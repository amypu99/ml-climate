## Weeks of 02/10 and 02/17 - Dataset Collection, Scoping, & Understanding

Over the past two weeks, our group has been refining our project idea and conducting extensive research to identify the best datasets and methodologies for our machine learning project on corporate climate commitments. Initially, we explored multiple potential directions, including analyzing countries' climate policies to predict emissions, examining climate-related discussions on social media, and assessing the feasibility of corporate carbon neutrality pledges.

After reviewing various academic papers and datasets, we decided to focus on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze corporate climate pledges and predict whether companies are likely to achieve their stated carbon neutrality goals. This decision was based on the availability of relevant datasets and our interest in studying how corporations' climate policies translate into real-world emission reductions.

A significant portion of our research involved identifying sources of corporate climate data. We explored resources such as the CDP dataset, SEC filings, company sustainability reports, and ESG risk ratings. One of the challenges we encountered was the inconsistency in corporate emissions reporting, as different companies use different definitions for reporting periods and emissions categories (Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions). To address this, we discussed the possibility of using ESG scores as a more standardized measure but recognized potential limitations in their correlation with actual emissions.

We also considered using ClimateBERT for feature extraction and text embeddings, as well as scraping corporate announcements and reports for policy-related information. Additionally, we explored different ways to establish ground truth labels for our model, debating whether to rely on reported emissions data, third-party ESG scores, or a combination of both.

Another key discussion point was determining our sample size. While focusing solely on Fortune 500 companies could limit our dataset size, we considered expanding our dataset by incorporating other publicly available corporate climate pledges. We also investigated government databases and financial reports to cross-check emissions data.

Moving forward, our next steps include finalizing our dataset selection, beginning the process of data collection and preprocessing, and drafting an initial project proposal. We plan to email our professor with our refined project idea and seek feedback on our approach, particularly regarding our methodology for assessing corporate climate commitments.

Overall, these past two weeks have been productive, with substantial progress in defining our project scope and identifying key challenges and solutions. We are excited to continue developing our model and refining our approach as we move forward in the project.

## Weeks of 2/24 and 3/2 - Dataset collection

Following the feedback received from the Prof. Alp and TAs, we are using this time to do the manual webscraping for sustainability reports and carbon net-zero pledges. We currently have a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NFO-U_q-CcS0DVRNQp9fWf4QF2BBKuGdOIawZDAE6cA/edit?gid=0#gid=0) of about 150+ Fortune 500 companies for which we've found sustainability reports/net-zero pledges for. A large percentage of these companies are tech companies, but many of them are just on the Fortune 500 list and are also non-tech.

Some things we've noticed so far with the scraping: not all companies have a pledge, and all companies' sustainability policeis look different. Some companies have their sustainability policies under a "sustainability" page, while others have it under a "corporate responsability" page. Some have made public announcements on blogs or done publicitiy advertising for their net-zero carbon pledges, whereas other companies' statements are just a  mere paragraph long. Some companies' most recent updates on their progress is from 2024, some are from 2023, and some are from 2022. Some companies' fiscal years starts in June, whereas others start in July. Some companies, such as Wells Fargo, previously had specific net-zero carbon emissions pledges, but then dropped them. This would actually be very interesting to add as an input to the model somehow.

What this means is that while we don't seem to have issues gathering data - in fact, most companies have some sort of statement on moving towards a more "sustainable future," whatever that means for them, it's still not entirely clear how much this data will be useful in training a model (given the large diversity in their policies, statements, blog posts). In the next week, we think a good idea would be to naively train an off-the-shelf LLM to predict ESG scores just to see whether any kind of relationship exists between these text policies and the ESG scores. We'll have a better idea then of how feasible the project is given the kind of data we have. In the meantime, we have also been looking elsewhere for data and applied for some access to some data held by private companies regarding carbon emissions for different tech companies.
