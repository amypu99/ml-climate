TOWARD A CLEAN, AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE ENERGY FUTURE
Executive Summary
Duke Energy is pleased to present our 2022 climate report� In the
two years since our last report, we have focused on: (1) building a
more reliable and resilient grid that can help mitigate the impacts
of more severe weather, provide customers with more solutions
tailored to their unique needs and accommodate significantly
greater amounts of renewable energy, distributed energy resources,
and demand response; and (2) investing in a cleaner energy supply�
These strategic priorities are founded on the fundamental customer
and community needs for affordable prices, reliability, and a
lower carbon dioxide (CO or “carbon”) footprint� The transition
2
to clean energy and grid modernization will provide reliability and
affordability through (1) taking advantage of decreasing prices
and incentives for cleaner sources of energy, (2) replacing aging
generating capacity that has increasing operation and maintenance
costs, (3) mitigating the impacts of volatile fuel prices and less
reliable fuel supplies, and (4) providing greater resilience to
weather events�
To this end, 85% of our capital plan over the next 10 years will
be invested in our clean energy transition and grid modernization,
with a keen focus on affordability and reliability� These capital
investments will not only reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
but will also provide substantial economic benefits in the regions
we serve while also providing for the cleaner, stronger, more
affordable and more resilient energy system our customers expect�
The $145 billion in capital we plan to invest to support our clean
energy transition and grid modernization over the next 10 years
will contribute, on average, over 20,000 additional direct, indirect
across the U�S� economy, including $1�5 billion in enterprisewide generation by 2030 and planning
additional annual labor income, and $5 billion in to fully exit coal by 2035 as part of the largest
associated property taxes over the next 10 years planned coal fleet retirement in the industry.2

3 The Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022. It extends certain and adds new tax incentives for clean energy.
For our natural gas business, we adopted a goal in 2020 to achieve
net-zero methane emissions for our operations by 2030 and have
taken significant steps toward that goal, replacing all remaining cast
iron and bare steel pipe, and adopting advanced leak detection
programs and other technologies to reduce methane emissions�
This year, we expanded our net-zero by 2050 goal to include Scope
2 and certain Scope 3 GHG emissions�4
Those are:
 In the electric business, our net-zero goal by 2050 includes
Scope 2 emissions from the electricity purchased for our own
use, as well as Scope 3 emissions from the power we purchase
for resale and from the procurement of fossil fuels for generation�
 For the natural gas business, our net-zero by 2050 goal now
includes Scope 3 upstream methane and CO emissions related
2
to purchased natural gas, as well as downstream CO emissions
2
from customers’ consumption of gas sold�
As we developed these new goals, we have also analyzed our
overall greenhouse gas emissions in more detail� Given this
analysis, we have established an interim target for our Scope 2 and
certain Scope 3 emissions of a 50% reduction from 2021 levels
by 2035�
We can now report that our goals cover 95% of our calculated
2021 greenhouse gas emissions� Additional details on these
emissions can be found in the section below entitled “Metrics
and Targets�”

Our compensation program includes several new performance
components that are aligned to our clean energy strategy�
2021 and future years:
Starting in 2021, the annual individual performance goals for
each of our senior leaders includes strategic objectives based
on a qualitative assessment of each leader’s contributions to
advancing our climate strategy, including:
– Demonstrating leadership to advance our climate strategy
to cost-effectively reduce our carbon footprint from
electricity generation by at least 50% by 2030 and to net-
zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050�
– Advocating for public policy related to our climate strategy�
– Investing in clean energy, including renewables, as well as
grid capacity and capabilities to support higher levels of
carbon-free generation�
2022 and future years:
Additionally, a new quantitative climate goal based on growth
in non-emitting generation and storage capacity measured
over a one-year period in comparison to preestablished
objective performance criteria has been added to the 2022
short-term incentive scorecard�6
We align incentive The following long-standing metrics continue to be included in our
compensation with clean compensation program:
energy-related metrics
including growth in  Safety – Safety remains our top priority� We include safety
non-emitting generation metrics in both our short-term and long-term incentive plans
and storage capacity, based on the total incident case rate of injuries and illnesses
and reliability and among our workers to emphasize our focus on an event- and
availability of nuclear and injury-free workplace�
renewables generation.
 Non-emitting generation – We include a nuclear reliability
objective and a renewables availability metric in our short-term
incentive plan to measure the efficiency of our nuclear and
renewable generation assets�
 Environmental events – To enhance our commitment to the
environment, we incorporate a reportable environmental events
metric into our short-term incentive plan�
6 This new 2022 goal is in addition to the 2021 goal that emphasizes the
reduction of our carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner�
 Customers – To prioritize the customer experience and their
expectation to be served reliably, affordably and increasingly, by
cleaner energy, we incorporate a customer satisfaction metric in
the short-term incentive plan, which is a composite of customer
satisfaction survey results for each area of business�
 Underpinning our entire compensation program, we continue
to incorporate sound governance principles and policies that
reinforce our pay for performance philosophy and strengthen the
alignment of interests of our executives and shareholders�
Duke Energy reviews its compensation program performance
metrics with the Compensation and People Development
Committee of the board on an ongoing basis�
Political Contributions and Lobbying
As we transition our business to cleaner sources of energy, we
remain focused on delivering sustainable value for our customers
and shareholders by maintaining industry-leading reliability
and affordability, exceeding customer expectations, optimizing
investments to drive attractive shareholder returns, and providing
new product offerings and solutions that deliver growth�
Transformation of this scale and scope requires partnering with
stakeholders to champion durable public policies at the local, state
and federal levels that enable us to transition our generating fleet,
expand and adapt our electric grid and natural gas infrastructure,
and adopt new carbon-free technologies that will reduce emissions
while keeping energy affordable, reliable, and accessible� It is
therefore essential for us to engage in public policy discussions
– both on our own behalf and through trade associations –
to advocate for the interests of our customers, employees,
communities and shareholders�
We regularly review our policies and procedures related to political
activities to help ensure we are following best practices and, as
a result, we have made several enhancements to our political
expenditures policies and disclosures in recent years� In 2020,
we expanded the practices covered by the policies to include
additional oversight of political consultants who conduct external
lobbying on behalf of the company� We also expanded disclosures
around the company’s Political Expenditures Committee (PEC) to
include the titles of the members and therefore the depth of their
experience� The PEC is responsible for the management, oversight
and approval of political activities. We also added certification,
attestation and periodic training requirements for individuals who
take part in political activities, including those individuals who hire
external consultants or interact with political candidates, campaign
committees or advocacy organizations�
In November 2021, we revised our Political Expenditures Policy to
enhance the transparency of our disclosures� These changes added
disclosure of the following expenses starting with the January 2022
to June 2022 Corporate Political Expenditures report:
 The federal lobbying portion of dues paid to 501(c)(6)
organizations, such as trade associations and chambers of
commerce, for 501(c)(6) organizations with dues in excess of
$50,000 for the calendar year�7
 Non-dues contributions to 501(c)(6) organizations, such as trade

(4) organization as used for political purposes�8 This disclosure
includes the 501(c)(6) and 501(c)(4) organizations’ names and
contribution amounts�
Trade associations
It is essential, as a highly regulated business, for us to engage in
public policy discussions – both on our own behalf and through
trade associations – to advocate for the interests of our customers,
employees, communities and shareholders� In 2021, we began
issuing an annual report, which discloses the major trade
associations to which we belong and those associations’ positions
on climate policy� The 2022 report, which was expanded
to also reference our trade associations’ alignment with the
Paris Climate Agreement, can be found here:

Duke Energy has a robust process to identify and
manage risks, including climate-related risks.
Our CRO meets with business unit leadership to discuss risks,
including climate-related risks, on a quarterly or semiannual
basis� Combined, the ERA and business unit risk reviews look at
short- and medium-term risks through the risk register process
and, for medium-term climate-related transition risks, through
the jurisdictional resource plans, which look out 10 to 20 years,
depending on the jurisdiction�9 Longer-term risks are identified and
managed through the Enterprise Strategy and Planning group’s
tracking of longer-term trends�
Business unit leaders are responsible for managing climate-related
risks and opportunities that fall within their managerial purview�
For example, the senior vice president of external affairs and

Introduction
Duke Energy is leading one of the most ambitious clean energy
transformations in our industry, with the largest planned coal
retirement program in the U.S. electric utility industry. Eighty-five
percent of our 10-year capital plan includes investments in our
generating fleet’s transition to low- and zero-carbon resources
and to a modernized grid� This transition not only provides a
cleaner energy mix, but provides the following tangible benefits to
customers, communities, and Duke Energy:
 a more reliable, resilient and smarter grid capable of
accommodating more distributed energy resources and
enhancing the overall customer experience;
 reduced exposure to financial and operational risks associated
with reliance on coal generation and coal supplies;
 mitigation against fuel price volatility;
 enhanced economic development competitiveness of the
regions we serve, enabling our states to recruit, retain, and grow
manufacturers and other businesses;
 opportunities for substantial capital investment, including through
growth of our states’ renewable energy industries, resulting in
employment growth and economic stimulation (including in rural
communities); and
 continued access to financing to fund operations and growth at
reasonable rates�10
This report provides more details on our paths toward our clean
energy goals, including an updated analysis for our electric utility
business’s projected path to net-zero carbon emissions� This
reflects the most recent resource plans for our Midwest and Florida
utilities, the proposed portfolios pursuant to Carolinas Carbon Plan
filed in North Carolina, and our targeted exit from coal generation
by 2035. We are confident we will well exceed our 50% carbon
reduction goal from 2005 levels for electricity generation by
2030 and will revisit this interim target in the future once state-
level reviews of our plans have advanced� We are, based on the

Risks
Physical risks
Extreme weather events – including hurricanes, heavy rainfall,
more frequent flooding, ice storms, higher temperatures, and
droughts – can impact our assets, electric grid and reliability�
Due to the location of some of our service territories, we must be
especially vigilant about adapting and responding to these risks�

In addition, in our natural gas business, as can be seen in the
scenario analysis section, our path to net-zero for Scope 3
customer emissions includes significant use of renewable natural
gas (RNG)� There is a risk to implementation of this strategy
if the needed quantities of RNG do not materialize at
reasonable costs or if any additional costs are not approved
by Duke Energy’s regulators�
To address permitting and execution risks, we are advocating for
permitting reform at the federal level� Federal, state and local
legislation or regulations need to be revised to expedite and
facilitate permitting and implementation of projects that will enable
our clean energy transition while continuing to ensure communities
will be meaningfully involved in decisions affecting them and the
environment will be protected�
Policy risks
As a regulated electric and gas utility, Duke Energy’s expenditures
supporting its clean energy transition must be approved by state
regulators to enable recovery of those costs� Capital expenditures
are reviewed by state public utility commissions for inclusion in
the company’s jurisdictional rate bases upon which regulated rates
of return are earned� In addition, some expenditures, such as fuel
costs, are subject to recovery clauses and are also subjected to
annual prudency reviews by state regulators, although the company
does not earn a return on these expenditures�
Under state laws, the company must present a range of resource
options when it is proposing a new generation mix, including the
most cost-effective options that maintain customer affordability and
reliability, given current state and federal policies� The company
Duke Energy’s must also present the lowest-cost option for cost recovery when
expenditures for delivering natural gas to its customers� We must demonstrate that

major laws in the past year – the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act (IIJA) and the IRA – that provide major incentives for the
development and deployment of clean energy technologies and grid
improvements� In addition, EPA has, over the past decade, twice
adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act to require power plants
to reduce carbon emissions� These regulations were rescinded by
the EPA or stayed or invalidated by judicial review�14
And in the states, recent policies have been adopted that help
our clean energy transition; for example, North Carolina adopted
14 T hese regulations were rescinded, stayed or invalidated before their
implementation; therefore, this has not affected our continuing carbon
emissions reductions from electricity generation�
HB 951 in 2021, and other policies were adopted in Tennessee
and North Carolina to help reduce emissions from our natural
gas business unit and its customers� Because these policies are
now in effect and will help enable our clean energy transition and
emissions reductions, they will be discussed further below
under “opportunities�”
To date, an important factor in driving our success in achieving
emissions reductions has been breakthroughs in technology
development� We also need policies to further support and enable
the commercialization of advanced clean energy technologies like
new nuclear, hydrogen, CCUS, and long-duration energy storage�
Other policies are also needed to facilitate the siting, permitting,
and cost recovery of needed electric transmission and distribution
infrastructure, as well as infrastructure that can carry natural
gas, RNG, CO , or hydrogen� Policies are also needed to facilitate
2
the procurement of low- and zero-carbon fuels such as RNG
and hydrogen�
From a regulatory standpoint, the EPA has stated that it will
propose a new rule under the Clean Air Act for power plant carbon
emissions in 2023� Duke Energy continues to monitor this and will
assess the impacts of any proposed rule on the company’s clean
energy transition and whether it helps enable that transition in an
affordable and reliable manner�
While the IIJA and the IRA, as mentioned above, will help drive
adoption of new clean energy technologies, to ensure we are able
to achieve our full clean energy transformation, we continue to
advocate for policies at the federal and state levels that will further
enable that transition while maintaining affordable and reliable
energy for our customers� The major principles against which we
compare proposed policies are discussed below�
Our view on effective carbon policy
Duke Energy has long advocated for climate change policies that
will result in significant but orderly reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions over time� We support market-based approaches that
balance environmental protection with affordability, reliability and
economic vitality� We seek to ensure that the policies adopted to
achieve emission reduction goals are cost-effective, and equitable;
promote a broad range of technology development; and include
provisions to efficiently address greenhouse gas emissions across
all sectors of the economy�
Duke Energy issued a statement in January 2021 supporting the
U�S� rejoining the Paris Agreement� We believe that the policy
approaches we support are aligned with the Paris Agreement’s
guiding principles and goals�
Our analyses have identified several key policy attributes that we
believe will allow us to achieve our emission reduction goals while
maintaining affordable and reliable energy for our customers� These
attributes will also help to incentivize the adoption of new, low- and
zero-emitting technologies� We believe climate policy should:
 Incentivize a zero-carbon trajectory in a cost-effective manner
that preserves the affordability and reliability of energy�
 Recognize that continuing to operate existing nuclear generation
and adding new small modular reactors (SMR) and likely other
advanced nuclear technologies is essential to maintaining our
emission reduction progress and achieving net-zero goals�
 Recognize that natural gas generation remains essential
to transition to an affordable and reliable clean energy
future, at least until advanced zero-carbon dispatchable
generation sources15 and long-duration storage become
commercially available�
 Recognize the need for and promote the siting and permitting
of infrastructure needed to transition to net-zero, including
pipelines for low- and zero-carbon fuels, as well as electric
transmission infrastructure�
 Promote robust and sustained support for research, development,
demonstration, and deployment of advanced technologies such
as advanced nuclear, hydrogen, RNG, long-duration storage, and
carbon capture, utilization and storage�
We need regulators and legislators to embrace policies to further
incentivize our clean energy transition and allow for the recovery
of costs to ensure the deployment of capital needed to operate our
system cleanly, affordably and reliably well into the future� We will
continue to advocate at the federal and state level for policies that
will meet the above criteria and ultimately benefit our customers.
Economic risks
Our clean energy transition will require additional capital
investments and operating and maintenance costs� As with other
costs incurred on behalf of our customers and in response to
energy and environmental policies, our regulated electric and
gas utilities would plan to seek cost recovery for clean energy
investments through public and transparent state regulatory
review processes�
To mitigate the risk of stranded assets, we will continue to engage
with policymakers and stakeholders prior to retiring existing assets

Renewables
Customer demand for electricity from cleaner sources continues to
increase� Given this, we are increasing the amount of renewables
on our system, which helps us reduce carbon emissions in line
with our clean energy goals, diversify our fuel sources and provide
investment opportunities� By 2035, we expect to have 30,000
MW of regulated renewables on our system, including both utility-
owned and those procured under purchased power agreements�17
One of the nation’s and Duke Energy’s fastest-growing areas for
solar power is Florida and in August of this year, we reached a
significant milestone, delivering on our commitment to provide
700 MW of solar energy at 10 facilities to Florida customers�
By 2024, with a combined investment of over $2 billion,
Duke Energy Florida’s solar generation portfolio will include 25
grid-tied solar power plants, which will provide about 1,500 MW
of emission-free generation with approximately 5 million solar
panels installed� These solar facilities provide a cleaner, brighter
energy future for our Florida customers, diversify our fuel sources
and, in addition, foster economic development and job creation in
the areas we serve�
In the Carolinas, more than 4,500 MW of solar capacity is
connected to our grid – including company-owned and independent
projects� We continue to grow our solar portfolio as we continue

Energy storage
There are many types of energy storage – from traditional
hydroelectric pumped storage to new technologies involving
battery, thermal, and mechanical energy storage� Our scenario
analysis shows that we are projecting nearly 30 GW of energy
storage on our system by 2050�
Our approach is to enhance our long-serving hydroelectric assets,
actively deploy battery storage technologies available today and
support the development of advanced energy storage options� We
plan to invest more than $600 million in battery energy storage by
2025, which will help to support our renewables portfolio�
The company has 77 MW of battery energy storage in service and
another 14 MW under construction� By the end of 2022, we will
have at least 50 MW of battery energy storage in Florida, including
a battery on Cape San Blas on the Gulf of Mexico� In North
Carolina, the Hot Springs Microgrid was placed in service in 2021�
This project combines a 2-MW solar array with 4�4 MW of battery
storage� This will be the company’s largest microgrid – providing
reliable power to a small town�
We are testing long-duration energy storage technologies at our
Duke Energy Emerging Technology and Innovation Center in Mount
Holly, North Carolina� Multiple new battery chemistries will be
tested in the 2022-2023 time frame that will inform our future
deployments at scale�
Energy efficiency
Energy efficiency is an important opportunity and tool for our
business – it helps customers by reducing energy costs and the
company by reducing electric and natural gas load and therefore
reducing carbon emissions�
Energy efficiency is an important part of our resource plans.
For example, each of the scenarios presented in the proposed
Carolinas Carbon Plan assumes reducing 1% of eligible retail load
through energy efficiency each year. This aggressive long-term
forecast of energy efficiency savings is more than double the level
assumed in the Carolinas 2020 IRPs�
In 2021, enterprisewide, we exceeded energy efficiency goals by
achieving a cumulative reduction in customer energy consumption

filed for approval of a similar program in South Carolina and intend
to expand it to other jurisdictions, subject to regulatory approval� In
addition, we aim to make sure future charging is equitable to rural
and low- to middle-income areas�
We are now working on an expanded suite of EV programs, making
it more affordable and convenient for customers to access EV
charging infrastructure across the areas we serve� For example, in
Indiana, we are implementing fast charging infrastructure as part
of a Volkswagen grant, and EV incentives were recently approved
for residential and commercial customers and for fleet and school

Stakeholder engagement
Duke Energy is driving the clean energy transition in partnership
with external stakeholders to reach the best solutions for its
customers and communities� We are working collaboratively to
make the changes we can today while developing new solutions
to deliver an even cleaner energy future� We are listening, learning
and adjusting along our journey and are committed to a future
that offers reliable, accessible and affordable clean energy for all
customers and to making a positive impact on our communities�
Doing so requires that we get their perspectives early and often and
work together to develop and deliver smart energy solutions� We
engage and interact, hold open houses and listen before we act�
Effective stakeholder engagement requires the development of
genuine, positive working relationships, which in turn relies on
a foundation of trust� We are growing our team of engagement
experts at Duke Energy to focus on engaging customers, local
governments and communities and connecting those localized
projects and initiatives to state and federal policies and regulations�
Duke Energy is committed to including engagement expertise
in our project management practices and maturing our use
of environmental justice screening tools and community
assessments. This helps us develop specific strategies and tactics
for engagement such as listening sessions, community forums
and partnerships with groups who have their own established
communications channels we can leverage� The early inclusion
of stakeholder engagement helps us identify risks and explore
opportunities associated with our energy transition�
For example, in the Carolinas we are targeting 70% carbon
reduction in the 2030 time frame – a goal outlined by North
Carolina HB 951� After gathering feedback from stakeholders in
both North Carolina and South Carolina, we incorporated this
public input into our proposed Carolinas Carbon Plan – a road
map for modernizing our two-state energy system in a manner
that reduces risks for customers while also lowering emissions and
balancing affordability and reliability�
We believe our long-term success is deeply intertwined with the
health and well-being of the communities we serve, and we strive
to be transparent in our stakeholder engagement outreach�
New Technologies
The development and commercialization of new technologies
will be critical to our achievement of our net-zero goals and for
economywide decarbonization� We have undertaken numerous
partnerships, with technology developers, researchers, and industry
groups to advance technology maturity and create supportive
policy frameworks� In addition to these initiatives, we are exploring
additional technology advancement projects and partnerships
under the IIJA, which provides the Department of Energy with
more than $60 billion to invest in clean energy technologies and
grid modernization across the United States� We are evaluating
potential IIJA projects related to hydrogen, long-duration energy

power the grid.
Duke Energy’s long-term success is deeply intertwined with the
health and well-being of the communities we serve� As part of
our clean energy transition, we want to ensure a just transition in
which we will be thoughtful and intentional in how we achieve our
clean energy transition and we will consider the diverse needs,
preferences and expectations of our stakeholders�
In 2022, we launched a cross-functional working team to build a
framework and just transition strategy that’s based on stakeholder
input and our learnings from previous coal facility retirements�
In those cases, we gained valuable experience about how to
meaningfully address impacts to workers and communities�
For example, in North Carolina, we developed a multiskilling
program for 500 coal plant workers, which provides employees
with the skills needed to generate reliable power for our
customers during the transition� We also conducted expert-guided
benchmarking exercises to determine best practices, and we’re
leaning in and engaging in dialogue to understand the needs of
a diverse set of stakeholders, including local governments and
nonprofits, as we develop our long-term strategy.
Based on this experience, our benchmarking exercises, and ongoing
stakeholder dialogues, we have developed the below principles to
guide us as we continue our transition to a clean energy future�
As we navigate the largest planned coal retirement in the industry,
we are being intentional in how we approach a fair, equitable and
just transition for stakeholder groups that include our employees,
customers and communities� We commit to:
 Support the workforce: Fundamental to our transformation
is our commitment to enable sustainable career opportunities
and build a talented, diverse workforce across the communities
we serve� We will support the workforce needed to safely run
and maintain the plants through retirement� Additional support
for employees affected by our clean energy transformation
will include providing assistance to pursue new career paths,
including reskilling and internal placement opportunities and,
if needed, external career transition support�
 Engage with our communities: We will communicate with
key stakeholders in and around the community to identify
opportunities and needs that arise as a direct result of the
transition� We will seek advice from and partner closely with

to 20 years, provide a relatively more certain view� Projecting
beyond that time frame requires more speculative assumptions for
how technology, electricity demand, and costs may evolve several
decades in the future�
In addition to assumptions in currently proposed IRPs and the
proposed Carolinas Carbon Plan, this net-zero scenario analysis is
based on the following assumptions:
 Legislative or regulatory federal climate policy is enacted that
facilitates the transition to net-zero emissions by 2050 – or, in
the absence of federal policy, climate policies are enacted in each
of the states in which Duke Energy operates generating capacity�
As noted above, the analysis was conducted before enactment of
the IRA and so does not include its clean energy incentives�
 Regulatory approvals of the generation changes modeled in the
scenario are obtained over the planning horizon through 2050�
 Buildout of natural gas pipelines and generating capacity is
allowed where necessary to enable coal retirements� (We assume
that these will be transitioned to hydrogen or RNG operation
prior to 2050�)
 Scalable supply chains are developed for renewables, storage,
and ZELFR technologies�
 Cost-effective new ZELFRs such as advanced nuclear, zero-
carbon hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilization and storage are
developed and commercially available in time to be used when

installations, pipelines, and transmission�
 In addition, this net-zero scenario analysis makes the following
specific modeling assumptions:
System load For the net-zero scenario analysis, Duke Energy used a “high EV”
scenario coupled with the same economic growth and energy efficiency
forecasts used in its proposed 2022 Carolinas Carbon Plan and its recent
integrated resource plans in Indiana and Kentucky and its 10-year site
plan in Florida� In the early years, the load growth under this scenario
matches the growth we project in our recent IRPs and Carbon Plan� It
then ramps up over time and averages over the period 2022-2050 a
compound annual growth rate for energy (in megawatt-hours (MWh))
of 1�49%� This assumes normal weather as experienced over the past
30 years�
The high EV scenario assumes achievement of the Biden administration’s
goal that 40% to 50% of new vehicle sales will be electric by 2030� To
enable this, we assume that the numerous announcements of new EV
models to be released in the next few years will come to fruition� Further,
greatly increased charging infrastructure must be assumed to be available
to alleviate range anxiety for EVs�
Existing nuclear All existing nuclear plants receive subsequent license renewals and are
authorized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate for an
additional 20 years (for a total operating life of 80 years)� In addition,
the IRA provides a production tax credit for existing nuclear from 2024
through 2032� Existing nuclear generation is assumed to be capable of
reducing output by up to 20% post-2040 to aid in balancing generation
and load�
Coal retirements Coal retirements in North Carolina are based on the proposed 2022
Carolinas Carbon Plan filed on May 16, 2022. Coal retirements in Indiana
and Kentucky are based on 2021 IRPs, and the Crystal River units in
Florida are assumed to retire in 2034, per the 2022 10-year site plan�
All future coal retirements are subject to regulatory approval and, in
certain cases, the availability of replacement generation�
Natural gas assets New units are assumed to have a 35-year book life, progressively
(power generation) transitioning to hydrogen use by 2050 or alternatively, RNG�
Hydrogen blending in natural gas turbines is assumed to begin in 2035
at approximately 3% by volume and to ramp up to approximately 15% by
volume by the early 2040s�
All natural gas units built after 2030 are assumed to be convertible to full
hydrogen capability� After 2040, only peaking units that are fully hydrogen
capable are assumed to be built�
time beginning in 2035 due to the uncertainties regarding how the
markets will evolve in the future�
This is a conservative approach to ensure that customer load is served�
Actual plans would consider market purchases as required by state law
and regulations�
Fuel supplies Until new dispatchable carbon-free fuel technologies become
and prices economically viable for utility-scale use, traditional fossil fuels will be
required to satisfy regulatory mandates for least-cost planning and reliable
operations. This means obtaining sufficient coal supplies to provide
reliability through the planned (subject to regulatory approval) end of
coal consumption in 2035 and obtaining additional firm transportation
for interstate natural gas required to support renewable integration,
maintain cost-effective and reliable energy, and achieve declining system
carbon emissions�
This analysis used Duke Energy’s fall 2021 fuel forecast, which was
completed before inflation and fuel supply challenges became a major
factor in the spring and summer of 2022� Our ongoing work will continue
to reflect updates in commodity prices and we believe, coupled with
incentives from the IRA, that this will tend to advantage clean generation
sources, balanced by the need for reliable capacity�
For natural gas commodity prices, fall 2021 market prices (which, as
noted above, occurred prior to 2022 fuel price inflation) are used for the
first five years of the forecast and assumed to transition to fundamentals-
based prices over years five through eight. IHS Markit forecasts are used
beginning in year nine� The modeling also assumed a limited supply of
new Appalachian gas. As described in our Carolinas Carbon Plan filings,
however, more detailed modeling would show that a limited portion of
energy storage could be more cost-effectively replaced with hydrogen-
capable combustion turbines (CTs)�
Zero-emitting load- ZELFRs are assumed to be commercially available for deployment in the
following resources mid-2030s� ZELFR is a placeholder in the modeling for new commercially
(ZELFRs) available dispatchable utility-scale technologies to complement high
penetrations of renewables� For purposes of cost analysis, costs for
ZELFRs were based on SMRs� ZELFRs could also be combined-cycle
power plants with CCUS, or use hydrogen or biofuels (like RNG)� In
reality, a combination of several technologies, including both SMRs
and advanced reactors are needed to replace existing baseload and
intermediate generation and back up weather-dependent renewable
generation� The capital costs of these various types of ZELFRs are
uncertain; therefore, it makes capital expenditure projections uncertain
once ZELFRs are assumed to be installed�
which did not capture supply chain issues and inflationary effects
observed over the past several months� Some of the prices below are
projected to decrease over time (especially renewables and storage), while
others are expected to increase�
 CTs – $600/kW (represents multiunit site)
 Combined cycle (CCs) – $650/kW (represents 2x1 advanced class with
duct firing)
 Hydrogen combustion turbines – $720/kW (represents multiunit site)
 Retrofit of existing gas units to 100% hydrogen capable – $110/kW for
CCs to $150/kW for CTs
 Small modular nuclear reactors and advanced reactors – $5,000/kW
 Solar – $1,500/kW
 Solar with integrated four-hour storage – $2,000/kW
 Wind – $1,400/kW (onshore) to $3,800/kW (offshore)
NOTES:
Interconnection costs for these technologies were not explicitly considered
in the scenario analysis� This assumption yields an optimistic view of the
costs of adding large quantities of renewables to the grid� Typical costs of
transmission access for various types of renewables are shown below as a
percentage of total project costs:
 Conventional generation – 10% (constrained area)
 Solar – 20% (bundled solar in constrained area)
 Wind (offshore and out of state) – 20% to 50% (location-dependent)
 Batteries – 20% (depends on location and primary use)
Transmission access cost is expected to increase with greater amounts of
renewables and will be dependent on location, type, amount, and existing
infrastructure� Due to uncertainty in these factors, projections of future
transmission access costs were not included�
New  New small modular reactors available beginning 2034�
nuclear availability
 Advanced reactors available beginning 2038�
generally aligned with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory annual
technology baseline moderate scenario�
Batteries are assumed to be available to store energy for four, six or eight
hours� It is also assumed that there are no limitations on the supply chain
for batteries and that they can be interconnected in a timely manner and
without cost constraints�
Seasonal battery storage technologies are not currently commercially
available, and their costs and development timeline are uncertain, so
they are not assumed in the model� We view ongoing research into
battery storage as vital to reducing costs and enabling longer-duration
storage, but because the timing of technological breakthroughs for battery
storage remains unclear (as do the costs of battery storage after the
breakthroughs), we did not speculate on the timing or cost impact of a
breakthrough in battery technology in this limited analysis�
Hydrogen (H ) Hydrogen blending is assumed at existing CC and CT units in 2035+�
2
See below discussion of assumptions for internally produced hydrogen�
 Hydrogen production technology and a robust hydrogen market is
assumed to be available by 2040�
 All new CTs 2040+ are assumed to be operated on 100% H �
2
 Remaining CT and CC units on the system in 2050, as well as all CTs
and CCs added to the portfolios, operate on H in 2050�
2
 Hydrogen cost assumptions are informed by the DOE price target for
clean hydrogen�
In the coming decades, hydrogen production and consumption for
electric power generation is expected to expand significantly and become
an important component of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050�
While Duke Energy is optimistic that the current DOE targets will drive
development of a hydrogen market, our modeling sought to assess the
potential for producing an adequate hydrogen supply for Duke Energy
needs based on surplus energy from our generating assets�
We evaluated the level of surplus clean energy (from solar, wind, and
nuclear) during periods of lower energy demand to see how that could
potentially be translated into hydrogen production� Our modeling showed
that this surplus clean energy could provide enough internally produced
hydrogen to adequately meet all of the assumed hydrogen blending needs,
which begin in 2035� As the need for hydrogen usage grows throughout
the 2040s with the addition of 100% hydrogen resources, our modeling
projects that our surplus clean energy could supply approximately half of
the total hydrogen needed for 2050 consumption�
carbon policy and Midwest modeling utilized a carbon price assumption, but with the
adjustment of a higher and later starting point. In these cases, a $26/
short ton carbon price, escalating at $7/year was used in dispatch starting
in 2028, which supports a steady trajectory to reach net-zero carbon
by 2050� For the Carolinas, the modeling results presented below are
consistent with the proposed Carolinas Carbon Plan� The carbon price
could also represent limitations on coal generation starting in 2028, either
through new policies or market constraints�
This modeling effort assumes a policy is imposed that requires zero
carbon emissions from electricity generation in 2050� This is consistent
with prior Clean Electricity Standard proposals in Congress� As discussed
previously, the modeling was performed before enactment of the IRA�
Electric Business Net-Zero Scenario Analysis Results
The following results reflect only one set of the possible
generation mixes that would result in net-zero emissions by
2050� The ultimate pace of the transition will be dependent
upon several factors such as regulatory approval, access to
replacement generation, supply chains, etc� and actual results
could be materially different from this scenario� These results do
not represent definitive utility resource plans. Each Duke Energy
utility’s resource plan will be developed in conjunction with
policymakers and other stakeholders and will require regulatory
approval under our legal mandate to provide affordable and
reliable energy�
Figure 1 shows the mix of the company’s regulated generating
capacity (in gigawatts (GW)) in 2021, along with the capacity
projected through 2050 every five years (starting in 2025).20 21
Overall, this shows that over 120 GW of new resources will need to
be built and interconnected over the next 27 years�

Key insights
Under this scenario analysis, we are confident in exceeding our
50% carbon reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 target and,
assuming new technologies are developed and are cost-effective,
achieving our new 80% reduction by 2040 target on the path to
zero carbon emissions in 2050� In addition:
 The analysis shows that while batteries are important for
smoothing and time-shifting renewables, dispatchable, clean
energy resources like hydrogen- and biogas-fired turbines are
needed to provide longer-duration backup for renewables,
particularly during cold winter weather when solar output is often
low, even at midday�
 It stands out in our modeling that advanced nuclear with
load-following capabilities works well to support renewables
integration into our transformed clean energy grid�
 As we consider sourcing hydrogen, we find that clean energy
from renewables and advanced nuclear in non-peak periods
would be sufficient to produce much of the green hydrogen
needed to back up renewables during severe weather events�
 To execute this strategy that doubles our installed generating
capacity by 2050, federal, state, and local permits are essential
for installation of new generation technologies, pipelines,
and transmission�
The economics and availability of future zero-emitting resources
could shift over time� However, we can mitigate that uncertainty

Comparison to Transition Pathway Initiative
Some stakeholders have expressed interest in how our projected
emissions trajectory aligns with goals of the Paris climate
agreement�24 The Paris Agreement states that its goals are
“holding the increase in the global average temperature to well
below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit
the temperature increase to 1�5°C above pre-industrial levels�”
Several groups have laid out a variety of pathways they project
are required to achieve global decarbonization consistent with the
goals of the Paris Agreement, among them the Transition Pathway

28 D uke Energy engaged ICF to conduct an analysis of the potential transition pathways for Duke Energy’s electric and gas
businesses under a scenario consistent with the International Energy Agency’s Net-Zero Emissions scenario, as well as to
perform its first analysis exploring natural gas utility pathways to achieve net-zero customer emissions. The analysis was based
on a variety of forward-looking assumptions and information obtained from public and private sources� Neither ICF nor

consultancies – are dedicated to working with business, government, and nonprofit organizations to plan for, design, and
implement programs that drive low-carbon transitions and build resilience against the effects of climate change�
Customer numbers Duke Energy customer growth trends continue, with residential and
commercial gas utility customers rising to 2�4 million by 2050,
a 47% increase over 2020 Duke Energy gas customer numbers�
Consistent with historic trends, this pathway assumes no significant
increase in electrification of building heating.
Efficiency & behavior A large portion of Duke Energy natural gas customers adopt high-
efficiency equipment and a variety of energy savings measures. This
adoption is supported by the company’s energy efficiency programs
and through reasonable building code updates and represents a
continuation of historical trends of a significant decline in average
per-customer consumption� As a result, even with the increase in
customer numbers, in this scenario total gas usage declines modestly,
as efficiency improvements offset the impact of growth.
Renewable natural gas Duke Energy will be able to procure adequate RNG to supply 80%
(RNG) of the company’s gas sales demand throughput by 2050� This
is generally aligned with the ”Optimistic” RNG supply scenario
discussed below and reflects a decarbonizing economy with state
policies that are supportive of utility investment in RNG production,
procurement and sales to utility customers�
Hydrogen We assume we will safely be able to blend up to 5% hydrogen
on an energy basis (equivalent to 15% on a volumetric basis) into
the company’s gas distribution system� The blending of hydrogen
will reduce the GHG emissions intensity of gas combustion by
our customers�
Offsets and negative Duke Energy will be able to purchase offsets or leverage negative
emissions technologies emissions fuel sources and technologies to reduce a portion of the
company’s emissions to reach net-zero�
Renewable natural gas supply
Renewable natural gas (RNG) is a pipeline-compatible gas derived from biogenic or other renewable
sources that have lower life cycle carbon dioxide emissions than geologic gas� Today, RNG is mainly
sourced from anerobic digestion processes for waste-based feedstocks (e.g., landfills, wastewater, food
waste, and animal manure), but it can also be produced from other feedstocks and processes, which
are expected to become more plentiful over time� To achieve net-zero for customer emissions, our gas
business will, over time, need to transition away from geologic gas and switch to RNG supply� To assess
potential RNG supplies, ICF developed a range of supply scenarios within the states in which our gas
utilities operate, which include “Total Inventory,” “Optimistic” and “Limited�” This analysis was based
on an assessment of projections of different RNG feedstocks from government and industry reports and
databases� Technical resource potentials were developed, including
availability and other resource constraining factors, to estimate the
supply of RNG available to the company for utility development or
purchased supply for our customers�
Figure 5’s Total Inventory column summarizes the maximum RNG
potential for each type of feedstock and production technology
for the states within the company’s natural gas service areas
(combined across Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina,
and Tennessee)� It does not apply any economic or technical
constraints on feedstock availability� By contrast, the Limited and
Optimistic RNG potential scenarios were developed assuming
different levels of feedstock utilization relative to the maximum
RNG inventory� The Limited scenario represents low levels of
feedstock utilization, resulting in RNG availability of 10% of the
Total Inventory maximum, whereas the Optimistic scenario uses
balanced assumptions regarding feedstock utilization, assuming
a greater value of biomass� This results in a projected potential
equal to 55% of the Total Inventory assessed for the company’s
service areas�

The IEA Net-Zero Energy (NZE) scenario
IEA’s NZE illustrates a potential global energy pathway limiting
global temperature rise to 1�5 degrees Celsius� This pathway is
dependent on international cooperation among all governments to
achieve a global energy sector revolution�
By design, the IEA NZE scenario relies on unprecedented changes
in energy production and consumer behavior, as well as expedited
technology innovations within the next decade and through 2050�
For example, the IEA NZE scenario assumes that globally the
following changes occur:
 The electric sector in all developed countries reaches net-zero
carbon emissions by 2035�
 The electric sector in all other countries reaches net-zero carbon
emissions by 2040�
 Within fewer than three years, no new fossil fuel boilers will
be sold�
 More than 85% of existing buildings are “zero-carbon ready”32 by
2050, requiring 2�5% of all existing buildings to undergo a deep
energy retrofit each year starting in 2030. This retrofit has been
estimated to cost the average single-family home in the U�S�
roughly $40,000 to $57,000�33

uses renewable energy directly or uses an energy supply that will be fully
decarbonized by 2050, such as electricity or district heat�”

Consistent with the IEA NZE, the electric analysis presented

electric portfolio by 2035� To achieve this, policies, technologies,
consumer behaviors, and supply chains that do not currently
exist are developed almost immediately� Under IEA’s scenario,
electric utilities in developed countries are also assumed to
continue to reduce emissions below zero thereafter, likely through
the adoption of CCUS technologies for biogas or biomass-fired

relevant climate-related risks and opportunities where such information is

related risks and opportunities and performance against targets�)
Goals
Scope 1 goals
For our electric generation business, our updated Scope 1 goals are
at least a 50% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by
2030, an 80% reduction by 2040, and to achieve net-zero carbon
emissions by 2050� We have also established a goal for coal to
represent 5% of our generation mix by 2030 and to exit coal
generation by 2035�34 For our natural gas distribution business, our
goal is to achieve net-zero methane emissions by 2030�
Through 2021, we have reduced Scope 1 carbon emissions from
electricity generation by 44% from 2005 levels, the equivalent of
removing 13 million vehicles from the road�
Examples of actions we have taken to reduce Scope 1 emissions in
our electricity business include:
 Retired 56 coal units, representing approximately 7,500 MW
since 2010�
 Filed the Carolinas Carbon Plan in line with the North Carolina
mandate to achieve a 70% reduction in carbon emissions by
2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050�
Duke Energy has
already reduced its  Filed resource plans in the Midwest and Florida with preferred
CO emissions from scenarios that support exiting coal generation by 2035�

keep this carbon-free energy source running for an additional 20
years� We plan to pursue similar license renewals for each of our
11 nuclear units�
 Installed or contracted for significant renewable generation, with
renewables projected to represent nearly 20% of generation
by 2030 and to total, in our regulated utilities, 30,000 MW
by 2035 (both utility-owned and under purchased power
agreements)�
34 A chieving these goals depends on necessary regulatory approvals (which will
require demonstration of no adverse effect on grid reliability and reasonable
and prudent costs), the ability to site and construct new generation and
transmission facilities, available supply chains for new generation and
transmission equipment and natural gas availability�
Our natural gas business continues to work to achieve its Scope 1
goal, with actions including:
 Replaced more than 1,400 miles of cast iron and bare steel
pipe, resulting in the elimination of more than 95% of the
methane emissions previously attributed to the cast iron and bare
steel infrastructure�
 Partnered with Accenture and Microsoft on a unique satellite leak
detection platform designed to measure actual baseline methane
emissions from natural gas distribution systems�
 Accelerated efforts to reduce leak inventory using a “find it, fix
it” approach. Under this program, we are fixing small leaks faster
and, as new leak detection technology is added, we will be able
to quickly address leaks as they are found� This has resulted in
an 85% reduction in leaks since the beginning of 2021�
 Piloting new technologies to improve measurement and
monitoring of methane emissions, including satellite technology
and real-time measurement devices to pinpoint and repair
leaks faster�
 Adopting cross compression technology to eliminate intentional
emissions from blow-downs or flaring during operational activities
when possible�
 Investing in RNG projects and continuing to work with our
jurisdictions to expand RNG availability for our customers�
 Sourcing RNG for our compressed natural gas stations in
Nashville and expanding the use of RNG to our other publicly

This year we expanded our 2050 net-zero goals to include Scope 2

detection system.
 In the electric business, our net-zero goal will include greenhouse
gas emissions from the power we purchase for resale, from the
procurement of fossil fuels used for generation, and from the
electricity purchased for our own use�
 For the natural gas business, it includes upstream methane
and carbon emissions related to purchased natural gas and
downstream carbon emissions from customers’ consumption
of sold gas�
We have also analyzed our overall greenhouse gas emissions in
more detail and disclose 2021 Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions below�
Our methodology and assumptions for calculating these emissions
were reviewed by a third party to provide additional confidence in
the numbers� Our net-zero goals for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 now cover
95% of our calculated 2021 greenhouse gas emissions�
We have also projected our Scope 2 and 3 emissions over time
through 2050 and have, based on this analysis, introduced
interim targets to achieve a 50% emissions reduction by 2035 for
the Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions included in our net-zero by
2050 goal�
Several factors give us confidence that we can meet this Scope 2
and 3 interim goal:
 As we transition out of coal and away from geologic gases as
sources of electricity generation, there will no longer be upstream
emissions related to coal mining and transportation and reduced
emissions related to gas procurement�
 We expect that emissions associated with purchases of electricity
for resale (Scope 3) and our own use (Scope 2) will similarly
decline as our industry peers reduce their emissions (for example,
the majority of electric generators have net-zero goals for the
2040 to 2050 time frame)�35 Energy efficiency opportunities
and, as noted above, the transition of our industry peers to net-
zero carbon emissions will support the net-zero trajectory for
Scope 2�
 And, as discussed above in the section on our natural gas
business, we will continue to work upstream with suppliers to
reduce emissions from geologic gas we procure, and will reduce
downstream emissions through customer efficiency, the use of
RNG and hydrogen, as well as offset program�
(TCFD: Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3
