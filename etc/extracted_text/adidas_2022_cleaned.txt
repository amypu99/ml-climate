HELLO BJØRN, WELCOME THREE STRIPES. OR SHOULD RATHER SAY: 'WELCOME BACK' THREE STRIPES? Well, you can say both. It's 'welcome' course it's 'welcome back' I appreciate both. It's like coming home brand I have always had strong feelings . My father was an player I played sports all time when I was kid. course, it was my first job. I followed even when I was working different parts industry, so being allowed come back great honor. REVIEW STATEMENTS HOW DID IT FEEL COMING OFFICE CEO AT BEGINNING YEAR? Walking into building gave me very positive feeling. course, I'm aware that things not great that expectation us that will improve. I can sense that hope. YOU'VE BEEN AN ATHLETE ALMOST YOUR ENTIRE LIFE NOW YOU'RE CEO . HOW HAS SPORT SHAPED YOUR LIFE YOUR LEADERSHIP STYLE? Well, sport my life. Because my father was professional athlete, I did all kinds sports when I was kid – from skiing track field handball football. I went play football handball professionally, but unfortunately, an injury ended my career early. My wife was national champion gymnastics, my sons played football at high level. I spend almost 100% my time things that related sports. I have bachelor's degree I have master's, but one thing that has taught me most about leadership playing team sports. You play people you like, people you don't like, or who better than you, worse than you, you must find spot where you can have biggest influence team. I've learned lot from sport I'm still learning lot. YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF 'SPORTS ROMANTIC.' WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? I think all sports important. There's tendency focus big ones like football, basketball running, but smaller sports just interesting. I always felt that Adi Dassler was also sports romantic, trying deliver best equipment all sports. I have same philosophy. Visibility across many sports brings lot worth because that will give us credibility. That's why I'm sports romantic. I love all sports. YOU MENTIONED TEAM SPORTS EARLIER. HOW DO YOU BUILD WINNING TEAM? Well, it's difficult say how I build winning team because word 'I' little bit misleading. I think build winning teams by showing respect each other, playing each other's individual strengths trying make colleagues better. That's best formula. When you look at Football World Cup, best team paper doesn't always win. Often, team that comes together acts like team wins. course, you need coach, you need captains. end, need remember that bad coach can make good team bad, but great coach alone can't make bad team good. All players need play their roles make their teammates better, not only themselves. Those teams that will win future. Then there's culture . 're operating so many different markets that dependent truly multicultural team. I also think workplace should be most fun place be. should laugh lot should not take ourselves too seriously. should be allowed be different, need show each other respect. It doesn't matter who you or what job you have, all . this comes team spirit that will need win. REVIEW STATEMENTS NOW LET'S SHIFT GEARS TALK ABOUT BUSINESS. WHAT'S YOUR VIEW CURRENT STATE AFFAIRS? You look at numbers it's obvious that 're not performing way should. I have said it many times, but have all ingredients win: have great brand, have credibility, have authenticity, have innovation, have collaborations, have very talented people, have global network. But covid-19 brought problems that maybe weren't addressed pragmatically they should have been. Now locked into strategy that isn't really tied how world has changed – pandemic everything that came after. Now should please multi-brand retail partners their consumers. They need see strong income, but also need strong direct--consumer sales ourselves. have deal all these channels an optimized way more discipline how go market. know was difficult year 2023 won't be much easier. entire industry has suffered from high inventory levels , result, there lot discounting going marketplace. But do have some winners, especially performance area. have very good football business great new concepts products, 've made huge progress running, which maybe most difficult area qualify . I love see that 've established ourselves outdoor industry, golf business doing well, have some exciting things coming up basketball. lifestyle side, have collaborations Gucci, Prada, Moncler, more. I think when people say 're not exciting, maybe sometimes too exciting don't celebrate individual wins because have so many. I'm sure that if get some time, can – will – turn this into very successful formula. Again, just need work little bit more basics. WHAT DOES NEED FOCUS GET BACK TRACK? need focus core business, which design, development, sourcing, marketing, selling, delivering product. should never forget that shoe, apparel, accessories brand that sells physical product. Everything around that should support this, so right now, that means focusing product, how go--market being most service-minded organization both retail partners consumer. should be most liked brand by both athletes by those who influential business. need create best product must always remember that consumers – although informed globally – still think act locally. WHAT'S YOUR VIEW IMPORTANCE MARKETS? During covid-19, markets drifted away from each other. China was open closed at same time, US was open, but Europe was closed – that meant that launch products flow industry switched from being very global very local. political tensions economic chaos last three years have also fed into this. REVIEW STATEMENTS needs China might be different those Germany or North America. This local focus giving consumer what they want has be top mind. You cannot tell consumer what they want. need listen what consumers want from us. Yes, they influenced by global athletes, global celebrities, global products, but also need accept that there local influences. need find that balance. can also optimize go--market processes. Speed has become more important, need be more agile. Things change quickly, need move this change stay relevant eyes consumer. DO YOU WANT FOCUS SPECIFIC MARKETS? They will be treated equally, yet individually. I think it's wrong set priorities say that one market more important than other, should be strong every market tailor approach each individual one. Saying that, home market, should be market leader Europe. also know that if you're not successful North America, you're not really global brand. China has been growth driver us. Because pandemic other challenges, however, 're not where used be, but I have feeling that things will improve there. Latin America fire, which makes me optimistic. then, there markets like Korea Japan which very directional very fashion oriented. Here have real opportunity grow. So, win every market, need work more closely accounts find out what works what doesn't. If you have good product retailer wants it, consumers will probably buy it. If retailer doesn't want it, then it's likely consumer doesn't want it either. have both physical stores e-com sites, so can always bring whatever want market test it. 're already sitting lot consumer insights which could definitely help us win markets. TALKING ABOUT INSIGHTS TRENDS, WHAT TRENDS INDUSTRY DO YOU SEE RIGHT NOW? There so many mega trends that good us , but one that I've liked most that, during covid-19, people have been coming back sports. They're becoming more health conscious embracing individual sports – especially outdoors – like walking, running, biking, skiing. There's also growth yoga, pilates variety other sports, that's very good us! workplace becoming more casual, people wearing sneakers branded sweatshirts work. It's clear that working from home has led people become more casual every aspect their lives. Last year also saw Samba Gazelle become that special look everyone wanted. This something that own it's very, very hot. It has happened organically over last six nine months it's trend that 're really exploiting. REVIEW STATEMENTS HAS ALWAYS HAD STRONG FOCUS SUSTAINABILITY. HOW IMPORTANT THIS TOPIC YOU? me, sustainability focus all companies must have. Doing things that good next generation – planet – value that should all have. This industry – especially – has done lot good stuff planet over last 30 years. Back then, didn't think about it at all look where now. has set very clear targets what want achieve, will do exactly that. Sustainability going be one things that every employee – especially those working product – needs know about. It's not something can delegate just one department, I believe that everybody needs have knowledge this. WHAT YOU MOST LOOKING FORWARD 2023? Well, I look forward big sporting events including FIFA World Cup 2023 Australia New Zealand. business side, I'm looking forward making progress turnaround showing people that can make positive shift. Although have problems short term, can get back where belong. DO YOU HAVE ANY FINAL MESSAGE SHAREHOLDERS? like no other. There's probably no other brand world that emotional . relevant sport, music, entertainment, fashion. appeal global stretches over multiple generations. when I look future, I see people doing more sport, dressing more casually being even more brand-driven. Given all this, I think 're great invest . REVIEW STATEMENTS EXECUTIVE EXECUTIVE COMPOSED SIX MEMBERS. EACH MEMBER RESPONSIBLE AT LEAST ONE MAJOR FUNCTION WITHIN .

REVIEW STATEMENTS Worker satisfaction grievance opportunities robust grievance mechanism fulcrum which workers can raise their concerns secure remedies. Since 2017, have reduced reliance local worker hotlines complaint mechanism by building an application-based 'Workers Voice' platform: bespoke, manufacturing-facility-based digital grievance channel workers. have progressively improved expanded use this grievance mechanism, , more than 440,000 workers employed 134 manufacturing facilities across 17 countries had access, reflecting 100% coverage strategic manufacturing partners. Access digital complaint mechanism has proven invaluable during covid-19. Close 48,000 human labor rights complaints (2021: around 52,000) were filed through Workers Voice platform , 99% these complaints being closed by end . top complaints received were related concerns over general facilities (more than 16,000), internal communication (more than 11,000), benefits (more than 6,000). Input received through Workers Voice platform tracked by , using KPIs dashboard reviews, case satisfaction ratings, -site worker interviews. This allows us evaluate efficacy grievance channels, see major cases real time, undertake timely interventions, where necessary. It also helps us understand main challenges labor rights issues manufacturing facility track how facility's management their HR teams resolve cases communicate their findings. evaluation contributes facility's overall social impact rating (S-KPI). provides ongoing capacity building enhance facility teams' capability improve effectiveness grievance mechanism. case satisfaction rate, which allows workers input their level satisfaction resolution complaints, has almost doubled from 39% 2019 77% . increase satisfaction partly related significant improvement response time that it took factory management address workers' grievances, which decreased from 49 hours 2020 less than 17 hours due improvements communication transparency workplace. management teams manufacturing facilities have continuously engaged facility's workers through newsletters broadcast messages, which has improved workers' engagement overall culture factories. Complementing various grievance channels, expanded 'Worker Pulse' project, digitalized short survey launched 2020 capture workers' perception awareness their labor rights focused areas such communication, harassment, abuse, well grievance systems. It builds what learned from previous survey process initiated 2016. , undertook these digital surveys 133 manufacturing facilities (2021: 123) across 17 countries (2021: 16), more than 85,000 workers participating (2021: 66,000) through mobile-phone-based application. At its core were six statements which level agreement or disagreement was assessed. Topics included willingness speak up, recommend factory work at friends, or level comfort when raising suggestion or complaint or when talking supervisors. Results show steady increase number favorable respondents across all questions since 2020, from roughly 78% 87% average. percentage figures indicate average response five-point Likert-type scale where 100% represents 'strong agreement' 0% 'strong disagreement.' This increase overall worker satisfaction also factor increase average S-KPI score manufacturing partners' facilities . This shows that when workers' voices being heard acted upon by facility's management, it can have an impact improving overall working conditions within manufacturing facility. Manufacturing partners required develop track workplace improvement plans based feedback from Worker Pulse.

An economic activity considered Taxonomy-eligible if it referenced by Taxonomy has potential help achieve at least one following six environmental objectives: ) Climate change mitigation 2) Climate change adaptation 3) Sustainable use protection water marine resources 4) Transition circular economy 5) Pollution prevention control 6) Protection restoration biodiversity ecosystems. an activity be considered reported environmentally sustainable, i.e., Taxonomy-aligned, following three prerequisites must be fulfilled: Substantial contribution: activity makes substantial contribution one environmental objectives by meeting technical screening criteria defined this economic activity. ─ Do-No-Significant-Harm ('DNSH'): activity fulfills further criteria, which intended prevent significant harm one or more other environmental objectives. ─ Minimum safeguards: performing activity must have implemented minimum safeguards relating human rights, including labor rights, corruption, taxation, fair competition. ─ Reporting scope fiscal year Delegated Regulation (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178) Article 8 Taxonomy specifies content, methodology, presentation information be disclosed by non- undertakings concerning proportion environmentally sustainable economic activities their business, investments, or lending activities. Throughout , Platform Sustainable Finance, which serves advisory body European Commission development Taxonomy, published detailed draft report technical screening criteria concerning environmental objectives 3–6. per this draft report, core business activities – manufacturing textiles footwear well wholesale retail sale thereof – referenced by environmental objective number 4, 'Transition circular economy.' addition, final recommendation concerning minimum safeguards criteria was issued by Platform Sustainable Finance October . However, by end fiscal year , Taxonomy has not been enacted its entirety. Thus, timing full-scope Taxonomy reporting obligation, content details, exact interpretation various components within Regulation remained unclear at time this report was prepared.27 Therefore, reporting requirements limited first two environmental objectives – 'climate change mitigation' 'climate change adaptation' – which do not reference main economic activities industry. However, contrast previous year, it necessary provide information degree which Taxonomy-eligible economic activities Taxonomy-aligned disclose corresponding turnover (net sales), capital expenditure ('CapEx'), operating expenses ('OpEx') KPIs, accordingly.

Due expected time resource investment necessary assessing all eligible activities, prioritized assessment those eligible activities that were most material terms volume value /or were more likely be Taxonomy-aligned due availability necessary information. Accordingly, concentrated efforts assessing eligible building leases connection warehouses, own retail stores, corporate offices. applicable substantial contribution DNSH criteria, which mentioned section 7.7 Annex I Delegated Regulation, predominantly relate primary energy consumption well climate-related risks mitigation solutions, respectively, connection leased buildings. substantial contribution criteria evidence most relevant this regard existence an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) class . Many eligible building leases outside Europe, which requires alignment this EU-centric energy performance certification standards frameworks typically use non-EU countries (e.g., LEED certification). line generally low share available non- residential buildings adhering these energy performance standards across markets, only few eligible leases fulfil this criterion, particularly eligible retail leases where has very limited ability influence design /or re-development malls, where many stores located. Also, certain eligible retail lease locations heritage sites which it not possible obtain EPC class certification.
