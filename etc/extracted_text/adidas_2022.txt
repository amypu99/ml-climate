OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
INTERVIEW WITH OUR CEO
BJØRN GULDEN
adidas is a company like no other.
We have all the ingredients to win.
HELLO BJØRN, AND WELCOME TO THE THREE STRIPES. OR SHOULD WE RATHER SAY:
‘WELCOME BACK’ TO THE THREE STRIPES?
Well, you can say both. It’s a ‘welcome’ and of course it’s a ‘welcome back’ and I appreciate both. It’s like
coming home to the brand I have always had strong feelings for. My father was an adidas player and I
played sports in adidas all the time when I was a kid. And of course, it was my first job. I followed adidas
even when I was working in different parts of the industry, so being allowed to come back is a great honor.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
HOW DID IT FEEL COMING TO THE OFFICE AS ADIDAS CEO AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR?
Walking into the building gave me a very positive feeling. Of course, I’m aware that things are not great
and that the expectation is on us that we will improve. And I can sense that hope.
YOU’VE BEEN AN ATHLETE ALMOST YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND NOW YOU’RE THE CEO OF
ADIDAS. HOW HAS SPORT SHAPED YOUR LIFE AND YOUR LEADERSHIP STYLE?
Well, sport is my life. Because my father was a professional athlete, I did all kinds of sports when I was a
kid – from skiing and track and field to handball and football. I went on to play football and handball
professionally, but unfortunately, an injury ended my career early. My wife was a national champion in
gymnastics, and my sons played football at a high level. I spend almost 100% of my time with things that
are related to sports.
I have a bachelor’s degree and I have a master’s, but the one thing that has taught me the most about
leadership is playing team sports. You play with people you like, with people you don’t like, or who are
better than you, worse than you, and you must find a spot where you can have the biggest influence on the
team. I’ve learned a lot from sport and I’m still learning a lot.
YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS A ‘SPORTS ROMANTIC.’ WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
I think all sports are important. There’s a tendency to focus on the big ones like football, basketball and
running, but smaller sports are just as interesting. I always felt that Adi Dassler was also a sports
romantic, trying to deliver the best equipment for all sports. And I have the same philosophy. Visibility
across many sports brings a lot of worth because that will give us credibility. That’s why I’m a sports
romantic. I love all sports.
YOU MENTIONED TEAM SPORTS EARLIER. HOW DO YOU BUILD A WINNING TEAM?
Well, it’s difficult to say how I build a winning team because the word ‘I’ is a little bit misleading. I think we
build winning teams by showing respect for each other, playing to each other’s individual strengths and
trying to make our colleagues better. That’s the best formula. When you look at the Football World Cup,
the best team on paper doesn’t always win. Often, the team that comes together and acts like a team wins.
Of course, you need a coach, and you need captains. In the end, we need to remember that a bad coach can
make a good team bad, but a great coach alone can’t make a bad team good. All the players need to play
their roles and make their teammates better, not only themselves. Those are the teams that will win in the
future.
Then there’s the culture of the company. We’re operating in so many different markets that we are
dependent on a truly multicultural team. I also think our workplace should be the most fun place to be. We
should laugh a lot and we should not take ourselves too seriously. We should be allowed to be different,
and we need to show each other respect. It doesn’t matter who you are or what job you have, we are all
adidas. With this comes the team spirit that we will need to win.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
NOW LET’S SHIFT GEARS AND TALK ABOUT THE BUSINESS. WHAT’S YOUR VIEW ON
THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS?
You look at the numbers and it’s obvious that we’re not performing the way we should. I have said it many
times, but we have all the ingredients to win: We have a great brand, we have credibility, we have
authenticity, we have innovation, we have collaborations, we have very talented people, and we have a
global network.
But covid-19 brought problems for adidas that maybe weren’t addressed as pragmatically as they should
have been. Now we are locked into a strategy that isn’t really tied to how the world has changed – with the
pandemic and everything that came after.
Now we should please our multi-brand retail partners and their consumers. They need to see strong
income, but we also need strong direct-to-consumer sales for ourselves. We have to deal with all these
channels in an optimized way and with more discipline in how we go to market.
We know 2022 was a difficult year and 2023 won’t be much easier. Our entire industry has suffered from
high inventory levels and, as a result, there is a lot of discounting going on in the marketplace.
But we do have some winners, especially in the performance area. We have a very good football business
with great new concepts and products, and we’ve made huge progress in running, which is maybe the
most difficult area to qualify in. I love to see that we’ve established ourselves in the outdoor industry, our
golf business is doing well, and we have some exciting things coming up in basketball.
On the lifestyle side, we have collaborations with Gucci, Prada, Moncler, and more. I think when people say
we’re not exciting, maybe sometimes we are too exciting and don’t celebrate the individual wins because
we have so many. I’m sure that if we get some time, we can – and will – turn this into a very successful
formula. Again, we just need to work a little bit more on the basics.
WHAT DOES ADIDAS NEED TO FOCUS ON TO GET BACK ON TRACK?
We need to focus on the core of our business, which is design, development, sourcing, marketing, selling,
and delivering product. We should never forget that we are a shoe, apparel, and accessories brand that
sells physical product. Everything around that should support this, so right now, that means focusing on
the product, on how we go-to-market and being the most service-minded organization both to our retail
partners and the consumer.
We should be the most liked brand by both athletes and by those who are influential in our business. We
need to create the best product and must always remember that our consumers – although informed
globally – still think and act locally.
WHAT’S YOUR VIEW ON THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR MARKETS?
During covid-19, markets drifted away from each other. China was open and closed at the same time, the
US was open, but Europe was closed – that meant that the launch of products and the flow of our industry
switched from being very global to very local. The political tensions and economic chaos of the last three
years have also fed into this.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The needs in China might be different to those in Germany or in North America. This local focus of giving
the consumer what they want has to be top of mind. You cannot tell the consumer what they want. We need
to listen to what our consumers want from us. Yes, they are influenced by global athletes, global
celebrities, and global products, but we also need to accept that there are local influences. We need to find
that balance.
We can also optimize our go-to-market processes. Speed has become more important, and we need to be
more agile. Things change quickly, and we need to move with this change to stay relevant in the eyes of
our consumer.
DO YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON SPECIFIC MARKETS?
They will be treated equally, yet individually. I think it’s wrong to set priorities and say that one market is
more important than the other, we should be strong in every market and tailor our approach for each
individual one.
Saying that, as our home market, we should be market leader in Europe. We also know that if you’re not
successful in North America, you’re not really a global brand. China has been a growth driver for us.
Because of the pandemic and other challenges, however, we’re not where we used to be, but I have a
feeling that things will improve there. Latin America is on fire, which makes me optimistic. And then, there
are markets like Korea and Japan which are very directional and very fashion oriented. Here we have a
real opportunity to grow.
So, to win in every market, we need to work more closely with our accounts to find out what works and
what doesn’t. If you have a good product and the retailer wants it, our consumers will probably buy it. If the
retailer doesn’t want it, then it’s likely the consumer doesn’t want it either.
We have both physical stores and e-com sites, so we can always bring whatever we want to market and
test it. We’re already sitting on a lot of consumer insights which could definitely help us win in the
markets.
TALKING ABOUT INSIGHTS AND TRENDS, WHAT TRENDS IN THE INDUSTRY
DO YOU SEE RIGHT NOW?
There are so many mega trends that are good for us as a company, but the one that I’ve liked most is that,
during covid-19, people have been coming back to sports. They’re becoming more health conscious and
embracing individual sports – especially in the outdoors – like walking, running, biking, and skiing.
There’s also growth in yoga, pilates and a variety of other sports, and that’s very good for us!
The workplace is becoming more casual, and people are wearing sneakers and branded sweatshirts to
work. It’s clear that working from home has led people to become more casual in every aspect of their
lives.
Last year also saw the Samba and the Gazelle become that special look everyone wanted. This is
something that we own and it’s very, very hot. It has happened organically over the last six to nine months
and it’s a trend that we’re really exploiting.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
ADIDAS HAS ALWAYS HAD A STRONG FOCUS ON SUSTAINABILITY. HOW IMPORTANT IS
THIS TOPIC TO YOU?
For me, sustainability is a focus all companies must have. Doing things that are good for the next
generation – for the planet – is a value that we should all have. This industry – and especially adidas – has
done a lot of good stuff for the planet over the last 30 years. Back then, we didn’t think about it at all and
look where we are now.
Our company has set very clear targets on what we want to achieve, and we will do exactly that.
Sustainability is going to be one of the things that every employee – especially those working on product –
needs to know about. It’s not something we can delegate to just one department, I believe that everybody
in the company needs to have knowledge in this.
WHAT ARE YOU MOST LOOKING FORWARD TO IN 2023?
Well, I look forward to the big sporting events including the FIFA World Cup 2023 in Australia and New
Zealand. On the business side, I’m looking forward to making progress on our turnaround and showing our
people that we can make a positive shift. Although we have problems in the short term, we can get back to
where we belong.
DO YOU HAVE ANY FINAL MESSAGE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS?
adidas is a company like no other. There’s probably no other brand in the world that is as emotional as
adidas. We are relevant in sport, in music, in entertainment, and in fashion. Our appeal is global and
stretches over multiple generations. And when I look to the future, I see people doing more sport, dressing
more casually and being even more brand-driven. Given all this, I think we’re a great company to invest in.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
2022 was a disappointing year for adidas. Geopolitical tensions as well as macroeconomic and company-
specific challenges, severely impacted adidas’ top- and bottom-line performance last year. While large
parts of the global economy recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, business activity in Greater China
was still negatively affected by strict lockdown measures throughout most of the year. In addition, the war
in Ukraine, continued supply chain constraints, increasing inflation, tightened monetary policy and, as a
result, a slowdown in consumer demand, had a significant adverse impact on the company’s business
activities. In this challenging environment, adidas posted solid growth in its Western markets as well as in
Asia-Pacific. The company continued to invest into the creation and marketing of its products, the physical
and virtual consumer experience as well as into driving its sustainability efforts and further improving its
digital set-up. In addition to the challenging market backdrop, adidas faced company-specific challenges
such as the slower recovery in Greater China and the termination of its Yeezy partnership. As a result, the
company’s top- and bottom-line results came in significantly below our initial expectations. With the
appointment of Bjørn Gulden as new CEO as of January 1, 2023, we have been paving the way for a
successful restart of adidas. Consequently, the company is currently conducting a thorough strategic
review, which also includes its long-term financial ambition.
SUPERVISION AND ADVICE IN DIALOGUE WITH THE EXECUTIVE BOARD
In the year under review, we performed all of our tasks laid down by law, the Articles of Association, the
German Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’), and the Rules of Procedure carefully and conscientiously, as
in previous years. We regularly advised the Executive Board on the management of the company as well as
diligently and continuously supervised its management activities. The Executive Board involved us directly
and in a timely and comprehensive manner in all of the company’s fundamental decisions.
The Executive Board informed us extensively and regularly through written and oral reports. This
information covered all relevant aspects of the company’s corporate strategy, business planning (including
finance, investment and personnel planning), the business development, and the company’s financial
position and profitability. We were also kept up to date on matters relating to accounting processes, the
risk situation and the effectiveness and development of the Internal Control and Risk Management
Systems, compliance as well as all major decisions and business transactions. Furthermore, the Executive
Board always reported immediately and thoroughly on any deviations in business performance from the
plans. In the year under review, such deviations were attributable, in particular, to the geopolitical
situation in Ukraine and the associated wind-down of business operations in Russia, the ongoing
pandemic-related restrictions and the related slower recovery of the business in China, elevated inventory
levels due to declining consumer demand and the termination of the Yeezy partnership. The Executive
Board informed us regularly about the measures taken to mitigate the negative effects on operational
performance.
Furthermore, the Executive Board provided us regularly with comprehensive written reports for the
preparation of our meetings. We thus always had the opportunity to critically analyze the Executive Board’s
reports and resolution proposals within the committees and within the entire Supervisory Board and to put
forward suggestions before passing resolutions based on in-depth examination and extensive
consultation. At the Supervisory Board meetings, the Executive Board was available for discussions and
answering our questions. In the periods between our meetings, the Executive Board also provided us with
extensive monthly reports on the current business situation. We critically examined and scrutinized the
information provided to us by the Executive Board.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
MEETINGS OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES
In the past financial year, the Supervisory Board primarily exercised its duties in plenary meetings.
Members who were unable to participate in the meetings took part in the resolutions by submitting their
votes in writing. In the year under review, the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees took
place both as physical and virtual meetings. The latest videoconferencing technology was used to ensure
an open and appropriate discussion between the Executive Board and Supervisory Board within the virtual
meetings.
TYPE OF MEETING
Virtual meeting Physical meeting
Supervisory Board 6 3
General Committee 4 2
Audit Committee 1 3
The external auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, (‘KPMG’) attended all meetings of
the Supervisory Board, with the exception of three extraordinary meetings, insofar as no Executive Board
matters or internal matters of the Supervisory Board were discussed. Furthermore, KPMG attended all
meetings of the Audit Committee.
In the periods between meetings, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Audit
Committee maintained regular contact with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,
conferring on matters such as corporate strategy, business planning and development, the risk situation,
control and risk management as well as compliance. In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board
and, as applicable, the entire Supervisory Board, were informed about events of fundamental importance
for evaluating the situation, development, and management of the company, also at short notice, if
required. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board regularly reported during meetings on discussions with
the Executive Board outside the Supervisory Board meetings.
The Supervisory Board also met regularly without the Executive Board members, in particular to discuss
internal affairs of the Supervisory Board as well as personnel and compensation matters relating to the
Executive Board. The Audit Committee also follows the new recommendation D.10 of the Code and
regularly confers with the auditor in the Audit Committee meetings without the Executive Board being
present.
In this year under review, too, the participation rate of the Supervisory Board and its committees was
consistently high, totaling approximately 96% (2021: approximately 98%) and thus exceeding the targeted
minimum participation rate of 75%.

TASKS AND TOPICS FOR THE ENTIRE SUPERVISORY BOARD
In the year under review, there were nine meetings of the entire Supervisory Board (2021: seven
meetings).
The following subject areas were presented to us in detail by the Executive Board for regular discussion at
meetings of the entire Supervisory Board: the development of sales, earnings, and the employment
situation, the financial position of the company, and the development of the company’s individual
operations, brands, and markets. Furthermore, we focused on the impact of the geopolitical situation in
Ukraine and the associated wind-down of business operations in Russia, the ongoing pandemic-related
restrictions and the related slower recovery of the business in China, the elevated inventory levels due to
declining consumer demand and the termination of the Yeezy partnership. Moreover, we thoroughly
addressed supply chain challenges, the development of the market shares in the major markets and
adidas’ brand heat, also compared with our competitors. Additionally, we examined the development of e-
commerce sales, the continued expansion of adidas’ direct-to-consumer business, and the progress of the
company’s digital transformation. The status of the Reebok divestiture process was also regularly
addressed and conferred on. We also discussed the annual and multi-year planning of the Executive
Board. One of the focus topics in this respect was the implementation status of the long-term strategy
‘Own the Game’ that will run until the 2025 financial year. The growing importance of ESG-related topics
and their regulation was also discussed regularly by the Supervisory Board. Finally, the Executive Board
informed us about the implementation of the people strategy and the measures taken to foster and
accelerate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at adidas. As regards personnel matters, the extension of the
appointments of Roland Auschel and Brian Grevy and the change in the Chief Executive Officer position
from Kasper Rorsted to Bjørn Gulden were some of the main topics of consultation.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
In accordance with statutory regulations or the Rules of Procedure, certain transactions and measures by
the Executive Board require the prior approval of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board discussed
transactions requiring approval as they arose and gave its approval to resolution items after detailed
reviews, in some cases based on preparations by the relevant committees. In addition, the Supervisory
Board regularly discussed personnel and compensation matters with respect to the Executive Board as
well as questions of corporate governance.► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/COMPENSATION ► SEE DECLARATION ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
At the February meeting of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board reported on the company’s
situation and preliminary financial results for the 2021 financial year as well as the pandemic-related
challenges in China and Vietnam. Moreover, we discussed the dividend and return policy of adidas AG, the
M&A strategy, and the status of the Reebok divestiture. In this connection, in case of a successful
divestiture of Reebok to the Authentic Brands Group, we approved to return the majority of the proceeds
from the divestiture to the shareholders by way of another share buyback program. In addition to adidas’
ESG targets, we also dealt with the Executive Board compensation. In this respect, having determined the
degree of target achievement and having discussed in detail the individual performance of the Executive
Board members, we set the variable compensation to be paid to the Executive Board members for the
2021 financial year. We also determined the appropriateness of the Executive Board compensation
following an internal appropriateness test. In addition, we discussed the criteria and targets for the
variable, performance-based compensation of the Executive Board members for the 2022 financial year.
Furthermore, following a thorough consultation, we resolved the extension of the appointments of Roland
Auschel and Brian Grevy as members of the Executive Board of adidas AG. Finally, we addressed
corporate governance topics such as the adjustment of the Supervisory Board compensation and the
adoption of the 2021 Compensation Report and the Declaration of Corporate Governance.
At the balance sheet meeting in March, the Executive Board reported on the financial results for the past
financial year as well as on the audit of the 2021 annual financial statements and consolidated financial
statements. Before the Supervisory Board passed its resolution, the auditor reported on the material
results of the audit, including the results of the examination of the content of the non-financial statement
commissioned by the Supervisory Board in accordance with § 111 section 2 sentence 4 of the German
Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG). After in-depth examination of the financial statements and on
the basis of the independent auditor’s report and the Audit Committee report on the audit results, the
Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as well
as the combined Management Report including the non-financial statement for adidas AG and the adidas
Group. The annual financial statements were thus adopted. The Executive Board also reported on the
situation in Russia and Ukraine and the respective financial impact on adidas as well as on the security of
and support provided for the employees there. In addition, the Executive Board reported on the company’s
current business situation, the outlook for the 2022 financial year, the challenges of the operating
business in China and the planned mitigating measures. Furthermore, the Executive Board gave us an
update on adidas brand topics and current marketing campaigns, key partnerships and the new operating
business in the area of metaverse and NFT. The successful conclusion of the Reebok divestiture was
another topic. Other topics of discussion included compliance and major legal disputes involving adidas.
Moreover, we approved the Supervisory Board Report to the Annual General Meeting as well as the
proposed resolutions to be submitted to the 2022 Annual General Meeting, including the proposal on the
appropriation of retained earnings for the 2021 financial year. In addition, at the March meeting, we
finalized the criteria and targets for the variable, performance-based compensation of the Executive Board
members for the 2022 financial year. The Supervisory Board was also given a comprehensive presentation
of new product developments.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
At the May meeting, we focused on the current business performance, the business situation in China, and
the impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine. The Executive Board outlined the financial report for
the first quarter of 2022 and reported on the revised outlook for the 2022 financial year reflecting the
impact of the pandemic-related lockdowns in China. Furthermore, the Executive Board reported on the
conclusion of a new, long-term strategic partnership with Foot Locker Inc. We were also given an update
on adidas’ market shares and the development of brand heat. In light of the ongoing share buyback
program, we approved the Executive Board’s adjusted resolution proposal on the appropriation of retained
earnings and discussed the percentage of women on the Executive Board.
At the August meeting, we discussed, in particular, the Q2 and half-year results for 2022, the business
situation in China, also compared with competitors, and the situation in Russia and Ukraine. The Executive
Board also outlined the adjustment of the outlook for 2022 in view of the slower than expected recovery of
the business in China. In this regard, we also discussed mitigating measures with the Executive Board.
Furthermore, we received another update on adidas’ market shares, the development of brand heat,
marketing investments and their efficiency as well as on product innovations. Comprehensive and detailed
reports were given on adidas’ talent strategy and the topics of Tech and Data & Analytics. Furthermore, we
discussed the amendments to the Code and their meaning for the company, and approved the court
appointment of Birgit Biermann as new Supervisory Board member on the employee representative side
due to the resignation of Roland Nosko with effect from August 31, 2022. Finally, the Supervisory Board
was provided with training opportunities.
At an extraordinary Supervisory Board meeting in August, after a thorough discussion, we decided to
follow the recommendation of the General Committee to approve the amicable termination of the
appointment of Kasper Rorsted as Executive Board member of adidas AG in 2023 and the termination
agreement to the Executive Board service contract. Furthermore, it was resolved to initiate the succession
process.
The October meeting focused on the current business situation and the preliminary financial results for Q3
2022, the outlook for the year under review and the emerging challenges for the operating business, the
planned Business Improvement Program, and the business development in China. In connection with the
report on the situation in Russia and Ukraine, we approved the Executive Board’s proposal to wind down
business operations in Russia. Moreover, we approved the extension of the term and the increase of the
commitments of the revolving credit facility. Furthermore, we discussed with the Executive Board our
collaboration strategies with partners and received an update on the strategic orientation of the basketball
business as well as a presentation of product innovations in this regard. We also thoroughly discussed the
Yeezy partnership and the settlement of a legal dispute with a competitor. Following a report by our
Supervisory Board member responsible for ESG about sustainability issues at adidas AG, in particular the
‘share of sustainable articles offered’ (‘9 out of 10’), we addressed in detail the horizontal comparison of
the Executive Board compensation, which had been conducted by an external compensation consultant. On
this basis, the Executive Board compensation was assessed to be appropriate. In addition, the Supervisory
Board elected Michael Storl as member of the General Committee. He succeeded Roland Nosko due to the
latter’s resignation from the Supervisory Board with effect from the end of August 31, 2022. We also
discussed the results of the self-assessment (efficiency examination) of our work. Based on the self-
assessment results, we derived selective measures to improve the Supervisory Board’s work. In general,
the self-assessment results confirmed the high effectiveness of the work of the Supervisory Board and its
committees.
At an extraordinary Supervisory Board meeting in October, after a thorough discussion, we followed the
Executive Board’s recommendation and approved the termination of the Yeezy partnership and the
discontinuation of the production of Yeezy brand products.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Following in-depth consultations and upon recommendation of the General Committee, we resolved to
appoint Bjørn Gulden as Executive Board member and Chief Executive Officer, each with effect from
January 1, 2023, as well as the conclusion of his Executive Board service contract at our extraordinary
Supervisory Board meeting in November. Moreover, we resolved, also upon recommendation of the
General Committee, the amicable termination of the appointment of Kasper Rorsted as Executive Board
member and Chief Executive Officer with effect from the end of November 11, 2022, as well as the
appointment of Harm Ohlmeyer as Chief Executive Officer for the period from November 12, 2022, to
December 31, 2022. Furthermore, we approved the issuance of non-share-based bonds with an aggregate
amount of up to € 1,000,000,000.
At the December meeting, we focused on the preliminary Budget and Investment Plan for the 2023
financial year presented by the Executive Board as well as on the marketing and sponsorship agreements
concluded in the year under review. After a thorough review, we approved the final Budget and Investment
Plan presented to us for resolution in February 2023. Moreover, the Executive Board gave a
comprehensive report on the implementation status of our strategy ‘Own the Game,’ including an overview
on the current business situation and on the outlook for the year under review. We also discussed the
Business Improvement Plan, the business situation in China, the status of the wind-down of business
operations in Russia, and the Yeezy partnership. In addition, we dealt with the succession planning for the
Executive Board, the assessment of the independence of the Supervisory Board members and resolved the
Declaration of Compliance with the Code. Other topics were the resolution on the adjusted competency
profile for the Supervisory Board prepared by the General Committee and thoroughly evaluated by the
entire Supervisory Board as well as the adjustment of the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board,
Supervisory Board, and Audit Committee in view of the amendments to the Code. The Supervisory Board
also resolved the necessary amendment to the Articles of Association to reflect the reduction of the
nominal capital and the changed number of shares resulting from the cancelation of shares.
TASKS AND TOPICS FOR THE COMMITTEES
In order to perform our tasks in an efficient manner, we have established a total of five standing
Supervisory Board committees. The committees prepare resolutions and topics for the meetings of the
entire Supervisory Board. Within the legally permissible framework and in appropriate cases, we have
furthermore delegated the Supervisory Board’s authority to pass certain resolutions to individual
committees. With the exception of the Audit Committee, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also chairs
all the standing committees. The respective committee chairmen report to the Supervisory Board on their
work as well as the content and results of the committee meetings on a regular and comprehensive basis.
The Steering Committee did not meet in the year under review.
The General Committee held six meetings in the year under review (2021: four meetings). The main task
of the General Committee was to prepare resolutions for the entire Supervisory Board on personnel and
compensation matters of the Executive Board. In particular, it discussed the extension of the appointments
of Roland Auschel and Brian Grevy and the amicable termination of the appointment of Kasper Rorsted.
Moreover, the General Committee comprehensively prepared the search for a successor to the Chief
Executive Officer and the appointment of Bjørn Gulden. Regarding Executive Board compensation, the
General Committee drafted proposals for resolutions on the targets, target achievement, and amount of
the variable performance-related compensation, and pre-examined the appropriateness of the Executive
Board compensation. Furthermore, the General Committee discussed in detail the compensation report
and the long-term succession planning for the Executive Board. The adjustment of the Supervisory Board
compensation and the horizontal comparison to ascertain the appropriateness of the Executive Board
compensation were also prepared by the General Committee for the entire Supervisory Board.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The Audit Committee held four meetings in the year under review (2021: four meetings). The Chief
Financial Officer and the auditor were present at all meetings and reported to the committee members in
detail. The Audit Committee follows the recommendation of the Code and regularly confers with the
auditor at Audit Committee meetings without the Executive Board being present.
In addition to the monitoring of the accounting process, the committee’s work focused on the audit of the
2021 annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements, including the combined
Management Report and the non-financial statement of adidas AG and the Group, as well as the proposal
regarding the appropriation of retained earnings. Following a detailed presentation of the audit reports by
the auditor, the Audit Committee decided to recommend to the Supervisory Board to approve the 2021
annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Audit Committee
prepared the audit of the non-financial statement.
In the year under review, the Audit Committee dealt intensively with the continued development and
monitoring of the effectiveness of the Risk Management System, the Internal Audit System, the Internal
Control System, and the Compliance Management System. Other matters discussed in detail were the
assignment of the audit mandate to the auditor appointed by the Annual General Meeting and the
determination of the audit fees and key audit matters. In accordance with § 111 section 2 sentence 4 AktG,
the Audit Committee furthermore commissioned the auditor with the audit of the content of the non-
financial statement with limited assurance and, for the first time, with an audit with reasonable assurance
of the statements on the ‘share of sustainable articles offered’ (‘9 out of 10’) KPI contained therein. In
addition, the Audit Committee monitored the independence and qualification of the auditor, while also
taking into account the non-audit services provided by the auditor. With regard to the quality of the audit,
the Audit Committee determined on the basis of the auditor’s report on its own quality assurance system,
the findings of the German Auditor Oversight Body (Abschlussprüferaufsichtsstelle – APAS), and its
internal quality review, that there were no indications of quality issues in the 2021 audit. Finally, the Audit
Committee discussed the quarterly financial results and the half-year financial report. Furthermore, in the
year under review, the Audit Committee had in-depth discussions about the transition regarding the
external rotation of the auditor in 2023 and dealt thoroughly with the audit plan and risk management
report. At each committee meeting, the Audit Committee was also informed about the findings and
developments of the Internal Audit department as well as in the area of compliance.
Furthermore, the meetings of the Audit Committee covered topics such as data protection and information
security, business partner due diligence, adidas Global Business Services as well as sustainability issues
at adidas (including the Executive Board compensation target ‘share of sustainable articles offered’ –
‘9 out of 10’). Other topics were the German Supply Chain Act, the KPIs of the non-financial statement, and
amendments to the Code. The provisions of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the
impact of currency effects on the business of adidas, including the associated hedging strategy and
pension obligations, were also discussed by the Audit Committee.
The Nomination Committee did not meet in the year under review.
As in previous years, the Mediation Committee to be established in accordance with the German Co-
Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz – MitbestG) did not have to be convened in the year under
review.

Supervisory Board members who joined the Supervisory Board during the year under review, or who
assumed new responsibilities within the Supervisory Board, an introduction to the work of the Supervisory
Board and/or to new areas of responsibility within adidas AG. The Supervisory Board members were given
detailed resources on the business and subject areas that are relevant to their particular tasks. In

made permanently available on our website. ► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE
In the year under review, there were no conflicts of interest among the members of either the Supervisory
Board or the Executive Board. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the brand ambassador agreement
between adidas International, Inc., and the Supervisory Board member Jackie Joyner-Kersee does not
constitute a conflict of interest with regard to her role on the Supervisory Board.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
EXAMINATION OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The 2022 Annual General Meeting appointed KPMG as auditor and Group auditor for the 2022 financial
year as proposed by the Supervisory Board and recommended by the Audit Committee. Prior to this, KPMG
had confirmed to both the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee that there are no circumstances that
could prejudice their independence as auditor or that could cast doubt on KPMG’s independence. In this
respect, KPMG also declared to which extent non-audit services were rendered for the company in the
previous financial year or are contractually agreed upon for the following year.
KPMG audited the 2022 consolidated financial statements prepared by the Executive Board in accordance
with § 315e of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB) in compliance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as they are to be applied in the European Union, and
issued an unqualified opinion thereon. This also applies to the 2022 annual financial statements of
adidas AG, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the German Commercial Code, and the
combined Management Report of adidas AG and the adidas Group. Furthermore, at the request of the
Supervisory Board, KPMG audited the non-financial statement. The financial statements, the proposal on
the appropriation of retained earnings, and the auditor’s reports of the annual and consolidated financial
statements were distributed by the Executive Board to all Supervisory Board members in a timely manner.
The financial statements were examined in depth, with a particular focus on legality and regularity, in the
presence of the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting held on March 6, 2023, and at the balance sheet
meeting of the Supervisory Board on March 7, 2023, during which the Executive Board explained the
financial statements in detail. At both meetings, the auditor reported on the material results of the audit,
inter alia with regard to the audit focus points agreed as well as the key audit matters, and was available
for questions and the provision of additional information. The auditor did not report any significant
weaknesses with respect to the Internal Control and Risk Management Systems relating to the accounting
process. Prior to the passing of the resolution, the auditor reported on the results of the audit of the non-
financial statement with limited assurance as commissioned by the Audit Committee in accordance with
§ 111 section 2 sentence 4 AktG and the first-time audit with reasonable assurance of the statements on
the ‘share of sustainable articles offered’ (‘9 out of 10’) KPI contained therein. In addition, the Supervisory
Board discussed in depth and approved the Executive Board’s proposal concerning the appropriation of
retained earnings for the 2022 financial year.
Based on our own examinations of the annual and consolidated financial statements (including the non-
financial statement), we came to the conclusion that there are no objections to be raised. Following the
recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board therefore approved the audit results and
the financial statements prepared by the Executive Board, including the non-financial statement, for the
2022 financial year. The annual financial statements were thus adopted. As the responsible audit partners,
auditor Angelika Huber-Straßer has signed the annual financial statements since the 2021 financial year
and auditor Johannes Hanshen since the 2022 financial year.
KPMG has been acting as auditor and Group auditor for adidas AG since the 1995 financial year. On the
basis of the transitional periods of Article 41 Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, KPMG may not be reappointed
as auditor after June 17, 2023. In the 2021 financial year, the Audit Committee had already conducted a
tendering and selection process for a new auditor for the 2023 financial year in accordance with the
requirements of Article 16 section 3 of the EU Audit Regulation. Based on the proposal prepared by the
Audit Committee, the 2022 Annual General Meeting, upon proposal of the Supervisory Board, appointed
PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as auditor and Group auditor for the
2023 financial year. Prior to this, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft had
confirmed to both the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee that there are no circumstances that could
prejudice their independence as auditor or that could cast doubt on the independence of
PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
EXPRESSION OF THANKS
On behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the long-serving Supervisory Board
member Roland Nosko, who resigned during the year under review, for his tremendous dedication to the
company and his exceptional work on the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, I wish to thank the current
Executive Board and all our employees around the world for their great personal dedication and ongoing
commitment. I would also like to express my gratitude for the enduring trust and cooperation between the
employee and shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board.
Moreover, I would like to thank Kasper Rorsted, who resigned from the Executive Board in mid-November,
for his achievements for the company during the past six years. He strategically repositioned the company
and fast-forwarded its digital transformation. In North America, the world’s largest sporting goods
market, adidas has doubled its sales during his term of office since 2016. In addition, with Kasper Rorsted
at the helm, adidas has strengthened its leadership position in sustainability and increased Diversity,
Equity, and Inclusion throughout the company. We would like to express our gratitude and respect for
these achievements.
For the Supervisory Board

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
DECLARATION ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance stands for responsible, transparent corporate management and control geared
toward a long-term increase in value. We are convinced that good corporate governance is an essential
basis for sustainable corporate success and strengthens the trust placed in our company by our
shareholders, business partners, and employees, as well as the financial markets.
DECLARATION OF THE ADIDAS AG EXECUTIVE BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD ON THE GERMAN CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE CODE PURSUANT TO § 161 GERMAN STOCK CORPORATION ACT (AKTIENGESETZ – AKTG)
In December 2021, the adidas AG Executive Board and Supervisory Board issued the last Declaration of
Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code in the version of December 16, 2019, published
in the Federal Gazette on May 20, 2020, pursuant to § 161 AktG. The following declaration refers to the
recommendations of the ‘Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code’ in the
version of December 16, 2019 (‘Code 2019’) and the version of April 28, 2022, published in the Federal
Gazette on June 27, 2022 (‘Code 2022’).
1. The adidas AG Executive Board and Supervisory Board declare that since the last declaration, the
recommendations of the Code 2019 have been met with the following exceptions:
Recommendation C.5 Alternative 1 Code 2019
One member of the Supervisory Board, Ian Gallienne, holds more than two mandates in supervisory bodies
of non-group companies which are listed at a stock exchange or have similar requirements. Ian Gallienne
is Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (‘GBL’). GBL is a holding company that is regularly
represented in the supervisory bodies of portfolio companies as an institutional investor, inter alia, by its
Chief Executive Officer. All companies (apart from adidas AG) in which Ian Gallienne is a member of the
supervisory body are portfolio companies or subsidiaries of GBL or are under joint control of GBL and
therefore belong to the same group of companies. They have to be attributed to his main occupation as
Chief Executive Officer of GBL.
We are of the opinion that in accordance with its rationale, recommendation C.5 alternative 1 Code 2019 is
thus not applicable to Ian Gallienne. For precautionary reasons, however, a deviation is declared. The
Supervisory Board has also assured itself that Ian Gallienne has sufficient time to duly perform his duties
as a member of the Supervisory Board of adidas AG.
Recommendation C.5 Alternative 2 Code 2019
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Thomas Rabe, is also Chief Executive Officer of the listed
company RTL Group S.A., Luxembourg. In this respect, the company deviates from recommendation C.5
alternative 2. However, the Supervisory Board is convinced that Thomas Rabe’s mandate at RTL Group S.A.
does not affect the due performance of his duties as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. In particular, the
Supervisory Board has assured itself that Thomas Rabe has sufficient time to perform his duties.
2. Furthermore, the adidas AG Executive Board and Supervisory Board declare that since the last
Declaration of Compliance, the recommendations of the Code 2022 have been and are met with the
following exceptions:
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Recommendation B.3 Code 2022
With effect from January 1, 2023, the Supervisory Board has appointed Bjørn Gulden as member of the
Executive Board and Chief Executive Officer for a period of five years, thus exceeding the term of office of
three years recommended for initial appointments.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that, in view of Bjørn Gulden’s qualification and experience and the
implementation of long-term strategic decisions and goals, an initial appointment of five years is in the
company’s best interest.
Recommendation C.5 Alternative 1 Code 2022
Bjørn Gulden, appointed member of the Executive Board and Chief Executive Officer from January 1, 2023,
holds mandates with requirements comparable to mandates in non-group listed companies at Tchibo
GmbH and Salling Group A/S, a stock corporation under Danish law which is not listed. Furthermore, he
holds a mandate at Essity Aktiebolag (publ)., a listed stock corporation under the laws of the Kingdom of
Sweden. The Supervisory Board is convinced that Bjørn Gulden’s mandates will not affect the due
performance of his duties as a member of the Executive Board and Chief Executive Officer. In particular,
the Supervisory Board has assured itself that Bjørn Gulden will have sufficient time to perform his duties.
Recommendation C.5 Alternative 1 Code 2022
With regard to the mandates held by Ian Gallienne, reference is made to the above explanations. We are of
the opinion that in accordance with its rationale, recommendation C.5 alternative 1 Code 2022 is not
applicable to Ian Gallienne. For precautionary reasons, however, a deviation is declared.
Recommendation C.5 Alternative 2 Code 2022
With regard to the mandate held by Thomas Rabe, reference is made to the above explanations. The
Supervisory Board is convinced that Thomas Rabe’s mandate does not affect the due performance of his
duties as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. In particular, the Supervisory Board has assured itself that
Thomas Rabe has sufficient time to perform his duties.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
DUAL BOARD SYSTEM
As a globally operating stock corporation with its registered seat in Herzogenaurach, Germany, adidas AG
is subject to, inter alia, the provisions of German stock corporation law. A dual board system, which
assigns the management of the company to the Executive Board and advice and supervision of the
Executive Board to the Supervisory Board, is one of the fundamental principles of German stock
corporation law. These two boards are strictly separated both in terms of members and competencies.
However, both boards cooperate closely in the interest of the company.
COMPOSITION AND WORKING METHODS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD
The composition of our Executive Board reflects the international structure of our company. Upon expiry of
November 11, 2022, Kasper Rorsted, who had been Chief Executive Officer until then, departed from the
Executive Board of adidas AG. Thus, the Executive Board consisted of five members at the balance sheet
date. With effect from January 1, 2023, Bjørn Gulden was appointed as ordinary member of the Executive
Board and Chief Executive Officer. Since this point in time, the Executive Board of adidas AG once again
consists of six members. The Executive Board is responsible for independently managing the company
with the aim of sustainable value creation in the best interests of the company, developing the company's
strategic orientation, coordinating it with the Supervisory Board, and ensuring its implementation.
Furthermore, it determines business objectives, the company’s policy, and the organization of the Group.
In this respect, the Executive Board also systemically identifies and assesses risks and opportunities for
the company associated with social and environmental factors as well as the ecological and social impacts
of its business activities. Moreover, the Executive Board is responsible for preparing the quarterly
statements, the half-year report, and the annual financial statements and consolidated financial
statements as well as the combined Management Report of adidas AG and the Group. It also prepares a
combined non-financial statement for the company and the Group. Additionally, the Executive Board
ensures responsible management of business resources as well as compliance with and observance of
legal provisions and internal regulations by the Group companies. For this purpose, the Executive Board
sets up an Internal Control System and Risk Management System appropriate and effective with regard to
the scope of business activities and the company’s risk situation, comprising, both, a Compliance
Management System aligned to the company’s risk situation and sustainability-related objectives. The
Executive Board also provides employees with the opportunity to report, in an appropriate and protected
manner, suspected legal infringements within the company. It is tied to the company's interest and
obligated to strive for a sustainable increase in the value of the company.
Notwithstanding the Executive Board’s joint responsibility for managing the company, the Executive Board
members are individually responsible for managing their respective operations in accordance with the
Business Allocation Plan for the Executive Board. There are no Executive Board committees. The Chief
Executive Officer represents the Executive Board and the company and is in charge of the overall
management and development of the company, including cooperation with the Supervisory Board as well
as coordination and supervision of the Executive Board members’ work, the Executive Board areas,
operations, brands, and markets. The Executive Board members continuously report to the CEO and to
each other about all significant developments in their respective business areas and coordinate with each
other on all cross-functional measures. Collaboration within the Executive Board is further governed by
the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board and the Business Allocation Plan. These documents
specifically stipulate requirements for meetings and resolutions as well as for cooperation with the
Supervisory Board.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board cooperate closely and trustfully for the benefit of the
company. The Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board regularly, extensively, and in a timely
manner on all matters relevant to the company’s strategy, planning, business development, financial
position, and compliance, as well as on material business risks. Fundamental questions related to the
corporate strategy and its implementation are thoroughly discussed and aligned with the Supervisory
Board.
The composition of the Executive Board is determined by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is
committed to promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion at adidas. Diversity is understood in the
broadest sense, including age, gender, cultural origin, nationality, educational background, professional
qualifications, and experience. Greater diversity on the Executive Board will help secure the long-term
success of adidas by taking diverse perspectives into account. For this reason, the Supervisory Board has
adopted a diversity concept. In addition, an age limit of 65 years applies for Executive Board members.
The General Committee of the Supervisory Board already accounts for diversity when selecting candidates
for Executive Board positions. Every decision by the Supervisory Board on the composition of the Executive
Board is made in the best interests of the company and with due consideration of all circumstances in
each individual case. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the current composition of the Executive
Board meets the diversity concept outlined above.
As at the balance sheet date, no member of the Executive Board has accepted a Supervisory Board chair
or more than two Supervisory Board mandates in non-group listed companies or in supervisory bodies of
non-group companies with comparable requirements. ► SEE EXECUTIVE BOARD
COMPOSITION AND WORKING METHODS OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Our Supervisory Board consists of 16 members. It comprises eight shareholder representatives and eight
employee representatives in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz –
MitbestG). The shareholder representatives are elected by the shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting and the employee representatives by the employees. ► SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The last regular Supervisory Board elections were held in the 2019 financial year. In the subsequent 2020
financial year, Christian Klein was appointed as a new member of the Supervisory Board in a by-election
due to Igor Landau’s resignation, and Thomas Rabe was elected as new Chairman of the Supervisory
Board. Due to Herbert Kauffmann’s departure, Jackie Joyner-Kersee was elected to the Supervisory
Board as a new shareholder representative in the 2021 financial year. At the end of 2021, Roswitha
Hermann resigned from the Supervisory Board as employee representative, and Bastian Knobloch was
appointed by court to succeed her. Most recently, Roland Nosko resigned from the Supervisory Board with
effect from the end of August 31, 2022. He was also an employee representative (trade union
representative) and was succeeded by Birgit Biermann, who was appointed by court. The terms of office of
the current members of the Supervisory Board expire at the end of the 2024 Annual General Meeting.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
In order to increase the efficiency of its work and to deal with complex topics, the Supervisory Board has
formed five permanent committees from within its members, which, inter alia, prepare its resolutions and,
in certain cases, pass resolutions on its behalf. At present, these committees are as follows:

Board on the results of the committee work on a regular basis.
Further information on the committees can be found on the company’s website.
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/SUPERVISORY-BOARD-COMMITTEES
In the 2022 financial year, after implementing the provisions of the Act to Strengthen Financial Market
Integrity (Gesetz zur Stärkung der Finanzmarktintegrität – FISG) in the 2021 financial year, the Supervisory
Board amended its Rules of Procedure as well as the Rules of Procedure of the Audit Committee to reflect
the amendments to the Code 2022 adopted on April 28, 2022. The amendments clarify that the Supervisory
Board’s supervision and advising activities also include sustainability issues. Accordingly, non-financial
reporting and its audit and assurance are also included in accounting and auditing which fall within the
Audit Committee’s sphere of responsibility. Further information on the competency profile for the entire
Supervisory Board and the expertise of the individual Supervisory Board members in sustainability issues
relevant to the company are outlined in the qualification matrix below.
OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
In the 2022 financial year, the Supervisory Board also revised the objectives regarding its composition
(including the competency profile for the entire Supervisory Board) once again, taking into account the new
recommendations of the Code 2022, and made them more specific with particular regard to the
sustainability issues relevant to adidas. These objectives are published on our website. According to these
objectives, the Supervisory Board should be composed in such a way that qualified supervision of and
advice to the Executive Board are ensured. Its members as a whole are expected to have the knowledge,
skills, and professional experience required to properly perform the tasks of a supervisory board in a
capital market-oriented international company in the sporting goods industry. To this end, it is ensured
that the Supervisory Board as a whole possesses the competencies considered essential in view of adidas’
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
activities. This includes, in particular, in-depth knowledge and experience in the sporting goods and
sports- and leisurewear industry, in the business of fast-moving consumer-oriented goods, and in the
areas of digital transformation and information technology (including IT security), production, marketing,
and sales, in particular also in the e-commerce and retail sector. Moreover, the Supervisory Board is
expected to possess knowledge and experience in the markets relevant for adidas, in particular the Asian
and US markets, and in the management of a large international company. Furthermore, the Supervisory
Board as a whole must possess knowledge and experience in the areas of business strategy development
and implementation, personnel planning and management, accounting and financial reporting,
governance/compliance and sustainability issues relevant to adidas, including environmental, social,
governance (ESG) aspects. At least one member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field
of accounting, and at least one further member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field
of auditing. Accounting and auditing also include non-financial reporting and its audit and assurance. The
members of the Supervisory Board as a whole must be familiar with the sporting goods industry.
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/BODIES
Regarding the independence of its members, the Supervisory Board considers the following provisions to
be appropriate: More than half of the Supervisory Board members should be independent within the
meaning of the Code 2022, whereby it is assumed that the independence of employee representatives is
not impaired either by their role as employee representatives or their status as adidas employees. If we
consider shareholder representatives and employee representatives separately, more than half of the
Supervisory Board members in each of these groups should be independent. From the company’s
perspective and following the regulations of the Code 2022, Supervisory Board members are to be
considered independent if they have no personal or business relationship with the company or its
Executive Board that may cause a substantial, and not merely temporary, conflict of interest.
More than two thirds of the shareholder representatives should be free of any potential conflicts of
interest. This applies, in particular, to potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of an
advisory or governing body function among customers, suppliers, lenders, or other third parties. As a rule,
members of the Supervisory Board should not have a governing body or advisory function with any key
competitor and should not have a personal relationship with any key competitor.
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board is committed to a diverse composition in terms of age, gender,
cultural origin, nationality, educational background, professional qualifications, and experience. An
adequate number of the shareholder representatives should have long-standing international experience.
In addition, each Supervisory Board member must ensure that they have sufficient time to properly
perform the tasks associated with the mandate. In general, the age limit for the Supervisory Board should
be 72 years at the time of their appointment. As a rule, the length of membership in the Supervisory Board
should not exceed 15 years or three terms of office.
In the Supervisory Board’s assessment, the Supervisory Board as a whole in its current composition
fulfills the objectives stated and the competency profile. With Bodo Uebber, Chairman of the Audit
Committee, and Thomas Rabe, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, at least two members of the
Supervisory Board have substantial expertise in the fields of accounting or auditing. In addition to Kathrin
Menges, the Supervisory Board member responsible for ESG, Bodo Uebber also possesses specific
expertise and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk
management systems as well as in non-financial reporting and its audit and assurance.
In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, all shareholder representatives qualified as independent in the
year under review. The names of the independent shareholder representatives are set out in the overview
of all Supervisory Board members in this Annual Report. ► SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The Supervisory Board’s election proposals to the Annual General Meeting are always prepared by the
Nomination Committee. They take into account the objectives regarding the Supervisory Board’s
composition resolved upon by the Supervisory Board and are aimed at fulfilling the competency profile
developed by the Supervisory Board for the Board as a whole. The Supervisory Board pays attention to a
balanced composition to ensure that the required know-how is represented on as broad a scale as
possible. Moreover, the Supervisory Board ascertains that each proposed candidate has sufficient time to
perform their mandates.

Board and the expertise of the individual Supervisory Board members are outlined in the following

TASKS OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board on questions relating to the
management of the company. The supervision and advice also include sustainability issues in particular.
The Executive Board regularly, expeditiously and comprehensively reports on the strategy, planning,
business development, on the company’s risk situation, the risk management and the compliance
organization as well as material compliance cases and litigation, and coordinates the corporate strategy
and its implementation with the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board examines and approves the
annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as well as the combined Management
Report of adidas AG and the Group, taking into consideration the auditor’s reports, and resolves upon the
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
proposal of the Executive Board on the appropriation of retained earnings. Additionally, it resolves on the
Supervisory Board’s resolution proposals to be presented to the Annual General Meeting. Moreover, the
Supervisory Board examines the combined non-financial statement for the company and the Group and/or
any separate non-financial reports. Certain business transactions and measures of the Executive Board
with fundamental significance are subject to prior approval by the Supervisory Board or by a Supervisory
Board committee. The respective details are set out in § 9 of the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory
Board of adidas AG. Furthermore, the requirement of prior Supervisory Board approval is stipulated in
some resolutions by the Annual General Meeting.
The Supervisory Board is also responsible for the appointment and dismissal of the Executive Board
members as well as for the allocation of their areas of responsibility. The respective proposals are
prepared by the General Committee. When appointing new Executive Board members, the Supervisory
Board provides for the best possible, diverse and mutually complementary Executive Board composition
for the company and, together with the Executive Board, ensures long-term succession planning. The
Supervisory Board takes a structural approach in its succession planning for the Executive Board. This is
based on multiple planning horizons. Accordingly, the company has established a number of management
groups (Core Leadership Group [CLG], Extended Leadership Group [ELG], and High Potentials). This
ensures a sustainable approach to identifying and evaluating successor candidates for Executive Board
positions, while also accommodating the company’s diversity concept. The Supervisory Board discusses
succession planning on a regular basis.
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board determines the Executive Board compensation system, examines it
regularly and decides on the individual overall compensation of each Executive Board member. The
Supervisory Board, together with the Executive Board, annually prepares a clear and comprehensible
report on the compensation granted and due in the previous financial year in accordance with § 162 AktG.
Further information on Executive Board compensation, the current compensation system, the
compensation report, and the auditor’s report in accordance with § 162 AktG can be found on the
company’s website. ► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/COMPENSATION

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The members of the Supervisory Board are individually responsible for undertaking any necessary training
and professional development measures required for their tasks and are supported by adidas AG in this
regard. The company informs the Supervisory Board regularly about current legislative changes as well as
opportunities for external training and provides the Supervisory Board with relevant specialist literature.
In this regard, the Supervisory Board has also examined in detail the latest developments in corporate
governance, especially the new requirements of the Code 2022 and the sustainability issues relevant to
adidas.
Moreover, the Supervisory Board as well as the Audit Committee, General Committee, and Nomination
Committee regularly assess the efficiency of their work. As the improvement measures for increasing the
efficiency of the Supervisory Board’s work resolved upon in 2020 were deemed to have been implemented
successfully in the 2021 financial year, the Supervisory Board conducted another efficiency examination of
its work in October 2022 and concluded that the Supervisory Board as a whole as well as its respective
committees are efficient, and resolved upon specific measures to further improve the organization of the
Supervisory Board’s work.
The compensation of the Supervisory Board members is set out in the Compensation Report.
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/COMPENSATION
COMMITMENT TO THE PROMOTION OF EQUAL PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN AND MEN IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS
When filling leadership positions in the company, the Executive Board takes diversity into account and
aims for an appropriate participation of women in particular. The Supervisory Board is also convinced that
an increase in the number of women in leadership positions within the company is necessary to ensure
that, in the future, a larger number of suitable female candidates will be available for Executive Board
positions. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board therefore recognize the enormous importance of
the company’s initiatives to foster diversity and inclusion and to promote women to leadership positions.
► SEE OUR PEOPLE
With Amanda Rajkumar joining the Executive Board, the target set by the Supervisory Board of 1/7
respectively 14.29% for the representation of women on the Executive Board with the deadline of
June 30, 2022, had already been fulfilled. At the same time, the requirements set forth in § 76 section 3a
AktG introduced with the Second Leadership Positions Act (Führungspositionengesetz – FüPoG II) are fully
met, which requires that at least one woman and at least one man be appointed as members of the
Executive Board.
In addition, the Executive Board has set targets and deadlines for female representation in the first two
management levels of adidas AG.
As the targets for the first management level and the second management level had already been
exceeded on December 31, 2021, with 38% and 31%, respectively, the Executive Board defined a
percentage share of female representation of 39% for the first management level and 31% for the second
management level. The Executive Board set December 31, 2023, as deadline for achieving these two
targets. As at the balance sheet date, the percentage share of women amounted to 44% for the first
management level and 37% for the second management level. Moreover, the global share of women in
leadership positions amounted to 39%, which means that the target of 39% was met.
In accordance with § 96 section 2 sentence 1 AktG, at least 30% of the members of the Supervisory Board
must be female and at least 30% must be male. As the Supervisory Board had not objected to an overall
fulfillment of the aforementioned quota pursuant to § 96 section 2 sentence 3 AktG, the minimum quota
must be fulfilled by the Supervisory Board overall, with the numbers of male and female members
rounded up or down to full numbers (§ 96 section 2 sentences 2 and 4 AktG). This means that the
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Supervisory Board of adidas AG must be composed of at least five women and five men. These minimum
quotas were achieved. As at December 31, 2022, six of the company’s 16 Supervisory Board mandates
were held by women.
Within the framework of the employee strategy already launched in 2021, the company will continue to
intensify its efforts for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in order to remain an attractive employer in the
future. There will be a particular focus on a long-term approach to equity in leadership positions – both
through hiring and through appropriate succession planning. ► SEE OUR PEOPLE
AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are obligated to disclose any conflicts of
interest to the Supervisory Board without delay. Substantial transactions between the company and
members of the Executive Board or related parties of the Executive Board require Supervisory Board
approval. Contracts between the company and members of the Supervisory Board also require
Supervisory Board approval. The Supervisory Board reports any conflicts of interest, as well as the
handling thereof, to the Annual General Meeting. In the year under review, the members of the Executive
Board and the members of the Supervisory Board did not face any conflicts of interest. A brand
ambassador agreement exists between adidas AG and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. The Supervisory Board is of
the opinion that this does not constitute a conflict of interest. In particular, the brand ambassador
agreement does not represent a material business relationship for either adidas or Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
The Supervisory Board passed a unanimous resolution approving this agreement without the participation
of Jackie Joyner-Kersee. ► SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT

RELEVANT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
Our business activities are aligned with the legal systems of the various countries and markets in which
we operate. We are also aware of our considerable social and environmental responsibility.
We will significantly increase our commitment to sustainability in the years ahead. In addition to the
continued digital transformation of the company, we are working closely with our partners in the global
supply chain to reduce energy consumption and increase the proportion of green energy we use. By 2025,
nine out of every ten adidas articles should be made from more sustainable materials, while the carbon
footprint per product should be reduced by 15% in comparison to baseline year 2017. adidas aims for
climate-neutral operation at its locations by 2025 and to reach complete climate neutrality by 2050.

COMPLIANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT

Control and Risk Management System. As part of our global ‘Fair Play’ concept, the Compliance
Management System establishes the organizational framework for companywide awareness of our
internal rules and guidelines and for the legally compliant conduct of our business. It underscores our

strong commitment to ethical and fair behavior in our own organization and also sets the parameters for
how we deal with others. The principles of our Compliance Management System are set out in the Risk and
Opportunity Report. The risk and opportunity management system ensures risk-aware, opportunity-

competitiveness and sustainable success of adidas. ► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT
TRANSPARENCY AND PROTECTION OF SHAREHOLDERS’ INTERESTS
It is our goal to inform all institutional investors, private shareholders, financial analysts, business
partners, employees, and the interested public about the company’s situation, at the same time and to an
equal extent, through regular, transparent, and up-to-date communication. We publish all essential

view of the uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and to protect the health of our
shareholders, employees, and other participants, the Annual General Meeting was held once again in a
virtual format on May 12, 2022. We were determined to allow our shareholders to participate in the virtual
event as comprehensively as possible within the legal framework and the pandemic-related restrictions.
As in previous years, coverage of the Annual General Meeting was available to adidas AG shareholders via
our shareholder portal and to the general public via our website. The Executive Board and Supervisory
Board provided detailed answers to pre-submitted questions. The content of the CEO’s speech was
published prior to the Annual General Meeting. Finally, in 2022 as well, it was possible to share video
messages with all adidas shareholders via the shareholder portal, which were also shown during the
Annual General Meeting. In addition, for the first time, the shareholders of adidas AG had the opportunity
to ask follow-up questions relating to questions submitted in advance and answered by the Executive
Board or the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. The measures undertaken were intended to align our
shareholders’ justified interests in a broadest possible participation in the Annual General Meeting on the
one side with the company’s responsibility to protect the health of all participants on the other.

OUR SHARE
Global stock markets were volatile in 2022 and ended the year significantly below prior-year levels. The
DAX and the EURO STOXX 50 decreased by 12% each, while the MSCI World Textiles, Apparel and Luxury
Goods Index was down 24% as a result of severe macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions.
In this generally negative market environment, the adidas AG share underperformed the broader stock
market and ended 2022 with a decrease of almost 50% compared to the prior year.
GLOBAL STOCK MARKETS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AT THE END OF 2022
After heightened volatility throughout the year, global stock markets were significantly lower at the end of
2022 compared to 2021. The war in Ukraine and the continued negative impact of the covid-19 pandemic as
well as their economic consequences severely impacted investor sentiment. Global central banks
addressing multi-year high inflation levels with interest rate hikes also weighed on financial markets.
Against this negative backdrop, the DAX and the EURO STOXX 50 lost 12% each in 2022, while the MSCI
World Textiles, Apparel and Luxury Goods Index decreased by 24%. In addition to general market
pressure, the adidas AG share underperformed the broader stock market and ended 2022 with a decrease
of almost 50% compared to the prior year. Apart from severe macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical
tensions, a further deterioration of traffic trends in Greater China, significant inventory build-up also in
major Western markets, the incurrence of several one-off costs as well as the negative impact from the
termination of the Yeezy partnership weighed on the development of the adidas AG share.
LEVEL 1 ADR UNDERPERFORMS COMMON STOCK
Our Level 1 ADR closed 2022 at US $ 67.74, representing a decrease of 53% versus the prior year level
(2021: US $ 144.00). The more pronounced decrease of the Level 1 ADR price compared to the ordinary
share price was due to the valuation of the US dollar versus the euro in 2022. The number of Level 1 ADRs
outstanding decreased to 9.5 million at year-end 2022 compared to 10.9 million at the end of 2021. The
average daily trading volume increased to around 172,000 ADRs in 2022 (2021: around 65,000). Further

ADIDAS RETURNS MORE THAN € 3,100 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS IN 2022
In December 2021, adidas had introduced its latest multi-year share buyback program. The first tranche of
this program launched on January 10, 2022 and was completed on February 22, 2022. During that period,
the company bought back 4,156,558 shares for a total amount of € 1,000 million. In addition to the
company’s regular buyback activities and against the background of the formal closing of the Reebok
divestiture on February 28, 2022, adidas launched a second share buyback program to return the cash
proceeds from the Reebok divestiture to its shareholders. As a result, between March 14 and October 10,
2022, adidas bought back 8,978,138 shares for a total consideration of € 1,500 million. Taking into account
both share buybacks, adidas bought back 13,134,696 shares for a total amount of € 2,500 million in 2022.
Including the dividend payment of € 610 million in May 2022, the company returned more than
€ 3,100 million to its shareholders in 2022. After the completion of both share buybacks in 2022, adidas
decided to cancel a total of 12,100,000 treasury shares, reducing the company’s share count and stock
capital accordingly.
STRONG INTERNATIONAL INVESTOR BASE
Based on our share register, the adidas AG currently has more than 169,000 shareholders (2021: more
than 125,000). The higher number of shareholders was mainly driven by an increase in the number of
German retail investors. In our latest ownership analysis conducted in December 2022, we identified
almost 100% of our shares outstanding. Institutional investors represent the largest investor group,
holding 80% of shares outstanding (2021: 81%). Private investors and undisclosed holdings account for
19% (2021: 19%). Lastly, adidas AG currently holds 0.8% of the company’s shares as treasury shares
(2021: 0.3%). This increase is mainly driven by our share buyback activities.

STRATEGY
With sport playing an increasingly important role in more and more people’s lives, both on and off the
field of play, we operate in a highly attractive industry. Based on the authenticity of the adidas brand and
our constant efforts to understand our consumers’ needs, we aim at capitalizing on the acceleration of
favorable long-term structural trends by pushing the boundaries of products, experiences, and
services.
Since the creation and launch of our ‘Own the Game’ strategy, the economic and political environment we
operate in has significantly changed. Macroeconomic challenges as well as geopolitical tensions have had
an adverse impact on our business, our consumers, and business partners. Paving the way for a restart,
Bjørn Gulden joined adidas as new CEO in January 2023. In this context, we are currently conducting a
thorough strategic review, which also includes the financial ambition for 2025. We will provide an update
on the outcome of this review in the course of the second half of 2023 and, in the meantime, continue to
diligently execute our functional priorities.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
GLOBAL BRANDS
Global Brands oversees the innovation, design, development, and marketing of the company’s sports
and lifestyle offerings. By constantly developing desirable products and providing inspiring
experiences, the function strives to build a strong image as well as trust and loyalty with consumers to
capitalize on growth opportunities in the sporting goods industry.
THE ADIDAS BRAND
The adidas brand has a long history and deep-rooted connection with sport. We believe that through sport,
we have the power to change lives. This is our purpose, and we live it every day by expanding the limits of
human possibilities, including and uniting people in sport and creating a more sustainable world. For us to
continue to transcend cultures and remain one of the most recognized and iconic brands, on and off the
field of play, we need to maintain credibility. This means delivering groundbreaking innovations in sports,
as well as cutting-edge fashion items that are culturally relevant. We are continuously sharpening our
edges of adidas ‘Performance’ and ‘Lifestyle’ and therefore have introduced our new ‘Sportswear’
proposition as a part of adidas’ updated brand architecture.
For over 70 years, we have innovated for sports. The performance logo therefore represents the product
built for our athletes, helping them to perform at their best inside the lines of the playing field.
‘Performance’ products are built from sport and worn for sport. On the other hand, adidas Originals caters
to lifestyle in a futuristic way and is motivated by the collective memory of sports. adidas Originals
represents brand classics and new visionary designs. The brand with the iconic Trefoil celebrates products
that connect to culture, leveraging our archive, and expanding into new premium and luxury segments.
Lastly, our newest addition ‘Sportswear,’ is built for everyone. It is born from sport and worn for style.
Sportswear provides everyday products that redefine comfort, versatility, and aesthetics, with the first
collection launched in 2022.
FRANCHISES AS LIGHTHOUSES FOR OUR BRAND
We believe that brand perception is largely influenced by footwear and has the potential to drive consumer
desire among product categories, a lever for growing market share. An archive that is unrivaled in the
industry, cutting-edge technological breakthroughs, and access to fundamental athlete insights provide
plenty of opportunities to create newness in footwear and push the industry boundaries. Franchises are
one of our strategic priorities with the ambition to focus and reduce the number of footwear models
overall. Simply put, franchises are our most iconic symbols of sport and culture acting as lighthouses for
our brand. They represent the very best of adidas, influencing not only sport but also culture, reimagining
the notions of performance and lifestyle footwear while contributing to building our brand equity. Through
uncompromised functionality, iconic design markers, and unique stories they are clearly targeted toward
the consumer and have the potential to be iterated over time to preserve desirability. Their life cycles are
also diligently managed to maintain consumer relevance and commercial longevity. Key footwear
franchises for the adidas brand include, among others, Superstar, Stan Smith, Samba, Ultraboost, and
NMD. In 2022, key footwear franchises represented almost 33% of the brands footwear business. On the
apparel side, adidas manages a portfolio of franchises including the Tiro Pant, MyShelter Jacket, and the
Z.N.E. Hoodie.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
BRAND DESIRABILITY FUELED BY INNOVATION AND COLLABORATIONS
Innovation is a key enabler for success in our industry. We are applying an innovative mindset to all
aspects of our business – from creation to consumer, in order to create tangible proof points of our
credibility, elevate experiences, and push the boundaries in sustainability. In addition to leveraging iconic
product franchises, creating innovative concepts to meet the needs of athletes and consumers is a
prerequisite to strengthening our market position and a premise to being the best sports brand in the
world. We remain highly committed to maintaining a full and innovative concept pipeline to drive our
credibility in performance and achieve what´s best for the athlete. We aim to bring new groundbreaking
technologies and processes to life, investing in sustainability, and exploring all the possibilities of
digitalization. Our key technology platforms Boost, Lightstrike, Repetitor, 4D, and Strung are proof points
for our broader innovation approach. We bring functionality and meaning together, where we work on
nothing but experientially focused examples of elevated human performance. We invest in manufacturing
techniques and new technologies aiming to address deeply understood athlete challenges.
We also collaborate with athletes and consumers, universities, and innovative companies, as well as
national and international governments and research organizations. We are enhancing our innovative
collaboration with both our established partners such as BASF and Carbon, while simultaneously seeking
out new partnership opportunities with brands sharing our sustainability mission, such as Infinited Fiber
Company.
COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIONS
We believe developing industry-leading technologies, materials, and consumer experiences is only one
aspect of being an innovative leader. Equally important is the successful commercialization of those
innovative concepts.
We have a long heritage of innovation and strive to provide athletes with the best by creating high-
performance, competitive products. In 2022, we continued to serve consumers with innovative
technologies, materials and sustainable concepts built into our products:
− ‘Bra Revolution’: Sports bras are among the most essential workout pieces, but many women aren’t
wearing the right size. That is why we have redesigned our entire bra line with 43 new styles in 72 sizes
to fit more bodies and workouts than ever before. In February 2022, we launched the ‘Bra Revolution’
campaign which was the biggest campaign activation for Training in 2022. Using the latest material and
design innovations, the new collection features training bras, studio bras, everyday bras, and running
bras.
− Adizero Prime x Strung: Our first ever Adizero running shoe with a ’Strung’ upper. Strung is a textile
innovation that transforms athlete data into a dynamic material tuned to the athlete's needs. It makes
it possible to map and program different fiber properties thread by thread. With a flexible and a
lightweight seamless cocoon feel around the foot, Strung helps optimize comfort and supports the
athlete on long distance runs. The Strung upper is fused to a Prime X outsole packed with carbon
EnergyRODS and three layers of Lightstrike Pro for a responsive run.
− 4DFWD 2: The shoe’s industry-first bowtie-shaped lattice midsole transforms vertical pressure into a
horizontal force, designed to move runners in one direction only: forward. With every stride, the new
adidas 4DFWD 2 midsole compresses forward, reducing braking forces and transforming the impact
energy into forward motion. The result is a smooth ride with less stop-and-go pounding on the
pavement. With the 4DFWD 2, we have introduced a new Continental outsole that provides extra grip
for a confident run in any weather condition. We also introduced an all-new Primeknit+ and engineered
mesh upper construction for an extra supportive and snug fit. Complemented by a new integrated heel
counter, Primeknit+ offers a sock-like fit, while areas of engineered mesh provide support exactly
where runners need it most. Made with a series of recycled materials, the upper features at least 50%
recycled content.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
− Adizero Adios Pro 3: The newest addition to the iconic Adizero range, the Adizero Adios Pro 3 is a true
testament to the brand’s continued dedication to elevating the performance of runners by helping them
push the boundaries of what is possible. Launching in two colorways, the Adizero Adios Pro 3 features
EnergyRODS 2.0 embedded in the midsole that run parallel to the metatarsals, Lightstrike Pro foam
that provides cushioning and energy return to support runners, a new race-ready upper, and a
Continental rubber outsole with traction to help take corners at a fast pace. In addition, the product is
made in part with a series of recycled materials. In 2022, half of the twelve major marathons worldwide
were won by athletes wearing Adizero.
− ‘Al Rihla' – official match ball of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022: ‘Al Rihla' means ‘the journey’ in
Arabic and was inspired by the architecture, iconic boats, and flag of Qatar. The ball is designed to
support the highest game speeds as it travels faster in flight than any other World Cup ball. Designed
from the inside out using data from rigorous testing in adidas labs, wind tunnels, and on the field, Al
Rihla offers the highest level of accuracy and reliability on the field of play, in part due to its new panel
shape and surface textures. Additionally, 1% of all ball net sales in Football will be donated to the
Common Goal movement to help drive social change and support grassroots football communities
worldwide.
− adidas by Stella McCartney – ‘Made To Be Remade’ capsule: The ‘Made To Be Remade’ program is
adidas’ first approach to delivering the potential of circular fashion, following the launch of its
Futurecraft.Loop shoe in 2019 – an early prototype of circular footwear. The adidas by Stella McCartney
garment, launched in 2022, is the latest milestone demonstrating the successful implementation of the
entire value chain to produce a commercial end-of-life garment. Joining forces with leading names
and innovators in the fashion industry to create, test, and innovate, the adidas by Stella McCartney
tracksuit forms the pinnacle expression of the brand’s pilot circularity program ‘Made To Be Remade,’
a take-back program that allows consumers to wear down products and then return them by scanning
a QR code on the product for it to be remade.
Beyond innovative technologies, sustainable concepts and materials, key products, and collaborations of
the 2022 business year include:
− adidas x Gucci: Originally debuting on the ‘Exquisite Gucci’ runway, the first adidas x Gucci collection
dropped in June 2022 in select Gucci stores, dedicated pop-up stores and digital channels such as the
adidas Confirmed app. The collection expands on the creative concept founded on an affinity for the
three stripes. Reflecting a shared commitment to innovation, progress, sustainability goals, and
collective action, the collection features multiple pieces crafted with future-conscious material
fabrications including polyester, cotton, and viscose.
− adidas NFT wearable collection: adidas Originals unveiled a limited collection of blockchain-based
virtual wearables, released as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The collection represented the brand’s first
NFT collection of wearables, which is a new, interoperable product category adidas calls ‘Virtual Gear.’
The launch of this 16-piece collection accelerates adidas Originals’ drive towards strengthening its
community-based, member-first, and open metaverse strategy. Designed to be worn by virtual avatars,
and accessible through a Profile Picture (PFP) dressing tool, every piece within the NFT offering is
interoperable with other identity-based projects and worlds. This means that the adidas collection is
able to respond and adapt to the emerging metaverse environments, so that the ‘Virtual Gear’ is ready
for all dimensions of Web3.
− adidas x Calm: On World Mental Health Day, adidas announced a new partnership with ‘Calm,’ the
world’s leading mental health platform. The two brands are uniting with the ambition of progressing
sports performance by supporting mental well-being. The partnership will kick off as a pilot in the UK
and US, with adiClub members able to redeem points to unlock Calm Premium services. There will

and aligned to supporting sports performance. The initial collaboration will be based on the concept of
‘Rest. Restore. Perform.’ with the practice of mindfulness and mental fitness helping to strengthen

how athletes of all levels perform. In the longer term, the aim is to explore a range of co-created,
unique, and experience-based benefits for adiClub members, as well as a broader integration of the
two brands’ digital ecosystems.
− adidas x Soul Cap: adidas announces its first swim cap made in partnership with London-based start-
up ’Soul Cap.’ This collaboration – which follows last summer’s launch of adidas’ full-coverage and
inclusive sizing swimwear ranges – is part of the brand’s ongoing commitment to make water sports
more accessible. adidas and Soul Cap share the belief that sports belongs to everyone and
participation is possible for everyone. By offering a swimwear product suitable for a range of
hairstyles, the brands are joining efforts on their quest to increase access and inclusivity to swimming.
IMPACTFUL AND EFFECTIVE MARKETING INVESTMENTS
An additional important building block of creating brand desirability and winning the consumer are our
marketing investments. adidas is focused on creating inspirational and innovative concepts that drive
consumer advocacy, build brand equity, and drive demand for our products. The company historically
spends almost half of its marketing investment on partners, with the remainder spent on brand marketing
activities such as digital, advertising, point-of-sale, and grassroots activations. In addition, the company
continues its efforts to further consolidate and focus resources to create powerful brand statements
overarching several categories under one narrative, amplified and orchestrated via an overarching media
strategy with clear roles for the different activation levels of story and content. The ambition is to have a
fully connected marketing funnel, from grabbing consumer attention at the top to driving consideration in
the middle of the funnel when consumers are in the buying phase down to conversion at the point of sale
at the bottom of the funnel. To holistically address the entire marketing funnel, adidas is active in four
dimensions:
− Brand campaigns: The highest expression of the brand which drives visibility, desire, and commercial
demand by reinforcing our brand attitude with bold, relevant, and recent (consumer-centric)
storytelling
− Brand moments: Deliver a strong brand point of view through targeted sport and culture moments to
amplify brand attitude and reinforce our purpose
− Category activation: Strengthen sport and culture credibility by sharpening label and category
propositions through product story, sport/culture moments, partner activation, hype drops, and
commercial activation
− Commercial conversion: Drive conversion and consistency at the point-of-sale (in-store and online) to
support cross-category commercial partnerships and ‘evergreen’ key items through delivery of
seasonal, modular toolkits
From building awareness and brand heat all the way down to deliberate point-of-sale experiences, the
2022 brand marketing plan showcased a variety of activations at all levels of the marketing funnel:
− ‘I’mPossible’: In the first quarter of 2022, adidas continued its ‘Impossible is Nothing’ story with the
announcement of its biggest ever commitment to women: ‘I’mPossible.’ Driven by its company purpose
‘Through sport, we have the power to change lives,’ the brand released a fully integrated campaign to
launch major new women-focused product innovations, including the most inclusive bra range to date,
alongside enhanced support for established and emerging athletes, and new grassroots programs. The
campaign spotlighted a global collective of inspiring women who are breaking down barriers in sport
and beyond. In addition to the new collection of sports bras, the campaign also featured Ultraboost 22,
a running shoe built to address differences between male and female instep height, heel anatomy and
gait cycle trend.
− Run for the Oceans (‘RFTO’): Under the umbrella of ‘Together, impossible is nothing,’ we continued to
elevate our purpose to help end plastic waste with the fifth edition of the ‘Run for the Oceans’ (RFTO) in
May 2022. Compared to previous years, RFTO 2022 included more sports activities such as tennis,
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
football, and wheelchair movement. The goal was to encourage global sporting communities and
motivate nine million participants to collect 250 million active minutes by June 8, 2022, World Oceans
Day. For every ten minutes of movement, adidas together with Parley, pledged to cleaning up the
equivalent weight of one plastic bottle – up to a maximum of 250,000 kg.
− X-Speedportal: A highlight in summer was the launch of the new X-Speedportal football boot, the
latest innovation from the adidas’ X-Speed boot franchise designed for players to enjoy acceleration
while providing grip for movement in any direction. For the marketing campaign, adidas teamed up
with Emmy award-winning animated comedy series ‘Rick and Morty.’ The campaign launched with a
90-second film featuring football players Mohamed Salah and Vivianne Miedema, as well as Rick and
Morty. The film drove great awareness across all our channels – social, PR, digital, and retail. Among
others, football clubs Arsenal London and Manchester United supported the campaign on social
channels.
− Members Week: Building on the success of ‘Members Week 2021,’ we held this week-long digital
festival twice in 2022 to celebrate the best of adidas, bringing some of the biggest product
collaborations to consumers. During Members Week in April, many raffle opportunities were offered to
members to win exclusive products and experiences. Items included, among others, a personalized
workout plan from our adidas Runners coaches across the world or the chance to win the official World
Cup match ball. The Members Week in October was kicked off with the Black Panther product pack
drop exclusively for members in collaboration with Disney, as well as the Embroidery pack allowing
members to express their style with a new adidas classic apparel collection and the launch of the
Authentic Balance product pack celebrating training moments. Synced with Members Week, the event
was extended to the Confirmed app to give the sneakerheads and streetwear community a chance to
redeem points to access a Golden Ticket to secure their next hype drop. Members were eligible to win
tickets to the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, as well as many other relevant local experiences driven by the
markets.
− Impossible is Nothing: Rounding up 2022 with the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 set the stage for another
chapter of ‘Impossible is Nothing,’ where adidas launched a month-long campaign, bringing its iconic
brand partners together for a one-of-a-kind ‘family reunion.’ The campaign featured Lionel Messi,
Karim Benzema, Achraf Hakimi, Son Heung-Min, Jude Bellingham, Pedro ‘Pedri’ González López,
Serge Gnabry as well as musician Stormzy. adidas was the most talked about brand at the World Cup
by reaching over one million social conversations. The Impossible is Nothing World Cup brand
campaign was the most watched adidas campaign of all time reaching 2.3 billion video views overall.
Furthermore, Lionel Messi’s post after the World Cup final of him lifting the trophy and wearing the
home jersey of Argentina became the most-liked Instagram content piece of all time.
In terms of partners and athletes, while being conscious of overall marketing spend, we will continue to
bring our products to the biggest stages in the world through:
− Events with global reach: FIFA World Cup (men’s and women’s), UEFA Champions League (men’s and
women’s), as well as new partnerships with race organizer ‘Atlanta Track Club,’ and the Brooklyn,
Cape Town, and Rio Marathons. Along with the world-renowned Boston, Mexico City, and Berlin
Marathons, these events provide an important link to running consumers.
− High-profile teams: National association football teams of Argentina, Belgium, Colombia, Germany,
Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, and Spain, as well as top football clubs such as Arsenal London, F.C.
Bayern Munich, Flamengo Rio de Janeiro, Juventus Turin, Manchester United and Real Madrid, the
New Zealand All Blacks in rugby, national Olympic associations such as the British Olympic Association
and German Olympic Sports Confederation, as well as American universities such as the University of
Miami, Arizona State University, University of Washington, and Texas A&M University.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
GLOBAL SALES
Our Global Sales function drives the commercial performance of the company by converting brand
desire into profitable and sustained business growth. We aim to deliver the best shopping experience
within the sporting goods industry across all consumer touchpoints. To transform the marketplace, we
are actively shaping and accelerating the growth of our integrated trade network. Our goal is to
establish scalable business solutions that deliver premium experiences, thereby meeting and
surpassing consumer expectations with an integrated brand offering.
⌐ While 2022 saw a reduction in distribution points due to a challenging market environment and
heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, we continued to leverage a consistent global framework with
close to 2,000 own retail stores and our own e-commerce channel, the latter being our single biggest
retail presence and available in 65 countries. ¬
CHALLENGING MARKET ENVIRONMENT
The challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions in 2022 continued to impact our business, with
some markets more affected than others. In October 2022, we decided to initiate the process of the
winding down of our business operations in Russia. Continued and widespread covid-19 restrictions, as
well as significant inventory takebacks in Greater China, also had a negative impact on our sales
development.
To meet these challenges, we moved closer to our Alliance Accounts to continue to drive growth in all
areas where this is feasible, and digitalization remained central to our future-proofing efforts. Retail
regained momentum in the course of the year as consumers returned to physical stores. We evolved the
brand experience by upgrading existing stores to the latest concepts and opening new brand centers in
several markets. We continued to grow e-commerce, providing premium, connected, and personalized
shopping experiences through exclusive products and engaging member offerings.
2022 CHANNEL MIX
⌐ Wholesale remained our largest channel accounting for 61% of total net sales in 2022 (2021: 62%). The
share of DTC business, consisting of own retail and e-commerce sales, was 39% in 2022 (2021: 38%). Our
adiClub membership program has reached 303 million members across around 50 countries, enabling us
to build direct relationships with our consumers. ¬
NET SALES BY CHANNEL
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
WHOLESALE
Our main objective in Wholesale is to win market share in critical consumer touchpoints on- and offline,
especially in key trade zones and high streets. We continued to proactively manage our orderbook to make
stock accessible to all channels and customers, both on- and offline. In 2022, we continued to invest in
digital tools to future-proof our Wholesale business. Our industry-leading digital sell-in tool ‘Digital
Showroom,’ for example, enables customers to see our complete product rollout, including individual
product stories, in a single environment. In 2022, the channel delivered double-digit top-line growth in
EMEA, North America, and Latin America. The Alliance Accounts, our key partners, are growing faster
than the overall channel. Leveraging our strong cross-functional partnerships with Alliance Accounts in
sales and activation, we achieved considerable success in landing our products, services, and stories. This
is critical to ensure a holistic consumer journey.
We continued to focus on and invest in our digital capability to team up with our accounts and win online
together. This allowed us to deliver an enhanced and consistent shopping experience in digital wholesale
by integrating our product images and descriptions into customer systems to power their website and app
experiences. Our ‘Partner Program’ brings us one step closer to sharing our product and inventory data
with strategic partners and their consumer-facing digital platforms. Despite severe headwinds in the
online marketplace in 2022, our Partner Program grew at a mid-single-digit rate compared to 2021. We
also rolled out our Partner Program in Emerging Markets, South Korea, and Greece.
E-COMMERCE
In e-commerce, we showcased our brand differentiators such as exclusive products and engaging
member experiences. Our own e-commerce grew by 10% in 2022 to € 4,617 million (2021:
€ 4,193 million)13 reflecting 4% currency-neutral growth, as we leveraged the launch of new products
across our key categories as well as from major sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022
and ‘Run for the Oceans,’ which extended our reach to Gen Z. We were also the first brand in our industry
to enable membership integration on Instagram.
We continued the work toward premium, connected, and personalized shopping experiences that enable
direct relationships with our consumers. In addition to our adidas e-commerce platform, which is available
in 65 countries, our adidas app strategy continued to fuel our mobile and member focus and has reached
close to 50 countries across all major markets, achieving a significant share of business in the adidas
digital ecosystem. The adidas app provides a premium experience with immersive storytelling,
personalized content, frictionless checkout, seamless order tracking, and access to our membership
program, which was relaunched as ‘adiClub’ in 2022 with an updated visual identity. Members collect
points from interactions across all our touchpoints (.com, apps, retail stores), enabling them to climb
levels and unlock rewards, including personalized experiences. In 2022, we also launched a new
redemption feature in seven countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Mexico, the UK and the US)
and introduced six ways for members to spend their collected points (‘Money-can’t-buy’ products, raffles,
vouchers, partner offers, Golden Tickets, and donations).
In addition, our sports apps amplify our purpose that, ‘Through sport, we have the power to change lives,’
and sports engagement is driving increased sales and membership. For example, in 2022, we set new
participation records in engagement activities such as ‘Run for the Oceans,’ which reached 6.7 million
participants through our sports apps and connected partners, with 1.3 million being newly acquired
members. The success of our membership program is visible in key metrics, such as a consumer lifetime
value that is significantly higher compared to non-members.
13 E-commerce net sales reported in the previous year’s annual report amounted to € 3,942 million. Due to a change in the reporting logic, certain
transactions, e.g., Click & Collect or ship-from-store transactions, are now reported in the e-commerce channel and no longer in own retail. ‘Endless aisle’
transactions, on the other hand, are now reported in own retail and no longer in the e-commerce channel.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
As our latest and most premium touchpoint for sneakerheads and style, the ‘Confirmed’ app continues to
unlock commercial opportunities in digital and generate more buzz, energy, and consumer engagement
through new collaborations with high fashion brands such as Gucci, Prada, and Balenciaga. In 2022, we
expanded the app to include Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea, bringing our most coveted and
premium products to adidas consumers.
RETAIL
Our close to 2,000 own retail stores allow our consumers to directly interact with our brand, product, and
teams, and to touch and try our products, feel inspired by our stories, and experience what we stand for as
a brand. Through premium experiences and the human connection with our teams and communities, we
aim to build brand loyalty and increase consumer lifetime value. With our fleet of halo stores (including
flagship stores and brand centers) focusing on premium experiences, core stores with a more commercial
focus, and factory outlet stores for the value-seeking consumer, we provide an environment to satisfy a
wide variety of our consumers’ needs when shopping for our product and connecting with the essence of
our brand.
In 2022, the total number of stores decreased from almost 2,200 in 2021 to close to 2,000 in 2022, mainly
driven by our decision to initiate the winding down of our operations in Russia.
Halo stores are at the top of our concept store fleet and remained a priority in ‘Key Cities.’ In 2022, we
continued to elevate our Key Cities through additional flagship stores that drive our focus on digitalization,
personalization, and a seamless premium consumer experience across all touchpoints. We upgraded
selected stores to the latest store design concepts and opened new brand centers across several markets
to improve brand image and commerciality. In Mexico City, we opened two new stores: one is the largest in
Latin America, and the other includes an adidas Running Center. We also opened a new brand center in
Warsaw, now the largest in Eastern Europe, with spaces for the adidas Runners Warsaw community as
well as artists and sustainability education for children. The new brand center in Rome has 28 digital
touchpoints and immersive dressing rooms with changeable backgrounds for a truly digital consumer
experience. Continuing the success of the ‘Home of Sport’ store design concept launched in 2021, we
opened a new store in Battersea, London, focusing on local consumer groups and promoting an active
lifestyle through hosted fitness sessions.

INDONESIA REMAINS LARGEST FOOTWEAR SOURCING COUNTRY
⌐ Indonesia represented our largest sourcing country in 2022 with 34% of the total volume (2021: 36%),
followed by Vietnam with 32% (2021: 30%) and China with 16% (2021: 15%). Overall, 97% of our total 2022
footwear volume was produced in Asia (2021: 96%). In 2022, our footwear manufacturing partners
produced approximately 419 million pairs of shoes (2021: 340 million pairs). Our largest footwear factory
produced approximately 7% of the footwear sourcing volume (2021: 8%).
CAMBODIA REMAINS LARGEST SOURCE COUNTRY FOR APPAREL
In 2022, we sourced 91% of the total apparel volume from Asia (2021: 91%). Cambodia was the largest
sourcing country, representing 22% of the produced volume (2021: 21%), followed by Vietnam with 17%
(2021: 15%) and China with 17% (2021: 20%). In total, our manufacturing partners produced approximately
482 million units of apparel in 2022 (2021: 482 million units). The largest apparel factory produced
approximately 9% of this apparel volume (2021: 11%). Overall, apparel production remains more
fragmented than footwear.
CHINA REMAINS MAIN SOURCE COUNTRY FOR ACCESSORIES AND GEAR
In 2022, 72% of our accessories and gear, such as balls and bags, were produced in Asia (2021: 69%).

AGILE AND EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION CENTER NETWORK
By following a clear strategic framework, we enhanced our distribution center landscape in 2022 through
process automation, system upgrades, and distribution center capacity expansion. These enhancements
helped us to improve e-commerce service levels and provide more delivery choices with an overall
broader product availability.
Overall, our global distribution network consists of 66 distribution centers, enabling us to service our
global demand efficiently and effectively. We operate distribution centers in all our markets, with
29 distribution centers in EMEA, eleven in Greater China, twelve in Asia-Pacific, seven in North America,
and seven in Latin America. In view of an above-average dynamic economic environment, the end of 2022
was characterized by close monitoring of consumer behavior and adjusting the size of the network to
changing demand.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
ADIDAS VS. PARTNER-OWNED AND -OPERATED DISTRIBUTION CENTERS PER REGION
Of the 66 distribution centers that make our global network, 23 are owned and operated by adidas, while
43 are owned and operated by logistics partners, allowing for the operational flexibility and agility to best
service our customers and consumers.
To enable a broader range of products to be available at point of sale, 32 of our distribution centers are set
up to serve all our channels. The other 34 have a channel- or service-specific set-up, in line with the needs
and developments of the different markets. This includes three facilities where adidas is testing a
dedicated returns concept to enhance consumer experience and increase the efficiency of the overall
network. This diverse combination of distribution centers allows us to be agile and efficient in distributing
our products to our customers and consumers across the globe.
ON-TIME IN-FULL DELIVERY TO OUR CONSUMERS
Global Operations strives to develop, produce, source, and distribute ordered articles on time and in full.
Therefore, we track two KPIs: ‘On-Time Available’ (‘OTA’) and ‘On-Time In-Full’ (‘OTIF’). OTA measures on-
time-available products at the distribution center for both our wholesale customers and our own retail
stores. OTIF represents the in-full delivery of our products by the request date to our own retail stores
only.
During the first half of the year, we continued to experience external disruptions including covid-19-
related factory shutdowns in Asia, container shortages, port congestions, and carrier disruptions which
impacted our ability to provide the highest product availability in our distribution centers. From the third
quarter onward, the ongoing supply chain disruptions and slowing consumer demand led to an increase in
excess inventory that exceeded the storage capacities of our distribution centers. Despite these
challenges, mitigating actions such as leveling out production periods, expediting factory to port flows, and
selectively prioritizing airfreight resulted in OTA KPI improvement to pre-crisis levels in the fourth
quarter. In 2022, 82% of adidas products were available on time (2021: 87%) and in the last quarter, the
figure was 87%, which means we achieved our target for the full year.
Despite the availability challenges, through diligent focus on operational excellence across systems,
outbound transportation, and distribution centers, we ensured stable delivery performance throughout the
year for our own retail stores against the request dates. In 2022, adidas delivered 83% of its adidas brand
products on time and in full (2021: 83%), continuing the journey toward the 2025 OTIF ambition of 90%.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
OUR PEOPLE
⌐ We believe that our people are the key to the company’s success. Their performance, well-being, and
personal development have a significant impact on brand desire, consumer satisfaction, and, ultimately,
our financial performance. Our people strategy comprises three key pillars: Leadership, Betterment,
and Performance, all underpinned by ‘Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion’ (‘DEI’). ¬
⌐ These pillars seek to focus our efforts on people and culture through:
− embedding DEI even further into our culture,
− attracting key talent,
− building role model leaders that empower people,
− creating a premier employee experience,
− instilling a mindset of continuous learning,
− recognizing and rewarding both individual and team performance. ¬
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/EMPLOYEES
⌐ Our goal is to develop a culture that values the experience, well-being, and performance of our
employees. To support this, we introduced our adidas values in 2022: Courage, Ownership, and Innovation,
as well as Team Play, Respect, and Integrity. Throughout the year, we focused on implementing and
embedding these values across our people policies and processes, including the way we hire, promote,
and evaluate performance. To support the global launch, we took a cascade leadership development
approach and upskilled nearly 300 of our executive leaders plus an additional 1,957 people leaders. These
leaders are now going through the ‘Living Our Values Team Workout’ development session together with
their teams. The training is offered in 21 languages globally. ¬
EMBEDDING DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION INTO OUR CULTURE
⌐ We strongly believe that embedding ‘Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion’ into our culture gives us a real
competitive edge and we embrace it as we work to be the best sports brand in the world. By creating a
level playing field for everyone, every individual has an equal opportunity to achieve betterment, maximize
their leadership potential and unleash high performance. By recruiting talent and developing our people to
reflect the rich diversity of our consumers and communities, we foster a culture of inclusion where we
value and leverage differences to engage our employees and connect with our consumers.
In 2022, we launched a new DEI strategy to ‘Create an Equal Playing Field for All,’ based on three key
pillars: People, Culture, and Accountability. The strategy was informed by adidas’ first anonymous and
voluntary diversity dimensions survey on four key dimensions of diversity (Gender, LGBTQ+, Race &
Ethnicity, and Disability). The survey participation of 42% of employees exceeded the benchmarks for a
survey of this type. We integrated the launch of the strategy into our multi-market ‘Global Week of
Inclusion’ in October 2022, during which we held multiple panel discussions and learning webinars.
Various elements of diversity were addressed during this week, including cognitive diversity, ageism,
disability, and mental health.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
To support our DEI strategy and initiatives, we are continuing to progress on our aspirations and
commitments:
Women in leadership: As part of our people strategy, adidas has established a measurable,
aspirational goal to help us realize our DEI ambitions. We are committed to increasing female
─
representation in management positions (Director level and above) globally to more than 40% by 2025.
Having achieved our target of 39% in 2022 (2021: 37%) reflects our commitment to equity as well as
our consumer focus, where women are a priority. Moreover, for the Executive Board and the first two
levels below, adidas has clear statutory targets regarding female representation. ¬ ► SEE DECLARATION ON
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Women in management positions

⌐ Global racial equity: Our new DEI strategy aspires to global racial equity through the broadening of
our data collection and talent initiatives to identify and support high-performing talent from under-
─
represented and marginalized groups. We commit to promoting inclusivity across all diversity
dimensions and across different intersectionalities.
‘Employee Resource Groups’ (‘ERGs’): Throughout the company, we continue to support and grow our
ERGs. These are employee-led networks that give employees with differing backgrounds and
─
perspectives communities of belonging and togetherness. We have more than 30 ERGs around the
globe, as well as Diversity Ambassador teams that focus on diversity dimensions, such as ethnicity,
gender, LGBTQ+, experienced generation, faith, disability, and mental health. Participation in these
groups is voluntary and inclusive to all employees. In 2022, an ERG task force was formed to create a
new operating model, structure, and guideline to reward, recognize, and develop contributing
employees.
United Against Racism: adidas implemented United Against Racism in June 2020 to support the social
justice movement and to promote racial equity within our US business and communities. This initiative
─
involves a multi-factored level of commitment across hiring, talent development, and community
engagement with the goal of creating lasting change. The commitments include, among others, an
investment of $ 120 million in the US toward ending racism and supporting Black communities through
to 2025 as well as funding for 50 university scholarships in the US each year for Black and LatinX
students. We also set new targets for increased representation of Black and LatinX people within our
US workforce, aiming to fill at least 30% of all new positions in the US with Black and LatinX people by
2025. With 23% in 2022, we are well on track to meet our goal.
DEI Executive Council: Our DEI Executive Council, made up of a diverse group across the organization,
including all members of the Management Board and leaders from each market, has continued its
─
work in 2022 to increase accountability on global DEI initiatives and to drive the execution of our DEI
strategy. Within their individual functions and markets, Council members have committed to identifying
and removing cross-functional and market-based barriers. In this way, the values of adidas are
anchored and exemplified at management level. The termination of the Yeezy partnership in October
2022 should also be seen in this context. ¬
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
ATTRACTING KEY TALENT
⌐ Market conditions in 2022 were similar to those in 2021, and adidas continued to compete for highly
sought-after talent in a changing business landscape. In 2022, we hired 8.7% fewer employees than in
2021. adidas remains a leading company to work for, with our ‘employer of choice’ status continuing to
receive global recognition in 2022 as we topped our category in Forbes’ ‘World’s Best Employers’ list for
the second year in succession and placed 16th overall (2021:14th). We also remained on Universum’s
‘World’s Most Attractive Employers’ rankings in 2022 for business and IT students worldwide. In addition,
our Tech, Digital, and Data & Analytics hiring team was named ‘TA Team of the Year’ in 2022 by HRO Today
Forum EMEA for our innovative hiring strategies. Lastly, in Greater China, we celebrated two accolades
sponsored by 51job, Inc. that we have received for the first time: the ‘100 Excellence Employer of China
Award’ and the ‘Excellence in Talent Attraction & Retention Award’ for our commitment to identifying
talent strategy, early talent attraction and development.
To support our talent pipeline, we executed several programmatic interventions in 2022:
‘Unlimited’ program: After achieving success in North America, the adidas ‘Unlimited’ program
expanded into EMEA in the second quarter of 2022. ‘Unlimited’ provides support and opportunities for
─
retail staff who want to pursue a career in our corporate structure. North America continued the
program with its fifth recruitment cycle, while EMEA completed its first cycle with employees who
started their new roles in September 2022.
Undergraduate and MBA internship programs: In 2022, we employed 305 interns globally (2021: 105).
Students were provided with a three- to six-month work and developmental opportunity within adidas,
─
accompanied by robust internship programming elements that included professional development,
mentorship, and networking events. Our goal is to ensure we retain top-performing interns and have
them become full-time employees.
Recruitment experience enhancements: In 2022, adidas kicked off ‘Program Diamond’ to promote
continuous improvement in our hiring approach. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition from hire to
─
onboarding, focused on optimizing automation in the hiring process and elevating the candidate and
employee experience. As part of this initiative, we piloted a new onboarding experience to create a
greater sense of community among new joiners at our headquarters in Herzogenaurach. ¬
BUILDING ROLE-MODEL LEADERSHIP
⌐ Our development offerings focus on developing the leadership behaviors and essential skills needed to
ensure our continued success. Our ambition is to inspire and nurture talented and diverse leaders who
exemplify our leadership behaviors. We undertake different initiatives to elevate and enhance our
leadership pipeline:
Leadership development experiences: Our portfolio of leadership development experiences is
designed for every level of management across all markets and functions. They include our ‘People
─
Leader Experience’ (‘PLE’), ‘Manager Development Experience’ (‘MDE’), ‘Director Development
Experience’ (‘DDE’), and ‘Executive Development Experience’ (‘EDE’). These interactive learning
experiences support the development of leadership skills that are directly linked to the participants’
current roles and responsibilities as well as being aligned to our values. In 2022, 1,026 employees
enrolled in ‘MDE’ or ‘DDE,’ and of those 743 employees graduated the programs through a virtual
experience. Additionally, 3,087 people leaders and/or those who aspire to lead people enrolled in ‘PLE,’
with 2,570 completing the program through a virtual, collaborative experience. In 2022, our ‘People
Leader Experience’ won the ‘Brandon Hall Group HCM Excellence Award’ for ‘Best Advance in
Competencies and Skill Development,’ while our ‘Director Development Experience’ won the ‘Brandon
Hall Group HCM Excellence Award’ for ‘Best Unique or Innovative Leadership Program.’
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Succession management: Our succession management approach aims to ensure stability and
certainty in business continuity through the development of strong internal talent pipelines for critical
─
leadership positions. We achieve this through a globally consistent succession process that identifies
these critical leadership positions and matches our top talent as successors to these roles. We also
drive the succession process through achievable development plans that prepare the identified
successors for their next steps. Our leadership groups and top talent pool serve as the succession
pipeline for the executive roles in our organization.
Leadership groups: Our leadership groups consist of the ‘Core Leadership Group’ (‘CLG’) and the
‘Extended Leadership Group’ (‘ELG’). The ‘CLG’ partners with the Executive Board, leading the
─
execution of our business strategy while the ‘ELG’ collaborates across markets and functions, leading
the execution of our strategic initiatives. Furthermore, the ‘ELG’ drives continuous improvement and
consistency throughout the organization.
High-potential programs: We invest in selected high-performing and high-potential employees
through three dedicated programs: ‘Global High Potential Group’ (‘GHIPO’), ‘Local High Potential
─
Group’ (‘LHIPO’), and ‘Future High Potential Group’ (‘FHIPO’) program. Our ‘GHIPO’ and ‘LHIPO’
programs enable us to identify and develop global and local high-potential leaders who have the ability
to take on more complex and demanding responsibilities at a higher leadership level. The programs
are designed to build peer relationships and to give participants cross-functional and cross-cultural
exposure. The ‘FHIPO’ program enables us to identify and develop selected high-potential employees
at an early stage in their careers. The program is designed to build on participants’ skills, further
evolve their capabilities, strengthen their behaviors, and expand their business perspective. Through
continuous investment into the development and growth of our ‘HIPOs,’ we are strengthening our
global, regional, local, and functional succession pipelines at different levels. Until the end of 2022, a
total of 93% of the ‘GHIPO,’ 74% of the ‘LHIPO,’ and 37% of the ‘FHIPO’ participants successfully made
positive career steps through upward, lateral, cross-cultural, or cross-functional moves. ¬
CREATING A PREMIER EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE
⌐ Ensuring a positive and impactful employee experience is a key focus of our people strategy. We do this
through listening to feedback from our employees, offering opportunities for flexibility, and focusing on
well-being.
Employee listening: After the successful launch of the ‘Employee Listening Survey’ (‘ELS’) to all
corporate and retail employees in 2021, we expanded the survey into distribution centers (‘DCs’) in the
─
first quarter of 2022. This was the first time the entire DC population had had the opportunity to
complete such a survey, and the participation rate was 53%. With the holistic results gathered from the
entire organization, we were able to identify three key global themes to drive our next steps: Feedback,
trust, and career advancement. Throughout 2022, these themes remained at the heart of our strategic
HR initiatives and inspired the creation of our ‘ELS’ Ambassadors, i.e., representatives of regions and
functions who ensure our global themes are integrated into local initiatives, while also addressing
specific findings in their market or function. The ‘ELS Ambassadors’ will be integral in the rollout of
the next iteration of the ‘ELS,’ planned for the first quarter of 2023.
Health management: We strongly believe that physical, mental, and social well-being are of equal
importance and are the cornerstone of sustainable performance. With this holistic approach, we aim to
─
provide the best possible conditions for our employees to ensure their well-being, safety, and health.
Focusing on prevention, education, and support, our comprehensive and inclusive portfolio caters for
the diverse needs of our employees. Our employees have access to a wide range of sports activities,
events, and facilities. We have corporate gyms at many locations around the world, including
Herzogenaurach, Portland, Gurgaon, Shanghai, Dubai, and Manchester. Many of our office buildings
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
have lockers and showers, allowing employees to cycle to work and include sports in their working
day. To meet employee needs in a hybrid work set-up, programs are both local and virtual to support
teamwork and a healthy lifestyle. Offerings range from hybrid sports classes, medical and
psychosocial consultations (in-person and virtual), and tools for digital disconnection, to carefully
curated sessions on life topics. Today, with a gradual extension, almost all adidas employees around
the world have access to an Employee Assistance Program. In addition, 2022 saw the launch of several
pilots across Germany aimed at elevating our approach to health. These include a certified peer
program on psychological first aid, an ergonomic program for our distribution center employees, and a
tailored three-year plan for our dual students and apprentices to support a healthy start to their
working life.
Return to office: In 2022, we were able to reopen several offices around the world, including our
Herzogenaurach headquarters, where we introduced our new hybrid workplace concept as of May. We
─
implemented a range of measures, such as vaccination centers, crisis management support, and
training to ensure the ongoing safety of our people and to limit the risk of infections in the workplace.
In our own retail stores, we implemented safety protocols and trainings to ensure the safety of all
employees and customers, and we will continue to do so. For more than two years, China had
maintained the world’s strictest covid measures. During the severe lock down period in Shanghai, we
implemented a special assistance program for all employees. We also provided food, expat support,
and unlimited psychological care for employees in all other cities in mainland China.
Health and safety: Managing the health and safety of our global workforce remains a priority for us.
Our infrastructure, assets, and operations comply with ISO 45001, and we regularly conduct internal
─
and external audits to ensure a healthy, safe and secure work environment for all employees. We
monitor our performance closely in order to measure our progress toward our targets and to identify
areas for potential improvement. Our training and guidelines on health and safety have been
successfully implemented and scaled throughout the organization. In 2022, we recorded a Lost Time
Incident Rate (‘LTIR’) of 0.44 (2021: 0.40), as well as, unchanged to the previous year, a zero
Occupational Illness Frequency Rate (‘OIFR’) and zero fatalities for own employees. For external,
contracted workforce, we recorded an improved LTIR of 0.67 (2021: 0.97), and one work-related fatal
accident (2021: 0). We initiated thorough investigations to understand the exact root cause enabling us
to take all measures and actions necessary to prevent similar accidents in the future.
Work-life integration: We aim to harmonize the commercial interests of the company with the
professional, private, and family needs of our employees. Our work-life integration initiatives and
─
programs include the provision of flexible working times and locations, personal development, and
leadership competence related to work-life integration, as well as family-oriented services:
Family and childcare: In addition to providing flexible working opportunities and sabbaticals, we
maintain a family-friendly environment and infrastructure. At our headquarters in
─
Herzogenaurach, we provide parent-child offices and a bilingual childcare facility, ‘World of Kids,’
with 270 places. We also run children’s camps to support working parents during school holiday.
In Herzogenaurach alone, 445 children attended these camps during 2022. The ongoing pandemic
required a considerable degree of flexibility to meet individual needs in some locations. In China,
for instance, adidas provided food and 1.5-hour lunch breaks during lockdown to help employees
care for their families.
Parental leave: For parental leave and re-entry, programs are in place to provide employees with
advice early on and options for their return to work, also taking into consideration flexible
─
working hours and work locations. In Germany, employees on parental leave are guaranteed their
original positions, which are only filled temporarily. In the US, in addition to regular parental
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
leave for new parents (up to ten weeks at home, 70% of their salary), adidas offers an extra two
weeks of paid parental leave. Furthermore, our special parental bonding leave provides parents
with the opportunity to stay home for up to six months within the first twelve months after the
child’s birth or placement. While unpaid, it offers parents the opportunity to stay home longer and
take care of their new arrival and new life together. Latin America provides for an extended
parental leave approach across the market, with mothers having 24 paid weeks in total to spend
with their children, while fathers/partners have 20 paid days in total. In addition, mothers can
work fewer hours for one month immediately before and after their maternity leave period.
Flexible work: Our worldwide off-campus-working approach, which allows our employees to
work up to 40% of their working hours from home, was expanded in January 2022 to enable
─
short-term remote working from another location (domestic or international). This new approach
is called ‘Work from Anywhere.’ Having experienced the importance of social and personal
interaction first-hand during the pandemic, we want to provide flexibility to support employees’
unique needs and experiences.
Commitment to impact: Together with our employees and partners, we act on our core belief that
through sport we have the power to change lives by fostering genuine connections with the
─
communities we serve and affect. To maximize this positive impact, we create volunteering programs
and company-matched fundraisers that encourage our people to actively engage and bring our core
belief to life.
In 2022, teams across all markets took part in multifaceted volunteering initiatives under a new
‘Community & Social Impact’ framework, listening to the respective communities’ needs and
promoting a culture of co-creation. Our projects ranged from sports coaching in safe places for women
and girls trying out new and diverse activities to skills-based support such as mentoring refugees to
help them unlock their potential in the labor market. Collectively, adidas employees performed 3,570
hours of voluntary work14, engaged in 28 different virtual or real-world projects, and/or supported 34
non-profit organizations or social ventures. In 2022, adidas continued to run fundraising campaigns
where we matched employee donations. Our employee fundraiser ‘Support for Ukraine’ raised more
than € 120,000 by matching our employees’ contributions and was one example of how we
demonstrated our collective and united support as one adidas family in 2022. ¬
INSTILLING A MINDSET OF CONTINUOUS LEARNING
⌐ We continue to promote a high-performance culture by developing our employees. We offer a wide
range of learning and development opportunities, including online learning resources and interactive
learning experiences that provide personal and professional growth opportunities for our workforce. Our
investments in digital learning and development opportunities, such as LinkedIn Learning, Udemy, Circus
Street, and Arizona State University, offer equitable access to learning content and just-in-time upskilling
and/or reskilling. In 2022, more than 59,000 employees worldwide invested a total of 1,175,000 hours in
training courses and workshops – an average of 19.7 hours.
The key pillars of our extended learning and development offerings are informal learning and mentoring.
Our informal learning is supported by platforms where employees can network and connect across the
organization based on shared learning goals and/or interests. When participating in our informal learning
offerings, more than 90% of employees said it made them feel more connected to the people and culture
at adidas and would recommend the program to others.
14 Excludes 'ERG' and individual hours of voluntary work. While for 2021 we only reported projects curated and managed by the adidas Global Community &
Social impact team, 2022 numbers include global data.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
In addition to our 'Board Mentoring Circle,’ which ran until June 2022, we also continued to partner with
former track and field athlete Edwin C. Moses on a mentoring experience for selected employees to help
elevate their ability to reinforce and support our cultural aspirations. Participants comprised a small and
diverse cohort of high-potential leaders across North America. ¬
REWARDING INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM PERFORMANCE
⌐ The key focus of our rewards strategy is to attract, retain, and motivate individuals through
remuneration and benefits that are inclusive, fit for purpose, and competitive in the marketplace – thus
enabling us to achieve our strategic objectives. To promote a high-performance culture, it is essential that
we focus on performance management to ensure fair and equitable reward and recognition.
Performance management: #MYBEST is our global performance development approach and a key
enabler of our high-performance culture. During the fourth quarter of 2021 and throughout 2022, we
─
initiated a review of #MYBEST to include our new values and to explore the future of performance at
adidas. In 2022, we sharpened our focus and simplified our approach: #MYBEST now has three
elements to encourage regular high-quality conversations between employee and line manager, and to
ensure goals are set and reviewed quarterly. A formal performance evaluation takes place twice a
year, with employee development being the focus of every monthly ‘Touch Base’ conversation. We
continue to work on making the performance evaluation and potential assessment processes more
equitable and to further develop our line managers’ capabilities to engage in meaningful performance
standard conversations. As we implement the new values into #MYBEST in 2023, we will focus on the
adoption of these values and how they are lived.
Total compensation management: Compensation at adidas has a dual focus of ensuring employees
are compensated fairly and equitably for the role they perform, while also creating a culture of
─
rewarding performance. The adidas total compensation management philosophy enables educated
compensation decisions based on external market reference and internal equity. It also takes into
account the skills, experience, and responsibility of each individual. Our variable compensation
programs engage and motivate employees by reflecting their activities’ input, while driving a culture of
high-performance. To do this, adidas offers the following variable compensation plans:
Short-Term Incentive programs,
─
Profit participation programs,
─
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for senior management.
─
Benefits: At adidas, employee benefits take the form of monetary or non-monetary programs that
supplement wages or salaries on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. Programs can be offered
─
globally, regionally, or locally and can be statutory or supplemental. They comply with legislation or
local market practice and are based on benchmark data.
Cross-border employment: adidas invests in international relocation to fill local skill gaps, enable
knowledge transfer, develop talent for a more diverse workforce, enable location strategy, and enforce
─
our learning culture. Our aim is to support the success of our business through a relocation of talent
that will both enhance the employee experience and align with our business purpose.
Stock Purchase Plan: Participation in the Stock Purchase Plan is open to employees in Germany, the
US, the Netherlands, and Greater China (China mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong). This amounts to
─
almost half our global workforce (excluding Retail). A total of 4,468 employees participated in the
program in 2022 (2021: 5,230). ¬

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
SUSTAINABILITY
⌐ adidas’ purpose ‘Through sport, we have the power to change lives,’ guides the way we run our
company, how we work with our partners, create our products, and engage with our consumers. We will
always strive to expand the limits of human possibilities, to include and unite people through sport, and
to create a more sustainable world. We believe that acting as a responsible company will contribute to
lasting economic success. However, achieving a truly sustainable business model is a marathon, not a
sprint. ¬
SUSTAINABILITY ROOTED IN OUR PURPOSE
⌐ Our commitment to sustainability is embedded into how we have done business for over two decades. It
is rooted in our purpose ‘Through sport, we have the power to change lives.’ In 2021, we have doubled
down on our commitment to sustainability and defined a roadmap for 2025 and beyond that allows us to
create a positive impact across relevant areas, always focusing on the most material topics – for us and
our stakeholders. We will continue to move to a comprehensive, consumer-facing sustainable article
offering at scale, expand our circular services, and work toward achieving climate neutrality (CO2e) across
our entire value chain. We continue to empower our employees to become sustainability ambassadors,
just as we invite consumers globally to engage and connect with us on the topic of sustainability. Lastly, we
aim to uphold the highest social compliance standards in our supply chain.
We believe that moving toward achieving the targets we have defined for 2025 will set us up for future
success. Yet we know that we cannot achieve these alone. We will leverage our long-term relationships
with suppliers to ensure they can continue moving with us in alignment with our decarbonization efforts,
and work closely with partners to scale innovative materials and recycling technologies. ¬
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/SUSTAINABILITY
GOVERNANCE
⌐ A robust governance structure ensures timely and direct execution of programs that drive the
achievement of our set of targets for 2025 and beyond. The head of Sustainability reports directly to the
member of the Executive Board responsible for Global Operations, who is responsible for the
development, coordination, and execution of our sustainability strategy and also leads the ‘Sustainability
Sponsor Board,’ which is composed of senior representatives from Global Brands, Global Operations,
Digital, Sales, and other relevant functions across the company. The ‘Sustainability Sponsor Board’
ensures cross-functional alignment, transparent end-to-end management, and execution of agreed-upon
sustainability goals within their functions. This includes reviewing and signing-off on policies as required.
We also maintain a separate compliance function which is operated as the Social and Environmental
Affairs (‘SEA’) Team to evaluate supplier-facing social and environmental compliance performance and
human rights impacts, reporting, through the General Counsel, to the CEO.
We have set up regular sustainability networking calls for all employees involved in sustainability projects
and programs in the organization to ensure company-wide alignment on all levels. On top of this, adidas
continued to offer the company-wide sustainability training program available to all employees, educating
them on how to think and act sustainably, enabling them to become sustainability ambassadors, and
encouraging everyone to make personal and professional commitments to contribute to a cleaner planet.
We also initiated sustainability training for our retail colleagues, with the objective of informing, engaging,
and inspiring our entire team and all consumers we interact with on a daily basis, around the globe. ¬
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
MATERIALITY
⌐ Throughout 2022, adidas conducted a full-scope materiality analysis to confirm non-financial topics
relevant to the company’s external reporting. The process was based on existing and future regulatory
disclosure requirements applicable to adidas. These requirements, in combination with existing material
topics, were the starting point for creating a long list of potentially material ESG ('environmental, social,
and governance’) topics. In a series of workshops with internal stakeholders, including responsible
experts and senior management of relevant functions, we identified and validated related impacts, risks
and opportunities for these topics. The analysis was carried out from an impact materiality perspective as
well as from a financial materiality perspective, each of which was assessed both qualitatively and
quantitatively. This has ultimately led us to form a two-dimensional materiality matrix and a list of
material topics, which forms the basis of the non-financial statement presented in this report. Notably, all
existing material topics were fully confirmed. The topic of biodiversity was identified as a new material
topic. ¬ ► SEE NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
⌐ Engaging openly with stakeholders and establishing ways to increase transparency and disclosure has
long been central to our approach. Our stakeholders are those people or organizations who affect or are
affected by our operations, including our employees, consumers, suppliers and their workers, customers,
investors, media, governments, and NGOs. The adidas ‘Stakeholder Relations Guideline’ specifies key
principles for the development of stakeholder relations and details the different forms of stakeholder
engagement. adidas participates in a variety of industry associations, multi-stakeholder organizations, and
non-profit initiatives. Through these memberships, we work closely with leading companies from different
sectors to develop sustainable business approaches and debate social and environmental topics on a
global, regional, and local level. We use collaborations and partnerships to build leverage for systemic
change in our industry, such as for efforts to mitigate the carbon footprint in our industry’s supply chain, to
strengthen chemical management practices, and to raise social and environmental standards in the textile
and leather supply chain. In addition, we build awareness, capacity, and knowledge of laws and rights
among factory management and workers by partnering with leading providers such as the International
Labour Organization’s (‘ILO’) ‘Better Work’ program, as well as with the United Nations International
Organization for Migration (‘IOM’) with the objective of ensuring that the labor rights of foreign and migrant
workers are upheld in the adidas supply chain.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
TRANSPARENCY
⌐ We believe transparent communication with our stakeholders is critical. We use global reporting
standards such as the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’) and the Sustainability
Accountability Standards Board (‘SASB’) to inform our external non-financial reporting. We regularly
disclose additional information to public-facing social and environmental benchmarks and reporting
platforms and publish important sustainability updates about our work throughout the year on our
corporate channels, including our corporate website. A key element is the publication of our global
supplier factory list which is updated twice a year. In addition, we disclose the names of the factories of
suppliers that process materials for our primary suppliers and subcontractors, where the majority of wet
processes are carried out.
We acknowledge the value of climate-related reporting and for many years have been reporting into well-
established frameworks. Based on its international accreditation, we are aiming to stepwise include the
‘Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures’ (‘TCFD’) recommendations that enable companies
to improve reporting of climate-related financial information, especially climate-related risks and
opportunities. The TCFD is structured around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how
organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management as well as metrics and targets. We believe
that with our long-standing commitment to and strategic focus on sustainability we are already covering
elements of the four thematic areas in various sections of our Annual Report. adidas has a comprehensive
roadmap with clear targets in place. The Sustainability Sponsor Board ensures end-to-end management
to achieve these targets. As part of our risk identification process, we monitor physical risks related to
climate change as well as risks and opportunities resulting from the transition to a low-carbon economy.
To further refine and develop the core reporting elements in line with the TCFD recommendations, a
cross-functional project team was set up. This team met throughout 2022 to establish solid governance
processes around the TCFD and created a prioritized list of climate-related risks and opportunities.
Further, relevant stakeholders took part in upskilling sessions, and, together with several experts, the
Risk Management team conducted a qualitative climate-related risk and opportunity assessment.
Given the complex nature of the topic, further preparation will be needed to build more granularity and to
ensure high quality for more extensive external reporting for scenario analyses. ¬

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
DECARBONIZATION
The climate crisis presents the most pressing long-term challenge facing civilization. For that reason,
adidas has set targets that will help us limit emissions aligned with the 1.5°C benchmark and contribute to
a net-zero future. adidas has committed to:
− achieving climate neutrality (CO2e) across its own operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2025,
− reducing absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the entire value chain (Scope 1, 2, 3)16 by
30% by 2030, measured against a baseline of 2017,
− achieving climate neutrality (CO2e) across the entire value chain by 2050.
Our emission reduction targets by 2030 have been approved by the ‘Science Based Targets initiative’
(‘SBTi’). Within the 2025 target, we commit to reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 90%
from a baseline of 2017. This target is consistent with the reduction pathways needed to prevent a rise in
average temperatures of more than 1.5°C – the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. Our GHG
reduction target for value chain emissions (Scope 3) meets the SBTi’s criteria for ambitious value chain
goals, meaning they are in line with current best practices.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Our ’Environmental Footprint Tool’ enables us to quantify, monitor, and be transparent about our carbon
footprint not only across our own operations, but along our entire value chain. This covers all stages from
extraction, production and processing of materials, product assembly, own operations, and logistics to the
use phase and the disposal of our products at the end of their lifetime. Results for 2022 clearly show again
that our environmental impacts are distributed unequally across the value chain, with the most significant
impacts generated in the supply chain, particularly raw materials production and processing. We are
moving ahead with our ambition to fully integrate the tool into our existing data-tracking systems to enable
real-time simulations.
The following table shows the total annual GHG emissions across our value chain. The average Scope 1, 2,
and 3 annual GHG emissions per product for 2022 decreased compared to the previous year. This
reduction was majorly driven by our focus on innovation that enabled us to, for example, reduce emissions
through low-carbon manufacturing and materials. In 2022, 96% of all polyester we used was recycled
polyester, ensuring we are on the right path to achieving our target to only use recycled polyester. By
continuing to focus on our decarbonization strategy which includes further material innovation, switching
to cleaner energy sources at our supplier facilities, enabling low-carbon design for our products, and
achieving climate neutrality (CO2e) across our own operations, we will ensure we stay on track to achieve
our target of 15% emission reduction per product by 2025 (baseline 2017).

1 Values reported cover production seasons SS22 and FW22. Within Scope 3, ‘Purchased goods and services’ considers the production and processing of raw
materials for which impacts are estimated based on quantities of materials and life-cycle analysis data. All key production processes are considered. Primary,
secondary, and tertiary packaging material quantities are included. The quantities are estimated based on sales volumes, using composition and weight
assumptions from the ‘Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules’ (‘PEFCR’). Furthermore, ‘Purchased goods and services’ also considers the assembly
phase, for which impacts are estimated by applying emission factors to reported energy consumption from Tier 1 strategic suppliers. Sourcing volume data is
used to estimate the impact of non-strategic suppliers (<20%). ‘Upstream transportation and distribution’: Quantities of goods for specified distribution routes
are combined with transport emissions factors. ‘Business travel’: Calculations are based on the business travel data system. ‘Use of sold products’: Emissions
caused by washing, drying, and ironing of sold products throughout their lifetime based on data on average care cycles from PEFCR and life-cycle analysis
datasets. ‘End-of-life treatment of old products’: Emissions caused by disposal of sold products are estimated based on sales volumes and typical waste
disposal routes (e.g., landfill and incineration). Scope 1 and 2: Impacts are estimated calculated based on reported environmental quantities in the Health and
Safety, Environment, and Energy (HSEE) own operations workplace governance data collection systems.
2 Intensity factor does not include emissions from ‘Use of sold products’ to ensure alignment with our GHG reduction target for 2030 as approved by the
‘Science Based Targets initiative.’
Despite reducing our GHG emission intensity, as shown in the table, due to an increase in the number of
products we created and shipped, and due to the return of employees to the offices after the pandemic, we
see a slight increase in the total absolute GHG emission compared to the previous year. ¬
Measuring our product footprint
⌐ In order to create new and elevated consumer experiences, we are developing and implementing tools
that bring more transparency to our product creation process, enabling our development and innovation
teams to identify materials as well as create products and concepts with lower carbon footprints. At the
same time, this helps us provide consumers with greater transparency for more informed purchase
decisions. Following the launch of our most climate-friendly shoe in collaboration with Allbirds, we
continued to scale our capabilities to calculate and communicate our product footprints visible to
consumers. During 2022, we introduced the Adizero Lightstrike with a carbon footprint of 3.5 kg CO2e per
pair, achieving a 42% reduction compared to the previous version, and the Supernova 2 with a footprint of
8.9 kg CO2e per pair, an 11% reduction.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Identifying ways we can make lower-impact products requires a detailed and thorough approach that
includes not only optimizing our own operations but also the manufacturing of each of our products. And
since most of our carbon emissions occur outside our direct control, we collaborate with our suppliers
located across the globe, helping them improve their carbon footprint during production processes. ¬
Supply chain
⌐ We continued to work with our suppliers to ensure they are continuously optimizing their environmental
footprint in energy use and carbon emissions. Strategic suppliers producing most of our products and
materials are enrolled in our environmental program, which means we partner closely with them and
provide suitable training to achieve their targets and progressively improve their footprint.
adidas aims to have the supply network with the lowest carbon footprint in the industry. At the start of
2022, we reached a major milestone on our path to meeting that goal, when we shared a set of clear
expectations, the adidas Decarbonization Manifesto, with our strategic Tier 1 and Tier 217 suppliers. This
Manifesto clearly presents how we expect our suppliers to support our decarbonization efforts. Our
expectations include:
− Environmental stewardship: Suppliers should set targets that get approved by the SBTi by 2024.
− Materials: 100% of new material offered to adidas must be of sustainable content and produced using
low-carbon-intensive processes.
− Product: Suppliers should aim for an aggressive adoption of more sustainable and low-carbon
materials spanning from creation to manufacturing.
− Transparency: Suppliers should build in-house capacity to provide full transparency and traceability,
from raw material to finished product, and connect to the adidas sustainable material tracing tool that
is used to trace the source of origin.
− Energy sources: Suppliers should adopt clean energy, including rooftop solar energy, energy sourced
through renewable energy purchase power agreements (PPAs), and other renewable alternatives, and
also achieve a phase-out of coal by or before 2025.
− Manufacturing processes: Suppliers should adopt low-carbon technologies from the adidas low-
carbon technology portfolio.
Becoming the industry’s lowest-carbon-footprint supply network is a team sport. Meeting the conditions of
our Manifesto will form the basis for continuing business operations with our suppliers beyond 2025. We
have put measures in place to incentivize high-performing and committed supplier partners. These
measures include:
− Product allocation priority,
− Opportunity for existing, high-performing supplier partners to gain market share,
− Entry opportunity for new, disruptive supplier partners,
− First-mover advantage and sustainability leadership position.
17 Tier 1 suppliers are responsible for product assembly, Tier 2 suppliers are our material manufacturers.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
We encourage all our suppliers to enroll in the ‘UNFCCC Climate Action Training’ program. This, in
addition to other upskilling initiatives conducted by our in-house team, helps suppliers develop their own
decarbonization pathways, since they are best placed to understand their own circumstances and find the
most appropriate measures for their future reduction in GHG emissions. Beyond that, we have driven
various initiatives to help suppliers scale their use of renewable energy and increase their energy
efficiency:
− Phasing out coal-fired boilers: With only one exception for administrative reasons, we have been
successful in ensuring our suppliers refrained from installing new coal-fired boilers, heaters, or power
generation systems from 2022 onwards, and remain committed to phasing out coal-fired boilers at all
Tier 1 and Tier 2 direct supplier facilities by 2025. We asked these suppliers to conduct coal phase-out
feasibility studies and provide us with a clear roadmap for replacing coal. During 2022, all relevant
suppliers have confirmed their commitment to replace or modify their coal-fired boilers by 2025, and
18 boilers have already been converted to non-coal fuel or decommissioned this year.
− Increasing adoption of on-site renewable energy for electricity generation: Electricity is the other
major source of emissions in our manufacturing process. We are therefore asking our suppliers to
obtain their electricity from on-site and off-site renewable energy sources and have incorporated
renewable energy (‘RE’) and decarbonization performance of our suppliers in our supplier assessment
process. Rooftop solar projects are one of the major contributors to such on-site RE electricity. Total
rooftop solar capacity across our key suppliers has doubled to 186 MWp in 2022, putting us ahead of
our internal roadmap. We will continue to increase rooftop solar capacity over the next few years.
− Preparing suppliers to purchase electricity from off-site renewable energy sources: We are also
encouraging our suppliers to source renewable energy through off-site options such as PPAs, green
tariffs and Energy Attribute Certificates (‘EACs’) or Renewable Energy Certificates (‘RECs’). We
provided supplier training workshops in multiple countries to upskill suppliers on how to source off-
site RE and to communicate our expectations on scaling up RE. In 2022, our suppliers in China secured
a total of 25,000 MWh of renewable energy through recently launched green power contracts.
− Advocating for policy to scale up renewable energy: Many of the key operating countries in our supply
chain do not have the policies required to support PPAs or to maximize rooftop solar potential. We
engaged with the governments of Vietnam, Indonesia, and Cambodia, as well as their respective
electricity utilities, to communicate our concerns and recommendations with a view to facilitating PPAs
and removing the barriers to rooftop solar. We also actively collaborated with other stakeholders such
as Euro-Cham, Am-Cham, USAID, and fashion industry associations on their policy advocacy work
across multiple countries during 2022.
− Continuing to increase energy efficiency: We use a supplier self-governance model for energy
efficiency. Our efforts in recent years to improve our suppliers’ ability to measure, monitor, and
conserve their energy use have enabled us to transfer full responsibility to our suppliers for their own
efforts and achievements, while adidas continues to track and monitor their energy efficiency
performance. In 2022, strategic suppliers enrolled in our environmental program successfully
achieved an annual improvement in energy efficiency of almost 4% compared to the baseline of 2019,
leading to an accumulated improvement of almost 12% over the last three years. ¬
Own operations
⌐ Own operations refer to administrative offices, distribution centers, and our own retail stores. In 2022,
this equaled a coverage of 3,730,035 m2 of gross leased area. Our efforts are underpinned by the clear
targets we have set. By 2025, we aim to achieve climate neutrality (CO2e) across own operations. To
achieve this target, we will steadily increase our overall environmental performance data coverage and
continue to implement eco-efficiency standards through a holistic integrated management system (IMS) at
key sites. All of these efforts will support us on our way to achieving a 30% reduction in GHG emissions
across our entire value chain by 2030, measured against the baseline of 2017.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
2025 Goal for Own Operations
Climate Neutrality (CO e)
2
We defined a clear roadmap to achieve our emission reduction targets for our own operations, including
measures such as implementing on-site renewable energy production, improving energy use efficiency,
and sourcing renewable energy through green tariffs in Europe. In 2022, we continued to invest in own
operations and offered Green Funds to subsidize local energy efficiency and on-site renewable energy
projects. These initiatives included the on-site solar renewable energy projects in Herzogenaurach,
Bogota, Caspe, and Stockport. We also improved energy efficiency through LED retrofits, HVAC (heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning) equipment upgrades, energy monitoring, sensors, and automatization.
Additionally, in response to the natural gas crisis, we implemented significant energy-saving measures in
Europe, e.g., reducing building temperatures to a minimum and planning shutdown sequences for district
heat networks.
In 2021 we began collecting electricity consumption data for our own retail stores. During 2022, we
managed to increase our primary data coverage for own retail by 15 percentage points to 36% globally
compared to last year. Data coverage for administrative offices and distribution centers is at 100%, while
data for showrooms and small offices was estimated. In 2022, our total energy consumption across own
operations globally was 510,539 MWh (2021: 512,050 MWh), equivalent to a total of 164,149 tCO2e (2021:
138,411 tCO2e). While we continue our transition toward renewable electricity in Europe through green
tariffs, in 2022 we decided to switch our focus from short-term initiatives, such as the purchasing of EACs
for Europe and North America, to focus on more impactful measures, e.g., securing long-term contracts
such as PPAs starting in 2023. We have also expanded our scope of GHG Scope 1 and 2 reporting through
the first-time inclusion of company vehicles in 2022, and as a result see an absolute increase compared to
the previous year.
Implementing sustainable processes: Our Integrated Management System (‘IMS’) helps us to reduce
potential negative impacts and secure all relevant ISO management certifications for key locations,
─
such as environmental management (ISO 14001), health and safety management (ISO 45001) and
energy management (ISO 50001). We aim to further expand these certifications to more key sites
through implementation of the standards as well as internal and external audits, as these support our
efforts to achieve our energy, water, waste, and health and safety targets. As of 2022, 64 sites (2021:
64) were certified for ISO 14001, 112 sites (2021: 63) for ISO 45001, and 322 sites (2021: 327) for ISO
50001 (applies to locations with more than 50 employees or space exceeding 4,500 m2).
Continuing Green Building certification: We continue to use ‘Green Building’ certifications in the
interior design and construction of own retail stores – including ‘LEED’ (‘Leadership in Energy and
─
Environmental Design’) and ‘BREEAM’ (‘Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment
Method’) certifications. As Green Building certification is used for strategically relevant projects, a set
of internal eco-efficiency standards has been continuously implemented for all projects that mirror the
priorities of the LEED certification. The ultimate goal is to achieve energy reduction through
investment in high-energy-efficient equipment and energy monitoring. In 2022, our distribution center
Suzhou X in China, one of the biggest highly automated distribution centers, was awarded LEED
Platinum certification for Building Design and Construction, the highest level of sustainability
recognition. The key Green Building features at Suzhou X include, but are not limited to, rooftop solar,
LED lighting and control, top-vent air conditioning, HVLS ventilation fans, a building management and
energy management system, rainwater collection, and a recycling system. ¬
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
WATER EFFICIENCY
⌐ We continued to expand our water-reduction efforts by including additional, high-consuming Tier 2
suppliers in our environmental program. In 2022, Tier 1 suppliers achieved a 20% reduction in water
intensity (liters/worker-hour of operation) and Tier 2 suppliers a 29% intensity reduction (m3/total product
output value in US-$), compared to the 2017 baseline. By 2025, we aim to achieve an overall reduction in
water intensity of 40% against the 2017 baseline. This will be accomplished with the aid of new
technologies and through continued support for our suppliers in the form of environmental good practice
guidelines with examples for water-saving initiatives.
At own operations globally, we also aim to continue to strengthen water efficiency and wastewater projects
in the coming years. By the end of 2022, our water intensity at administrative offices and distribution
centers totaled 0.145 m3/m2 (2021: 0.128 m3/m2). This year, we have again included new administrative
offices into our reporting and, with that, continued to expand our data coverage. In combination with the
gradual return of employees to the office after the pandemic, we see an increase of the absolute volume of
water consumption compared to 2021. Overall, we achieved an accumulative reduction of 25% (2021: 34%)
compared to the 2019 baseline (0.193 m3/m2), and with that exceeded the target we set ourselves for
2025. ¬
CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT
⌐ It is necessary to use a range of chemicals to facilitate innovation and deliver high-performance
products. For years, adidas has been implementing a holistic chemical management program in its supply
chain, spanning the use of positive input chemistry, monitoring the chemical output of manufacturing and
reporting supplier performance data publicly.
As a founding member and participating company, we continue to work closely with the Zero Discharge of
Hazardous Chemicals (‘ZDHC’) Foundation and to promote the application of their guidelines and
Manufacturing Restricted Substances Lists (‘MRSL’) across our suppliers. We are proud to have reached
‘Progressive Level’18 in the ZDHC ‘Brands to Zero’ program in 2022, which measures the level of suppliers’
adoption and implementation of ZDHC guidelines and tools.
− Ensuring robust input chemical management: We are continuously working to promote sustainable
chemistry in our product creation by accelerating the adoption of chemicals that meet the highest level
of ZDHC MRSL conformance (Level 3). In 2022 we partnered with ZDHC and TESTEX, a certification
organization, to hold workshops for some 160 suppliers in our major sourcing countries (China,
Vietnam, and Indonesia). These events increased supplier awareness of ZDHC MRSL conformance and
improved their competence in Level 3 certification and registration of chemical products on the ZDHC
Gateway platform. Proactively involving key chemical formulators to these conversations underlines
our ambition to motivate the entire industry to use more sustainable chemicals. We also launched the
‘ZDHC Supplier to Zero’ program in 2022 to assist suppliers in adopting safer chemistries. At the end of
2022, at least 50% of chemicals used at 46% of supplier facilities were ZDHC MRSL Level 3. At the
manufacturing level, we continue to ban the intentional use of priority chemical groups classified as
particularly hazardous under ZDHC standards and the EU REACH Candidate List of Substances of Very
High Concern (‘SVHC’). We are working to find suitable alternatives and phase out harmful chemicals
from our supply chain. adidas has successfully achieved a 99% phase-out of polyfluorinated and per-
fluorinated chemicals (PFCs) since 2017.
− Monitoring output chemical management: With regard to eliminating the discharge of hazardous
chemicals, we believe it is critical that our suppliers adopt the ‘ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines’ in order
to monitor the quality of directly discharged wastewater. In 2022, we successfully maintained our high
standard of compliance, with 89% of these suppliers achieving ZDHC Wastewater ‘Foundational Level’
18 ‘Progressive Level’ is the second best of the three levels awarded in the ZDHC ‘Brands to Zero’ program.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
through the implementation of our Effluent Treatment Plant evaluation tool. In 2023, this tool will be
integrated into the ZDHC supplier platform to support a wider group of facilities and will be adopted by
other ZDHC brands as well. ¬
WASTE MANAGEMENT
⌐ We make continuous efforts toward optimizing waste diversion across our supply chain with the aim of
increasing the value of waste within the life cycle, e.g., through recycling or reuse. We have developed
waste management guidelines to help our suppliers improve waste segregation in manufacturing,
prioritizing, recycling and reuse for non-hazardous waste. These guidelines specify that the non-
recyclable waste materials should also not be directly landfilled. In 2019, in collaboration with co-
processing partners in our major sourcing countries, we developed a waste diversion program to use non-
recyclable manufacturing waste in energy production. Co-processing is a proven and sustainable solution
that can reduce pollution, reduce consumption of natural resources, reduce landfill space, and ultimately
contribute to a smaller carbon footprint. To further optimize the waste diversion, we have scaled up this
solution across the globe, especially in sourcing countries with immature co-processing infrastructure.
Globally, the suppliers enrolled in our environmental program collectively achieved a 96% landfill
diversion in 2022, exceeding our target of 95% for this year. With the promising result in 2022, we are
currently working on setting a more ambitious target for future waste diversion.
At own operations, during 2022, we also focused on improving the quality of waste-related data from our
administrative offices and distribution centers by upskilling team members on the data collection process
of waste streams. This resulted in a higher data quality but also a lower diversion rate. As of 2022, 89%
(2021: 74%) of our own operations by square meters are monitoring and tracking waste. By the end of
2022, a total of 32,246 tons (2021: 32,951 tons) of waste was generated, and we achieved an accumulated
diversion rate of 88% (2021: 92%) for administrative offices and distribution centers. ¬
TRANSPORTATION
⌐ We regularly track the environmental impact related to the transport of our goods. Compared to the
previous year, performance remained relatively stable. While the use of air freight increased in 2022 as
part of our efforts to counterbalance covid-related supply chain challenges to 2.0%, the vast majority of
our transportation continued to take place via sea freight and truck, with 81.4% via sea freight and 16.6%
via truck, almost unchanged compared to the previous year. ¬
MATERIALS
[ We are moving to a comprehensive sustainable article offering at scale. Our ambition is that 90% of our
articles will be sustainable by 2025. We define articles as sustainable when they show environmental
benefits versus conventional articles due to the materials used, meaning that they are – to a significant
degree – made with environmentally preferred materials. The majority of the environmentally preferred
materials currently used are recycled materials or more sustainable cotton. Additionally, innovative
materials such as biobased synthetics and more sustainably grown natural materials are used on a small
scale already and will become increasingly relevant in the future.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
To qualify as a sustainable article, environmentally preferred materials have to exceed a certain
predefined percentage of the article weight. The applied criteria for environmentally preferred materials
and the percentage of the article weight are defined based on standards reflecting the latest industry
developments, competitor benchmarks, and expert opinions: For apparel, the environmentally preferred
material content is required to be at least 70% of the article weight, for accessories and gear at least 50%,
and for footwear at least 20%.19 This standard has been applied for the year 2022 onward. By the end of
2022, we managed to have seven out of ten of our articles sustainable.]

− Recycled polyester: Polyester is the most widely used material in adidas products. In 2017, we set
ourselves the ambitious target of replacing all virgin polyester with recycled polyester in all products
where a solution exists by the end of 2024. We set clear internal milestones for our product creation
teams and have seen progress throughout the last several seasons. In 2022, 96% (2021: 91%) of all the
polyester we used was recycled. With that, we are on track to use only recycled polyester by the end of
2023 – one year ahead of schedule. While recycled polyester has been in use for a long time, it is still
not the standard in the textile industry, with only 15% of polyester produced worldwide being recycled
polyester.
− Parley Ocean Plastic: Since 2015, adidas has partnered with the environmental organization ‘Parley for
the Oceans’ and uses ‘Parley Ocean Plastic’ as a replacement for virgin polyester. Parley Ocean Plastic
is plastic waste collected from remote islands, beaches, coastal communities, and shorelines,
preventing it from polluting the oceans. In 2021, we continued to roll out Parley Ocean Plastic in key
categories, both in ‘Performance’ and ‘Lifestyle’ products across footwear, apparel, and accessories
and gear. In 2022, we produced close to 27 million pairs of shoes containing Parley Ocean Plastic.
(2021: close to 18 million).

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
− More sustainable cotton: adidas has steadily increased the sourcing of more sustainable cotton
throughout the last several years. Since the end of 2018, 100% of the cotton we use has come from
more sustainable sources.
− Responsibly sourced leather: adidas uses leather on account of its unique performance properties in
products where it is the optimum material for the purpose. Currently, more than 99% of our leather
volume is audited in accordance with the Leather Working Group (‘LWG’) protocol, and most of our
hides are sourced from tanneries with the highest LWG rating (LWG Gold). We believe the existing LWG
audit protocol and chain of custody provide a strong foundation on which to create a robust and
scalable traceability solution for leather hides. For this reason, adidas is working with the LWG to
broaden the scope of the audit to include traceability to the slaughterhouse by 2030. This will allow
higher transparency on important environmental impacts such as deforestation from the origin of the
material.
− Natural materials: In 2022, adidas collaborated with innovative material startups such as Infinited
Fiber Company, Spinnova, and Pond to develop materials from natural resources that we can use in
our products. Together, we are striving to replace fossil-based plastics with plant-based raw
materials, without compromising product performance. In the fall, we successfully launched a small
apparel collection made with at least 60% fibers from recycled cotton waste and 40% organic cotton in
partnership with Infinited Fiber Company and the EU-funded New Cotton project. This three-year
project aims to collect, sort and regenerate textile waste into a new man-made cellulosic fiber that
looks and feels like cotton, based on Infinited Fiber Company’s textile fiber regeneration technology.
Also in the fall, we launched our ‘made with nature’ Ultraboost, which features a knitted upper made
with lyocell, a material made from cellulose fibers derived from sustainably grown wood.
Synthetic fibers are widely used in our industry due to their unique performance properties, such as
elasticity, light weight, and high durability. We are aware that products made from synthetic fibers can
have a negative environmental impact during both material production and product use. We acknowledge
that fiber fragmentation is a complex challenge for our industry, but it is one we are proactively
addressing. adidas is a co-founder of ‘The Microfibre Consortium’ (‘TMC’), which has developed a test
method for assessing fiber release and in future aims to advise the textile industry on mitigating the
impact of fiber fragmentation. In 2022, TMC published position papers on microfiber degradability and
wastewater management that are fully consistent with our internal guidelines and contribute to the
industry’s knowledge on this topic. ¬
CIRCULAR SERVICES
⌐ In addition to using recycled content or other more sustainable material in our products, we are
rethinking entire processes to design products that have a circular end-of-life solution and are ‘made to
be remade’ (MTBR), meaning they can be completely recycled after use and the material can be reused.
We successfully scaled this concept from prototype back in 2019 to a fully commercial MTBR footwear
offer across multiple categories in 2022 (including Ultraboost, Stan Smith, Terrex Free Hiker, and NMD
Hype) and have meanwhile expanded the concept to apparel. In 2022, we introduced the adidas by Stella
McCartney tracksuit made of viscose that can be returned and recycled into new fibers.
Besides various product launches we also continued with our circular services in 2022, which have the
objective of prolonging the life of the product. In our Munich Terrex store, we launched a repair service,
and in several flagship stores such as Berlin, London, Dubai, or Shenzen we are offering sneaker cleaning
services. ¬
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
BIODIVERSITY
⌐ adidas is aware of the potential impacts and dependencies its business operations can have on
ecosystem services and nature assets. As a consequence, biodiversity has been recognized as a material
topic for external reporting in 2022. In our industry, preserving and restoring biodiversity is a complex
challenge that requires strong collaboration between multiple actors, including direct and indirect
suppliers, certifiers, and innovators. In 2022, we began working on a systematic approach to address
biodiversity challenges in our value chain. Using scientifically validated frameworks we identified actions
to be taken across our entire value chain activities related to the five drivers of nature change as identified
by the Science Based Targets Network (‘SBTN’)20. As a first step, we aim to work with our suppliers to
develop a deforestation-free roadmap for nature-derived materials. We will further assess our strategic
facilities for potential impacts on protected areas, key biodiversity areas and the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (‘IUCN’) Red List of Threatened Species. Finally, for downstream impacts in our
value chain, adidas will evaluate future contributions to biodiversity-enhancing projects.
In line with our ambition to source our nature-derived materials more responsibly, we launched our
standards for animal-derived materials in 2022. They demonstrate our commitment to sourcing animal-
derived materials in an ethical and sustainable manner that respects animal welfare and species
conservation. We do not source or process raw materials from endangered or threatened species as
defined by the IUCN in its Red List. All down used in our products is either virgin down certified by the
Textile Exchange’s Responsible Down Standard (‘RDS’) or recycled down. Regarding the sourcing of wool,
we are committed to increase the share of wool that is certified by Textile Exchange’s Responsible Wool
Standard (‘RWS’) to 100% by the end of 2024.
We have also started to explore how we can increase biodiversity in our own facilities. In an exploratory
phase, the adidas headquarters has taken steps to map the current biodiversity status of the campus, the
steps to reduce the impacts and to define measures to increase the number of species present on the
campus. ¬
PACKAGING
⌐ We are committed to using more sustainable packaging materials and reducing the impact of
packaging by optimizing box sizes and number of shipments.
Most of our paper-based packaging, such as shoe boxes and shipping boxes, is made with recycled
content. Practically all plastic packaging (polybags) used to protect finished products during shipping is
made from 100% recycled LDPE (low-density polyethylene). The only current exception are the DCs where
e-commerce returns are repackaged, and no local vendor of recycled LDPE polybags is available yet (less
than 1% of polybags). For many years already, all the carrier bags handed out in adidas retail stores have
been made with recycled paper. ¬
PRODUCT SAFETY
⌐ Product safety is an imperative. As a company we have to manage the risk of selling defective products
that may result in injury to consumers. To mitigate this risk, we have company-wide product safety policies
in place that ensure we consistently apply physical and chemical product safety and conformity standards.
The creation of respective adidas standards and policies is a collaborative, cross-functional approach
involving experts from the Corporate Legal and Global Operations departments to ensure all aspects of a
specific product are covered. This includes subsequent updates and training activities. Application and
monitoring are ensured through our Global Operations function. One of these policies is the Restricted
Substances Policy (‘A-01’ Policy) that we pioneered in 1998. It covers the strictest applicable local
20 Land/water/sea use change, Resource exploitation, Climate change, Pollution, and Invasive Species & Other are identified as drivers of nature change by
Science Based Targets Network.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
requirements and includes best-practice standards as recommended by consumer organizations. The
policy is updated and published internally and externally at least once a year based on findings in our
ongoing dialogue with scientific organizations, and it is mandatory for all business partners. Both our own
quality laboratories and external institutes are used to constantly monitor material samples for
compliance with our requirements. Materials that do not meet our standards and specifications are
rejected. As a result of our ongoing efforts, we did not record any product recalls in 2022.
Over the last several years, we have substantially contributed to the AFIRM ‘Restricted Substances List,’
which constitutes a harmonized restricted substances list across the industry. While the uptake of the list
as an industry best practice matured further, and AFIRM membership continues to grow, various tools
have been developed further in 2022, such as a harmonized Test Request Form, the third-party Lab
Evaluation Questionnaire, or the Supplier Online Training Videos. All these will be issued to the public and
available to other companies from the textile and sporting goods industry and their suppliers. We also
continued our participation in several major public stakeholder consultation processes initiated by the
European Commission (e.g., European Chemicals Agency) and US state legislative initiatives to inform
governmental entities on implications and opportunities of drafted legislation. ¬
SOCIAL IMPACTS
⌐ Through our economic activities we create value and make positive contributions to society. However,
being a company of our scale and global presence, we also have a social impact on communities. adidas
recognizes its responsibility to respect human rights and the importance of managing the appropriate
due diligence to fulfill this obligation as a business. We do this by striving to operate responsibly along
the entire value chain, by safeguarding the rights of our own employees and those of the workers who
manufacture our products through our Workplace Standards, and by applying our influence to effect
change wherever human rights issues are linked to our business activities. ¬
HUMAN RIGHTS
⌐ Since its inception in 1997, our human and labor rights program has been built on the back of intense
stakeholder outreach and engagement, seeking to understand and define the most salient human rights
issues to address as a company. As part of our broader risk management processes, we are taking steps
to increase the scope and application of Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence (‘HREDD’) efforts.
We have defined those areas and assessment processes that need to be evaluated and strengthened in
preparation for the implementation of the ‘German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply
Chains,’ which took effect in the beginning of 2023. As part of our HREDD efforts, in 2022, we focused on
the following key areas, among others: creating and implementing our Human Rights Policy, addressing
country-specific risks associated with our sponsorship of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, and addressing
modern slavery risks in our supply chain through continued programs to ensure responsible recruitment
of migrant workers.
In 2022, we launched our Human Rights Policy, which embeds our commitment to respecting and
promoting the fulfillment of human rights and establishes an ongoing due diligence process to identify,
address, evaluate, and communicate the risks of involvement with adverse human rights impacts through
our own operations, products, or services, or via our business relationships. We have engaged in extensive
consultation in the development of this policy, involving a wide range of internal stakeholders, including
key business functions and employee representatives, as well as external stakeholders, civil society,
business and human rights experts. Stakeholder feedback has informed the content of our Human Rights
Policy and the measures taken to support its implementation and has further enhanced our understanding
of the most salient issues to address as a company.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
We continue to support improvements in the ongoing and independent accreditation of our supply-chain-
facing social compliance program by the Fair Labor Association (‘FLA’). We have also maintained our
commitment to the ‘Sporting Chance Principles’ and our seat on the Advisory Council of the Centre for
Sport and Human Rights.
As a sponsor, we intensified our engagement with stakeholders over the hosting of the FIFA World Cup
Qatar 2022, paying close attention to the advocacy community’s concerns over migrant labor rights. This
culminated in our publishing of a statement in August 2022, which called on FIFA, the Supreme Committee
for Delivery and Legacy (responsible for organizing the World Cup), and the Qatar Ministry of Labor to
come together to discuss a remedy fund for workers. We continued to support several global trade unions
with their plans for a migrant workers information center in Qatar, which is now slated to be launched as a
World Cup legacy project in 2023. We also followed through with planned due diligence and labor rights
training for our wholesale partners in Doha and again made public our list of suppliers responsible for
World Cup production.
Since the military coup in Myanmar in February 2021, adidas has closely monitored the situation in the
country and expressed concern about reports of violence, severe human rights, and labor rights risks for
workers, and the fragile state of social and economic stability in the country. Given the increased risk of
adverse human rights impacts in the country, we have closely followed the call of the international
advocacy community and international due diligence standards – including the UN Guiding Principles and
the OECD – and have heightened our due diligence processes for the few suppliers we have in this country.
We will continue to engage with international and local stakeholders and collaborate with industry peers
and associations to monitor the evolving operating environment and local context. This includes
monitoring the status of international sanctions and trade agreements.
To implement responsible recruitment practices in the supply chain, adidas has continued its partnership
with the International Organization for Migration (‘IOM’) through its ‘Corporate Responsibility in
Eliminating Slavery and Trafficking’ (‘CREST’) initiative. In early 2022, IOM CREST launched a new resource
for businesses, the ‘Migrant Worker Guidelines for Employers,’ which provides guidance on how to recruit
and employ migrant workers in their supply chains ethically and responsibly. adidas was consulted and
provided input on the development of this resource. ¬
Transparency and recognition
⌐ Through our annual Modern Slavery Statements, annual progress updates, and other public disclosures
on our corporate website and relevant third-party channels, we have shared the actions we have taken to
address forced labor in our global supply chain, documenting risks and remedies. In 2022, we completed a
review of our Modern Slavery Risk Assessment to ensure we accurately identify the potential risks and to
set priorities for further action and engagement in 2023.
In recent years, we have received external recognition for our approach to managing human rights. For
example, we hold overall industry leadership position in the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark of the
World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA), leadership position on the KnowTheChain forced labor benchmark
as the highest-scoring European company, and rank in the top three in the first ever WBA Gender
Benchmark. ¬ ► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/SUSTAINABILITY
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
SUPPLY CHAIN
WORKING CONDITIONS
⌐ Our commitment to ensuring fair labor practices and safe working conditions in our manufacturing
facilities throughout our global supply chain is fundamental to our human rights approach. Our active
efforts are guided by the adidas Workplace Standards, which is our supply chain code of conduct that is
aligned with the FLA ‘Workplace Code of Conduct’ and ‘Principles of Fair Labor and Responsible Sourcing.’
The adidas Workplace Standards are embedded as a contractual obligation in the manufacturing
agreements to ensure workers are employed in fair, safe, and healthy workplaces that are
environmentally sound. In addition, they follow ILO and UN conventions relating to human rights and to
fundamental principles and rights at work, as well as the model code of conduct of the World Federation of
the Sporting Goods Industry (‘WFSGI’).
We also seek to extend our reach by cascading responsibilities to our contractual partners in order to
capture and address potential and actual risks related to possible labor rights violations upstream and
downstream of our supply chain. Specific reference to the code provisions of the ILO core labor
conventions is provided in the adidas Guidelines on Employment Standards. The Social and Environmental
Affairs (‘SEA’) senior management team reviews and approves all policies and implementation processes
of the labor rights program.
In addition to regularly monitoring our supply chain to ensure compliance with the adidas Workplace
Standards, in 2022, we continued to focus on our own purchasing practices in accordance with our
‘Responsible Sourcing Policy’ to ensure that they do not negatively impact our manufacturing partners’
ability to comply with our standards. As a subscriber to the Better Buying Institute, an independent
organization that assesses sourcing practices of participating brands, we continued to collaborate with our
Sourcing team, who took actions to further improve our purchasing practices based on the feedback we
received in the Better Buying reports. In addition, in partnership with Better Buying, we developed an e-
learning training about responsible purchasing practices, which was launched to adidas’ Global Operations
employees. ¬
Managing the impact of covid-19
⌐ From the very outset, adidas has sought to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the
workers in its global supply chain, providing guidance on infectious disease control, occupational safety,
and improvement of workers’ welfare. We continued to uphold our standard manufacturing terms,
including worker rights protection, and assisted key manufacturing partners in securing bank financing to
help them weather the covid-19 crisis. In 2022, we saw a stepwise relaxation of government restrictions in
all countries except for China, which maintained its zero-covid policy. Suppliers in some parts of China
were impacted by lockdowns and by restrictions on the movement of people and materials to and from the
factories. During this time, we continued to ensure legal compliance with respect to pay and benefits for
all workers affected by operational changes due to covid-19, and we closely monitored the working
conditions at every manufacturing facility. ¬
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
TARGETS FOR 2025
⌐ Our social compliance program continues to evolve and is built around three core concepts with targets
for 2025 in place.

1 The S-KPI measures a set of social indicators, such as accident rates, worker satisfaction, and worker empowerment. Due to positive progress in our
suppliers’ overall performance in 2022, we have upgraded our 2025 target for the number of suppliers expected to achieve a ‘4S’ rating. The overall target seeks
to achieve 100% adherence to or 90% overachievement against these foundational social impact measures, with ‘3S’ being the minimum expected supplier
performance.
2 The fair wage benchmarks include industry wages, minimum wages and living wages. These benchmarks are set and tracked through a ‘FLA Fair
Compensation Tool,’ which has broad industry adoption and is being rolled out progressively to strategic Tier 1 suppliers.
3 The measurement of wage parity for production line workers and their immediate supervisors (i.e., line leaders) forms part of a broader gender strategy
rollout to applicable strategic Tier 1 suppliers who complete self-assessments to identify and then close gender gaps in operating practices and procedures.
4 In conducting due diligence we seek to identify, prevent or mitigate potential adverse human rights or environmental impacts, with priority given to addressing
the most severe impacts.
Measuring supplier social impact performance
In 2022, we launched our new social impact KPI (‘S-KPI’). The S-KPI measures suppliers’ social impact
performance through a set of social indicators, such as accident rates, worker satisfaction, and worker
empowerment. By 2025, our initial target was to have 70% of strategic Tier 1 suppliers achieve a minimum
of ‘4S,’ and 100% of strategic Tier 1 suppliers achieve ‘3S’ or better. As we have seen very positive
progress in our suppliers’ overall performance following the end of the pandemic, we have upgraded our
2025 target accordingly and now expect that 90% of our strategic Tier 1 suppliers will achieve a minimum
of 4S or better by 2025. For a detailed description of this new KPI and the progress towards this target in
2022, and adjusted targets, please see later in this chapter. ¬
Improving gender fairness and wages at our suppliers’ factories
⌐ We are committed to upholding responsible sourcing practices, increasing gender equality, and
creating pay equity, with the goal of providing fair compensation for workers in our supply chain,
regardless of their gender. By 2025, we aim to see a progressive improvement in compensation, measured
by fair wage benchmarks, across our strategic Tier 1 suppliers. We also want to achieve gender wage
parity for workers and their supervisors in our strategic Tier 1 suppliers.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Fair compensation: In 2022, we completed wage data collection21 among our strategic suppliers in
Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, representing 62% of all strategic suppliers. We compared this
─
wage data against external benchmarks, such as the applicable legal minimum wage, the FLA Country
Average22, which represents the industry average, the Global Living Wage Coalition’s (‘GLWC’)
benchmark23 if available, and the World Bank International Poverty Line. It is important to note that our
collected data coincides with the first year of covid-19, a time period where wages were impacted by
the disruptions caused by the pandemic, particularly in countries where suppliers experienced long
periods of work suspensions and/or shorter hours of operations.
The data collected shows that payment of wages in these factories did surpass all of the
aforementioned benchmarks. In detail, the data collected for eight factories in Cambodia, the major
sourcing country for apparel, shows that wages paid by adidas suppliers surpassed the legal gross
minimum wage by 50% and the applicable net FLA Country Average24 by 29%. The eleven factories in
Vietnam, the major sourcing country for footwear, are located within three minimum wage zones.
Therefore, their wage data analysis is grouped by their respective minimum wage requirements: In all
three zones, wages paid at adidas factories all surpassed the applicable legal minimum wages by at
least 65%, up to 78%. Where applicable, wages also surpassed the net GLWC Benchmark by 18%. Our
eight surveyed factories in Indonesia are located within five different legal minimum wage groups. As
such, their wage data analysis results are reported under their respective minimum wage
requirements. Across all zones, wages paid surpassed the legal minimum wage by between 7% and
45%.
In addition, we continued to support the evolution of the FLA’s data collection tools by participating in
the FLA’s Fair Compensation Practitioners Working Group. In 2022, the primary focus of this work was
improving the FLA’s ‘Fair Compensation Dashboard,’ which is used to analyze, report, and visualize
wage data. The year 2022 also saw the continued activation of the five levers that heavily influence
wages as outlined in our ‘Fair Compensation Strategy’: legal obligations, responsible sourcing and
purchasing practices, worker productivity, government involvement, and industrial relations.
Specifically, we activated our gender pay parity efforts and continued to focus on closing benefit and
wage-related gaps identified through our compliance activities. In 2023, we will continue to benchmark
our strategic suppliers in the rest of the world, identify and prioritize factories that may require wage
improvements and establish KPIs to help track and measure progress against our five levers.
Gender equality: We aim to bring a gender lens to our strategic suppliers’ operations ensuring that all
workers enjoy the same opportunities, rights, and obligations. To support this aim, in 2022 we
─
launched our ’Gender Strategy for Business Partners’ to guide and help our strategic suppliers in this
process. In addition, we introduced and shared guidelines alongside a self-assessment tool to help
them develop and implement their own gender strategy. The tool is designed to help suppliers identify
gender-related gaps in their operating practices and procedures and provide the building blocks they
need to develop their own gender strategy. In 2023, suppliers will develop improvement plans aimed at
closing potential identified gaps. These insights will help us to track their progress against their plans.
21 Wage data for 2020 was collected in 2021 and 2022 and is self-reported by suppliers. The data presented here was collected in 2021 and covers 62% of our
strategic factories in the three countries. We are planning to report data collected in 2022 in the next reporting cycle.
22 An applicable FLA Country Average is currently only available by country, and not for each applicable minimum wage group and/or region for countries with
multiple minimum wage requirements.
23 A 2020 GLWC benchmark is only available for Vietnam. The GLWC published its first reference value in 2021; it will be used in future benchmarking, and as
more GLWC benchmarks become available, they will be incorporated into our analysis and reporting.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Increasing transparency on human rights across our value chain
As part of our broader risk management processes, we will increase the scope and application of our
HREDD efforts. By 2025, we aim to have a system in place to identify and manage high-risk human rights
issues in 100% of our value chain. In conducting due diligence, we seek to identify, prevent, and mitigate
potential adverse human rights or environmental impacts, with priority given to the most severe impacts.
In 2022, we enhanced the mapping of subcontractors of our Tier 1 manufacturing partners. In addition, as
part of our effort to cascade HREDD processes within our supply chain, we made our key Tier 1
manufacturing partners accountable for implementing their own due diligence efforts, and we tracked that
implementation via our S-KPI tool. This also required our supplier partners to commission social
compliance audits in their subcontractor facilities. ¬
MONITORING AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE
⌐ We regularly assess our manufacturing partners on their ability to provide fair, healthy, and
environmentally sound workplace conditions by conducting announced and unannounced audits by our
own team and by accredited external auditors. Any cases of non-compliance identified during audits are
given a clear time frame for remediation. Potential new manufacturing facilities are assessed in a similar
way, and orders can only be placed if approved by the SEA team. Based on the results of these
assessments, the Sourcing and SEA teams jointly decide on the course of action, ranging from trainings to
enforcement actions, such as sending warning letters or hiring external consultants to help improve
workplace systems or practices. We also operate several grievance channels allowing workers or third
parties to submit complaints about violations of the adidas Workplace Standards and human rights
generally. All third-party complaints received through our grievance channels are reviewed and
investigated, and the outcome is reported on our corporate website.
Manufacturing facilities’ conditions are also inspected by independent auditors through our participation in
the FLA, demonstrating our commitment to independent manufacturing facility inspections and external
verification of our programs. Our program has been accredited three times by the FLA and, in 2022,
remains accredited based on FLA’s annual evaluations. In addition to labor rights assurance, the FLA also
provides external parties with an independently managed ‘Third Party Complaint’ mechanism. adidas was
the subject of two FLA complaints over the course of 2022.
At the end of 2022, adidas worked with 424 independent supplier facilities25 (2021: 509) that manufacture
products for our company in 44 countries (2021: 46). The reduction in facilities reflects the completed
divestiture of Reebok and associated impacts on sourcing operations. The core adidas supply chain has
remained stable in line with our strategy to form long-term relationships with our manufacturing
partners. 63% of our manufacturing partners’ facilities (2021: 67%) are located in the Asia-Pacific region.
The number of licensees we worked with was reduced significantly due to the divestiture of Reebok. In
2022, 39 licensees (2021: 60) manufactured products in 287 factories (2021: 418) across 34 countries
(2021: 39). ¬
Onboarding
⌐ Against the backdrop of the Reebok divestiture, our primary focus in 2022 was on maintaining
partnerships with our existing manufacturing partners rather than onboarding new ones. Consequently,
we saw a marked reduction in the number of initial assessments – the first approval stage for a new entry
into our supply chain – in 58 prospective supplier factories (2021: 142). Of these, 20 factories (2021: 48)
were either rejected directly after the initial assessment identified zero-tolerance issues or were ‘rejected
25 Independent supplier facilities refer to individual Tier 1 facilities (factories) of our manufacturing partners that adidas has a manufacturing agreement with,
and their Tier 1 subcontractor facilities, excluding own factories and licensee facilities. Facilities that work with our licensees are reported separately. Some of
these facilities may produce both for adidas directly and for licensees.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
with a second visit’ due to identification of one or more threshold issues, which means they were rejected
but given the chance to remediate the non-compliance issues within a specific timeframe. The vast
majority (71%) of all initial assessments were undertaken in Asia (2021: 86%), with China accounting for
26% (2021: 42%).
Overall, at the end of 2022, the first-time rejection rate of 34% of all new factories visited remained in line
with the previous year (2021: 34%). Providing focused support to those factories that we have onboarded
has aided us in maintaining a ‘final rejection rate’ of under 5% in 2022. The remediation of non-compliance
issues prior to their onboarding is beneficial for workers as it raises the bar in terms of better workplace
conditions. Manufacturing partners that have threshold issues are normally given three months to
remediate those issues before being re-audited for final acceptance.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Worker satisfaction and grievance opportunities
A robust grievance mechanism is the fulcrum on which workers can raise their concerns and secure
remedies. Since 2017, we have reduced our reliance on local worker hotlines as a complaint mechanism
by building an application-based ‘Workers Voice’ platform: a bespoke, manufacturing-facility-based digital
grievance channel for workers. We have progressively improved and expanded the use of this grievance
mechanism, and in 2022, more than 440,000 workers employed in 134 manufacturing facilities across
17 countries had access, reflecting 100% coverage of our strategic manufacturing partners. Access to a
digital complaint mechanism has proven invaluable during covid-19. Close to 48,000 human and labor
rights complaints (2021: around 52,000) were filed through the Workers Voice platform in 2022, with 99%
of these complaints being closed by the end of 2022. The top complaints received in 2022 were related to
concerns over general facilities (more than 16,000), internal communication (more than 11,000), and
benefits (more than 6,000).
Input received through the Workers Voice platform are tracked by adidas, using KPIs and dashboard
reviews, case satisfaction ratings, and on-site worker interviews. This allows us to evaluate the efficacy of
the grievance channels, see major cases in real time, and undertake timely interventions, where
necessary. It also helps us understand the main challenges and labor rights issues in a manufacturing
facility and track how the facility’s management and their HR teams resolve cases and communicate their
findings. Our evaluation contributes to the facility's overall social impact rating (S-KPI). adidas provides
ongoing capacity building to enhance the facility teams’ capability to improve the effectiveness of the
grievance mechanism. The case satisfaction rate, which allows workers to input their level of satisfaction
with the resolution of complaints, has almost doubled from 39% in 2019 to 77% in 2022. The increase in
satisfaction is partly related to a significant improvement in the response time that it took the factory
management to address workers’ grievances, which decreased from 49 hours in 2020 to less than
17 hours in 2022 due to improvements in communication and transparency in the workplace. The
management teams in the manufacturing facilities have continuously engaged with the facility’s workers
through newsletters and broadcast messages, which has improved the workers’ engagement and the
overall culture in factories.
Complementing the various grievance channels, we expanded the ‘Worker Pulse’ project, a digitalized
short survey launched in 2020 to capture workers’ perception and awareness of their labor rights on
focused areas such as communication, harassment, and abuse, as well as grievance systems. It builds on
what we learned from a previous survey process we initiated in 2016. In 2022, we undertook these digital
surveys in 133 manufacturing facilities (2021: 123) across 17 countries (2021: 16), with more than
85,000 workers participating (2021: 66,000) through a mobile-phone-based application. At its core were six
statements for which the level of agreement or disagreement was assessed. Topics included the
willingness to speak up, to recommend the factory to work at to friends, or the level of comfort when
raising a suggestion or complaint or when talking to supervisors. Results show a steady increase in the
number of favorable respondents across all questions since 2020, from roughly 78% to 87% on average.
The percentage figures indicate the average response on a five-point Likert-type scale where 100%
represents ‘strong agreement’ and 0% ‘strong disagreement.’ This increase in overall worker satisfaction
is also a factor in the increase in the average S-KPI score for our manufacturing partners’ facilities in
2022. This shows that when workers’ voices are being heard and acted upon by the facility’s management,
it can have an impact in improving the overall working conditions within a manufacturing facility.
Manufacturing partners are required to develop and track workplace improvement plans based on
feedback from the Worker Pulse.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Alongside facility-led training, we have also offered tailored training under our ‘Women Leadership
Program,’ first launched in 2016. Building on our team’s learnings, we modified the training approach in
2022, adopting a hybrid model of in-person and online training to accommodate countries that were facing
restrictions due to covid-19. In 2022, more than 1,100 supervisors at factories participated in the program
(Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Vietnam).
2022 also saw an expansion of our mobile-phone-based ‘Digital Training’ project, which was successfully
rolled out at 123 manufacturing facilities in 18 countries in 2021. The digital tool assesses workers’
awareness of their labor rights and remedies, e.g., fire safety, harassment and abuse, and use of
grievance channels. More than 82,000 workers took part in 2022 (2021: 62,000) and averaged a score
higher than 91 out of 100 in the post-test questions, thereby demonstrating very high levels of
awareness. ¬
Manufacturing facility engagements and training sessions
⌐ In 2022, our ability to physically visit our manufacturing partners continued to be limited in some
locations due to the pandemic, while it was restored in other areas. We used these opportunities to
maximize the impact of our facility engagements and training sessions. Through a combination of on-site
and remote or virtual interactions throughout the year, we completed 657 individual facility engagements
in 2022 (2021: 373), and 187 training sessions for manufacturing partners, licensees, workers, and adidas
employees (2021: 149). Training sessions covered a broad range of topics, from our Workplace Standards,
guidelines, and supporting policies, through to targeted training on specific labor, health and safety, and
environmental topics. The amount of training delivered also reflected our focused efforts this year to
educate our manufacturing partners on Worker Empowerment projects and the launch of our new S-KPI
tool. Where virtual training sessions could be held, we continued to utilize this format to attract larger
audiences, reaching a total of 4,535 people, slightly down from the 2021 figure of 5,321.
Wherever possible, we were also able to exchange multiple, shorter virtual interactions, with longer, and
more comprehensive, on-site engagements. In addition to our continuous tracking of covid-19 impacts on
our manufacturing partners’ operations, we used these engagements to monitor remediation activities,
KPI improvement plans, grievance investigations, and follow-up on worker satisfaction surveys.
We continued to work with our licensee partners in 2022 to ensure that they were implementing adidas
Workplace Standards into their manufacturing partners’ operations in a consistent manner. In addition, we
provided our licensees with access to the FLA e-learning materials, which include training courses
covering topics such as human rights, forced labor, responsible manufacturing, and worker
engagement. ¬
Audits
⌐ We audit our manufacturing partners regularly against the adidas Workplace Standards. In 2022, in
addition to our own audits, we continued to use ‘Social and Labor Convergence Program’ (SLCP)
assessments. In 2022, we have accepted 133 SLCP assessments in lieu of our own performance audits
(2021: 142). The SLCP, as an industry assessment tool, will continue to evolve as it is adopted more widely
across the sector, and its methodology is strengthened. With covid-19 continuing to place restrictions in
some parts of the world on our ability to conduct our own on-site assessments in 2022, our monitoring
approach had to remain agile to accommodate lockdowns and travel restrictions. Where possible, we
continued to carry out our regular on-site assessments, while also continuing the use of remote desktop
assessments first piloted in 2020.

1 Every new manufacturing facility has to pass an initial assessment to prove compliance with the ‘adidas Workplace Standards’ before an order is placed. The
data shown includes both initial assessments and initial assessment follow-ups, and includes on-site and desktop assessments.
2 Audits conducted in approved factories that have passed the initial assessment (including on-site and desktop assessments).
3 Includes environmental assessments and wastewater test assessments according to the ‘ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines.’
4 Includes audits done in licensee factories.
A total of 709 social compliance audits (initial assessments, performance audits, and SLCPs) were
conducted in 2022 (2021: 770), 15 of which were conducted remotely (2021: 67). Of the 481 on-site
performance audits conducted, 78% were carried out on an unannounced basis whereby the
manufacturing facility is not informed in advance of the exact date of assessment. The number of audits in
factories manufacturing goods for licensees was reduced from 395 in 2021 to 295 in 2022, reflecting the
reduction in the number of licensee partners connected to the Reebok divestiture.
To complement our broader sustainability efforts, as shown earlier in this chapter, we monitor our
suppliers to ensure compliance with our environmental standards and guidelines and to validate their
performance against annual environmental targets. In 2022, 259 facilities in 20 countries were assessed
and evaluated for their environmental performance, which represented 251 of our key Tier 1 and Tier 2
manufacturing partners, and selected Tier 3 suppliers enrolled in our sourcing sustainability program.
As we continue to increase our focus on added-value advisory services and empowerment projects, which
go beyond our regular audit routine, the number of internally managed audits decreased to 109 in 2022
(2021: 233), with 860 assessments performed by third-party monitors (2021: 741).26
A total of 65% (2021: 54%) of all direct and licensee facilities were audited in 2022. ‘High-risk’ locations in
Asia, which is the most significant sourcing region for adidas, were the subject of extensive monitoring in
2022, with an audit coverage of 84% (2021: 70%). As a general principle, manufacturing facilities located in
high-risk countries are 100% covered in our auditing scope, which means they receive audits annually,
while low-risk countries with strong government enforcement and inspectorate systems, such as
Germany, are considered out of scope for our audit coverage.
We continue to measure suppliers’ ability and performance in conducting their own, internal compliance
monitoring and due diligence processes, which is captured in our S-KPI tool. This replaces the previously
used self-governance audits, which were only required for our best performing. ¬
Audit results and S-KPI performance
⌐ 2022 marks the first year where we have measured supplier performance using the S-KPI tool. The S-
KPI assesses a factory’s performance in delivering a safe and fair workplace by measuring effective due-
diligence processes, as well as the ability to deliver positive social impact. In total, the S-KPI has 15 units
of measures (‘UOM’). These include compliance with threshold and zero-tolerance issues, completion of
remediation plans, accident and absenteeism rates, as well as a range of worker empowerment measures
such as resolution and satisfaction rate of workers’ grievances, participation rate in worker satisfaction
26 Including social and environmental assessments, excluding ZDHC wastewater assessments.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
surveys, and the ratio of females in mid-managerial position. The S-KPI assesses a factory’s performance
in each of the UOMs, based on the information gathered and validated during social compliance audits
which are uploaded to a dashboard for each supplier. The result is a final score (in %) which is converted
to S-rating levels from 1-5, with 5S being the best. The thresholds are set as follows: 1S: 0-29%, 2S: 30-
59%, 3S: 60-79%, 4S: 80-89%, 5S: 90-100%.
In 2022, almost 75% of our key manufacturing facilities achieved a rating of ‘4S’ or better, which
significantly exceeded the original target that we set for 2025 (70% of suppliers rated 4S). This
achievement shows the extraordinary efforts made by our supplier partners to master the requirements of
the S-KPI, and the positive impact of the guidelines and training provided in the two-year lead-up to its
launch. Given this outstanding achievement, we have upgraded our target for the upper band of
performance for our suppliers, and now expect 90% of our strategic Tier 1 suppliers to achieve a minimum
of 4S or better by 2025.
SOCIAL IMPACT PERFORMANCE RATING OF STRATEGIC SUPPLIER FACTORIES BY S-KPI IN %
Of our key licensees, 100% achieved a Licensee Compliance Rating (‘LCR’) of at least 4S, and of these, 33%
received a rating of 5S. This rating mechanism mirrors that of our S-KPI applied to manufacturing
partners and reflects that these licensees have successfully demonstrated that they have embedded
strong governance systems, supply chain management, and purchasing practices compliance
requirements into their business practices. Licensees are also assessed on the existence of policies and
systems to address stakeholder engagement, as well as levels of public reporting and communication. ¬
Non-compliances identified in active factories
⌐ Our manufacturing partners’ facilities are evaluated against a number of critical compliance issues.
While threshold issues are considered serious but correctable non-compliances that can be addressed
through remedial action within a specified timeframe, zero-tolerance issues – such as forced labor, child
labor practices, or critical life-threatening health, safety, and environment conditions – immediately
trigger a warning and potential disqualification of a supplier. During the course of each year, we
continuously track non-compliances identified through manufacturing partners’ performance audits,
collaboration audits, self-governance assessments, and, since 2020, SLCP assessments. We follow up on
all non-compliances and require our manufacturing partners to remediate these findings within a
specified timeframe. The identified issues in 2022 remained largely the same as those reported in 2021.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Labor: Besides identifying non-compliances with the Workplace Standards, our social compliance
team focuses on the use and effectiveness of the facilities’ HR management systems, including any
─
gaps in policies and procedures, related to specific risk areas, such as forced labor, child labor,
freedom of association, or discrimination. As a result, the percentages shown indicate the systemic
shortcomings of active facilities, where corrective action is required to reduce potential risks, rather
than the confirmed presence of a specific case of non-compliance or breach, which requires
remediation.
SHORTCOMINGS IN THE AREA OF LABOR IDENTIFIED DURING AUDITS IN 2022
1 ‘Other’ includes, for example, overtime/holiday rate and other benefits/allowances.
2 ‘No standardized filing’ indicates a factory does not keep relevant information/documents and records that demonstrate compliance with laws and
regulations.
− Health and safety: Fire, electrical, and machine safety are critical areas for existing manufacturing
facilities, and together they accounted for more than 30% of the non-compliances identified in 2022.
The way chemicals were stored and used, including the handling of hazardous chemicals, accounted
for 10% of non-compliance findings reported. A further 9% of the findings related to management
systems, policies, and procedures, and specifically a lack of compliance with our Workplace Standards
and expectation for effective occupational health and safety systems, including the recruitment and
retention of qualified safety staff.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
SHORTCOMINGS IN THE AREA OF HEALTH AND SAFETY IDENTIFIED DURING AUDITS IN 2022
1 ‘Other’ includes, for example, material storage, housekeeping, or waste management.
Remediation of shortcomings
We follow up on all cases of non-compliance and require our manufacturing partners to remediate open
issues within a specified timeframe. For the period 2019 through June 2022, 93% of the threshold issues
identified in our monitoring assessments were found to be fully remediated. A small percentage of issues
identified over this period remain open, the majority of which were found during assessments conducted in
2021 and in the first half of 2022. While in many cases the actual issues will have been resolved, our
approach is to only ‘close’ these in our systems when we have verified evidence of completion and
established that corrective actions taken are sustainable and sufficient to avoid reoccurrence. ¬
Independent FLA audits
⌐ The FLA has assessed the supply chain of its member brands by utilizing a variety of monitoring models
(e.g., in-person, virtual, or a hybrid approach of both in-person/virtual), despite the ongoing challenges
posed by covid-19. This resulted in adidas receiving four ‘Sustainable Compliance Initiative’ (‘SCI’)
Assessments from the FLA in 2022. In addition to manufacturing facility monitoring, the FLA focused its
efforts on more areas, including enhancing virtual monitoring methodology, issuing specific country-
related and topical guidance, supply chain mapping, grievance mechanisms, revising its third-party
complaint mechanism, developing responsible termination guidelines, and continuing its work to measure
and mitigate impacts of covid-19 on the industry’s supply chain. ¬
Enforcement
⌐ Warning letters are an essential part of our enforcement efforts and are triggered when we find
ongoing serious non-compliance issues that need to be addressed by our manufacturing partners’
facilities. We work closely with our manufacturing partners to help them improve their performance.
However, where we face situations of severe or repeated non-compliances, which cannot be resolved, we
do terminate business relationships with facilities. When making such a decision, we always seek to
balance the adverse impacts arising from the unresolved non-compliances against the wider effects that a
business termination can have on the rights and interests of the workers, especially if this triggers layoffs.
In such circumstances, we may extend timelines to ensure a responsible exit is achieved.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Warning letters: In 2022, our close engagement with our manufacturing partners’ facilities has helped
reduce the number of active warning letters to six (2021: 13) across five countries. Compared to the
─
previous year, the overall number of active first-warning letters decreased significantly, from eleven in
2021 to six in 2022; the total number of second warnings even decreased to zero in 2022 (2021: 2).
Manufacturing facilities that receive second-warning letters are only one step away from being notified
of possible termination of the manufacturing agreement and are subject to focused monitoring by our
team. No third-warning letters (which result in business terminations) were issued to our
manufacturing partners in 2022 (2021: 0).
Terminations: In 2022, there were no instances in which a supplier agreement was terminated for
social compliance reasons (2021: 1). ¬

SUSTAINABLE FINANCE
The challenges posed by the impact of climate change and social developments in our societies and
supply chains are huge. Responding to these will require dedicated funding of sustainability initiatives.
In this section of the Report, we provide an overview on our sustainability bond as well as on our
approach to comply with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy that has the objective to channel
investments in the right direction. We will also report about responsibility regarding tax. Through
taxes, governments have the monetary ability to pursue their objectives and take on the responsibility
of further developing their countries.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
EU TAXONOMY
⌐ In 2020, the EU introduced Regulation (EU) 2020/852 to establish the EU Taxonomy framework
(‘Taxonomy’). The purpose of the Taxonomy is to provide a common language and a clear definition of what
is considered ‘sustainable’ in order to direct investments towards sustainable economic activities.
Thereby, the EU’s climate and energy as well as ‘European Green Deal’ targets shall be supported.
The Taxonomy is a classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. An economic
activity is considered Taxonomy-eligible if it is referenced by the Taxonomy and has the potential to help
achieve at least one of the following six environmental objectives:
1) Climate change mitigation
2) Climate change adaptation
3) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
4) Transition to a circular economy
5) Pollution prevention and control
6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.
For an activity to be considered and reported as environmentally sustainable, i.e., Taxonomy-aligned, the
following three prerequisites must be fulfilled:
Substantial contribution: The activity makes a substantial contribution to one of the environmental
objectives by meeting the technical screening criteria defined for this economic activity.
─
Do-No-Significant-Harm (‘DNSH’): The activity fulfills further criteria, which are intended to prevent
significant harm to one or more of the other environmental objectives.
─
Minimum safeguards: The company performing the activity must have implemented minimum
safeguards relating to human rights, including labor rights, corruption, taxation, and fair competition.
─
Reporting scope for fiscal year 2022
The Delegated Regulation (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178) on Article 8 of the Taxonomy specifies
the content, methodology, and presentation of information to be disclosed by financial and non-financial
undertakings concerning the proportion of environmentally sustainable economic activities in their
business, investments, or lending activities. Throughout 2022, the Platform on Sustainable Finance, which
serves as the advisory body to the European Commission on the development of the Taxonomy, published
a detailed draft report on the technical screening criteria concerning environmental objectives 3–6. As per
this draft report, the adidas core business activities – the manufacturing of textiles and footwear as well as
wholesale and retail sale thereof – are referenced by environmental objective number 4, ‘Transition to a
circular economy.’ In addition, a final recommendation concerning the minimum safeguards criteria was
issued by the Platform on Sustainable Finance in October 2022. However, by the end of fiscal year 2022,
the Taxonomy has not been enacted in its entirety. Thus, the timing of the full-scope Taxonomy reporting
obligation, the content details, and the exact interpretation of various components within the Regulation
remained unclear at the time this report was prepared.27 Therefore, the reporting requirements for 2022
are limited to the first two environmental objectives – ‘climate change mitigation’ and ‘climate change
adaptation’ – which do not reference the main economic activities of our industry. However, in contrast to
the previous year, it is necessary to provide information on the degree to which Taxonomy-eligible
economic activities are Taxonomy-aligned and to disclose the corresponding turnover (net sales), capital
expenditure (‘CapEx’), and operating expenses (‘OpEx’) KPIs, accordingly. Furthermore, in 2022, the EU
27 Due to the timing and resources required to prepare the adidas Annual Report 2022, we have only included Taxonomy-relevant publications issued before
January 27, 2023.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
enacted amendments (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214) to the Delegated Regulation, requiring
companies to make specific disclosures on economic activities in connection with the fossil gas and
nuclear energy sectors. Due to the operation of a district heating plant in Germany, we carried out related
activities in 2022, however not to a material extent. Thus, the disclosure requirements as per Annex XII of
the amendments to the Delegated Regulation are not applicable to adidas.
Description of adidas procedure toward compliant 2022 reporting
Building on the experience and learnings from the first-time reporting on Taxonomy-eligible activities
from the previous year, a core team within the adidas Corporate Finance area had the responsibility for the
2022 reporting process. The main tasks of the team were to
− educate the functional and subject matter experts – mainly from the Accounting, Controlling, HR
Workplaces, Supply Chain, and Retail teams – on the reporting requirements, with particular focus on
Taxonomy-alignment criteria,
− define, orchestrate, and lead a structured process to collect all Taxonomy-relevant information from
the subject-matter experts,
− analyze and verify reported information in terms of Taxonomy relevance, correctness, and
completeness,
− ensure that all new and updated Taxonomy-relevant publications that have become available
throughout the course of the year were adequately reflected in this report.
Determination of Taxonomy-eligible activities
As a first step in the 2022 reporting process, the core team identified the Taxonomy-eligible activities at
adidas as referenced in the Taxonomy Regulation. A detailed review of the defined environmental
objectives ‘climate change mitigation’ and ‘climate change adaptation’ confirmed that ‘climate change
mitigation’ is the environmental objective relevant for adidas. The main economic activities of our business
model however are not covered by the environmental objective ‘climate change mitigation,’ and
consequently we have no turnover-generating Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to report.
Furthermore, due to the multitude of potential eligible economic activities, the principle of materiality was
further refined compared to the previous year and applied consistently. Accordingly, an economic activity
category is determined eligible if the corresponding KPI value is at least € 10 million. As a result, eligible
economic activities associated with the environmental objective ‘climate change mitigation’ are reported
for activity categories associated with construction and real estate activities as follows:
− 7.3. Installation, maintenance, and repair of energy efficient equipment
− 7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings (building leases)
The eligible activities identified relate almost entirely to building leases.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Assessment of Taxonomy alignment of Taxonomy-eligible activities
Annex I of the Delegated Regulation lays out the substantial contribution and DNSH criteria in connection
with the eligible economic activities for the environmental objective ‘climate change mitigation.’ Since the
identified Taxonomy-eligible activities relate to the purchase of output from potentially Taxonomy-aligned
activities, performing the Taxonomy assessment was dependent on the input of the relevant information
from third-party suppliers. Due to the expected time and resource investment necessary for assessing all
eligible activities, we prioritized the assessment of those eligible activities that were most material in
terms of volume and value and/or were more likely to be Taxonomy-aligned due to the availability of the
necessary information. Accordingly, we concentrated our efforts on assessing the eligible building leases
in connection with warehouses, own retail stores, and corporate offices. The applicable substantial
contribution and DNSH criteria, which are mentioned in section 7.7 of Annex I of the Delegated Regulation,
predominantly relate to the primary energy consumption as well as the climate-related risks and
mitigation solutions, respectively, in connection with the leased buildings. The substantial contribution
criteria evidence most relevant for adidas in this regard is the existence of an Energy Performance
Certificate (EPC) class A. Many eligible building leases are outside of Europe, which requires the
alignment of this EU-centric energy performance certification with standards and frameworks typically in
use in non-EU countries (e.g., LEED certification). In line with the generally low share of available non-
residential buildings adhering to these energy performance standards across our markets, only a few
eligible leases in 2022 fulfil this criterion, particularly the eligible retail leases where adidas has very
limited ability to influence the design and/or re-development of malls, where many of our stores are
located. Also, certain eligible retail lease locations are heritage sites for which it is not possible to obtain
EPC class A certification. However, we have certain eligible lease contracts in connection with major
warehouse investments in Suzhou (China) and Cheb (Czech Republic), as well as with a major corporate
office investment in Amsterdam (Netherlands) which fulfil the substantial contribution criteria. This
reflects our commitment to de-carbonize our own operations as well as our more pronounced ability to
influence the design and development of major real estate investments in connection with our operational
infrastructure. ► SEE OWN OPERATIONS
The only applicable DNSH criterion for building leases relates to the environmental objective ‘climate
change adaptation’ and refers to the performance of a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment as
per Appendix A to Annex I of the Delegated Regulation. The objective of this criterion is, firstly, the
assessment of the materiality of climate risks affecting the performance of the eligible activity, taking
different climate projections into account depending on the expected lifespan of the activity. Secondly, the
effectiveness of adaptation solutions to mitigate the physical climate risk for the activity needs to be
assessed. We prioritized in the assessment the most relevant eligible activities regarding this DNSH
criterion and used existing information on climate risks and corresponding mitigation solutions that was
gathered as part of our regular business processes (e.g., for insurance purposes). As a result, not all
information was available for a complete and conclusive assessment exactly as per the methodology and
scope prescribed by the Regulation. We therefore assessed the building leases to be not Taxonomy
aligned.
For the remaining eligible activities under category 7.3, a Taxonomy alignment assessment with the
respective criteria laid out in Annex I of the Delegated Regulation was conducted in a structured manner to
an extent considered prudent and meaningful. While the eligible activities fulfil the substantial contribution
criteria, none is considered Taxonomy-aligned as a result of the DNSH assessment.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Determination and reporting of Taxonomy KPIs
Turnover KPI: No Taxonomy-eligible turnover/net sales were identified.
─
CapEx KPI: In comparison to the disclosed CapEx value of € 695 million in this report, the
Taxonomy definition of ‘CapEx’ results in a total value of € 1,587 million (denominator of the
─
‘CapEx KPI’) at adidas (2021: € 1,188 million). The denominator contains, in accordance with the
definition of the Taxonomy and as disclosed in this report, additions to buildings, technical
equipment and machinery, other equipment, furniture and fixtures, right-of-use assets, and other
intangible assets, before depreciation, amortization, and re-measurements. For the calculation of
the numerator of the CapEx KPI, we analyzed the additions in relation to the identified eligible
activities as described above. In this process we conducted several control measures such as
plausibility checks as well as reconciliations to avoid double-counting of additions. In total, the
corresponding numerator of the eligible CapEx KPI amounts to € 867 million
(2021: € 604 million), resulting in a CapEx KPI of 55% eligible and 45% non-eligible CapEx. Most
of the eligible CapEx in 2022 (98%) relates to the leasing of buildings, which amount to
€ 853 million, with the remaining eligible CapEx relating to the installation of energy efficiency
equipment. While a total of € 230 million of eligible CapEx complies with the substantial
contribution criteria, € 0 million of eligible CapEx is reported as Taxonomy-aligned.
In summary, the corresponding numerator of the aligned CapEx KPI amounts to € 0 million,
resulting in a CapEx KPI of 0% aligned and 55% non-aligned CapEx.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
− OpEx KPI
The Taxonomy definition of ‘OpEx’ refers to expenditure for research and development, short-term
leases, maintenance and repair, as well as certain other expenditure28. In 2022, this amounted to
€ 862 million (denominator of the OpEx KPI) at adidas (2021: € 692 million), which compares to
€ 22,511 million of net sales and € 10,260 million of OpEx disclosed in this report. In the context of our
business model, which is the design, development, production, and marketing of a broad range of
athletic and sports lifestyle products, we consider the Taxonomy ‘OpEx KPI’ denominator value to be
insignificant. Consequently, and in line with the Regulation, we have decided not to publish the amount
of eligible OpEx and hence the OpEx KPI numerator. The information has no significant value to the
reader of this report as, for example, our expenditure for research and development would not be
considered Taxonomy-eligible at this point. At the current stage, the numerator would only include
minor OpEx related to information and communication activities. As a result of these considerations,
we report the numerator value of our Taxonomy-eligible OpEx KPI as € 0 (2021: € 0). Consequently, no
further information on the alignment of eligible OpEx can be provided in this report.
Full information on the Taxonomy KPIs according to Annex II of the Delegated Regulation can be found in
this report. ► SEE EU TAXONOMY TABLES
Minimum safeguards
The minimum safeguards form part of the Taxonomy alignment criteria. Their purpose is to ensure that
companies performing environmentally sustainable activities adhere to social norms and certain minimum
governance standards. In its final report to the European Commission on minimum safeguards, the
Platform on Sustainable Finance provided more details on the minimum safeguards criteria and outlined
the specific conditions of non-compliance:
Human rights and labor rights:
− Lack of adequate human rights due diligence process (HRDD) as outlined in the UNGPs and OECD
Guidelines for MNEs, and/or
− evidenced signals of breach of law or human rights
Taxation:
− Lack of tax governance and compliance as well as adequate risk management strategies and
processes, and/or
− evidence of tax law violation
Corruption/bribery:
− Lack of anti-corruption processes, and/or
− cases of court conviction on corruption
Fair competition:
− Lack of promotion of employee awareness of the importance of compliance with all applicable
competition laws and regulations, and/or
− cases of court conviction on violating competition laws
28 By ‘other expenditure,’ we mean expenditure for facility management services, i.e., expenditure relating to the day-to-day servicing of property, plant, and
equipment.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Following the publication of the report on minimum safeguards by the Platform on Sustainable Finance,
our subject-matter experts from the Social and Environmental Affairs, Tax, and Legal areas assessed the
details of the respective criterion. The key objective of this assessment was to determine the extent to
which the herein mentioned governance standards and policy frameworks are already embedded in the
existing adidas policies (e.g., adidas Human Rights policy), standard operating procedures (e.g., adidas
Fair Play Code of Conduct), and the adidas compliance management system. The assessment paid
particular attention to the requirements regarding human rights and labor rights to determine whether
the six steps of the HRDD outlined in the UNGPs and OECD Guidelines for MNEs were implemented
effectively, both in our own operations and in our supply chain.
Based on this assessment, there is no evidence that Taxonomy-eligible activities in 2022 failed to comply
with any of the above-mentioned conditions. More information on our compliance with the respective
criteria can be found in this report:

− Taxation ► SEE OUR APPROACH TO TAX
− Corruption/bribery ► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT
− Fair competition ► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT
Our commitment to sustainability is reflected in the ambitious targets and numerous initiatives that are
outlined in this report. We consider the EU Taxonomy to be a potentially valuable instrument that will help
us validate and adjust our sustainability ambitions over time, particularly when our core business activities
become applicable under the environmental objective ‘transition to a circular economy,’ and a common
interpretation of all aspects relevant to adidas has been established. A precise timeframe for these
developments was not yet available at the time of this report. ¬
APPROACH TO TAX
⌐ We are committed to being compliant with all tax regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate.
We consider the interests of our stakeholders in the business decisions we make in order to ensure the
lasting success of our company.
We do not operate through artificial structures or structure our business in ways that are intended to
result in tax avoidance. Where we have a presence in so-called low-tax jurisdictions, this is related to our
business activities in those jurisdictions and is not created for the purpose of minimizing our tax burden.
While tax is among the many considerations in making business decisions, it is not the main driver in our
decision-making process. ¬
Tax management and governance
⌐ Given the range of activities and locations we operate in, adidas is subject to a wide range of taxes
across the world, including corporate income tax, VAT/GST, employee-related taxes such as payroll and
fringe benefit tax, withholding taxes, property taxes, stamp duties, and other taxes. The purpose of our tax
function is to support and enable business objectives while ensuring compliance and preventing or
minimizing tax risks.
The approach to tax is defined by the Vice President Corporate Tax and is reflected in the tax strategy,
objectives, policies, and internal controls. Economic and social impacts are considered in developing and
executing our tax strategy. The Corporate Tax team reviews our tax strategy on an annual basis, with
significant changes being approved by our Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CFO is ultimately accountable
for compliance with our tax strategy.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Pursuant to our tax policies, the local Directors and Management of each legal entity are responsible for
ensuring compliance with tax regulations. The local teams are supported by the company’s Corporate Tax
team and tax advisors. The Corporate Tax team exercises global governance and is accountable for our
approach to tax. Its main responsibility is to provide global tax advisory, to identify and manage
opportunities and risks, and to ensure tax compliance worldwide. Through partnering with business
functions, the Corporate Tax team aims to understand the needs and perspectives of various stakeholders
internally and externally and to support business objectives while ensuring continued compliance with tax
regulations. Inquiries from and communication with external stakeholders regarding our tax affairs are
managed in accordance with our Global Communication Guidelines.
Our Executive Board is updated on tax matters periodically, including a risk review process every six
months that also forms part of our tax governance framework. Our CFO and/or the Executive Board,
advised by the Corporate Tax team, is ultimately responsible for decisions on topics such as entering into
significant or one-off transactions that may give rise to an increase in tax risk (e.g., mergers and
acquisitions).
Our ‘Fair Play Code of Conduct’ sets out the options available to employees who detect unlawful or
unethical behavior, including anonymous notification or whistleblowing procedures. The adidas AG audit
includes the audit of disclosures in respect to tax.
Interactions with tax authorities
We seek a cooperative relationship with tax authorities. We respond to information requests, whether
formal or informal, and, on a case-by-case basis, decide whether to take the initiative in communicating
business developments of particular significance to the local tax authorities. During 2022 we were not
involved in the public policy regarding tax law or tax law changes in any of the jurisdictions in which we
operate.
Tax planning
We ensure that the tax profile of our activities is aligned with the substance of the operating structures of
our business. Accordingly, transactions have commercial and economic substance, and we do not put in
place arrangements that are contrived or artificial. Our ‘Transfer Pricing Policy’ requires that intragroup
transactions be carried out on an arm’s-length basis. As a result, our profits are derived and taxed in the
jurisdictions where value is created. ¬

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
We are committed to significant value creation – for our company and all its stakeholders. We strive to
create value by converting sales and profit growth into strong operating cash flow, while at the same
time managing our asset base proactively. Our company’s planning and controlling system is therefore
designed to provide a variety of tools to assess our current performance and to align future strategic
and investment decisions to best utilize commercial and organizational opportunities.
INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DESIGNED TO DRIVE SHAREHOLDER VALUE
In order to drive and steer value creation, the company’s Management focuses on a set of major financial
key performance indicators (KPIs). Sales and operating profit growth, paired with a focus on management
of operating working capital, are the main contributors to operating cash flow improvements. At the same
time, value-enhancing capital expenditure benefits future operating profit and cash flow development. Our
strong focus on value creation is reflected in the fact that our Management’s short- and long-term
variable compensation is closely linked to the company’s growth in sales and profitability.
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/COMPENSATION
NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT GROWTH
While in 2022 net income from continuing operations was one of our major financial KPIs, 2023 will be a
transition year where we will be focusing on incremental net sales generation and absolute operating
profit stabilization.
Net sales growth is the reflection of the attractiveness of our product offering driven by innovation and our
ability to identify and respond to latest consumer trends. To ensure that we have the most relevant
information to assess our respective performance, we exclude foreign currency effects and use currency-
neutral net sales growth as one of our major KPIs.
Operating profit as another major KPI helps to drive and improve our company’s operational performance.
The primary drivers to enhance operating profit are as follows:
Sales and gross margin development: Management focuses on identifying and exploiting growth
opportunities that not only provide for future top-line improvements but also have potential to increase
─
our gross margin. Major levers include planning pricing and clearance activities according to market
realities, optimizing our product and channel mix as well as managing product and supply chain costs.
Operating expense control: Management puts high emphasis on tightly controlling operating
expenses. This requires a particular focus on ensuring flexibility in the company’s cost base, especially
─
in marketing and operating overhead expenses. More broadly, marketing expenditure is one of our
largest operating expenses, and at the same time, one of the most important mechanisms for driving
brand desirability and top-line growth. Therefore, we are committed to improving the efficiency of our
marketing investments. This includes concentrating our communication efforts on key global brand
initiatives and focusing our promotion spend on well-selected partnerships with top events, leagues,
clubs, federations, athletes, and cultural marketing partners. We also aim to increase operational
efficiency by tightly managing operating overhead expenses. In this respect, we regularly review our
operational structure by harmonizing business processes, standardizing systems, eliminating
redundancies, and leveraging the scale of our organization.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
CASH FLOW AND OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Actively managing our liquidity, cash flow, and operating working capital remains a key focus for us and
continues to be monitored closely by Management. Generally, due to a comparatively low level of fixed
assets required in our business, the efficiency of the balance sheet depends to a large degree on our
operating working capital management. Operating working capital comprises accounts receivable plus
inventories minus accounts payable. ► SEE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
In this context, the major KPI we use is average operating working capital as a percentage of net sales.
Monitoring the development of this metric facilitates the measurement of our progress in improving the
efficiency of our business cycle.
We strive to proactively manage our inventory levels to meet market demand and ensure fast
replenishment. Inventory aging is controlled carefully to reduce inventory obsolescence and to minimize
clearance activities. As a result, ‘Inventory Days Lasting’ (‘IDL’) is monitored and assessed regularly as it
measures the average number of days goods remain in inventory before being sold, highlighting the
efficiency of capital locked up in products. To optimize capital tied up in accounts receivable, we strive to
improve collection efforts in order to reduce the ‘Days of Sales Outstanding’ (‘DSO’) and minimize the
aging of accounts receivable. Likewise, we strive to optimize payment terms with our suppliers to manage
our accounts payable in the best possible way.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE TARGETED TO MAXIMIZE FUTURE RETURNS
Improving the effectiveness of capital expenditure is another major lever to drive our cash flow generation.
We control capital expenditure with a top-down, bottom-up approach. In a first step, Management defines
focus areas and an overall investment budget based on investment requests from various functions within
the organization. Then, in a second step, our operating segments align their initiatives within the scope of
assigned priorities and available budget. We evaluate potential return on planned investments utilizing the
net present value method. Risk is accounted for by adding a risk premium to the cost of capital, and thus
reducing our estimated future earnings streams where appropriate. By means of scenario planning, the
sensitivity of investment returns is tested against changes in initial assumptions. For large investment
projects, timelines and deviations versus budget are monitored on a monthly basis throughout the course
of the project. In addition to optimizing return on investments, we evaluate larger projects upon
completion and document learnings for future capital expenditure decisions.
OTHER KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
In addition to the major financial KPIs to assess the performance and operational success of our company,
as outlined above, we have identified a set of KPIs that help us track our progress in areas that are
important for our success as well. These KPIs are assessed on a regular basis and managed by the
respective business functions. These other KPIs we are monitoring and that are also part of the strategic
review we are currently conducting include, among others, the development of our member base,
employee engagement, the share of female leadership, and our sustainable article offering.
MEMBERSHIP
⌐ We want to grow long-term relationships with our consumers. Our membership program offers
personalized experiences and rewards our most valued consumers’ engagement and purchasing activity.
Therefore, our goal is to increase the member base over the years, and its growth serves as the metric to
measure our success. ¬
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE
⌐ We are convinced that listening to employees plays a crucial role in our pursuit of creating a best-in-
class employee experience and continuing to attract and retain top talent. We can only tell if we are
successful by asking our people, hence we empower them to share their feedback through our ‘Employee
Listening Survey.’ ¬ ► SEE OUR PEOPLE
FEMALE LEADERSHIP
⌐ Through our focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, we are committed to providing an equal starting
line for all our people, ensuring that everyone has the same career opportunities. One of our commitments
is to increase the share of women in management positions (Director level and above) globally to more
than 40% by 2025. ¬ ► SEE OUR PEOPLE
SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE
⌐ We have a strong commitment to enhance the environmental and social performance of our company.
By doing so, we firmly believe we will not only improve the company’s overall reputation but also increase
its economic value. To measure our progress, we have developed and implemented the KPI ‘Sustainable
Article Offering.’ In addition, we have already been following a comprehensive roadmap with clear targets
for years, and regularly track our progress toward these targets with regard to the environmental and
social impact. We are measuring the environmental footprint of our entire value chain including our own
operations globally as well as monitoring and rating our supplier factories for environmental and social
compliance with our Workplace Standards. We have a long-standing commitment to sustainability
disclosure, providing regular updates about our sustainability performance in this Annual Report as well
as on our corporate website. ¬ ► SEE MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES, AND OUTLOOK ► SEE SUSTAINABILITY
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/COMPENSATION ► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/SUSTAINABILITY
STRUCTURED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM
We have developed an extensive performance measurement system, which utilizes a variety of tools to
measure the company’s performance. Key performance indicators and other important financial metrics
are regularly monitored and compared against initial targets as well as rolling forecasts on a monthly
basis. When negative deviations exist between actual and target numbers, we perform a detailed analysis
to identify and address the cause. If necessary, action plans are implemented to optimize the development
of our operating performance. To assess current sales and profitability development, Management
continuously analyzes the performance of our operating segments. We also benchmark our financial
results with those of our major competitors on a regular basis.
Taking into account the year-to-date performance as well as opportunities and risks, the company’s
expected full-year financial performance is assessed on a monthly basis. Finally, as a further early
indicator for future performance, the results of any relevant recent market and consumer research are
assessed as available.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
In 2022, adidas recorded lower-than-expected results against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and
heightened macroeconomic as well as company-specific challenges. Revenues increased 1% on a
currency-neutral basis. The gross margin decreased 3.4 percentage points to 47.3%. Other operating
expenses as a percentage of sales were up 3.7 percentage points to 45.6%. The company’s operating
margin decreased 6.4 percentage points to 3.0%. Net income from continuing operations decreased 83%
to € 254 million. The decline was partly related to one-off costs in the amount of € 350 million. These
one-off costs are related to our decision to wind down our business in Russia, a settled legal dispute,
higher provisions for customs-related risks, cash-pooling in high inflationary countries as well as to
restructuring costs as part of the company’s business improvement program.
ECONOMIC AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH DECELERATES IN 2022 29
Global economic growth has slowed in 2022, with the global gross domestic product (GDP) increasing
2.9%. The war in Ukraine led to soaring energy and commodity prices, while increasing inflation lowered
household purchasing power and dampened consumer confidence. Global central banks implemented
swift and universal monetary policy tightening resulting in elevated interest rates. This substantially
affected global economic activity as growth in advanced economies slowed to 2.5% in 2022. Coronavirus-
related disruptions, especially in Greater China, continued to dampen growth in parts of the world. Due to
negative spillover effects from advanced economies and weaker external demand, growth in developing
economies nearly halved from 2021 levels to 3.4% in 2022. Overall, extremely high inflation, the monetary
tightening cycle, but also disruptions to both global supply chains and the availability of key commodities
left their mark on advanced and developing economies alike. Globally, risks of escalating geopolitical
tensions and a further decrease of consumer confidence, potentially leading to recessions in developed
economies, remain.
SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY GROWS MODERATELY IN 2022
The global sporting goods industry expanded in 2022 while facing pressure on input costs and supply
chains as well as suppressed demand due to lower discretionary spending amid multi-year high inflation
rates. In addition, strict coronavirus-related lockdown measures continued to be implemented in parts of
the world, particularly in Greater China. While global supply chains were still constrained in the first half
of the year as a result of coronavirus-induced factory closures, industry-wide inventory levels increased
severely in the second half, leading to heightened promotional activity. Despite these challenges, demand
globally benefitted from large-scale sport events, such as the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, the UEFA
Women’s EURO 2022 in England, or the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. Furthermore, existing global trends,
such as the increased penetration of sportswear (‘athleisure’) as well as rising awareness for health and
wellness, accelerated further. Moreover, consumers are holding sporting goods brands accountable for
their sustainability efforts more than ever. Ultimately, brands continued to benefit from an integration of
physical retail and online channels amplified by scaling of digital platforms and membership programs.
For the sporting goods industry, too, risks of lower consumer demand due to pressured discretionary
spending power and a global economic downturn persist.

COST OF SALES INCREASE DRIVEN BY HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS
Cost of sales is defined as the amount we pay to third parties for expenses associated with producing and
delivering our products. In addition, own-production expenses are also included in the cost of sales.
However, these expenses represent only a very small portion of total cost of sales. In 2022, cost of sales
was € 11,867 million, representing an increase of 13 % compared to the prior year level of
€ 10,469 million. This development mainly reflects higher supply chain costs as well as an increased
sourcing volume.
GROSS MARGIN AT 47.3%
In 2022, gross profit decreased 1% to € 10,644 million from € 10,765 million in 2021, representing a gross
margin decrease of 3.4 percentage points to 47.3% (2021: 50.7%). Broad-based price increases were more
than offset by the strong increase in supply chain costs, reflecting increased product costs and freight
expenses, as well as by higher discounts, particularly in the second half of the year. In addition, a less
favorable market, category and channel mix, negative currency developments as well as one-off costs in
the amount of more than € 50 million, reflecting the company’s decision to wind down its business in
Russia as well as higher provisions for customs-related risks, weighed on the gross margin development
in 2022.

ROYALTY AND COMMISSION INCOME AND OTHER OPERATING INCOME INCREASE
In 2022, royalty and commission income increased 31% to € 112 million (2021: € 86 million) due to an
increase in licensing income. Other operating income was up 529% to € 173 million from € 28 million in
2021, mainly reflecting income from post-closing agreements with Authentic Brands Group from the
Reebok divestiture.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES UP 3.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS
Other operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization, mainly consist of marketing and point-
of-sale, distribution and selling, as well as general and administration expenses. In 2022, other operating
expenses were up 15% to € 10,260 million, also reflecting unfavorable currency developments (2021:
€ 8,892 million). As a percentage of sales, other operating expenses increased 3.7 percentage points to
45.6% from 41.9% in 2021. In 2022, marketing and point-of-sale expenses increased 8% to € 2,763 million
(2021: € 2,547 million) as the company continued to invest into the launch of campaigns, especially around
important sport events such as the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, the UEFA Women’s Euro 2022, as well as
the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. In addition, adidas invested into the launch of new products such as the
Adizero Adios Pro 3, the adidas x Gucci collection, and the federation kits for the FIFA World Cup Qatar
2022, as well as into an enhanced consumer experience across both its digital and physical platforms. As a
percentage of sales, marketing and point-of-sale expenses increased 0.3 percentage points to 12.3%
(2021: 12.0%). Distribution and selling expenses increased 17% to 5,601 million in 2022 from
€ 4,782 million in the prior year, mainly reflecting higher personnel and logistic costs. As a percentage of
sales, distribution and selling expenses increased 2.4 percentage points to 24.9% from 22.5% in 2021.
General and administration expenses were up 11% to € 1,651 million (2021: € 1,481 million), mainly driven
by higher professional fees and facility expenses. As a percentage of sales, general and administration
expenses were up 0.4 percentage points to 7.3% (2021: 7.0%). In total, operating overhead expenses
increased 18% to € 7,498 million (2021: € 6,345 million), driven by investments into DTC and
infrastructure. Operating overhead expenses further include more than € 250 million one-off costs related
to the company’s decision to wind down its business in Russia, a settled legal dispute, as well as
restructuring costs as part of the company’s business improvement program. As a percentage of sales,

calculation of basic earnings per share (EPS) was 183,263,629 (2021: 194,172,984).
GAINS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AMOUNT TO € 384 MILLION
In 2022, adidas incurred gains from discontinued operations of € 384 million, net of tax, related to the
Reebok divestiture (2021: gain of € 666 million). ► SEE NOTE 03
NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS OF € 612 MILLION
The company’s net income attributable to shareholders, which in addition to net income from continuing
operations includes the gains from discontinued operations, decreased 71% to € 612 million (2021:
€ 2,116 million). As a result, basic EPS from continuing and discontinued operations decreased 69% to
€ 3.34 versus € 10.90 in 2021. Diluted EPS from continuing and discontinued operations also decreased
69% to € 3.34 (2021: € 10.90).

At the end of December 2022, total assets were down 8% to € 20,296 million from € 22,137 million in the
prior year, as the decrease of cash and cash equivalents as well as of assets classified as held for sale
more than offset the increase of inventories, other current financial assets, and other current assets.

Total current assets decreased 16% to € 11,732 million at the end of December 2022 compared to
€ 13,944 million in 2021. Cash and cash equivalents were down 79% to € 798 million at the end of
December 2022 from € 3,828 million in the prior year. This reduction is mainly due to the negative cash
flow from operating activities, the repurchase of adidas AG shares, as well as the dividend payment for the
year 2021. This decline was only partly offset by the proceeds from the divestiture of the Reebok business
and the issuance of two bonds. Currency effects had a negative impact on cash and cash equivalents in an
amount of € 19 million. Inventories increased 49% to € 5,973 million at the end of December 2022 from
€ 4,009 million in 2021. The increase was mainly driven by higher product and freight costs, a different
order pattern as a result of longer transportation lead times, the termination of the Yeezy partnership, as
well as lower prior year comparables due to last year’s impact from the factory lockdowns in Vietnam. On
a currency-neutral basis, inventories also increased 49%. ► SEE NOTE 08

to last year’s impact from the factory lockdowns in Vietnam. On a currency-neutral basis, receivables were

related to deferred considerations of € 241 million with regards to the divestiture of the Reebok business.
Other current assets were up 24% to € 1,316 million at the end of December 2022 (2021: € 1,062 million)

Total non-current assets increased 5% to € 8,563 million at the end of December 2022 from

assets. Fixed assets were up 4% to € 6,935 million at the end of December 2022 versus € 6,696 million in
2021. Right-of-use assets increased 4% to € 2,665 million (2021: € 2,569 million) due to additions as well
as positive currency effects. Goodwill was up 3% to € 1,260 million (2021: € 1,228 million) reflecting
positive currency effects and other intangible assets increased 22% to € 429 million (2021: € 352 million)
mainly due to additions in software including own created software and new patents. Other non-current
financial assets increased 110% to € 336 million from € 160 million at the end of 2021, mainly related to
the earn-out component with regard to the divestiture of the Reebok business. Deferred tax assets
amounted to € 1,216 million compared to € 1,263 million in 2021. ► SEE NOTE 35
LIABILITIES AND EQUITY
Total current liabilities were up 3% to € 9,257 million at the end of December 2022 from € 8,965 million in
2021. Short-term borrowings increased to € 527 million at the end of December 2022 (2021: € 29 million),
mainly reflecting the reclassification of the equity-neutral convertible bond of € 500 million due to its
maturity in 2023. Accounts payable were up 27% to € 2,908 million at the end of December 2022 versus
€ 2,294 million in 2021, mainly reflecting higher sourcing volumes as well as higher product and freight
costs. On a currency-neutral basis, accounts payable also increased 27%. Current lease liabilities
increased to € 643 million at the end of December 2022 versus € 573 million in 2021 mainly due to lease
modifications and remeasurements. Other current financial liabilities were up 17% to € 424 million from
€ 363 million in 2021, mainly related to higher customs liabilities. Other current provisions increased 9%
to € 1,589 million at the end of December 2022 versus € 1,458 million in 2021, mainly due to increased
provision for returns, partially offset by reduced provisions for personnel. Current accrued liabilities were
down 10% to € 2,412 million at the end of December 2022 from € 2,684 million in 2021, due to lower
accruals for personnel costs related to the company’s annual bonus for its bonus-eligible employees.
Other current liabilities were up 4% to € 452 million at the end of December 2022 from € 434 million in
2021. Liabilities classified as held for sale decreased to € 0 million at the end of December 2022 (2021:

€ 5,334 million in the prior year. Long-term borrowings were up 19% to € 2,946 million at the end of
December 2022 compared with € 2,466 million in the prior year. This increase is mainly due to the
placement of two new bonds with the overall amount of € 1,000 million in November 2022 and was
partially offset by the reclassification of the equity-neutral convertible bond of € 500 million to short-term
borrowings due to its maturity in 2023. Non-current lease liabilities increased 4% to € 2,343 million at the
end of December 2022 from € 2,263 million in the prior year as early lease terminations related to the
winding down of the adidas business in Russia were more than offset by increases of other lease contracts
and currency effects. Other non-current financial liabilities were down 14% to € 44 million at the end of
December 2022 from € 51 million in the prior year, related to embedded derivative financial instruments.
Deferred tax liabilities increased 11% to € 135 million at the end of December 2022 from € 122 million in

Shareholders’ equity decreased 34% to € 4,991 million at the end of December 2022 versus € 7,519 million

the dividend of € 610 million paid to shareholders for the full year 2021, the decrease of hedging reserves
of € 63 million, and a negative currency effect of € 70 million. This development could only be partially
offset by the net income generated in 2022 as well as by the positive effect of the remeasurement of
defined benefit obligations. ► SEE NOTE 26

generated). Net cash used in continuing operating activities was € 458 million (2021: € 2,873 million net
cash generated). This development was mainly due to lower operating profit and higher level of inventory
and accounts receivable in 2022 compared to the prior year.
In 2022, net cash generated from investing activities reached a level of € 495 million (2021: € 424 million
net cash used) and net cash generated from continuing investing activities amounted to € 495 million
(2021: € 415 million net cashed used). This development was mainly due to the proceeds related to the
divestiture of the Reebok business in 2022.
Net cash used in financing activities amounted to € 2,963 million (2021: € 2,991 million) and net cash used
from continuing financing activities amounted to € 2,957 million (2021: € 2,952 million). This is a result of
the proceeds from the issuance of two bonds, repayments of lease liabilities, the repurchase of adidas AG
shares, as well as the dividend payment for the year 2021.
Exchange rate effects negatively impacted the company’s cash position by € 19 million (2021: positive

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
TREASURY
CORPORATE FINANCING POLICY
In order to be able to meet the company’s payment commitments at all times, the major goal of our
financial policy is to ensure adidas’ solvency, to limit financing risks, and to balance financing costs with
financial flexibility. The operating activities of our segments and the resulting cash inflows represent the
company’s main source of liquidity. Liquidity is planned on a rolling monthly basis under a multi-year
financial and liquidity plan.
TREASURY POLICY AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Our Treasury Policy governs all treasury-related issues, including banking policy and approval of bank
relationships, financing arrangements and liquidity/asset management, currency, interest, equity and
commodity risk management, and the management of intercompany cash flows. Responsibilities are
arranged in a three-tiered approach:
The Treasury Committee consists of members of the Executive Board and other senior executives who
decide on the Treasury Policy and provide strategic guidance for managing treasury-related topics.
─
Major changes to our Treasury Policy are subject to the prior approval of the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury department is responsible for specific centralized treasury transactions and for the
global implementation of our Treasury Policy.
─
On a subsidiary level, where applicable and economically reasonable, local managing directors and
finance directors are responsible for managing treasury matters in their respective subsidiaries.
─
Controlling functions on a corporate level ensure that the transactions of the individual business units
are in compliance with our Treasury Policy.
CENTRALIZED TREASURY FUNCTION
In accordance with our Treasury Policy, all worldwide credit lines are directly or indirectly managed by the
central Treasury department. Portions of those lines are allocated to our subsidiaries and sometimes
backed by adidas AG guarantees. As a result of this centralized liquidity management, the company is well
positioned to allocate resources efficiently throughout the organization. The company’s debt is generally
unsecured and may include standard covenants. We maintain good relations with numerous partner
banks, thereby avoiding a high dependency on any single financial institution. Banking partners of the
company and our subsidiaries are required to have at least a BBB- long-term investment grade rating by
Standard & Poor’s or an equivalent rating by another leading rating agency. We authorize our companies
to work with banks with a lower rating only in very exceptional cases. To ensure optimal allocation of the
company’s liquid financial resources, subsidiaries transfer excess cash to our headquarters in all
instances where it is legally and economically feasible. In this regard, the standardization and
consolidation of our global cash management and payment processes, including automated domestic and
cross-border cash pools, are a key priority for our centrally managed Treasury department. In addition,
the department is responsible for effective management of our currency exposure and interest rate risks.
► SEE NOTE 02
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
STANDARD COVENANTS
In the case of our committed credit facilities, we have entered into various legal covenants. These legal
covenants may include limits on the disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens, cross-
default provisions, and change of control. However, our financial arrangements do not contain any
financial covenants. If we fail to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver, borrowings would
become due and payable immediately. As of December 31, 2022, we were in full compliance with all our
covenants. We are fully confident we will continue to be compliant with these covenants going forward. We
believe that cash generated from operating activities, together with access to internal and external
sources of funds, will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital needs.
CREDIT RATINGS
adidas received strong first-time investment-grade ratings by both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s in
August 2020. Standard & Poor’s gave adidas an ‘A+’ rating, and Moody’s granted the company an ‘A2’
rating. The initial outlook for both ratings was ‘stable’ as both rating agencies recognized the company’s
strong credit metrics, robust liquidity profile, and conservative financial policies. In November 2022, both
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s revised their outlook for adidas to ‘negative’ due to a deterioration in credit
metrics amid pressure on the company’s operating performance from economic as well as company
specific challenges. In February 2023, Standard & Poor’s lowered its rating on adidas to ‘A-‘, while
Moody’s downgraded the company to ‘A3’, both with a ‘negative’ outlook. These downgrades reflected a
further downward revision of credit metrics following the release of the company’s financial guidance for
2023. Overall, adidas' investment grade credit ratings continue to ensure an efficient access to capital
markets.
SYNDICATED CREDIT FACILITY
In 2020, adidas took several steps to considerably strengthen its financial profile. In November 2020,
adidas entered into a new € 1,500 million syndicated credit facility with twelve of its partner banks. This
credit facility agreement was subsequently amended in October 2021 and last in November 2022. The
amended and restated credit facility with eleven partner banks has a size of € 2,000 million and runs until
November 2027.
SUSTAINABILITY BOND
In September 2020, adidas successfully priced its first sustainability bond as the company continued to
execute on its ambitious long-term sustainability roadmap while at the same time further optimizing its
capital structure and financing costs. At the time of the issuance, the € 500 million bond had a term of
eight years and a coupon of 0.00%. It has been listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and has
denominations of € 100,000. Adidas plans to use the proceeds of the sustainability bond to finance and
refinance, in whole or in part, eligible sustainable projects, as defined in the sustainability bond
framework. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount allocated to eligible sustainable projects was
€ 432.7 million.

On top of the above-mentioned placements, the company has further outstanding bonds: a bond of € 400
million issued in 2014, and one outstanding equity-neutral convertible bond, which was issued in 2018. The
bond of € 400 million matures in October 2026 and has a coupon of 2.25%. The equity-neutral convertible
bond of € 500 million was issued in September 2018, with a coupon of 0.05%, and is due in September
2023. Additionally, in September 2020, adidas successfully issued two bonds amounting to € 1,000 million
in total. The four-year bond of € 500 million matures in September 2024 and has a coupon of 0.00%, while

ADDITIONAL CREDIT LINES
In addition to the syndicated credit facility and access to bond markets, the company’s financial flexibility is
ensured by the availability of further credit facilities. At the end of 2022, committed and uncommitted
credit lines, including the syndicated loan facility, amounted to € 4,090 million (2021: € 4,169 million), of
which € 3,998 million was unutilized (2021: € 4,058 million). Committed and uncommitted credit lines
represent approximately 51% and 49% of total credit lines, respectively (2021: 38% and 62%, respectively).
In addition, we have an unused multi-currency commercial paper program in the amount of € 2,000 million
available (2021: € 2,000 million). We monitor the ongoing need for available credit lines based on the
current level of debt and future financing requirements.
GROSS BORROWINGS INCREASE
The company’s gross borrowings, the vast majority of which are denominated in euro, are composed of
bank borrowings as well as the outstanding bonds and the equity-neutral convertible bond. Gross
borrowings increased 39% to € 3,473 million at the end of 2022 from € 2,495 million in the prior year. The
total amount of bonds outstanding at the end of 2022 was € 3,381 million (2021: € 2,384 million). Bank

In 2020, the definition of net borrowings was adapted to adjusted net borrowings in order to reflect
changes in the company’s Financial Policy. The most significant difference between the previous net
borrowings definition and the adjusted net borrowings definition was the inclusion of the present value of
future lease and pension liabilities. In 2022, the methodology for calculating adjusted net borrowings was
revised to align with broader market practice and the approach of rating agencies. The main change of the

INTEREST RATE INCREASES SLIGHTLY
The weighted average interest rate on the company’s gross borrowings slightly increased to 0.8% in 2022
(2021: 0.7%). This development was mainly due to the issuance of two new € 500 million bonds with
coupons of 3.00% and 3.125% respectively in November 2022. Fixed-rate financing represented 100% of
total gross borrowings at the end of 2022 (2021: 100%). There were no variable-rate borrowings at the end

EFFECTIVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT IS A KEY PRIORITY
As a globally operating company, adidas is exposed to currency risks. Therefore, effective currency
management is a key focus of our Treasury department, with the aim of reducing the impact of currency
fluctuations on non-euro-denominated net future cash flows. In this regard, hedging US dollars is a
central part of our hedging program. This is a direct result of our Asian-dominated sourcing, which is
largely denominated in US dollars. In 2022, our Treasury department managed a net deficit of around
US $ 7,500 million related to business activities (2021: US $ 7,300 million). Thereof, around
US $ 6,100 million was against the euro (2021: US $ 6,000 million). As governed by our Treasury Policy, we
have established a hedging program on a rolling basis up to 24 months in advance, under which the vast
majority of the anticipated seasonal hedging volume is secured approximately six months prior to the start

company as a whole. ► SEE OUTLOOK ► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT

NET SALES INCREASE 8%
Sales of adidas AG comprise external revenues generated by adidas Germany with products of the adidas
and Reebok (until February 2022) brands as well as revenues from foreign subsidiaries. Revenues of
adidas AG also include royalty and commission income, mainly from affiliated companies, revenues from
central distribution, and other revenues. From March 2022 onwards the commission income for the
Reebok sales is shown in other revenues. In 2022, adidas AG net sales increased 8% to € 4,814 million
compared to € 4,475 million in the prior year.
OTHER OPERATING INCOME UP 89%
In 2022, other operating income of adidas AG increased 89% to € 1,226 million (2021: € 649 million). This
development was primarily due to higher positive currency effects.
OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASE 39%
In 2022, other operating expenses for adidas AG increased 39% to € 3,415 million (2021: € 2,462 million).
This was largely attributable to higher currency losses.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION UP 20%
Depreciation and amortization for adidas AG relating to intangible and tangible fixed assets increased 20%
to € 140 million in 2022 (2021: € 117 million).
OPERATING RESULT SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW PRIOR YEAR LEVEL
In 2022, adidas AG generated an operating loss of € 117 million. This was significantly below the prior year
level of plus € 32 million and mainly due to higher expenses.
INCREASE OF THE FINANCIAL RESULT
The financial result of adidas AG increased 17% to € 2,237 million in 2022 (2021: € 1,916 million). The
increase was attributable to higher income from dividends partially offset by lower profit transfers from
affiliated companies under profit and loss transfer agreements.
NET INCOME ABOVE PRIOR YEAR LEVEL
Net income, after taxes of € 63 million (2021: € 98 million), amounted to € 2,057 million in 2022 and was

TOTAL ASSETS BELOW PRIOR YEAR
At the end of December 2022, total assets decreased 5% to € 10,475 million compared to € 11,061 million
in the prior year. This development was mainly a result of the decrease in cash and cash equivalents as
well as securities that was only partially offset by the increase in receivables and other assets.
SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY DOWN 27%
Shareholders’ equity decreased 27% to € 2,767 million at the end of 2022 (2021: € 3,801 million). The
equity ratio decreased to 26.4% (2021: 34.4%), mainly due to the repurchase of adidas AG shares in the
amount of € 2,500 million.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
PROVISIONS INCREASE 5%
Provisions were up 5% to € 833 million at the end of 2022 (2021: € 797 million). The increase primarily
resulted from higher provisions for pending risks concerning valuation units.
LIABILITIES AND OTHER ITEMS UP 6%
At the end of December 2022, liabilities and other items increased 6% to € 6,875 million (2021:
€ 6,463 million). This is mainly due to the issuance of bonds in 2022.
CASH OUTFLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES REFLECTS CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
adidas AG has a syndicated credit facility of € 2,000 million and additional bilateral credit lines of € 900
million. In addition, the company has a multi-currency commercial paper program in an amount of
€ 2,000 million. ► SEE TREASURY
In 2022, operating activities of adidas AG resulted in a cash outflow of € 1,699 million (2021: cash inflow of
€ 811 million). The change versus the prior year was mainly a result of higher receivables. Net cash inflow
from investment activities was € 2,518 million (2021: € 1,785 million). This was primarily attributable to
higher dividend income. Financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of € 2,223 million (2021:
€ 2,252 million). The net cash outflow from financing activities mainly relates to the repurchase of adidas
AG shares, the dividend payment, and the issuance of bonds. As a result of these developments, cash and
cash equivalents of adidas AG decreased to € 195 million at the end of December 2022 compared to
€ 1,600 million at the end of the prior year.
adidas AG is able to meet its financial commitments at all times.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO § 315A AND § 289A OF THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE
AND EXPLANATORY REPORT
COMPOSITION OF SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL
The nominal capital of adidas AG amounts to € 180,000,000 (as at December 31, 2022) and is divided into
the same number of registered no-par-value shares with a notional pro rata amount in the nominal capital
of € 1 each. In the 2022 financial year, the nominal capital and the number of shares were reduced due to
the cancelation of € 12,100,000 treasury shares and the capital reduction with effect from
November 28, 2022. The shares are fully paid in. Any claim on the part of the shareholders to the issuance
of individual share certificates is generally excluded pursuant to § 4 section 7 of the Articles of Association
unless such issuance is required in accordance with the regulations applicable at a stock exchange where
the shares are admitted. Pursuant to § 67 section 2 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG),
in relation to adidas AG, only a person who is registered accordingly in the share register shall be deemed
a shareholder. Each share grants one vote at the Annual General Meeting and determines the
shareholders’ share in the company’s profit. All shares carry the same rights and obligations. The
shareholders’ individual rights and obligations follow from the provisions of the German Stock Corporation
Act, in particular from §§ 12, 53a et seq., 118 et seq. and 186 AktG. As at December 31, 2022, adidas AG
held in total 1,462,802 treasury shares, which do not confer any rights to the company in accordance with
§ 71b AktG. ► SEE NOTE 26
In the USA, adidas AG has issued American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). ADRs are deposit certificates of
non-US shares that are traded instead of the original shares on US stock exchanges. Two ADRs equal one
adidas AG share. ► SEE OUR SHARE
RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING RIGHTS OR TRANSFER OF SHARES
The company is not aware of any contractual agreements with adidas AG or other agreements restricting
voting rights or the transfer of shares. Based on the Code of Conduct and internal guidelines of adidas AG
and based on Article 19 section 11 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation),
however, particular trade prohibitions do exist for members of the Supervisory Board and the Executive
Board as well as employees with regard to the purchase and sale of adidas AG shares in connection with
the (time of) publication of quarterly results as well as half-year and full-year financial reports.
In addition, restrictions of voting rights may exist pursuant to, inter alia, § 136 AktG or for treasury shares
pursuant to § 71b AktG as well as due to capital market regulations, in particular pursuant to §§ 33 et seq.
German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz – WpHG).
The shares that were issued to employees of adidas AG in the context of the employee stock purchase plan
and to employees of subsidiaries participating in the employee stock purchase plan are not subject to any
lock-up periods, unless such a lock-up period is stipulated in locally applicable regulations. Employees
who hold the shares which they purchased themselves (investment shares) for at least one year will
subsequently receive one share for every six investment shares without having to pay for such share
(matching share) if they are still adidas employees at that point in time. If employees transfer, pledge, or
hypothecate investment shares in any way during the one-year vesting period, the right to receive
matching shares ceases.
SHAREHOLDINGS IN SHARE CAPITAL EXCEEDING 10% OF VOTING RIGHTS
The company has not been notified of, and is not aware of, any direct or indirect shareholdings in the share
capital of adidas AG reaching or exceeding 10% of the voting rights.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
SHARES WITH SPECIAL RIGHTS
There are no shares bearing special rights. In particular, there are no shares with rights conferring
powers of control.
VOTING RIGHT CONTROL IF EMPLOYEES HAVE A SHARE IN THE CAPITAL
Like other shareholders, employees who hold adidas AG shares can exercise their control rights in
accordance with statutory provisions and the Articles of Association. This also applies to the shares
acquired by a service provider as part of the employee stock purchase plan. Employees may exercise their
voting rights from these shares directly or indirectly.
EXECUTIVE BOARD APPOINTMENT AND DISMISSAL
Pursuant to § 6 of the Articles of Association and § 84 AktG, the Supervisory Board is responsible for
determining the exact number of members of the Executive Board, for their appointment and dismissal as
well as for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The adidas AG Executive Board, which, as
a basic principle, comprises at least two members, consists of the CEO and four further members as at
the balance sheet date. Executive Board members may be appointed for a maximum period of five years.
Such appointments may be renewed and the terms of office may be extended, provided that no term
exceeds five years. ► SEE EXECUTIVE BOARD
The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment as a member of the Executive Board or CEO for good
cause such as gross negligence of duties or a vote of no confidence by the Annual General Meeting.
As adidas AG is subject to the regulations of the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz –
MitbestG), the appointment of Executive Board members and also their dismissal require a majority of at
least two thirds of the Supervisory Board members (§ 31 MitbestG). If such a majority is not established in
the first vote by the Supervisory Board, the Mediation Committee has to present a proposal which,
however, does not exclude other proposals. The appointment or dismissal is then made in a second vote
with a simple majority of the votes cast by the Supervisory Board members. Should the required majority
not be established in this case either, a third vote, again requiring a simple majority, must be held in which
the Chair of the Supervisory Board has two votes.
If the Executive Board does not have the required number of members, the competent court must, in
urgent cases, make the necessary appointment upon application (§ 85 section 1 AktG).
AMENDMENTS TO THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
Pursuant to §§ 119 section 1 number 6, 179 section 1 sentence 1 AktG, the Articles of Association of adidas
AG can, in principle, only be amended by a resolution of the Annual General Meeting. Pursuant to § 21
section 3 of the Articles of Association in conjunction with § 179 section 2 sentence 2 AktG, the Annual
General Meeting of adidas AG principally resolves upon amendments to the Articles of Association with a
simple majority of the votes cast and with a simple majority of the nominal capital represented when
passing the resolution. If mandatory legal provisions stipulate a larger majority of voting rights or capital,
this majority is applicable. When it comes to amendments solely relating to the wording, the Supervisory
Board is authorized to make these modifications in accordance with § 179 section 1 sentence 2 AktG in
conjunction with § 10 section 1 sentence 2 of the Articles of Association.
AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD
The authorizations of the Executive Board are regulated by §§ 76 et seq. AktG in conjunction with §§ 7
and 8 of the Articles of Association. The Executive Board is responsible, in particular, for managing the
company and represents the company judicially and extra-judicially.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
AUTHORIZATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD TO ISSUE SHARES
The authorization of the Executive Board to issue shares is regulated by § 4 of the Articles of Association
and by statutory provisions:
AUTHORIZED CAPITAL
Until August 6, 2026, the Executive Board is authorized to increase the nominal capital, subject to
Supervisory Board approval, by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several times
─
by no more than € 50,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2021/I). The Executive Board may, subject
to Supervisory Board approval, exclude residual amounts from shareholders' subscription rights.
Until August 6, 2026, the Executive Board is also authorized to increase the nominal capital, subject to
Supervisory Board approval, by issuing new shares against contributions in kind and/or cash once or
─
several times by no more than € 20,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2021/II). The Executive
Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude residual amounts from
shareholders’ subscription rights and to wholly or partly exclude shareholders’ subscription rights
when issuing shares against contributions in kind. Additionally, the Executive Board may, subject to
Supervisory Board approval, exclude shareholders’ subscription rights if the new shares against
contributions in kind are issued at a price not significantly below the stock market price of the
company’s shares already quoted on the stock exchange at the point in time when the issue price is
ultimately determined, which should be as close as possible to the placement of the shares; this
exclusion of subscription rights can also be associated with the listing of the company’s shares on a
foreign stock exchange. The authorization to exclude subscription rights under this authorization,
however, may only be used to the extent that the pro-rata amount of the new shares in the nominal
capital together with the pro-rata amount in the nominal capital of other shares which have been
issued while excluding subscription rights by the company since May 12, 2021, subject to the exclusion
of subscription rights on the basis of an authorized capital or following a repurchase or for which
subscription or conversion rights or subscription or conversion obligations have been granted, through
the issuance of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants, does not exceed 10% of the nominal
capital existing on the date of the entry of this authorization with the commercial register or – if this
amount is lower – as of the respective date on which the resolution on the utilization of the
authorization is adopted. The previous sentence does not apply to the exclusion of subscription rights
for residual amounts. The Authorized Capital 2021/II must not be used to issue shares within the scope
of compensation or participation programs for Executive Board members or employees or for
members of the management bodies or employees of affiliated companies. ► SEE NOTE 26
CONTINGENT CAPITAL
The nominal capital of the company is conditionally increased by up to € 12,500,000 (Contingent Capital
2022). The Contingent Capital serves the purpose of granting holders or creditors of bonds that were
issued based on the resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2022, subscription or conversion
rights relating to not more than a total of 12,500,000 shares in compliance with the corresponding
conditions of the bonds. Based on the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on
May 12, 2022, the Executive Board is authorized to issue bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds
(together ‘bonds’) in an aggregate nominal value of up to € 4,000,000,000 with or without a limited term
against contributions in cash once or several times until May 11, 2027, and to guarantee bonds issued by
subordinated Group companies. The Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board
approval, to exclude shareholders’ subscription rights for bonds insofar as this is required for residual
amounts, and to also exclude shareholders’ subscription rights insofar as and to the extent that this is
necessary for granting subscription rights to which holders or creditors of previously issued bonds are
entitled. Finally, the Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to also exclude
shareholders’ subscription rights insofar as the bonds are issued against contributions in cash and the
issue price of the bonds is not significantly below the hypothetical market value of these bonds and the
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
number of shares to be issued do not exceed 10% of the nominal capital. Shares which are issued or sold
in accordance with § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG during the term of this authorization until its
utilization, as well as shares to be issued or granted during the term of this authorization on the basis of
bonds issued with the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance with this provision utilizing another
authorization, shall be attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%. The total number of shares to be
issued under bonds which are issued with the exclusion of subscription rights based on the authorization
and of shares which are issued from an authorized capital with the exclusion of subscription rights during
the term of the authorization may not exceed a pro-rata amount of the nominal capital of 10% on the date
of the entry of this authorization with the Commercial Register. Notwithstanding the Supervisory Board’s
right to determine further approval requirements, the Executive Board requires the Supervisory Board’s
approval for the issuance of bonds based on the resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2022,
with the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights.
The Executive Board has so far not utilized the authorization to issue bonds granted by the Annual General
Meeting on May 12, 2022.
AUTHORIZATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD TO REPURCHASE SHARES
The authorizations of the Executive Board to repurchase adidas AG shares arise from §§ 71 et seq. AktG
and, as at the balance sheet date, from the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on
May 12, 2021.
Until May 11, 2026, the Executive Board is authorized to repurchase adidas AG shares in an amount
totaling up to 10% of the nominal capital at the date of the resolution (or, as the case may be, a lower
amount of nominal capital at the date of utilization of the authorization) for any lawful purpose and within
the legal framework. The authorization may be used by the company but also by its subordinated Group
companies or by third parties on account of the company or its subordinated Group companies or third
parties assigned by the company or one of its subordinated Group companies.
The repurchase can be carried out via the stock exchange, through a public invitation to submit sale offers,
through a public repurchase offer, or through granting tender rights to shareholders. The authorization
furthermore sets out the lowest and highest nominal value that may be granted in each case.
The purposes for which treasury shares repurchased based on this authorization may be used are set out
in the resolution on Item 12 of the Agenda for the Annual General Meeting held on May 12, 2021. The
shares may, in particular, be used as follows:
They may be sold on the stock exchange or through a public offer to all shareholders in relation to their
shareholding quota; in case of an offer to all shareholders, subscription rights for residual amounts
─
are excluded. The shares may also be sold differently, provided the shares are sold in exchange for a
cash payment and at a price that, at the time of the sale, is not significantly below the stock market
price of the company’s shares with the same features; the prorated amount of the nominal capital
which is attributable to the aggregate number of shares sold under this authorization may not exceed
10% of the nominal capital. The prorated amount of the nominal capital attributable to new shares
issued between May 12, 2021, and the sale of the shares based on an authorized capital with the
exclusion of shareholders’ subscription rights pursuant to § 203 section 1 in conjunction with § 186
section 3 sentence 4 AktG shall be attributed to the limit of 10%. Likewise, the prorated amount of the
nominal capital that is attributable to shares which may be issued due to bonds with warrants and/or
convertible bonds which are linked to subscription or conversion rights or obligations or the company’s
right to delivery of shares, provided these bonds are issued on the basis of authorizations pursuant to
§§ 221 section 4, 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG between May 12, 2021, and the sale of the shares, shall
also be attributed to the limit of 10%.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The shares may be offered and assigned as consideration for the direct or indirect acquisition of
companies, parts of companies or participations in companies or other business assets, especially real
─
estate and rights to real estate or receivables (also from the company) or within the scope of company
mergers.
They may be offered and sold as consideration for the acquisition of industrial property rights or
intangible property rights or for the acquisition of licenses relating to such rights, also through
─
subordinated Group companies.
They may be used for purposes of meeting the subscription or conversion rights or obligations or the
company’s right to delivery of shares arising from bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds
─
issued by the company or its subordinated Group companies.
In connection with employee stock purchase plans, the shares may be used in favor of (current and
former) employees of the company and its affiliated companies as well as in favor of (current and
─
former) members of management bodies of the company’s affiliated companies, whereas the amount
of shares must not exceed 5% of the nominal capital neither at the point in time when this
authorization becomes effective nor at the point in time when the shares are used. Shares assigned to
members of the Executive Board as compensation in the form of a share bonus based on this
authorization are to be attributed to this limit.
They may be canceled without such cancelation requiring an additional resolution of the Annual
General Meeting.
─
Furthermore, the shares may be assigned to members of the Executive Board as compensation in the
form of a share bonus subject to the provision that resale by the Executive Board members shall only be
permitted following a lock-up period of at least four years. Responsibility in this case lies with the
Supervisory Board. The amount of shares which may be used for such purposes must not exceed 5% of the
nominal capital, neither at the point in time when this authorization becomes effective nor at the point in
time when the shares are used or promised. Shares used based on this authorization shall be attributed to
this limit.
The rights of shareholders to subscribe treasury shares shall be excluded to the extent that such shares
are used pursuant to the aforementioned authorization. The Supervisory Board may determine that
transactions based on this authorization may only be carried out subject to the approval of the Supervisory
Board or one of its committees.
Within the scope of the authorization resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2021, the
Executive Board is furthermore authorized to conduct the share buyback also by using equity derivatives
which are arranged with a credit institution or financial services institution in close conformity with market
conditions or by using a multilateral trading facility within the meaning of § 2 section 6 Stock Exchange Act
(Börsengesetz). adidas AG is authorized to acquire options which entitle the company to purchase shares
of the company upon the exercise of the options (call options) and/or to sell options which require the
company to purchase shares of the company upon the exercise of the options by the option holders (put
options), or to use a combination of call and put options or other equity derivatives if the option conditions
ensure that the shares delivered for these equity derivatives were purchased in compliance with the
principle of equal treatment. All share purchases using the aforementioned equity derivatives are limited
to a maximum value of 5% of the nominal capital existing at the date on which the resolution was adopted
by the Annual General Meeting (or, as the case may be, a lower amount of nominal capital at the date of
exercising the authorization). The term of the options may not exceed 18 months and must furthermore be
chosen in such a way that the shares are purchased upon the exercise of the options no later than
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
May 11, 2026. The authorization to purchase adidas AG shares while using equity derivatives or via
multilateral trading facilities also contains specifications on the highest and lowest amount of
consideration paid per share.
For the use, the exclusion of subscription rights and the cancelation of shares purchased using equity
derivatives or a multilateral trading facility, the general provisions adopted by the Annual General Meeting
(as set out earlier) apply accordingly.
In the 2022 financial year, the Executive Board utilized the authorization to purchase adidas AG shares in
the context of the first tranche of the Share Buyback Program 2022-2025 and the share buyback program
for returning the cash proceeds from the Reebok divestiture to the shareholders (‘Additional Share
Buyback Program 2022’). In the first tranche of the Share Buyback Program 2022–2025, adidas AG
purchased 4,156,558 adidas AG shares. Under the Additional Share Buyback Program 2022, a further
8,978,138 adidas AG shares were purchased. In the year under review, adidas AG thus purchased
13,134,696 adidas AG shares in total. ► SEE NOTE 26
CHANGE OF CONTROL/COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS
The essential agreements that provide for regulations in the case of a change of control are the material
financing agreements of adidas AG. In the case of a change of control, these agreements, as is customary
in the market, entitle the creditor/bondholder to termination and early calling-in.
No compensation agreements were entered into with members of the Executive Board or employees
relating to the event of a takeover bid.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE BY SEGMENT
adidas has divided its operating activities into the following segments: EMEA, North America, Greater
China, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.
EMEA
In 2022, sales in EMEA increased 9% on a currency-neutral basis and 10% in euro terms to € 8,550 million
from € 7,760 million in 2021. The currency-neutral increase was driven by a strong double-digit growth in
Performance reflecting excellent growth in Football and Running, as well as a strong double-digit increase
in Outdoor, and mid-single-digit growth in Training. At the same time, Lifestyle revenues grew at a mid-
single-digit rate.

Gross margin in EMEA decreased 0.3 percentage points to 50.5% from 50.8% in 2021. The positive pricing
effect and favorable currency fluctuations were more than offset by the significant increase in supply chain
costs, higher discounting, and a less favorable market and channel mix. Operating expenses were up 17%
to € 2,683 million versus € 2,294 million in 2021, mainly driven by a double-digit increase in operating
overheads. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were up 1.8 percentage points to 31.4% (2021:
29.6%). Operating profit in EMEA improved 1% to € 1,679 million versus € 1,658 million in the prior year.
As a result of the lower gross margin and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales, operating
margin was down 1.7 percentage points to 19.6% (2021: 21.4%).

NORTH AMERICA
Revenues in North America increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis and 25% in euro terms to

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
OUTLOOK
In 2023, we expect macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions to continue dampening
consumer sentiment. Elevated recession risks in Europe and North America as well as uncertainty
around the speed and extent of the recovery in Greater China will also affect the sporting goods
industry. In addition, company-specific challenges such as high inventory levels and the termination of
the Yeezy partnership are forecast to weigh on the company’s operational and financial performance.
While we continue to review future options for the utilization of our Yeezy inventory, our FY 2023
guidance already accounts for the significant adverse impact from not selling the existing stock.
Compared to the prior year this would lower revenues by around € 1,200 million and operating profit by
around € 500 million in 2023. Should we irrevocably decide not to repurpose any of the existing Yeezy
product, this would result in the write-off of the existing Yeezy inventory and would lower the operating
profit by an additional around € 500 million this year. In addition, we expect one-off costs of up to € 200
million in 2023 which are part of a strategic review the company is currently conducting. Against this
background, we project currency-neutral sales to decline at a high-single-digit rate and expect to
report an operating loss of € 700 million in 2023.

► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT
GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH TO DECELERATE SHARPLY IN 202330
Global gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to grow only 1.7% in 2023 in light of a further tightening
of monetary policy as global central banks aim to keep soaring inflation under control. Additionally, the
war in Ukraine is expected to continue to impact energy and commodity prices around the globe. The
combination of these factors increases recession risk particularly in Europe and North America, while
economic activity in Greater China remains vulnerable due to risks around longer-than-expected
coronavirus pandemic-related disruptions and weaker external demand. In addition, all regions continue
to face downside risks from potential additional geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions, and
resurgences of covid-19. Overall, the subdued outlook is accompanied by consumer sentiment falling to
multi-year lows. Hence, advanced economies are forecast to see growth of only 0.5%. Growth in
developing economies is projected at 3.4% in 2023 as tightening financial conditions in advanced
economies paired with debt distress are supressing economic activity.
SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY TO FACE SEVERAL CHALLENGES IN 2023
The global sporting goods industry will face several challenges in 2023. Climbing energy and raw material
prices have been increasing input costs, while multi-year high inflation is negatively affecting household
savings and discretionary spending alike. On the contrary, the gradual wind down of strict lockdown
measures in Greater China are expected to bolster sports participation and increase store traffic in the
region. However, the speed and extent of recovery – particularly for Western brands – remain unclear. At
30 Source: Worldbank Global Economic Prospects.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
the same time, the cadence of major sports events, such as the FIFA Women’s World Cup Australia & New
Zealand 2023, has fully normalized from coronavirus pandemic-induced disruptions and is expected to
support industry growth. Moreover, the sporting goods industry is expected to remain fundamentally
attractive in the long-term, as existing global trends such as ‘athleisure,’ increasing sports participation
rates and rising health and fitness awareness are continuing to accelerate. In addition, consumers are
increasingly basing their purchasing decisions on sustainability factors, urging companies to drive
meaningful change. The risks of a global economic downturn, rising geopolitical tensions and the resulting
adverse effects on consumer spending also continue to exist for the sporting goods industry.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES TO DECLINE HIGH-SINGLE-DIGITS IN 2023
In 2023, we expect our currency-neutral revenue development to be impacted by ongoing macroeconomic
challenges and geopolitical tensions. In addition, elevated recession risks in Europe and North America as
well as uncertainty around the speed and extent of the recovery in Greater China persist. Our revenue
development will also be impacted by our initiatives to significantly reduce elevated inventory levels,
particularly in Greater China, North America, and Europe. In addition, while continuing to review future
options for the utilization of our Yeezy inventory, our guidance already accounts for the revenue loss of
around € 1,200 million from not selling the existing stock. As a result, we expect currency-neutral
revenues to decline at a high-single-digit rate in 2023.
CURRENCY-NEUTRAL REVENUES TO DECREASE IN KEY MARKET SEGMENTS
While currency-neutral revenues in EMEA and North America are expected to decline significantly in 2023,
sales in Greater China are expected to be around the prior year level. Revenues in Asia-Pacific and Latin
America are expected to increase versus the prior year level on a currency-neutral basis.
EXPECTED OPERATING LOSS OF € 700 MILLION
2023 will be a transition year where we will be focusing on incremental net sales generation and absolute
operating profit stabilization. The development of the gross margin is highly volatile given the
uncertainties around the shape and speed of the recovery in Greater China, the extent and length of
potential recessions in North America and Europe, the promotional activity in the industry as well as the
development of currencies and freight rates. We will manage these uncertainties by being flexible and
adjusting our operating expenses accordingly. Given the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties as
well as company-specific challenges, we expect an operating loss of € 700 million in 2023. This projection
includes the negative impact of around € 1,000 million from the discontinuation of the Yeezy partnership
consisting of the operating loss of around € 500 million related to the lost revenues as well as the write-off
of the existing Yeezy inventory as of February 2023 in the amount of around € 500 million. The expected
operating loss also accounts for one-off costs of up to € 200 million which are part of a strategic review we
are currently conducting aimed at reigniting profitable growth as of 2024.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
AVERAGE OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO INCREASE
During 2022, average operating working capital as a percentage of sales increased reflecting elevated
inventory levels driven by longer lead times, a higher sourcing volume as well as increased product and
freight costs. Our focus in 2023 will be on strongly reducing our inventory levels. As this improvement will
take time and against the background of the expected top-line decline, we still forecast average operating
working capital as a percentage of sales to increase to a level of between 25% and 26% in 2023.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE OF AROUND € 600 MILLION
We will continue to invest into our business, but at the same time adjust our spending to the financial and
operational situation of the company. Consequently, capital expenditure is expected to reach a level of
around € 600 million in 2023.
MANAGEMENT PROPOSES DIVIDEND PAYMENT OF € 0.70 PER SHARE
The adidas AG Executive and Supervisory Boards will recommend paying a dividend of € 0.70 per dividend-
entitled share to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 11, 2023 (2022: € 3.30). The total
payout of € 125 million (2022: € 610 million) reflects a payout ratio of 49.2% (2022: 40.9%) of net income
from continuing operations. This is at the upper end of the target range of between 30% and 50% of net
income from continuing operations as defined in our dividend policy. ► SEE OUR SHARE
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT
In order to remain competitive and ensure sustainable success, adidas consciously takes risks and
continuously explores and develops opportunities. Our risk and opportunity management principles and
system provide the framework for our company to conduct business in a well-controlled environment.
RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES
The key objective of the risk and opportunity management is to support business success and protect the
company as a going concern through an opportunity-focused but risk-aware decision-making framework.
Our Risk Management Policy outlines the principles, processes, tools, risk areas, key responsibilities,
reporting requirements, and communication timelines within our company. Risk and opportunity
management is a company-wide activity that utilizes key insights from the members of the Executive
Board as well as from global and local business units and functions. We define risk as the potential
occurrence of an external or internal event (or series of events) that may negatively impact our ability to
achieve the company’s business objectives or financial goals. Opportunity is defined as the potential
occurrence of an external or internal event (or series of events) that can positively impact the company’s
ability to achieve its business objectives or financial goals.
RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Executive Board has overall responsibility for establishing a risk and opportunity management system
that ensures comprehensive and consistent management of all material risks and opportunities. The Risk
Management department governs, operates, and develops the company’s risk and opportunity
management system and is the owner of the centrally managed risk and opportunity management process
on behalf of the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of
the risk management system. These duties are undertaken by the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee.
Working independently of all other functions of the organization, the Internal Audit department provides
objective assurance to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee regarding the adequacy and
effectiveness of the company’s risk and opportunity management system on a regular basis. In addition,
the Internal Audit department includes an assessment of the effectiveness of risk management processes
and compliance with the company’s Risk Management Policy as part of its regular auditing activities with
selected adidas subsidiaries or functions each year.
Our risk and opportunity management system is based on frameworks for enterprise risk management
and internal controls developed and published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Additionally, we have adapted our risk and opportunity management
system to more appropriately reflect the structure as well as the culture of the company. This system
focuses on the identification, evaluation, handling, systematic reporting, and monitoring of risks and
opportunities. In 2021, we evolved our risk and opportunity management system by introducing a
quantitative concept for risk capacity and risk appetite. Risk capacity is a liquidity-based measure and
represents the maximum level of risk adidas AG can take before being threatened with insolvency. Risk
appetite refers to the maximum level of risk the company is willing to take and is linked to the company's
liquidity targets.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Our risk and opportunity management process comprises the following steps:
Risk and opportunity identification: adidas continuously monitors the macroeconomic environment
and developments in the sporting goods industry as well as internal processes to identify risks and
─
opportunities as early as possible. On a semi-annual basis, the Risk Management department
conducts a survey with all members of the ‘Core Leadership Group’ (‘CLG’), ‘Extended Leadership
Group’ (‘ELG’), and selected middle management to ensure an effective bottom-up identification of
risks and opportunities. Risk Management has also defined 25 categories to help identify risks and
opportunities in a systematic way. In addition, adidas uses various instruments in the risk and
opportunity identification process, such as primary qualitative and quantitative research including
trend scouting and consumer surveys as well as feedback from our business partners. These efforts
are supported by global market research and competitor analysis. Through this process, we seek to
identify the markets, categories, consumer target groups, and product styles that show the most
potential for future growth at a local and global level. Equally, our analysis focuses on those areas that
are at risk of saturation or exposed to increased competition or changing consumer tastes.
Furthermore, as part of our identification process and following the ‘Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures’ (‘TCFD’) framework, we monitor physical risks related to climate change as well
as risks and opportunities resulting from the transition to a low-carbon economy. Our risk and
opportunity identification process is however not only limited to external risk factors or opportunities;
it also includes an internal perspective that considers company culture, processes, projects, human
resources, and compliance aspects.
Risk and opportunity evaluation: We assess identified risks and opportunities individually according to
a systematic evaluation methodology, which allows adequate prioritization as well as allocation of
─
resources. Risk and opportunity evaluation is part of the responsibility of the Risk Management
department supported by subject matter experts as well as internal and external data. The Risk
Management department also conducts assessments with the Executive Board members and senior
leaders to validate the evaluation of risks and opportunities.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
According to our methodology, risks and opportunities are evaluated by looking at two dimensions: the
potential impact and the likelihood that this impact materializes. Based on this evaluation, we classify
risks and opportunities into three categories: minor, moderate, and major.
The potential impact is evaluated using five categories: marginal, low, medium, high, and significant.
These categories represent financial or equivalent non-financial measurements. The financial
measurements are based on the potential effect on the company’s net income and cash flow. Non-
financial measurements used are the degree to which the company’s reputation, brand image, and
employer value proposition are affected. Moreover, the degree of damage to people’s health and safety
and the degree of legal and judicial consequences at a corporate and personal level can be considered.
Likelihood represents the possibility that a given risk or opportunity may materialize with the specific
impact. The likelihood of individual risks and opportunities is evaluated on a percentage scale divided
into five categories.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
RISK EVALUATION CATEGORIES
1 Based on net income and cash flow.
When evaluating risks and opportunities, we also consider the speed of materialization (velocity). In
this respect, we differentiate in which financial year risks and opportunities could occur. We consider
both gross and net risk in our risk assessments. While the gross risk reflects the inherent risk before
any mitigating action, the net risk reflects the residual risk after all mitigating action. On the one hand,
this approach allows for a good understanding of the impact of mitigating action taken; on the other
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
hand, it provides the basis for scenario analysis. Our assessment of risks presented in this report only
reflects the net risk perspective. We measure the actual financial impact of the most relevant risks and
opportunities that materialized against the original assessment on a yearly basis (‘back-testing’). In
this way, we ensure continuous monitoring of the accuracy of risk and opportunity evaluations across
the company, which enables us to continuously improve evaluation methodology based on our findings.
In assessing the potential effect from opportunities, each opportunity is appraised with respect to
viability, commerciality, and potential risks. This approach is not only applied to longer-term strategic
prospects but also to shorter-term tactical and opportunistic initiatives at the corporate level as well
as at the market and brand level. In contrast to the risk evaluation, only the net perspective exists for
assessing opportunities.
We aggregate risks and opportunities using a stochastic simulation (Monte Carlo simulation) to
determine the company’s risk and opportunity portfolio (i.e., the company’s aggregated risk position),
considering interdependencies of individual risks and opportunities. To identify a potential threat to the
company as a going concern, we compare the risk and opportunity portfolio to the company’s defined
risk capacity and determine the likelihood that the aggregated risk exceeds the risk capacity; to identify
a potential threat to the company’s rating, we compare the risk and opportunity portfolio to the defined
risk appetite and determine the likelihood that the aggregated risk exceeds the risk appetite.
Risk and opportunity handling: Risks and opportunities are treated in accordance with the company’s
risk and opportunity management principles as described in the Risk Management Policy. Risk Owners
─
are in charge of developing and implementing appropriate risk-mitigating action within their area of
responsibility. In addition, the Risk Owners need to determine a general risk-handling strategy for the
identified risks, which is either risk avoidance, risk reduction with the objective to lower impact or
likelihood, risk transfer to a third party or risk acceptance. The decision on the implementation of the
respective risk-handling strategy also takes into account the costs in relation to the benefit of any
planned mitigating action if applicable. The Risk Management department works closely with the Risk
Owners to monitor the continuous progress of planned mitigating action and assess the viability of
already implemented mitigating action. Depending on the risk class determined by the risk and
opportunity evaluation, the authority to make decisions to accept risks resides with the Executive
Board, leaders reporting directly to an Executive Board member and the operational management on
the next hierarchical level. The decision to accept material risks without taking additional mitigating
action can only be made by the entire Executive Board. In its decision-making process, the Executive
Board takes into account the risk profile, i.e., the relationship between risk and opportunity portfolio
(i.e., the company’s aggregated risk position) and risk appetite, as well as risk capacity. To support the
Executive Board, the Risk Management department defined clear thresholds for the likelihood that the
company’s aggregated risk exceeds the defined risk appetite and risk capacity. The company’s risk
appetite must not be exceeded with a likelihood of at least 95%; the company’s risk capacity must not
be exceeded with a likelihood of at least 99%.
Risk and opportunity monitoring and reporting: Our risk and opportunity management system aims to
increase the transparency of risks and opportunities. As both risks and opportunities are subject to
─
constant change, Risk Owners not only monitor developments but also the adequacy and effectiveness
of the current risk-handling strategy on an ongoing basis.
Regular risk reporting takes place half-yearly and consists of a five-step reporting stream:
Risk Management identifies risks and opportunities (with a potential effect on net income and cash
flow higher than € 1 million) by conducting a survey of ‘CLG,’ ‘ELG,’ and selected middle management
─
as well as utilizing available information concerning the internal and external environment of the
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
company. Risk Management evaluates, consolidates, and aggregates the identified risks and
opportunities (‘bottom-up assessment’).
Risk Management discusses the assessment of substantial risks and opportunities with the members
of the Executive Board and leaders directly reporting to them. The Executive Board members and their
─
direct reports validate the assessment of risks and opportunities in their respective area of
responsibility (‘top-down assessment’).
Risk Management provides a consolidated report to the Executive Board summarizing the results of
both bottom-up and top-down assessment as well as the risk and opportunity profile to highlight a
─
potential threat to the company’s rating and going concern. The Executive Board reviews the report,
jointly agrees on a company assessment of risks and opportunities and decides if Risk Owners are
required to take further action.
Based on the Executive Board’s decision, Risk Management creates the final risk and opportunity
report that is also shared with the ‘CLG.’
─
The Executive Board presents in collaboration with Risk Management the final risk and opportunity
assessment results to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
─
Material changes in previously reported risks and opportunities or newly identified material risks and
opportunities as well as any issues identified that, due to their material nature, require immediate
reporting are also reported outside the regular half-yearly reporting stream on an ad hoc basis to the
Executive Board. To further improve the risk culture at adidas, we are also offering a risk management
training to all our employees through our company intranet.
COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ADIDAS FAIR PLAY)
⌐ We consider compliance with the law as well as with external and internal regulations to be imperative.
The Executive Board sets the tone from the top, and every employee is required to act ethically and in
compliance with the law as well as with internal and other external regulations while executing the
company’s business. We believe adidas Fair Play will prevent a majority of potential compliance issues.
For that reason, we have specific measures to detect and respond to any concerns. We realize, however,
that no compliance system can eliminate all violations.
The adidas Chief Compliance Officer oversees the company’s Compliance Management System (CMS). We
see compliance as all-encompassing, spanning all business functions throughout the entire value chain.
Our central Compliance team works closely with Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance
Officers to conduct a systematic assessment of key compliance risks on a yearly basis. In addition, the
central Compliance team regularly conducts compliance reviews within selected entities.
The company’s CMS is based on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. It refers to the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and is designed to:
support the achievement of qualitative and sustainable growth through good corporate governance,
─
reduce and mitigate the risk of financial losses or damage caused by non-compliant conduct,
─
protect and further enhance the value and reputation of the company and its brand through compliant
conduct, and
─
support ‘Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion’ (‘DEI’) initiatives by fighting harassment and discrimination.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The adidas Fair Play Code of Conduct is accessible on our website, includes guidelines for employee
behavior in everyday work, and is applicable globally for all business areas. In 2020, we revised the Code of
Conduct to ensure it remains up to date and reflects our business environment. ¬
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/CODE-OF-CONDUCT
⌐ The Fair Play Code of Conduct and our CMS are organized around three pillars: prevent, detect, and
respond.
Prevention: The Compliance team regularly reviews and updates the CMS as necessary. In addition to
the revised Fair Play Code of Conduct mentioned above, we also support all initiatives to prevent and
─
fight harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Management also shares compliance-related
communication, and the Compliance department provides mandatory training to all employees globally
during onboarding and in regular, repeated cycles. The Compliance team and partners also provide
targeted in-person compliance training as appropriate with senior management and newly promoted
or hired senior executives across the globe in order to further enhance the compliance ‘tone from the
top,’ as well as the ‘tone from the middle.’ We closely monitor the completion rates for these training
measures. We also focused on further enhancing cooperation between the Compliance team and the
Internal Audit, the Group Policies and Internal Controls, and the Risk Management department.
Detection: adidas has whistleblowing procedures in place to ensure timely detection of potential
infringements of statutory regulations or internal guidelines. Employees can report compliance
─
concerns internally to their supervisor, the Chief Compliance Officer, Regional Compliance Managers
or Local Compliance Officers, the relevant HR Manager, or, where applicable, the Works Council.
Employees can also report externally via the independent, confidential Fair Play hotline and website,
which also allow for anonymous complaints. The Fair Play hotline and website are available at all times
worldwide, including the services of interpreters, if required. They are promoted digitally and with
posters to reach all our locations around the world. The company’s work to identify potential
compliance violations continued in 2022.
Response: Appropriate and timely response to compliance violations is essential. The Chief
Compliance Officer leads all investigations in cooperation with an established team of Regional
─
Compliance Managers and a global network of Local Compliance Officers. We track, monitor, and
report potential incidents of non-compliance worldwide. In 2022, we recorded 521 potential compliance
violations (2021: 485). Most importantly, insights gained from the investigation of past violations are
used to continuously improve the CMS. Where necessary, we react promptly to confirmed compliance
violations, through appropriate and effective sanctions ranging from warnings to termination of
employment contracts. In addition, in 2022, the Compliance team strengthened its relationship with the
Employee Relations (ER) organization, a key partner in many compliance matters, especially those
related to harassment and discrimination.

Officer attended four meetings of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board to report on the further
development of the compliance program, major compliance cases, and other relevant compliance topics.
The Compliance department has revised its process for detecting compliance risks and included new
risks, as well as captured some risk areas (e.g., e-commerce) more clearly. In addition, the description of
the CMS has been sharpened. ¬
DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROCESS
PURSUANT TO § 315 SECTION 4 GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HANDELSGESETZBUCH – HGB)
The accounting-related internal control and risk management system of the company represents a
process embedded within the company-wide corporate governance system. It aims to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the company’s external financial reporting by ensuring company-
wide compliance with statutory accounting regulations, in particular the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and internal consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance Manual). We regard the
internal control and risk management system as a process based on the principle of segregation of duties,
encompassing various sub-processes in the areas of Accounting, Controlling, Taxes, Treasury, Planning,
Reporting, and Legal, focusing on the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of
financial reporting risks. Clearly defined responsibilities are assigned to each distinct sub-process. In a
first step, the internal control and risk management system serves to identify, assess, limit, and control
risks identified in the consolidated financial reporting process that might result in the consolidated
financial statements not being compliant with internal and external regulations.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICoFR) serves to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To monitor the
effectiveness of ICoFR, the Group Policies and Internal Controls department and the Internal Audit
department regularly review accounting-related processes. Additionally, as part of the year-end audit, the
external auditor assesses the effectiveness of selected internal controls, including IT controls. The Audit
Committee of the Supervisory Board also monitors the effectiveness of ICoFR.
All adidas companies are required to comply with the consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance
Manual), which are available to all employees involved in the financial reporting process through the
company-wide intranet. We update the Finance Manual on a regular basis, dependent on regulatory
changes and internal developments. Changes to the Finance Manual are promptly communicated to all
adidas companies. Clear policies serve to limit employees’ scope of discretion with regard to recognition
and valuation of assets and liabilities, thus reducing the risk of inconsistent accounting practices within
the company. We aim to ensure compliance with the Finance Manual through continuous adherence to the
four-eyes principle in accounting-related processes. In addition, the local manager responsible for the
accounting-related process within the respective company and the respective local Managing Director
confirm adherence to the Finance Manual and to IFRS in a signed representation letter to the Accounting
department semi-annually.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The accounting for adidas companies is conducted either locally or by our Global Business Services.
Virtually all the IT Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems used are based on a company-wide
standardized SAP system. Following approval by the Finance Director of the respective adidas company,
the local financial statements are transferred to a central consolidation system based on SAP SEM-BCS.
At the corporate level, the regularity and reliability of the financial statements prepared by adidas
companies are reviewed by the Accounting and Controlling departments. These reviews include automated
validations in the system as well as the creation of reports and analyses to ensure data integrity and
adherence to the reporting logic. In addition, differences between current-year and prior-year financial
data as well as budget figures are analyzed on a market level. If necessary, adidas seeks the opinion of
independent experts to review business transactions that occur infrequently and on a non-routine basis.
After ensuring data plausibility, the centrally coordinated and monitored consolidation process begins,
running automatically on SAP SEM-BCS. Controls within the individual consolidation steps, such as those
relating to the consolidation of debt or of income and expenses, are conducted both manually and system-
based, using automatically created consolidation logs. Any inadequacies are remedied manually by
systematically processing the individual errors as well as differences and are reported back to the adidas
companies. After finalization of all consolidation steps, all items in the consolidated income statement and
in the consolidated statement of financial position are analyzed with respect to trends and variances.
Unless already otherwise clarified, the adidas companies are asked to explain any identified material
deviations.
All financial systems used are protected against malpractice by means of appropriate authorization
concepts, approval concepts, and access restrictions. Access authorizations are reviewed on a regular
basis and updated if required. The risk of data loss or outage of accounting-related IT systems is
minimized through central control and monitoring of virtually all IT systems, centralized management of
change processes, and regular data backups.
Furthermore, the adidas internal control and risk management system includes non-accounting-related
controls which serve to provide reasonable assurance regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of
operations, reliability of non-financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The
internal control and risk management system regarding the non-accounting-related activities focuses also
on the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of relevant risks. It is as well
embedded within the company-wide corporate governance system and encompasses various sub-
processes in the areas of Brands, Operations (including Procurement and IT), Sales, or Human Resources.
All adidas companies are also required to comply with the non-accounting-related policies (‘Policy
Manual’), which are available to all employees involved in the various processes through the company-
wide intranet and are updated and communicated on a regular basis.
The effectiveness of the non-accounting-related controls is also regularly monitored by the Group Policies
and Internal Controls department and the Internal Audit department. The reporting of internal control
results to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board includes the effectiveness of non-accounting-
related controls as well.
Nothing came to our attention that would cause us to doubt the appropriateness and effectiveness of the
entire internal control and risk management system. However, due to the limitations of any internal
control and risk management system, absolute certainty about the appropriateness and effectiveness of
these systems cannot be guaranteed.31

Report.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
ILLUSTRATION OF RISKS
This report includes an explanation of financial and non-financial risks that we deem to be most relevant
to the achievement of the company’s objectives in 2023 and beyond. According to our risk assessment
methodology, macroeconomic, socio-political, regulatory, and currency risks; risks related to the
competitive and retail environment; risks related to tax and customs regulations; risks related to
consumer demand and product offering; risks related to the coronavirus pandemic; personnel risks; risks
related to media and stakeholder activities; and IT and cyber security risks are classified as material. The
corporate risks overview table illustrates the assessment of all risks described below.
CORPORATE RISKS OVERVIEW

Litigation risks High ↓ (Significant) < 15% ↓ (15% - 30%)
Project risks High ↑ (Medium) < 15% ↓ (30% – 50%)
MACROECONOMIC, SOCIOPOLITICAL, REGULATORY, AND CURRENCY RISKS
Growth in the sporting goods industry is highly dependent on consumer spending and consumer
confidence. Economic downturns, inflation, financial market turbulence, currency exchange rate
fluctuations, and sociopolitical factors such as military conflicts (e.g., further expansion of the war in
Ukraine), changes of government, civil unrest, pandemics, nationalization, expropriation, or nationalism, in
particular in regions where adidas is strongly represented, could therefore negatively impact the
company’s business activities and top- and bottom-line performance. Currency risks are a direct result of
multi-currency cash flows within the company, in particular the mismatch of the currencies required for
sourcing our products versus the denominations of our sales. Furthermore, translation impacts from the
conversion of non-euro-denominated results into the company’s functional currency, the euro, might lead
to a material negative impact on our company’s financial performance. In addition, substantial changes in
the regulatory environment such as trade restrictions (e.g., concerning the US and China, or the EU and
China), economic and political sanctions, regulations concerning product compliance, environmental, and
climate protection regulations could lead to potential sales shortfalls or cost increases. ► SEE NOTE 29
To mitigate these macroeconomic, sociopolitical, and regulatory risks, adidas strives to balance sales
across key regions and also between developed and emerging markets. We continuously monitor the
macroeconomic, political, and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem
areas, so that we can quickly adjust our business activities accordingly upon any change in conditions.
Potential adjustments may be a reallocation of manufacturing of our products to alternative countries, a
reallocation of investments to alternative, more attractive markets, changes in product prices, closure of
our own retail stores, more conservative product purchasing, tight working capital management, and an
increased focus on cost control.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
To mitigate the risk related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we utilize a centralized currency
risk management system and hedge currency needs for projected sourcing requirements on a rolling
basis up to 24 months in advance. In rare instances, hedges are contracted beyond the 24-months horizon.
► SEE TREASURY
By building on our leading position within the sporting goods industry and taking into account the interests
of our stakeholders, we actively engage in supporting policymakers and regulators in their efforts to
liberalize global trade and curtail trade barriers, and to proactively influence and adapt to significant
changes in the regulatory environment.
RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPETITIVE AND RETAIL ENVIRONMENT
Changes in the competitive landscape and the retail environment could impact the company’s success.
Strategic alliances among competitors or retailers, the increase in retailers’ own private-label businesses
and intense competition for consumers, production capacity, and promotion partnerships between well-
established industry peers and new market entrants pose a substantial risk to adidas. This could lead to
harmful competitive behavior, such as sustained periods of discounting in the marketplace or intense
bidding for promotion partnerships. Failure to recognize and respond to consolidation in the retail industry
could lead to increased dependency on particular retail partners, reduced bargaining power, and,
consequently, considerable margin erosion. Sustained pricing pressure in key markets, amplified by
current elevated inventory levels (in particular in the US and China), could threaten the company’s
financial performance and the competitiveness of our brands. Aggressive competitive practices could also
drive increases in marketing costs and market share losses, thus hurting the company’s profitability and
market position. The inability to adjust our distribution strategy in a timely manner to a changing retail
industry, which is experiencing continuous substitution of physical retail stores by digital commerce
platforms as well as increasing connectivity between physical and digital retail, could result in sales and
profit shortfalls. A decline in the attractiveness of particular shopping locations such as shopping malls
could lead to sales shortfalls in our customers’ and our own stores, higher inventory in the marketplace,
increased clearance activity, and margin pressure.
To mitigate these risks, we continuously monitor and analyze information on our competitors and markets
in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely
reacting to such changes. This enables us to proactively adjust our marketing and sales activities (e.g.,
product launches or selective pricing adjustments) when needed. We also continuously and closely
monitor numerous indicators (e.g., order placement, sell-through rates at the point of sale, average
selling prices, discounts, store traffic) that help us identify changes in the retail environment and quickly
take appropriate action such as closing or remodeling our own stores. We constantly adjust our
segmentation strategies to ensure that the right product is sold at the right point of sale at an appropriate
price. Continuous investment in research and development ensures that we remain innovative and distinct
from competitors. We also pursue a strategy of entering into long-term agreements with key promotion
partners. In addition, our product and communication initiatives are designed to increase brand desire,
drive market share growth, and strengthen our brand’s market position.
RISKS RELATED TO TAX AND CUSTOMS REGULATIONS
Numerous laws and regulations regarding customs and taxes as well as changes in such laws and
regulations affect the company’s business practices worldwide. Non-compliance with regulations
concerning product imports (including calculation of customs values), intercompany transactions, or
income taxes could lead to substantial financial penalties and additional costs as well as negative media
coverage and therefore reputational damage, for example in case of understatements or underpayments
of corporate income taxes or customs duties. Changes in regulations regarding customs and taxes may
also have a substantial impact on the company’s sourcing costs or income taxes. Therefore, we also create
provisions in accordance with the relevant accounting regulations to account for potential disputes with
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
customs or tax authorities. Due to the current geopolitical situation, we assume in individual cases
increasingly aggressive positions taken by tax and customs authorities in audits, which could increase the
potential impact of such risks and the likelihood that they materialize. In 2021, the ‘OECD/G20 Inclusive
Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting’ agreed on a two-pillar solution to address the tax
challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. Pillar 2, which includes the introduction of global
minimum tax, could have a considerable impact on income tax expense from 2024 onwards.
We seek to manage tax and customs risks in a balanced way that bears an appropriate relationship to the
operating structure, commercial and economic substance, and other business risks. To proactively
manage such risks, we constantly seek expert advice from specialized independent law and tax advisory
firms in areas such as process design, transaction advisory, compliance, and tax or customs audits.
Processes are in place requiring that attention is regularly directed to potential areas of tax or customs
risk (e.g., a quarterly tax risk questionnaire) and the corporate tax and customs teams are involved in
critical business transactions. Compliance with global tax and customs policies and controls is monitored
by the Corporate Tax and Customs teams, internal controls experts and the Internal Audit department. We
closely monitor changes in legislation to properly adopt regulatory requirements regarding customs and
taxes; apply any available and applicable guidance from tax authorities and organizations such as the
OECD, the World Customs Organization and the World Trade Organization; and seek guidance from
individual authorities, as appropriate, which may include requesting tax rulings from a tax authority. In
addition, our internal legal, customs, and tax teams advise our operational management teams to ensure
appropriate and compliant business practices. Our specialized staff receive adequate training for their role
and non-tax, or non-customs staff are made aware of potential tax and customs matters relevant to their
roles. Furthermore, we work closely with customs authorities and governments worldwide to make sure
we adhere to customs and trade regulations at import and export to ensure the availability and obtain the
required clearance of products to fulfill sales demand. ► SEE SUSTAINABILITY
RISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND AND PRODUCT OFFERING
Our success largely depends on our ability to continuously create new, innovative, and sustainable
products. Consumer demand changes can be sudden and unexpected, particularly when it comes to the
more fashion-related part of our business. Therefore, we face a risk of short-term revenue loss in cases
where we are unable to anticipate consumer demand or respond quickly to changes. In addition, creating
and offering products that do not resonate with consumers and our retail partners is a critical risk to the
success of our brands, especially considering our focus on key product franchises. This risk could be
exacerbated if our marketing activities and brand campaigns fail to generate consumer excitement. Even
more critical in the long term, however, are the risks of continuously overlooking new trends and failing to
continuously introduce and successfully commercialize new product innovation.
To mitigate these risks, identifying and responding to shifts in consumer demand as early as possible is a
key responsibility of our brand and sales organizations and, in particular, of the respective Risk Owners.
Therefore, we utilize extensive primary and secondary research tools as outlined in our risk and
opportunity identification process. By putting the consumer at the center of our decision-making, we
intend to create higher brand advocacy and attract new consumers. We continuously expand our consumer
analytics efforts to read and quickly react to changes in demand or trend shifts. In addition, direct
touchpoints with consumers via our own digital channels, such as the adidas app, and direct
communication with consumers on social media platforms strengthen our understanding of consumer
preferences and behavior and, as a result, help us to reduce our vulnerability to changes in demand.
Through continuous monitoring of sell-through data and disciplined product life-cycle management, in
particular for our major product franchises, we are able to better detect demand patterns and prevent
excess supply. By leveraging our promotion partnerships and by carefully orchestrating launch events
across markets and channels, we intend to maintain brand desire and consumer demand at a constantly
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
high level. Utilizing external insights and capabilities in product creation helps us strengthen our product
offering and drive consumer demand, brand desire, market share, and profitability.
RISKS RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC
The negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic have eased in most countries during 2022. However,
there could still be a substantial negative impact to the company’s success if high infection rates are
causing a persistent workforce shortage due to increased sick leave, or, if new coronavirus variants would
again require widespread lockdown and containment measures in our most important sourcing countries
or key markets, such as China. Risks related to the coronavirus pandemic include but are not limited to:
Traffic declines in our own and our retail partners’ stores or even store closures.
─
Closures of distribution centers would negatively impact the company’s ability to fulfill orders by
consumers or retail partners and lead to sales and profit shortfalls, order cancellations, or excess
─
inventory.
Supply chain disruptions, such as the closure of factories of our manufacturing partners or the closure
of ports in critical sourcing countries, could cause production or delivery delays and negatively impact
─
our ability to fulfill consumer demand.
Wholesale customers may cancel purchase orders or return product to adidas, which could result in
excess inventory and higher inventory allowances.
─
Lower-than-expected sales and profits in our own retail stores may result in higher impairment
charges or inventory allowances and negatively affect the company’s bottom line.
─
Third-party business partners may partially or completely fail to meet their contractual financial
obligations, which could result in higher loss allowances and increased write-offs for accounts
─
receivable.
Volatile global financial markets might negatively affect the company’s access to capital in the future.
─
To mitigate the effects of a potential aggravation of the coronavirus crisis, adidas could take numerous
measures, for example by further shifting our focus to digital channels with prioritized supply chain
management. With flexible shifts in our product purchasing in close alignment with our manufacturing
partners, a disciplined sell-in, and the conscious use of our factory outlets, we could be able to reduce
negative margin effects and manage our inventory. By securing alternative freight capacities and adjusting
planning processes for early shipments, we could mitigate the effect of container scarcity and port
congestions. Strict cash flow and cost management help us to ensure the financial stability of our
company. Furthermore, adidas is continuously safeguarding the health of its employees and other
stakeholders through strict measures.
PERSONNEL RISKS
Achieving the company’s strategic and financial objectives is highly dependent on our employees and their
talents. In this respect, strong leadership and a performance-enhancing culture are critical to the
company’s success. Therefore, ineffective leadership as well as the failure to install and maintain a
performance-oriented culture that fosters ‘Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion’ (‘DEI’) and strong employee
engagement amongst our workforce could substantially impede our ability to achieve our goals. An
ineffective, unbalanced, or insufficient allocation of resources to business activities as well as improper
planning and untimely execution of reorganization and transformation initiatives may reduce employee
engagement, cause business disruption and inefficiencies, and may negatively affect business
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
performance. In addition, global competition for highly qualified personnel remains fierce. As a result, the
loss of key personnel in strategic positions and the inability to identify, recruit, and retain highly qualified
and skilled talent who best meet the specific needs of our company pose risks to our business
performance.
We are taking various measures to ensure that we maintain a culture that fosters ‘DEI.’ Through several
specialized programs, ‘DEI’ is embedded into our recruitment processes. Our ‘Global DEI Council’ drives
the increase of representation, retention, and advancement of diverse talents within our global workforce.
Furthermore, our workforce takes part in ‘DEI’ learning programs. To ensure effective leadership across
the company we offer a portfolio of leadership development experiences designed for every level of
management across all markets and functions. To optimize staffing levels and resource allocation (i.e.,
having the right people with the right skillsets in the right roles at the right time), we adjust resource
allocation where required to reflect developments in business performance, the economic environment
and our company’s strategic priorities. Organizational transformations and reorganizations are supported
by change activations with our leadership teams and organizational design consultancy. We continuously
invest in improving employer branding activities, and our global recruiting organization constantly
enhances our internal and external recruiting services and capabilities. Our global succession
management helps create internal talent pipelines for critical leadership positions and therefore reduces
succession risk.
RISKS RELATED TO MEDIA AND STAKEHOLDER ACTIVITIES
Adverse or inaccurate media coverage on our products or business practices as well as negative social
media discussion may significantly harm adidas’ reputation and brand image, lead to public misperception
of the company’s business performance and eventually result in a sales slowdown. Similarly, certain
activities on the part of key stakeholders (e.g., non-governmental organizations, governmental institutions)
could cause reputational damage, distract top management, and disrupt business activities. Despite the
termination of the adidas Yeezy partnership in 2022, due to its former size and relevance, related
stakeholder reactions and negative media coverage could still be possible.
To mitigate these risks, we pursue proactive, open communication and engagement with key stakeholders
(e.g., consumers, media, the financial community, non-governmental organizations, governmental
institutions) on a continuous basis. In addition, we have established clear crisis communication processes
to ensure a quick and effective response to adverse developments. We have also strengthened social
media capabilities and created various digital newsrooms around the globe that enable continuous
monitoring of social media content related to the company’s products and activities and allow early
management of potentially damaging social media discussion. On a case-by-case basis, we seek external
advice from experts in communication and stakeholder management.
IT AND CYBER SECURITY RISKS
Theft, leakage, corruption, or unavailability of critical information (e.g., consumer data, employee data,
product data) and systems could lead to reputational damage, regulatory penalties, or the inability to
perform key business processes. Key business processes, including product marketing, order
management, warehouse management, invoice processing, customer support, and financial reporting, are
all dependent on IT systems. Significant outages, application failures, or cyber security threats to our
infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could therefore result in reputational damage, regulatory
penalties, or cause considerable business disruption or impact to business-critical data.
To mitigate these risks, our IT organization proactively engages in system preventive maintenance, service
continuity planning, adherence to IT policies and maintenance of a comprehensive information security
program. Information security governance, data security, security architecture design, continuity
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
management, and employee awareness programs help us to protect the company adequately. We have
also secured limited insurance coverage for damage resulting from cyber security incidents.
BUSINESS PARTNER RISKS
adidas interacts and enters into partnerships with various third parties, such as athletes, creative
partners, innovation partners, retail partners, or suppliers of goods or services. As a result, the company
is exposed to a multitude of business partner risks.
We work with strategic partners in various areas of our business (e.g., product creation, manufacturing,
research, and development) or distributors in a few selected markets whose approach might differ from
our own business practices and standards, which could also negatively impact the company’s business
performance and reputation. Similarly, failure to maintain strong relationships with our partners could
negatively impact the company’s sales and profitability. Risks may also arise from a dependency on
particular partners. For example, the overdependency on a supplier or customer increases the company’s
vulnerability to delivery and sales shortfalls, respectively, and could lead to significant margin pressure.
Business partner default (including insolvency) or other disruptive events such as strikes may negatively
affect the company’s business activities and result in additional costs and liabilities as well as lower sales
for the company. Unethical business practices or improper behavior on the part of business partners could
have a negative spillover effect on the company’s reputation, lead to higher costs or liabilities or even
disrupt business activities.
To mitigate business partner risks, adidas has implemented various measures. For example, we generally
include clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our
partnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of
promotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners.
We utilize a broad distribution strategy, which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer
business to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted
for more than 5% of the company’s sales in 2022. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with
suppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality, and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any
potential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we
enforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and
environmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance
coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers’ premises. To
reduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas
works with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products,
does not have a single-sourcing model.
COMPLIANCE RISKS
As a globally operating company, adidas is subject to various laws and regulations. Non-compliance with
such laws and regulations could lead to penalties and fines and cause reputational damage. For example,
non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, such as the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), may result in substantial fines. In addition, publication of failure to
comply with data protection and privacy regulations could cause reputational damage and result in a loss
of consumer trust in our brands. We also face the risk that members of top management as well as our
employees breach rules and standards that guide appropriate and responsible business behavior. This
includes the risks of fraud, financial misstatements or manipulation, anti-competitive business practices,
bribery, corruption, discrimination, and harassment in the workplace.
Our Compliance Management System (CMS) helps us to prevent, detect, and adequately respond to these
risks. Our Global Policy Manual provides a framework for basic work procedures and processes, and our
Fair Play Code of Conduct stipulates that every employee and our business partners shall act ethically in
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
compliance with the laws and regulations of the legal systems where they conduct company business. In
addition, our Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance Officers guide and advise our
operating managers regarding fraud and corruption topics. Furthermore, we utilize controls such as
segregation of duties in IT systems and data analytics technology to prevent or detect fraudulent activities.
We are also working with external partners and law firms to ensure we are informed about legal
requirements across the globe, and we take appropriate action to ensure compliance. To mitigate the risk
of non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, we developed a
global privacy management framework that introduces the company’s privacy principles and provides
guidance for the use and deletion of personal information. This framework applies to all adidas businesses
worldwide and also sets our expectations of third-party business partners for managing personal
information for or on behalf of adidas. Our Global Privacy Officer and the Global Privacy department drive
the operational establishment of the framework and monitoring capabilities to track and report its
implementation. During the implementation, they are continuously providing further implementation
guidance and training.
HAZARD RISKS
As climate change intensifies, the likelihood and intensity of natural disasters such as storms, floods,
droughts, pandemics, or heat waves increases, and so does adidas’ potential risk. In addition, our business
activities could be impacted by port congestions, strikes, riots, or terrorist attacks. All of the above could
damage our offices, stores, or distribution centers or disrupt our operational processes leading to loss of
sales, higher cost, and a decrease in profitability.
To manage and mitigate these risks, we continuously monitor potential threats and have implemented
business continuity plans including but not limited to fallback solutions for transportation, dynamic
capacity management of containers and carriers, and reallocation of production. We also maintain high
safety standards in all our locations and have secured insurance coverage for property damage and
business interruptions.
LITIGATION RISKS
adidas might be involved in legal disputes and proceedings in different jurisdictions. Legal action taken
against adidas due to the company’s use of technologies or other intellectual property that are owned by a
third party may result in the loss of rights to use those technologies or rights, imposed royalty payments,
withdrawal of products from the market, legal costs, or reputational damage.
Our Legal Intellectual Property and Trademark team is actively defending adidas’ intellectual property and
associated rights and regularly exchanging with internal business partners to ensure that designs and
innovations are cleared for use and protected. Furthermore, we engage with qualified external consultants
and lawyers in case legal actions are taken against the company.
PROJECT RISKS
To effectively support further business growth and improve efficiency, adidas continuously invests in new
projects such as the creation, implementation, expansion, harmonization, or modernization of IT systems,
distribution centers, or office buildings. Ineffective project management could delay the execution of
critical projects and lead to higher expenditures. Inadequate project planning and controlling as well as
executional mistakes or ineffective change management could cause inefficiencies, delays, or business
disruption, resulting in higher costs and sales shortfalls. Inappropriate project governance, prioritization,
and oversight of the project portfolio may lead to suboptimal resource allocation and undesired project
results.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
We manage projects utilizing reviews by project teams as well as project steering committees to evaluate
the progress, quality, and costs of those projects on a regular basis. This approach allows early detection
of project risks and quick implementation of corrective action or timely cancelation of projects with a low
chance of success. To ensure true end-to-end management of key projects we have established a network
of program and project management departments across all main functions (i.e., Sales, Marketing,
Operations, Finance, IT, and Human Resources). We also work with external partners for project
management support in areas where we do not have the required expertise or experience in-house.
ILLUSTRATION OF OPPORTUNITIES
In this report, we illustrate financial and non-financial opportunities considered most relevant in 2023 and
beyond. According to our assessment methodology, opportunities related to tax and customs regulations;
opportunities related to order and supply management; opportunities related to product engineering and
manufacturing processes; opportunities related to the distribution strategy; opportunities related to
consumer demand and product offering; opportunities related to existing Yeezy inventory; macroeconomic,
sociopolitical, regulatory and currency opportunities; and opportunities related to data analytics are
considered material. The assessment is illustrated in the corporate opportunities overview table.

opportunities
Opportunities related to data analytics High 15% – 30%
Personnel opportunities Medium 15% – 30%
OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO TAX AND CUSTOMS REGULATIONS
The potential release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets or the release of tax risk reserves
(e.g., relating to transactions or internal reorganizations in prior years) could positively impact income tax
expense. In addition, changes in local tax regulations may offer the company the option to realize benefits
that could result in a reduction of tax expenses and higher net income. Furthermore, we see considerable
potential in reducing the total amount of customs duties in the long term by increasing our sourcing from
manufacturing partners in countries with more favorable customs treaties.
OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO ORDER AND SUPPLY MANAGEMENT
The introduction of a more flexible order management, supported by our continued investment in our IT
systems, could effectively reduce inventory risk and drive incremental net sales and higher margins. This
could be achieved by reducing initial order sizes while ensuring continuous reproduction and
replenishment of products. Expanded nearshoring capabilities could further reduce lead times to ensure
that product demand can be fulfilled at all times and to respond more quickly to the latest trends in our
industry.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO PRODUCT ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
We constantly monitor which of our product features are perceived as most relevant by our consumers.
According to this, a further optimization of our product design could result in higher net sales and margins
by consistently focusing on product features that add the most value to our consumers, while increasing
the cost efficiency of less relevant components or reducing complexity in product design. By working
closely with our suppliers, we also see respective potential for more efficient manufacturing processes.
OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO THE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY
Our wholesale channel, where we clearly focus on partners that provide consumers with the best shopping
experience and customer service, could generate higher-than-expected sales and profit. In addition,
organic growth of our business in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, as well as market expansion in
Emerging Markets could provide further upside potential in terms of sales and profit.
OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND AND PRODUCT OFFERING
Well-executed campaigns and marketing initiatives could increase brand desire and consumer appeal,
which may drive full-price sell-through and result in higher-than-expected sales and profit. In addition,
outstanding competitive performance of promotion partners such as individual athletes, club teams, or
national teams may further increase their popularity among consumers. As a result, adidas may generate
higher sales of signature footwear or licensed apparel and accessories. We believe that our continued
focus on product innovation and the ability to fully commercialize such innovation through an attractive
product offering that resonates with consumers could provide further upside potential both in terms of
sales and profit. In that respect, we see untapped potential particularly for our Originals key franchises as
well as our basketball and running business.
OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO EXISTING YEEZY INVENTORY
adidas continues to review future options for the utilization of its existing Yeezy inventory. The full year
2023 guidance as outlined in this report already accounts for the significant adverse impact of not selling
as well as completely writing off the existing stock. Should the company, however, decide to sell the
existing Yeezy inventory – in full or in part –, this would have a positive impact on the company’s top- and
bottom-line development.
MACROECONOMIC, SOCIOPOLITICAL, REGULATORY, AND CURRENCY OPPORTUNITIES
Positive macroeconomic developments could strengthen consumer sentiment and purchasing power, for
example, if inflation rates declined at a faster pace than anticipated. Favorable exchange rate
developments can potentially have a positive impact on the company’s financial results. Translation effects
from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into our company’s functional currency, the euro,
might also positively impact our company’s financial performance. Legislative and regulatory changes
such as the elimination of trade barriers due to free trade agreements can create cost savings or
potentially open up new channels of distribution and, as a result, positively impact profitability.
OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DATA ANALYTICS
Data and analytics play a crucial role in enabling fact-based decision-making. Therefore, we have a
dedicated Data and Analytics team to support business decision-making by leveraging the power of data.
The continuous enhancement of our existing capabilities to build and scale insights-driven use cases and
the use of the latest technology could bring value to our business operations across the entire company.
As a result, we see the opportunity to become faster and more efficient in our operations. We may increase
visibility and understanding of consumer preferences, apply these insights in our product creation and, as
a result, increase sales and reduce cost of sales. Leveraging data may also help us, for instance, optimize
order book management, inventory management, and purchasing. All this could result in improved
financial performance.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
PERSONNEL OPPORTUNITIES
Creating and managing a performance-oriented culture that fosters ‘Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion’ as
well as leadership accountability and clear values in the workplace could lead to increased diversity of
thought, increased creativity and innovation, and higher employee satisfaction and engagement. This may
positively impact the company’s financial performance. A workforce that includes diverse talent and
reflects the diversity of our customers and consumers helps us better serve the communities we work in
and strengthens brand reputation among our consumers, which could potentially create a competitive
advantage and positively impact top- and bottom-line performance.
ILLUSTRATION OF CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
In 2022, the Risk Management department coordinated the identification and prioritization of climate-
related risks and opportunities taking the ‘Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure’ (‘TCFD’)
framework into consideration. The following section summarizes the main risks and opportunities that are
relevant for adidas. Given the different time horizon and complexity of climate-related risks and
opportunities, the overview is presented separately from the illustration of risks and opportunities in the
risk and opportunity report. We do not expect this to result in any additional material risks and
opportunities for the forecast for fiscal year 2023 compared to the explanations given in this Risk and
Opportunity report.
CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS
Based on the TCFD framework, climate-related risks are categorized as physical and transitional risks.
PHYSICAL RISKS
Physical risks resulting from climate change can be event driven (acute) or longer-term shifts in climate
patterns (chronic).
Acute risks, such as storms, wildfires, and floods, could damage our own or our business partners’
properties and lead to business disruptions.
─
Chronic risks such as changing weather patterns could affect crop yields (e.g., cotton), rising sea
levels could threaten coastal locations and lead to asset write-downs, and increases in average
─
temperatures and heat waves could lead to lower participation in sports and reduced productivity of
our own and our suppliers’ workforce.
TRANSITIONAL RISKS
Transitioning to a lower-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market
changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change.
Policy risks, such as increases in pricing of greenhouse gas emissions, mandates on existing or new
products and exposure to litigation for non-compliance with emerging regulations.
─
Market risks, such as changes in consumer behavior and a decrease in global economic growth, which
could lead to a reduced consumer demand, increased commodity and energy prices, increased
─
insurance costs, and reduced capital availability and market valuation due to stakeholder concerns
about resilience to climate change impacts.
Reputation risks, such as the stigmatization of the fashion and sportswear industry leading to a
decrease in employer attractiveness and negative stakeholder feedback.
─
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Technology risks, such as the costs to transitioning to lower emission technologies in the supply
chain.
─
CLIMATE-RELATED OPPORTUNITIES
Products and services, such as the development of more sustainable (low-emission) products and
services that could meet consumer preferences and lead to a competitive advantage and increased
─
consumer demand.
Resource efficiency and energy source, such as using more efficient production and distribution
processes (including our suppliers).
─
Markets, such as increased capital availability (green financing) and market valuation due to climate
change resilience and increased employer attractiveness due to strong environmental performance.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE,
RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES, AND OUTLOOK
ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE VERSUS TARGETS
We communicate our financial targets on an annual basis. We also provide updates throughout the year as
appropriate. In 2022, financial results were impacted by the war in Ukraine as well as heightened
macroeconomic challenges such as supply chain constraints, increasing inflation, tightened monetary
policy as well as declining consumer sentiment. Additionally, economic activity as well as our business in
Greater China were still severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Growth in all other markets
could only partly mitigate these challenges. The decision to terminate the Yeezy partnership also
significantly weighed on the company’s top- and bottom-line development in 2022. Given all of these
macroeconomic as well as company-specific challenges, we had to adjust our guidance three times in
2022. As a result, we delivered top- and bottom-line results significantly below the initial guidance
provided at the beginning of the year, but in line with the adjusted guidance provided in November 2022.

In 2022, revenues increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis. The development reflects increases in all
market segments except Greater China where sales declined strong double-digits. While sales in EMEA
and Asia-Pacific grew in line with the guidance provided in November 2022, the revenue development in
North America fell slightly short of our projections. At the same time, revenues in Latin America exceeded
our expectations. Gross margin ended the year at 47.3%, reflecting a decrease of 3.4 percentage points
versus the prior year level, but in line with the guidance provided in November 2022. Broad-based price
increases were more than offset by the strong increase in supply chain costs, reflecting increased product
costs and freight expenses, as well as higher discounts, especially in the second half of the year.
Moreover, a less favorable market and channel mix as well as unfavorable currency developments
weighed on the gross margin development in 2022. Our operating margin decreased 6.4 percentage points
to 3.0%, somewhat ahead of our guidance provided in November. This operating margin decline mainly
reflects the gross margin decrease, increasing operating overhead and marketing and point-of-sale
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
expenses as well as unfavorable currency developments. In addition, the decision to terminate the Yeezy
partnership at the end of October 2022 also had a significant adverse impact on our profitability. Net
income from continuing operations decreased 83% to € 254 million and came in in-line with the November
guidance. This development was impacted by several one-offs that occurred in the second half of 2022 in
the amount of € 350 million. These one-off costs are related to our decision to wind down our business in
Russia, a settled legal dispute, higher provisions for customs-related risks, cash-pooling in high
inflationary countries as well as to restructuring costs as part of the company’s business improvement
program. ► SEE INCOME STATEMENT
Average operating working capital as a percentage of sales ended the year 2022 at a level of 24.0%. While
this is directionally in line with the guided level of above 20.0%, the increase was significantly higher than
initially expected. The year-over-year increase was 4.0 percentage points. This increase mainly reflects
the slower recovery in Greater China, the significant inventory increase, which is mainly the result of
higher product and freight costs, an increased sourcing volume, a different ordering pattern given longer
transportation lead times, the termination of the Yeezy partnership as well as lower prior year
comparables due to the prior year’s impact from the factory lockdowns in Vietnam. Capital expenditure
increased 4% to € 695 million in 2022 in line with our latest guidance. More than 70% of these investments
were spent on controlled space initiatives as well as on Digital and IT activities. Controlled space initiatives
comprise investments in new or remodeled own retail or franchise stores as well as in shop-in-shop
presentations of our products in our customers’ stores. ► SEE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Our Risk Management team aggregates all risks and opportunities identified through the half-yearly risk
and opportunity assessment process to determine the company’s risk and opportunity portfolio (i.e., the
company’s aggregated risk position). Results from this process are analyzed and reported to the Executive
Board accordingly. The Executive Board discusses and assesses risks and opportunities on a regular basis
and takes into account the relationship between risk and opportunity portfolio (i.e., the company’s
aggregated risk position) and risk appetite as well as risk capacity in its decision-making. Compared to the
prior year, our assessment of certain risks and opportunities has changed in terms of likelihood of
occurrence and/or potential financial impact. Our risk and opportunity aggregation using a Monte-Carlo
simulation determined that the company’s aggregated risk does not exceed the company’s risk capacity
threshold with a likelihood of at least 99%. Therefore, we do not foresee any material jeopardy to the
viability of the company as a going concern. ► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL OUTLOOK
Since the creation and launch of our ‘Own the Game’ strategy, the economic and political environment we
operate in has significantly changed. Macroeconomic challenges as well as geopolitical tensions have had
an adverse impact on our business, our consumers, and business partners. Paving the way for a restart,
Bjørn Gulden joined adidas as new CEO in January 2023. In this context, we are currently conducting a
thorough strategic review, which also includes the financial ambition for 2025. We will provide an update
on the outcome of this review in the course of the second half of 2023 and, in the meantime, continue to
diligently execute our functional priorities.
In 2023, we expect our revenue development to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges and
geopolitical tensions which continue to dampen consumer sentiment, elevated recession risks in Europe
and North America as well as uncertainty around the speed and extent of the recovery in Greater China. In
addition, company-specific challenges such as the high inventory levels and the termination of the Yeezy
partnership are forecast to weigh on the company’s operational and financial performance. While we
continue to review future options for the utilization of our Yeezy inventory, our FY 2023 guidance already
accounts for the significant adverse impact from not selling the existing stock. Compared to the prior year,
this would lower revenues by around € 1,200 million and operating profit by around € 500 million in 2023.
Should we irrevocably decide not to repurpose any of the existing Yeezy product, this would result in the
write-off of the existing Yeezy inventory as of February 2023 and would lower the operating profit by an
additional around € 500 million this year. In addition, we expect one-off costs of up to € 200 million in 2023
which are part of the strategic review the company is currently conducting aimed at reigniting profitable
growth as of 2024. Against this background, we project currency-neutral sales to decline at a high-single-
digit rate and expect to report an operating loss of € 700 million in 2023. ► SEE OUTLOOK
We believe our outlook for 2023 realistically describes the underlying development of the company.
However, the outlook for 2023 as outlined in this report is subject to change depending on further
developments related to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, ongoing uncertainties regarding
macroeconomic challenges, the impact from geopolitical conflicts and consumer sentiment in both
advanced and developing economies as well as re-escalating trade tensions represent risks to the
achievement of our stated financial goals and aspirations. No other material event between the end of
2022 and the publication of this report has altered our view. ► SEE OUTLOOK

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
NOTES
adidas AG is a listed German stock corporation and parent of the adidas Group located at Adi-Dassler-
Str. 1, 91074 Herzogenaurach, Germany, and is entered into the commercial register at the Local Court of
Fürth (HRB 3868). adidas AG and its subsidiaries (collectively ‘adidas,’ ‘the Group’ or ‘the company’)
design, develop, produce, and market a broad range of athletic and sports lifestyle products.
01 GENERAL
The consolidated financial statements of adidas AG as at December 31, 2022, comprise adidas AG and its
subsidiaries and are prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as
endorsed by the European Union (EU) as at December 31, 2022, and the additional requirements pursuant
to § 315e section 1 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB).
The following amendments to existing standards and interpretations are effective for financial years
beginning on January 1, 2022, and have been applied for the first time to these consolidated financial
statements:
Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant, and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (effective
date: January 1, 2022): The amendment prohibits entities from deducting from the cost of an item of
─
property, plant, and equipment, any proceeds of the sale of items produced while bringing that asset to
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management. Instead, an entity should recognize the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs
of producing those items, in profit or loss. In accordance with the transitional provisions, adidas
applies the amendments retrospectively only to items of property, plant, and equipment made
available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented when the entity first applies
the amendment (the date of initial application). These amendments had no material impact on the
consolidated financial statements of adidas.
Annual Improvements to IFRS standards 2018 – 2020:
─
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards – Subsidiary as a
first-time adopter (effective date: January 1, 2022): The amendment permits a subsidiary that
─
has measured its assets and liabilities at carrying amounts recorded in their parent’s books to
also measure any cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported in the parent’s
consolidated financial statements. This amendment will also apply to associates and joint
ventures that have taken the same IFRS 1 exemption. These amendments had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements, as adidas is not a first-time adopter.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Fees in the ‘10 per cent’ test for derecognition of financial
liabilities (effective date: January 1, 2022): The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity
─
includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are
substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include only
those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by
either the borrower or lender on the other’s behalf. In accordance with the transitional
provisions, adidas applies the amendment to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged
on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the
amendment (the date of initial application). These amendments had no material impact on the
consolidated financial statements of adidas.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
IAS 41 Agriculture – Taxation in fair value measurements (effective date: January 1, 2022): The
amendment removes the requirement in paragraph 22 of IAS 41 that entities exclude cash flows
─
for taxation when measuring the fair value of assets within the scope of IAS 41. These amendme-
nts had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of adidas as it did not have assets in
scope of IAS 41 as at the reporting date.
Amendments to IFRS 3 – Reference to the Conceptual Framework (effective date: January 1, 2022):
The amendments replace a reference to a previous version of the International Accounting Standards
─
Board’s (IASB) Conceptual Framework (1989) with a reference to the current version issued in March
2018 without significantly changing its requirements. The amendments add an exception to the
recognition principle of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ to avoid the issue of potential ‘day 2’ gains or
losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of IAS 37
‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’ or IFRIC 21 ‘Levies,’ if incurred separately.
The exception requires entities to apply the criteria in IAS 37 or IFRIC 21, respectively, instead of the
Conceptual Framework, to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date. The
amendments also add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for
recognition at the acquisition date. In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Group applies the
amendments prospectively, i.e., to business combinations occurring after the beginning of the annual
reporting period in which it first applies the amendments (the date of initial application). These
amendments had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements of adidas as there were
no contingent assets, liabilities, or contingent liabilities within the scope of these amendments that
arose during the period.
Amendments to – IAS 37 Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective date:
January 1, 2022): An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the
─
obligations under the contract (i.e., the costs that adidas cannot avoid because it has signed the
contract) exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The amendments specify that
when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making, an entity needs to include costs that
relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services including both incremental costs (e.g., the
costs of direct labor and materials) and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities (e.g.,
depreciation of equipment used to fulfill the contract and costs of contract management and
supervision). General administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless
they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract. This amendment had no material
impact on the consolidated financial statements of adidas.
New standards and interpretations as well as amendments to existing standards and interpretations are
usually not applied by adidas before the EU effective date.
The following new standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards and
interpretations issued by the IASB, endorsed by the EU, and which are effective for financial years
beginning after January 1, 2022, have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial
statements:
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and Amendments to IFRS 17 (effective date: January 1, 2023): The new
standard covers the recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure related to all types of
─
insurance contracts. IFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023,
and once effective, will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. No material impact is expected on the
consolidated financial statements.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Amendments to IAS 8: Definition of Accounting Estimates (effective date: January 1, 2023): In
February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 8, in which it introduces a definition of ‘accounting
─
estimates.’ The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and
changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. Also, they clarify how entities use
measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amendments apply to
changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates that occur on or after the start of
the effective date. Earlier application is permitted as long as this fact is disclosed. The amendments
are not expected to have a material impact on adidas’ consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies (effective
date: January 1, 2023): In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice
─
Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, in which it provides guidance and examples to help
entities apply materiality judgments to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help
entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for
entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’
accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making
decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The amendments to IAS 1 are applicable for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 with earlier application permitted. Since the
amendments to the Practice Statement 2 provide non-mandatory guidance on the application of the
definition of ‘material’ to accounting policy information, an effective date for these amendments is not
necessary. Subject to the ongoing assessment, it is expected that the amendments will result in a
reduction in adidas’ accounting policy disclosures.
Amendments to IAS 12: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single
Transaction (effective date: January 1, 2023): In May 2021, the Board issued amendments to IAS 12,
─
which narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption under IAS 12, so that it no longer applies to
transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendments
should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, a deferred
tax asset (provided that sufficient taxable profit is available) and a deferred tax liability should also be
recognized for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with leases and
decommissioning obligations. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on adidas,
in particular since adidas did not apply the initial recognition exemption in the context of leases under
IFRS 16.
The following new standards and interpretations as well as amendments to existing standards and
interpretations were issued by the IASB. These are not yet endorsed by the EU and hence have not been
applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements:
Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (effective date:
January 1, 2024): In January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to
─
specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. Beside others, the
amendments clarify what is meant by a right to defer settlement, that such a right to defer must exist
at the end of the reporting period, and that the classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an
entity will exercise its deferral right. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2024 and must be applied retrospectively. The amendments are not
expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of adidas.
The consolidated financial statements have in principle been prepared on the historical cost basis with the
exception of certain items in the statement of financial position, such as certain originated financial
instruments, derivative financial instruments, and plan assets, which are measured at fair value.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
On February 11, 2021, adidas decided to begin a formal process aimed at divesting Reebok. Due to the
initiation of that selling process, which led to a binding agreement with Authentic Brands Group LLC (ABG),
on August 12, 2021, the Reebok operating business was reported as discontinued operations and classified
as a disposal group held for sale since the resolution has been passed. As of February 28, 2022, the
company has formally completed the divestiture of Reebok to ABG. The assets and liabilities, which were
reported as assets/liabilities held for sale since February 2021, were consequently derecognized from the
consolidated statement of financial position as of February 28, 2022.
Business operations in 2022 were impacted by the effects of the continued coronavirus pandemic and
covid-19-related lockdowns in Greater China as well as by the challenging economic and market
environment globally. Estimates and assumptions relevant to the consolidated financial statements were
made to the best of our knowledge, based on current events and actions. Due to the ongoing uncertainties,
it is still difficult to predict the impact on assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses.
On February 24, 2022 Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine. The still ongoing conflict continue to affect
economic and global financial markets and increase the current economic challenges. As a result of the
ongoing conflict, adidas took the decision in October 2022 to permanently wind down its business
operations in Russia, after having initially introduced a temporary suspension of the business in March
2022. The impairment of Property, plant, and equipment and Right-of-use-assets recognized in this
context as well as the recognition of related provisions has had a negative impact of € 120 million on net
income from continuing operations. ► SEE NOTE 10 ► SEE NOTE 11 ► SEE NOTE 19
In October 2022, adidas terminated the Yeezy partnership with immediate effect, discontinued the
distribution of Yeezy brand products, and stopped all payments to Ye and his companies. adidas is the sole
owner of all design rights to existing products as well as previous and new colorways under the
partnership. As of December 31, 2022, adidas intends to make use of these rights as early as 2023 and to
leverage the existing inventories. As of December 31, 2022, at adidas’ discretion, there was no lower net
realizable value and therefore no impairment loss was recognized on the existing inventories.
Furthermore, adidas believes that there is no other present obligation related to the termination of the
agreement and therefore no provision had to be recognized as of December 31, 2022. ► SEE NOTE 08
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (€), and unless otherwise stated, all values
are presented in millions of euros (€ in millions). Due to rounding principles, numbers presented may not
exactly sum up to totals provided. This can also lead to individual amounts rounded to zero.
02 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the consolidation, accounting, and
valuation principles described below.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of adidas AG and all its direct and
indirect subsidiaries, which are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting principles. An entity is
considered a subsidiary if it is controlled by adidas AG. Control exists when adidas is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the investee.
Effective as of December 2019, an amendment to the contractual arrangements existing between Agron,
Inc., Los Angeles, California (USA), and adidas entered into force granting adidas the power to approve key
financial and operational targets as well as the organizational structure of Agron, Inc. adidas has the right
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
to, and is exposed to, the returns from its contractual business relations with Agron, Inc., which are
dependent on the level of its net sales and overall profitability. As a result of the extended power, adidas
has the ability to directly influence the amount of these variable returns and consequently obtained control
over Agron, Inc. As adidas holds no equity interests of Agron, Inc., both net assets as well as income and
expenses are attributable entirely to the non-controlling interest. adidas has not transferred any
consideration to the owners of Agron, Inc. in relation to the amendment of the contractual arrangements.
The number of consolidated subsidiaries developed as follows in 2022 and 2021, respectively:

First-time consolidated subsidiaries 1 2

The subsidiaries are held either directly by adidas AG or indirectly via the two holding companies adidas
Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH in Germany or adidas International B.V. in the Netherlands.
A schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG is shown in Attachment I to the consolidated financial
statements.This schedule comprises information about the name and domicile of all consolidated
subsidiaries, as well as the respective share held in the capital of these subsidiaries. Furthermore, a
schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG is published on the electronic platform of the German Federal
Gazette. ► SEE SHAREHOLDINGS
Within the scope of the first-time consolidation, all acquired assets and liabilities are recognized in the
statement of financial position at fair value at the acquisition date. A debit difference between the
acquisition cost and the proportionate fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognized
as goodwill. A credit difference is recorded in the consolidated income statement after a reassessment of
the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities has been performed. In cases where not all
of the shares in the investment in a subsidiary are acquired, a non-controlling interest measured initially
as a proportionate share of net assets is recognized at the date of the first-time consolidation.
Acquisitions of additional investments in subsidiaries that are already controlled are recorded as equity
transactions. Therefore, neither fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities nor gains or losses are
recognized. Any difference between the cost for such an additional investment and the carrying amount of
the net assets at the acquisition date is recorded directly in shareholders’ equity.
The financial effects of intercompany transactions as well as any unrealized gains and losses arising from
intercompany business relations are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Financial assets are classified and measured according to IFRS 9. All purchases and sales of financial
assets, with the exception of trade receivables, are recognized on the trade date and initially measured at
fair value. At initial recognition, trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component are
measured at their transaction price. Subsequently, a financial asset is measured at amortized cost, fair
value through other comprehensive income (debt instrument), fair value through other comprehensive
income (equity instrument), or fair value through profit or loss.
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not
designated at fair value through profit or loss: the financial asset is held within a business model whose
objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows (business model ‘Hold to collect’); and the
financial asset’s contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it meets both of the
following conditions and is not designated at fair value through profit or loss: the financial asset is held
within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling
financial assets (business model ‘Hold to collect and sell’); and its contractual terms give rise on specified
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
In principle, all investments in equity instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss. At
initial recognition, an entity may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income
subsequent changes in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument that is neither held for
trading nor a contingent consideration acquired by a purchaser in a business combination. This election is
made on an investment-by-investment basis.
All financial assets, which are not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other
comprehensive income as described above, are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets are only reclassified when the business model for managing financial assets is changed,
in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets is as follows:

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (€), which is also the parent company’s
functional currency. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the respective functional currency by applying
the spot exchange rate valid at the transaction date to the foreign currency amount.
In the individual financial statements of subsidiaries, monetary items denominated in non-functional
currencies of the subsidiaries are generally translated into the functional currency at closing exchange
rates at the balance sheet date. The resulting currency gains and losses are recognized directly in profit or
loss.
This excludes monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment in a
foreign operation. These are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) until the net investment is
disposed of, at which time the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits
attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recognized in OCI.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated
using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair
value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is
determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is
treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item.
Assets and liabilities of the company’s non-euro functional currency subsidiaries that are included in the
consolidated financial statements are translated using closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date
into the presentation currency, the euro. For practical reasons, revenues and expenses are translated at
average rates for the period, which approximate the exchange rates on the transaction dates. The
resulting exchange differences arising on consolidation are recognized in OCI.
A summary of exchange rates to the euro for major currencies in which the Group operates is as follows:
EXCHANGE RATES

MXN 21.2037 23.9943 20.7683 23.1812
HYPERINFLATION
To reflect changes in purchasing power at the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts of non-monetary
assets and liabilities, shareholders’ equity, and comprehensive income of subsidiaries in hyperinflationary
economies are restated in terms of a measuring unit current at the balance sheet date. These are indexed
using a general price index in accordance with IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary
Economies.’ In contrast, no restatement is required for monetary assets and liabilities carried at amounts
current at the end of the balance sheet date because they represent money held, to be received, or to be
paid. ► SEE NOTE 34
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Gains and losses on the net monetary position are included in the financial result.
Non-monetary assets that have been restated following the guidance in IAS 29 are still subject to
impairment assessment in accordance with the guidance in the relevant IFRS.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
adidas uses derivative financial instruments, such as currency options, forward exchange contracts, and
stock price options, as well as forward stock transactions and currency swaps, to hedge its exposure to
foreign-exchange and stock-price risks. In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the company does not
enter into transactions with derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the statement of financial position at fair value,
and are subsequently also measured at their fair value. The method of recognizing the resulting gains or
losses is dependent on the nature of the hedge. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, adidas
designates derivatives as either a hedge of a forecast transaction (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of a net
investment in a foreign operation. In applying cash flow hedge accounting, adidas designates the spot
element of forward exchange contracts and the intrinsic value of currency options to hedge its currency
risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1 (spot-to-spot designation). The forward element of forward exchange
contracts and the time value component of currency options are excluded from the designation of the
hedging instrument.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or net
investments that are effective as defined in IFRS 9 are recognized in equity.
adidas applies the ‘cost of hedging’ approach for dedicated cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of
the time value component of currency options, as well as the forward element in forward exchange
contracts, are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging and are recognized separately in equity as a
cost of hedging reserve. When the effectiveness is not 100%, the ineffective portion of the change in the
fair value is recognized in the consolidated income statement. Accumulated gains and losses in equity are
transferred to the consolidated income statement in the same periods, during which the hedged forecast
transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. The
effective currency gains and losses in the derivative and all gains and losses arising on the translation of
the borrowing are recognized in equity with the exception of the cross-currency basis spread.
Certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the company’s risk-
management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IFRS 9.
adidas documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedge objects as well as the risk
management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions at transaction
inception. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific firm commitments
and forecast transactions. adidas also assesses the effectiveness and possible ineffectiveness of its
hedged derivatives by using generally accepted methods of effectiveness testing, such as the ‘hypothetical
derivative method’ or the ‘dollar offset method.’ The economic relationship between the hedging
instrument and hedged item is qualitatively and quantitatively ascertainable, and adidas judges the
effectiveness of the hedging relationship with the hypothetical derivative method. The main sources of
expected ineffectiveness are due to changes in the credit risk and in the timing of the hedged transactions.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The fair values of currency options, forward exchange contracts, and forward stock transactions are
determined on the basis of market conditions on the reporting date. The fair value of a currency option is
determined using generally accepted models. The fair value of an option is influenced not only by the
remaining term of the option but also by additional factors, such as the actual foreign exchange rate and
the volatility of the underlying foreign currency base. The company determines fair values taking the
counterparty risk into consideration.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash at banks, cash on hand, and short-term deposits with
maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition, such as commercial papers and
investments in money market funds.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts
of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash equivalents can partly include investments in money market funds. Classification and measurement
under IFRS 9 are performed based on the company’s business model for managing these financial assets
and the contractual cash flow characteristics. Investments in money market funds contain cash flows
other than those of principal and interest on principal. As a result, those investments are measured at fair
value through profit or loss.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
A receivable is recognized if an amount of consideration that is unconditional is due from the customer
(i.e., if only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due). Accounts
receivable that do not contain a significant financing component are recognized at the transaction price,
which represents the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for
transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third
parties. Subsequently, these are measured at amortized cost.
OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS
Other financial assets are classified and measured under IFRS 9, based on the company’s business model
for managing these assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics. Those other financial assets that
give rise to cash flows consisting only of payments of principal and interest and that are assigned to the
business model ‘Hold to collect’ are measured at amortized cost. adidas mainly has security deposits and
receivables from credit card companies and electronic marketplaces that fall under this category.
Other financial assets that give rise to cash flows consisting only of payments of principal and interest and
that are assigned to the business model ‘Hold to collect and sell’ are measured at fair value through OCI.
This category mainly includes other investments and securities to hedge long-term variable compensation
components.
Other financial assets, which are neither within the business model ‘Hold to collect’ nor ‘Hold to collect
and sell,’ are measured at fair value through profit or loss. This category mainly includes secured
promissory notes and earn-out components.
LONG-TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS
Long-term financial assets are distinguished between debt and equity instruments and classified
according to IFRS 9 as follows:
Debt instruments are measured depending on the company’s business model for managing financial
assets and the contractual cash flows. Only financial assets that are held within the business model ‘Hold
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
to collect’ with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows, which represent solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding on a specific date, are measured at amortized
cost. adidas classifies certain loans within this category. All other financial assets which do not fulfill one
of these criteria are measured at fair value – either at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value
through other comprehensive income (debt). adidas has no long-term financial assets in the category fair
value through comprehensive income (debt instrument) and shows loans which do not fulfill the
contractual cash flow characteristics in the category fair value through profit or loss. ► SEE NOTE 14
Generally, all investments in equity instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss, unless
these investments represent investments that the company intends to hold for long-term strategic
purposes, which are then designated as equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive
income (equity).
The designation of certain equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity) is
based on a strategic Management decision.
INVENTORIES
Finished goods and merchandise are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Costs are determined using a standard valuation method, the
‘average cost method.’ Costs of finished goods include cost of direct materials and labor and the
components of the manufacturing overheads which can be reasonably attributed to finished goods. The
allocation of overheads is based on the planned average utilization. The net realizable value allowances
are computed consistently throughout the company based on the age and expected future sales of the
items on hand. ► SEE NOTE 08
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
A part of the adidas Group, whose operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished operationally and
for financial reporting purposes from the other operating businesses, is classified as a discontinued
operation if the component has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, and:
represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations,
is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area
─
of operations, or
─
is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
─
Discontinued operations are excluded from the net income/loss from continuing operations and are
presented as a single amount as gain/loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated
income statement. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative
consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows are restated and presented as if
the operation had been classified as such from the start of the comparative year. ► SEE NOTE 03
ASSETS/LIABILITIES AND DISPOSAL GROUPS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE
Assets/liabilities and disposal groups classified as held for sale are non-current assets and liabilities
expected to be realized principally through a sale rather than through continuing use. The criteria for held
for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, and the asset or disposal
group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. It being unlikely that significant changes to
the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn is also a prerequisite for the
classification.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The sale must be expected to be completed within one year from the date of the classification. Assets and
liabilities classified as held for sale are hence presented separately as current items in the consolidated
statement of financial position.
These are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are
the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance
costs and income tax expense.
Assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale or held for distribution and subsequent gains
and losses on remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss. Reversals of impairment losses due to a
subsequent increase in fair value are recognized up to a maximum of the amount of impairment losses
that, unless attributable to goodwill, were recognized prior to classification of the asset or disposal group
in accordance with IFRS 5 and IAS 36, or were recognized at or after the date of classification in
accordance with IFRS 5.
Additional disclosures are provided in these Notes. ► SEE NOTE 03
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant, and equipment are measured at amortized cost. This comprises all costs directly
attributable to bringing the asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by Management less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognized for those assets, with the exception of land and construction in progress, over
the estimated useful life utilizing the ‘straight-line method’ and taking into account any potential residual
value, except where the ‘declining-balance method’ is more appropriate in light of the actual utilization
pattern. Parts of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the
total cost of the item are depreciated separately. ► SEE NOTE 10
Estimated useful lives are as follows:
ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT
Years
Land indefinite
Buildings and leasehold improvements 20 – 50
Furniture and fixtures 3 – 5
Technical equipment and machinery as well as other equipment 2 – 10
Expenditure for repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred. Renewals and improvements are
capitalized and depreciated separately, if the recognition criteria are met.
IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
If facts and circumstances indicate that non-current assets (e.g., property, plant, and equipment as well as
intangible assets including goodwill and contract assets) might be impaired, the recoverable amount is
determined. This is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal (net disposal price) and
value in use. Non-financial items measured at the recoverable amount primarily relate to impaired
property, plant, and equipment being measured based on value in use or on fair value taking unobservable
inputs (e.g., profit or cash flow planning) into account. The fair value is measured at Level 3 according to
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement.’
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
An impairment loss is recognized in other operating expenses or reported in goodwill impairment losses if
the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The impairment test for goodwill is performed based on groups of cash-generating units, which represent
the lowest level within the company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. If
there is an impairment loss for a group of cash-generating units, first the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the group of cash-generating units is reduced. Subsequently, provided that the recoverable
amount is lower than the carrying amount, the other non-current assets of the group of cash-generating
units are reduced pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the group of cash-
generating units. In allocating an impairment loss, the carrying amount of an individual asset is not
reduced below its fair value. The amount of the impairment loss that would otherwise have been allocated
to the asset is allocated pro rata to the other assets of the cash-generating unit and groups of cash-
generating units.
The impairment test for trademarks with indefinite useful lives is performed on the relevant level of cash-
generating units.
Irrespective of whether there is an impairment indication, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life
and goodwill acquired in business combinations are tested annually on December 31 for impairment. In
the case that indicators for impairment are present at any point in time other than on December 31, these
assets are also tested for impairment at this point in time.
An impairment loss recognized in goodwill is not reversible. With respect to all other impaired assets, an
impairment loss recognized in prior periods is only reversed affecting the consolidated income statement
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment
loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined (net of depreciation or amortization) if no impairment loss had been
recognized.
IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL ASSETS
Impairment losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other
comprehensive income (debt instrument) are recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 ‘Financial
Instruments.’ The standard requires that not only historical data, but also future expectations and
projections are taken into consideration when accounting for impairment losses (‘expected credit loss’
model).
adidas consistently applies the simplified approach and recognizes lifetime expected credit losses for all
accounts receivable. In order to calculate a collective loss allowance, all accounts receivable sharing
similar credit risk characteristics are allocated into several portfolios based on geographical regions and
macroeconomic indicators. Historical payment and aging patterns for accounts receivable are analyzed
individually for each of the portfolios to determine the probability of default, which is further adjusted by
forward-looking factors derived primarily from the Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads of the countries
where adidas runs its operations. The adjusted probability of default is then applied in combination with a
loss given default and exposure at default as a percentage rate to calculate the expected credit loss for
each portfolio and aging bucket. The percentage rates are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they
reflect the latest data on credit risk. In case objective evidence of credit impairment is observed for
accounts receivable from a specific customer, a detailed analysis of the credit risk is performed, and an
appropriate individual loss allowance is recognized for this customer. Accounts receivables are considered
to be in default when it is expected that the debtor will not fulfill its credit obligations toward adidas.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost are subject to a general impairment approach
under IFRS 9. adidas applies the low credit risk exemption for the majority of such instruments due to the
low credit risk for these investments, which is based upon the investment grade of their counterparties
(defined by the company as equivalent of BBB+ or higher). A significant increase of credit risk is assumed
for cash and cash equivalents when the instruments are more than 30 days past due. adidas monitors the
credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents taking into consideration the economic environment,
external credit ratings, and/or CDS spreads of counterparty financial institutions, and using established
exposure limits. Expected credit loss of cash and cash equivalents is calculated based on the probability of
default and recovery rates derived from CDS spreads or external credit ratings of the counterparties. Cash
and cash equivalents are considered to be in default when they are more than 90 days past due.
Other financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 impairment analysis include mainly security deposits as
well as accounts receivable from credit card companies and electronic marketplaces. The credit risk
associated with such financial assets is determined based on the economic environment, external credit
ratings, and/or CDS spreads of counterparty financial institutions. Other financial assets are considered to
be in default when they are more than 90 days past due.
Objective evidence that credit impairment of financial assets has occurred includes, for instance,
significant financial difficulty of the debtor/issuer, indications of their potential bankruptcy, the
deterioration of the market for their products, and general macroeconomic problems. The gross carrying
amount of financial assets is written off when adidas, based on a case-by-case assessment, assumes that
their recovery is no longer possible.
Impairment losses on accounts receivable are presented in the line item ‘Impairment losses (net) on
accounts receivable and contract assets,’ while impairment losses on all other financial assets are shown
in the line item ‘Financial expenses’ in the consolidated income statement.
LEASES
adidas assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease according to IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ at the inception of
the contract. IFRS 16 defines a lease as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A contract conveys the right to control the use of
an identified asset if the lessee has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use
of the identified asset (e.g., by having the exclusive right to use the asset throughout that period) and the
right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use.
In its role as a lessee, adidas leases various types of assets, particularly buildings (retail stores, offices,
warehouses, etc.), land, technical equipment and machinery (warehouse equipment, production machines,
etc.), motor vehicles, and computer hardware, as well as furniture and fixtures. Lease contracts are
typically negotiated for fixed periods of up to 99 years but may include extension or termination options.
Lease terms are negotiated individually and may contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.
adidas makes use of the recognition exemption in IFRS 16 to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities for leases of low-value assets (i.e., value of the underlying asset, when new, is € 5,000 or less)
and short-term leases (shorter than twelve months and the agreement does not include a purchase
option). The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Real estate and automobile leases are excluded from the classification as ‘low-
value assets.’
Furthermore, adidas exercises the option for lessees to combine lease payments with payments for non-
lease components in the calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset for all lease asset classes
except for real estate.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
adidas recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement
date. At the commencement date, adidas initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the
lease payments that are not paid at that date. This includes fixed payments (including in-substance fixed
payments), less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments based on an index or a rate,
amounts expected to be payable by adidas under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a
purchase option if adidas is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for
terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. Other variable lease
payments are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. The lease payments are discounted
using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, adidas uses its
incremental borrowing rate. Generally, adidas uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate,
adjusted to reflect the country-specific risk, the contract currency-specific risk, and the lease term.
► SEE NOTE 11 ► SEE NOTE 20
After the commencement date, lease payments are split into redemption payments and interest payments.
The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest cost on
the lease liability using the effective interest rate and reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease
payments made. The carrying amount of the lease liability is remeasured provided any
reassessments/lease modifications occur (including changes in the assessment of whether an extension
or termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised).
At the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is comprised of the
amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and
an estimate of costs to be incurred by adidas in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring
the site on which it is located, or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and
conditions of the lease. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. In
principle, the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term or the useful
life of the leased asset, whichever is shorter.
adidas applies judgment in determining the lease term for lease contracts including extension or
termination options. The assessment of whether the options are reasonably certain to be exercised has an
impact on the lease term and therefore may significantly affect the measurement of lease liabilities and
right-of-use assets, respectively.
Lease contract renegotiations that result in changes to the original contractual conditions, e.g., changes in
scope, consideration (including discounts and concessions), or lease term are treated as lease
modifications, even if they are a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Depending on the circumstances of
the renegotiation, either lease modifications are accounted for as a new separate contract or they trigger a
remeasurement of the lease liability using the discounted future lease payments. In the latter case, a
corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset with, in some instances, a difference
recognized in profit or loss.
Lease reassessments are the result of changes in assumptions or judgments, such as changes in lease
term due to amended estimates surrounding existing extension and termination options. It is necessary to
remeasure the lease liability using the discounted or existing future lease payments and make a
corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
In rare cases, adidas acts as a lessor when the company signs sub-leasing contracts for real estate
properties with third parties. These contracts are not material to the company’s consolidated financial
statements.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
adidas does not own any investment property.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business
combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. This results when the purchase
cost exceeds the fair value of acquired identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities. Goodwill
arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of
assets received, liabilities, and contingent liabilities are treated as assets, liabilities, and contingent
liabilities of the respective reporting entity, and are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of
the initial consolidation.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment
losses (Impairment-only approach). ► SEE NOTE 12
Goodwill is carried in the functional currency of the acquired foreign entity.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS (EXCEPT GOODWILL)
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (in particular trademarks) are recognized at purchase cost
and are subject to an impairment test at least on an annual basis (impairment-only approach).
Intangible assets with definite useful lives are valued at amortized cost. Amortization is calculated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, taking into account any potential residual value. ► SEE NOTE 13
Expenditure during the development phase of internally generated intangible assets is capitalized as
incurred if it fulfills the recognition criteria under IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets.’ Development costs for
internally generated intangible assets are capitalized from the date on which the recognition criteria set
out in IAS 38 'Intangible Assets' are first met. The capitalized development costs are amortized on a
systematic basis from the day it is available for use.
Estimated useful lives are as follows:
ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Years
Trademarks indefinite
Software 3 – 7
Patents, trademarks and licenses 5 – 15
Websites 2
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research costs are expensed in full as incurred. Development costs for internally generated intangible
assets are also expensed as incurred if they do not meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible
Assets.’
BORROWINGS AND OTHER LIABILITIES
Borrowings (e.g., eurobonds) and other liabilities are recognized at fair value using the ‘effective interest
method,’ net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, long-term borrowings are stated at
amortized cost using the ‘effective interest method.’ Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction
costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the consolidated income statement over the term of the
borrowing.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Compound financial instruments (e.g., convertible bonds) are divided into a liability component shown
under borrowings and into an equity component resulting from conversion rights. The equity component is
included in the capital reserve. The fair value of the liability component is determined by discounting the
interest and principal payments of a comparable liability without conversion rights, applying risk-adjusted
interest rates. The liability component is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the ‘effective
interest method.’ The equity component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the total
compound financial instrument and the fair value of the liability component and is reported within equity.
There is no subsequent measurement of the equity component. At initial recognition, directly attributable
transaction costs are assigned to the equity and liability component pro rata on the basis of the respective
carrying amounts.
PROVISIONS AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES
Provisions are recognized where a present obligation (legal or constructive) to third parties has been
incurred as a result of a past event that can be estimated reliably and is likely to lead to an outflow of
resources, and where the timing or amount is uncertain. The expense relating to a provision is presented
in the consolidated income statement. Non-current provisions are discounted if the effect of discounting is
material, with the interest expense being reported as financial expenses. ► SEE NOTE 19
Accrued liabilities are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied but have
not been paid, invoiced, or formally agreed with the supplier, including amounts due to employees. Here,
however, the timing and amount of an outflow of resources is not uncertain. ► SEE NOTE 21
PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS
Provisions and expenses for pensions and similar obligations relate to the company’s obligations for
defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The obligations under defined benefit plans are determined
separately for each plan by valuing the employee benefits accrued in return for their service during the
current and prior periods. These benefit accruals are discounted to calculate their present value, and the
fair value of any plan assets is deducted in order to determine the net liability. The discount rate is set on
the basis of yields of high-quality fixed-rate corporate bonds at the balance sheet date provided there is a
deep market for such corporate bonds in a given currency. Otherwise, government bond yields are used as
a reference. Calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the ‘projected unit credit method’ in
accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are
recognized as an expense in the consolidated income statement as incurred. ► SEE NOTE 24
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of
adidas. Additionally, contingent liabilities may be present obligations that arise from past events, but which
are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation, or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent
liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed and
explained in the Notes. ► SEE NOTE 39
TREASURY SHARES
When adidas AG shares are repurchased and recognized as treasury shares, the amount of the
consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognized as a
deduction from equity. The nominal value of € 1 per treasury share is debited to share capital. Any
premium or discount to the nominal value is shown as an adjustment to the retained earnings. If treasury
shares are sold or re-issued, the nominal value of the shares will be credited to share capital and the
amount exceeding the nominal value will be added to the retained earnings.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
CONTRACT ASSETS AND CONTRACT LIABILITIES
Contract assets and liabilities are recognized in connection with revenues arising from the licensing-out of
the right to use the brands to third parties. Contract assets represent the company’s conditional right to
consideration in exchange for rights that adidas has transferred to a third party, and contract liabilities
represent the company’s obligation to transfer rights to a third party for which adidas has already received
consideration from the third party. Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment. Refer to
accounting policies on Impairment Losses on financial assets. Contract liabilities are recognized as
income when the control of the related goods or services is transferred to the customer.
REVENUE
Revenue derived from the sale of goods is recognized when adidas has satisfied the respective
performance obligation by transferring the promised goods to the customer. The goods are transferred at
the point in time when the customer obtains control of the respective goods. The timing of the transfer of
control depends on the individual terms of the sales agreement (terms of delivery).
The amount of revenue to be recognized is determined based on the consideration adidas expects to be
entitled to in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer, taking into
account returns, discounts, and rebates.
Under certain conditions and in accordance with contractual agreements, the company’s customers have
the right to return products and to either exchange them for similar or other products or to return the
products against the issuance of a credit note. Amounts for estimated returns related to revenues are
accrued based on past experience of average return rates and average actual return periods by means of a
refund liability. The return assets are measured at the former carrying amount of the
inventories/products, less any handling costs and any potential impairment.
Provided that the customers meet certain predefined conditions, adidas grants its customers different
types of globally aligned performance-based rebates. Examples include rebates for customers’ increasing
adidas product sales, for customer loyalty, and for sell-out support, e.g., through retail space/franchise
store management. As soon as it is assumed that the customer fulfills the requirements for being granted
the rebate, this amount is recognized as a sales deduction via an accrued liability for marketing and sales.
Customer incentives and options as well as any obligation for adidas to pay for the delivery of goods to the
customer do not create separate performance obligations under IFRS 15 and are separated from revenue.
Customer incentives that were not contractually agreed upon as well as promises that were implied by
adidas’ customary business practice and did not bear the characteristics of a discount are accounted for
as marketing and point-of-sale expenses.
In addition, adidas generates revenue from the licensing-out of the right to use the brands to third parties.
The resulting sales-based royalty and commission income is recognized based on the contract terms on
an accrual basis, i.e., revenue is already realized even though the payment takes place at a later point in
time. Contracts with guaranteed minimum income result in contract assets and contract liabilities
depending on the timing of yearly payments received from customers. The performance obligation related
to these contract assets and liabilities is satisfied over the life of the contract, i.e., the guaranteed
minimum income per year is evenly distributed over twelve months, whereby payments are recorded as
arranged in the contract with the customer.
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURE
Advance payments for media campaigns are included in prepaid expenses within other current and non-
current assets until the services are received, and upon receipt are expensed in full. Significant costs for
media campaigns are expensed on a straight-line basis over the intended duration of the media campaign.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Promotional expenses including one-time up-front payments for promotion contracts are principally
expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.
INTEREST
Interest is recognized as income or expense as incurred using the ‘effective interest method’ with the
exception of interest that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a
qualifying asset. This interest is capitalized as part of the cost of the qualifying asset.
Interest paid is presented within the net cash used in financing activities.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
adidas receives government grants in the form of subsidies, subventions, or premiums from local,
national, or international government authorities such as those of the Free State of Bavaria, the Federal
Republic of Germany, and the European Union.
Government grants are recognized if there is adequate certainty that the grants will be received and that
the company satisfies the conditions attached.
Government grants are reported in the consolidated income statement as a deduction from the related
expenses.
INCOME TAXES
Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the applicable taxation rules established in the
countries in which adidas operates.
adidas computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax
base of its assets and liabilities as well as for tax loss carry-forwards. As it is not permitted to recognize a
deferred tax liability for the initial recognition of goodwill, adidas does not compute any deferred taxes
thereon.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year
when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards that exceed
taxable temporary differences are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that the entity
concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the associated benefit. The carrying amount of
deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be
utilized.
Income tax is recognized in the consolidated income statement unless it relates to items recognized
directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity. Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside
profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognized in correlation to the
underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
When there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, adidas recognizes and measures current or
deferred tax assets or liabilities applying the requirements of IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. On a case-by-case
basis, adidas determines whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with
one or more other uncertain tax treatments, depending on which approach better predicts the resolution
of the uncertainty.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Where it is not considered probable that the tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, adidas
reflects the effects of the uncertainty by using one of the following methods, depending on which method
better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty:
the single most likely amount or
the expected value based on the sum of the probability-weighted amounts.
─
─
In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profits (tax
losses), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and tax rates, adidas assumes that a taxation
authority will examine amounts it has a right to examine and will have full knowledge of all relevant
information when making those examinations. ► SEE NOTE 35
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
The cost of equity-settled share-based payment transactions with employees is determined by the fair
value at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.That cost is recognized in personnel
expenses, together with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings), over the period in which
the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The
cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the company’s best estimate of the number
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. ► SEE NOTE 27
Service-independent and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when
determining the fair value of awards at the grant date, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is
assessed as part of the company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately
vest. If the estimate is changed, even a credit in the consolidated income statement for the period can be
possible as it reflects the movement in cumulative expenses from the beginning to the end of that period.
No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or
service conditions have not been met.
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees are generally
measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where the fair value cannot be
estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted,
measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services acquired and the liability
incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the fair value of the
liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with all changes in
fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period.
ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of assumptions and
estimates that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Although such estimates are based on the
best of our knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from these
estimates. In 2022, assumptions and estimates continued to be significantly impacted by the coronavirus
pandemic as well as increased macroeconomic challenges, and due to the ongoing situation, future
assumptions and estimates will be impacted by this.
The decision to permanently discontinue the business activities in Russia leads in particular to an
increased level of judgment and estimation uncertainties with regard to provisions recognized in this
context. ► SEE NOTE 19

03 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
DESCRIPTION
On February 11, 2021, the company decided to initiate a formal process aimed at divesting Reebok, which
was completed with signing of a sales agreement with Authentic Brands Group LLC on August 12, 2021.
Due to the concrete plans to divest Reebok and the approval by the relevant committees, the Reebok
operating business has been reported as discontinued operations and classified as a disposal group held
for sale since the resolution.
The Reebok business was sold on 28 February 2022 with effect from 1 March 2022. The majority of the
purchase price was paid at closing, with the remainder comprising deferred and contingent consideration.
The fair value of earn-out components was determined using the discounted cash flow method and the
Monte Carlo method, respectively.

from discontinued operations also includes a gain of € 6 million (2021: € 12 million) related to divestments
from prior years.
The total tax benefit related to discontinued operations is € 248 million (2021: tax expense of
€ 168 million). The amount of € 248 million breaks down as follows: a gain from the release of a deferred
tax liability of € 308 million is included in the gain from the sale of discontinued operations of
€ 522 million. The taxable profit from the sale of discontinued operations leads to a tax expense of
€ 308 million. The tax benefit of € 248 million includes a tax benefit resulting from restructuring measures
related to discontinued operations.
As part of the divestiture of the Reebok brand, agreements were concluded for a limited period of time for
the purchase and distribution of Reebok products in certain markets. In this context, adidas is acting as an
agent in accordance with IFRS 15.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
05 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held by banks, cash on hand, and short-term deposits.
Short-term deposits are only shown as cash and cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to a known
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
The credit risk of cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost is insignificant due to their short-
term maturity, counterparties’ investment grade credit ratings, and established exposure limits.
Therefore, adidas does not recognize any credit impairment losses for these financial assets.
Cash and cash equivalents includes € 155 million and € 214 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, held by subsidiaries that were subject to foreign exchange control (e.g. Russia, Argentina) or
other legal restriction and hence were not at anytime available for general use by adidas AG or other
subsidiaries.

As a general principle, it is regularly assessed whether there are any indications that right-of-use assets
might be impaired. Irrespective of the existence of such indications, right-of-use assets in adidas’ own
retail stores are tested annually for impairment, whereby the recoverable amount, as part of determining
the profitability of the adidas’ own retail stores, is calculated using the ‘discounted cash flow method.’
Impairment losses for right-of-use assets recognized in 2022 mainly relate to the company’s own retail
activities and right-of-use assets in Russia and Ukraine, for which, contrary to expectations based in 2021,
there will be a lower future economic benefit.
In 2022, impairment losses of € 126 million were recognized for non-current assets (property, plant, and
equipment, right-of-use assets). Thereof € 20 million are related to the company’s own retail activities and
are mainly attributable to EMEA with € 13 million; Asia-Pacific with € 5 million; and Greater China with
€ 3 million. Discount rates between 8.6% and 15.2% were used to calculate the impairment for the value in
use. The recoverable amounts of adidas´own retail stores break down into Asia-Pacific at € 176 million,
EMEA at € 80 million, North America at € 30 million, Greater China at € 28 million, other businesses at
€ 5 million and Latin America at € 1 million. Due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the
decision to permanently wind down the business activities in Russia in 2022, impairment losses of
€ 94 million were recognized for both countries mentioned. These mainly include the impairment of the
warehouse in Russia, which was impaired by € 31 million to its fair value of € 29 million based on an
external appraisal. The impairment losses were recognized in the other operating expenses.
The income from sub-leasing of right-of-use assets recognized in the consolidated income statement in
2022 amounts to € 3 million (2021: € 3 million).
Further information on total depreciation and amortization expenses, impairment losses and reversals of
impairment losses is provided in these Notes. ► SEE NOTE 32

12 GOODWILL
The following table presents a reconciliation of the carrying amount of goodwill:
GOODWILL € IN MILLIONS
Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021
Goodwill, gross 1,680 1,630
Less: accumulated impairment losses (420) (402)
Goodwill, net 1,260 1,228
adidas determines whether goodwill impairment is necessary at least on an annual basis. The impairment
test for goodwill is performed based on groups of cash-generating units that represent the lowest level
within the company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. This requires an
estimation of the recoverable amount of the groups of cash-generating units to which the goodwill is
allocated. The recoverable amount of a group of cash-generating units is determined based on its value in
use. Estimating the value in use requires adidas to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows
from the groups of cash-generating units and also to choose a suitable discount rate to calculate the
present value of those cash flows.
This calculation uses cash flow projections based on the financial planning covering a four-year period in
total. The planning is based on long-term expectations of the company and reflects an average annual
mid-single sales increase with varying forecast growth prospects for the different groups of cash-
generating units. Furthermore, adidas expects the operating margin to improve to a level of low double-
digit profitability for the company by 2026, primarily driven by an improvement in gross margin, as well as
lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. The planning for capital expenditure and working
capital is primarily based on past experience. The planning for future tax payments is based on current
statutory corporate tax rates of the individual groups of cash-generating units. Cash flows beyond this
four-year period are extrapolated using steady growth rates of 1.7% (2021: 1.7%). According to the
company’s expectations, these growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the
business sector in which the respective group of cash-generating units operates.
Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering a five-year average
market-weighted debt/equity structure and financing costs referencing major competitors for the
respective group of cash-generating units. The discount rates used are after-tax rates and reflect the
specific equity and country risk of the respective group of cash-generating units.
The groups of cash-generating units are defined as the regional markets that are responsible for the
distribution of the adidas brands. The regional markets are Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), North
America, Greater China, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. The number of groups of cash-generating units
amounted to a total of five at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The goodwill impairment tests revealed no need for goodwill impairment for the years ending
December 31, 2022 and 2021.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The carrying amounts of acquired goodwill allocated to the respective groups of cash-generating units and
the respective discount rates applied to the cash flow projections are as follows:
ALLOCATION OF GOODWILL
Goodwill (€ in millions) Discount rate (after taxes)
Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021
EMEA 720 700 12.0% 8.2%
North America 77 77 9.8% 7.3%
Greater China 299 290 10.7% 7.9%
Asia-Pacific 164 161 10.8% 7.9%
Total 1,260 1,228
A change in the discount rate by up to approximately 0.5 percentage points or a reduction of planned free
cash inflows by up to approximately 6.5% would not result in any impairment requirement of the cash
generating unit North America.
Among the remaining cash generating units, neither a change in the discount rate by up to approximately
6 percentage points, nor a reduction of planned free cash inflows by up to approximately 40% would result
in any impairment requirement.
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments of the reported
goodwill in the future.
The majority of goodwill is denominated in US dollars. The effect of currency translation is as follows:

17 BORROWINGS AND CREDIT LINES
Borrowings are denominated in a variety of currencies in which adidas conducts its business. Whereas the
largest portion of effective gross borrowings (before liquidity swaps for cash management purposes) as at
December 31, 2022, are mainly denominated in euros (2022: 100%; 2021: 100%).
The weighted average interest rate on the Group’s gross borrowings increased to 0.8% in 2022
(2021: 0.7%).
As at December 31, 2022, adidas had cash credit lines and other long-term financing arrangements
totaling € 7.5 billion (2021: € 6.6 billion); thereof unused credit lines accounted for € 4.0 billion
(2021: € 4.1 billion). In addition, as at December 31, 2022, adidas had separate lines for the issuance of
letters of credit and guarantees in an amount of approximately € 0.5 billion (2021: € 0.6 billion).
In November 2020, adidas entered into a new syndicated credit facility agreement with twelve banks
totaling € 1.5 billion. The credit facility agreement was subsequently amended in October 2021 and in
November 2022. The amended and restated credit facility with eleven partner banks has a size of
€ 2.0 billion and will run until November 2027. It can be drawn in euros and US dollars. The interest
bearing is based on a defined margin on a reference rate (,€STR or ,EURIBOR for euros).

In 2020, adidas issued three rated eurobonds with a size of € 500 million and denominations of € 100,000
each. The four-year eurobond maturing in September 2024, with a coupon of 0.00% and the 15-year
eurobond maturing in September 2035, with a coupon of 0.625% were issued in September 2020. These
bonds were priced with a spread of 33 basis points and 63 basis points, respectively, above the
corresponding euro mid-swap rate. The issue price was fixed at 100.321% and 99.360%, respectively. In
adidas’ inaugural sustainability bond placement in September 2020, an eight-year eurobond was issued
with a coupon of 0.00% maturing in October 2028. The sustainability bond was priced with a spread of 40
basis points above the corresponding euro mid-swap rate. The issue price was fixed at 99.410%. Proceeds
from the issuance will be used in accordance with adidas’ sustainability bond framework. Eligible
sustainable projects include investments into sustainable materials and processes, as well as projects
with a positive impact on the community. More specifically, this includes the sourcing of recycled
materials for sustainably manufactured products, investments into renewable energy production and
energy-efficient buildings as well as various initiatives aimed at creating lasting change in
underrepresented communities.
adidas AG issued in November 2022 two eurobonds with a size of € 500 million each. The three-year
eurobond maturing in November 2025 bears a coupon of 3.00% and was issued at 99.901% issue price. The
seven-year eurobond maturing in November 2029 bears a coupon of 3.125% and was issued at 99.272%
issue price. These bonds were priced with a spread of 20 and 45 basis points, respectively, above the
corresponding euro mid-swap rate. Proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate
purposes including the refinancing of upcoming maturities.
In September 2018, adidas AG issued a € 500 million equity-neutral convertible bond with a coupon of
0.05% due in September 2023. The issue price was fixed at 104% of the notional amount, corresponding to
an annual yield to maturity of negative 0.73%. The initial conversion price was determined to be € 291.84 a
conversion premium of 40% over the reference share price of € 208.46. The economic risk exposure of
share price movements was hedged by purchased call options on ordinary adidas AG shares.

Non-current provisions mainly consist of provisions for long-term variable compensation components with
a time frame of three to four years, discounted with country-specific interest rates.
Management follows past experience from similar transactions when assessing the recognition and the
measurement of provisions; in particular, external legal opinions are considered for provisions for
customs risks and for litigation and other legal risks. All evidence from events until the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements is taken into account.
Due to the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the decision to permanently wind down
business activities in Russia in 2022, provisions of € 30 million have been recognized for personnel, taxes,
other than income taxes and sundry provisions.

24 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS
adidas has recognized post-employment benefit obligations arising from defined benefit plans. The
benefits are provided pursuant to the legal, fiscal, and economic conditions in each respective country and
mainly depend on the employees’ years of service and remuneration.
PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS € IN MILLIONS
Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021
Liability arising from defined benefit pension plans 114 266
Similar obligations 1 1
Pensions and similar obligations 115 267
The liability arising from defined benefit pension plans consist on the one hand of assets from defined
benefit pension plans in an amount of € 4 million (2021: € 1 million) and provisions for pensions and
similar obligations in an amount of € 118 million (2021: € 267 million).
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLANS
The total expense for defined contribution pension plans amounted to € 91 million in 2022
(2021: € 73 million).
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS
Given the company’s diverse subsidiary structure, different defined benefit pension plans exist, comprising
a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements. The company’s major defined benefit pension plans
relate to adidas AG and its subsidiaries in the UK and South Korea. The defined benefit pension plans
generally provide payments in case of death, disability, or retirement to former employees and their
survivors. The obligations arising from defined benefit pension plans are partly covered by plan assets.
In Germany, adidas AG grants its employees contribution-based and final-salary-defined benefit pension
schemes, which provide employees with entitlements in the event of retirement, disability, and death.
German pension plans operate under the legal framework of the German Company Pensions Act
(‘Betriebsrentengesetz’) and under general German labor legislation. Active existing employees and new
entrants are entitled to benefits in accordance with the general company agreement ‘Core Benefits: adidas
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
company pension plan.’ This is a pension plan with a basic employer contribution, possible salary
sacrifices, and additional matching contribution. Thus, the contributions to this pension plan are partly
paid by the employee and partly paid by the employer. The contributions are transferred into benefit
components. The benefits are paid out in the form of a pension, a lump sum, or installments. The pension
plans in Germany are financed using book reserves, a contractual trust arrangement (CTA) and, for certain
former members of the Executive Board of adidas AG, a pension fund (‘Pensionsfonds’) in combination
with a reinsured provident fund (‘Unterstützungskasse’).
The final salary defined benefit pension scheme in the UK is closed to new entrants and to future accrual.
The benefits are mainly paid out in the form of pensions. The scheme operates under UK trust law as well
as under the jurisdiction of the UK Pensions Regulator and therefore is subject to a minimum funding
requirement. The Trustee Board is responsible for setting the scheme’s funding objective, agreeing the
contributions with the company, and determining the investment strategy of the scheme.
In South Korea, adidas grants a final salary defined pension plan to certain employees. The benefits are
paid out in the form of a lump sum. The pension plan operates under the Employee Retirement Benefit
Security Act (ERSA). This regulation requires a minimum funding amounting to 100% of the present value
of the vested benefit obligation. The annual contribution includes at least the minimum amount in order to
meet the funding requirements.

The Group’s pension plans are subject to risks from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the
discount rate, salary, and pension increase rates, and risks from changes in mortality. A lower discount
rate results in a higher defined benefit obligation and/or in higher contributions to the pension funds.
Lower than expected performance of the plan assets could lead to an increase in required contributions or
to a decline of the funded status.
The following tables analyze the defined benefit plans, plan assets, present values of the defined benefit
pension plans, expenses recognized in the consolidated income statement, actuarial assumptions, and
further information.

The determination of assets and liabilities for defined benefit plans is based upon actuarial valuations. In
particular, the present value of the defined benefit obligation is driven by financial variables (such as the
discount rates or future increases in salaries) and demographic variables (such as mortality and employee
turnover). The actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from the actual circumstances and could lead
to different cash flows.

Expected pension increases 2.2 2.2 – 1.8 2.4 –
The weighted average actuarial assumptions as at the balance sheet date are used to determine the
defined benefit liability at that date and the pension expense for the upcoming financial year.
The actuarial assumptions for withdrawal and mortality rates are based on statistical information available
in the various countries. In Germany, the Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables are used. In the UK,
assumptions are based on the S3 base tables with modified improvement of the life expectancy mortality
tables. In South Korea, the KIDI 2019 tables from the Korea Insurance Development Institute are used.
As in the previous year, the calculation of the pension liabilities in Germany is based on a discount rate
determined using the ‘Mercer Yield Curve (MYC)’ approach.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Remeasurements, such as gains or losses arising from changes in the actuarial assumptions for defined
benefit pension plans or a return on the plan assets exceeding the interest income, are immediately

Since many pension plans are closed to future accrual, the salary trend plays a minor role in determining
pension obligations. Due to the fact that with the introduction of the Core Benefits arrangement, German
pension plans are mainly paid as lump sums, the pension increase rate and the mortality assumption have
significantly less impact than the discount rate when calculating the pension obligations.

Approximately 94% (2021: 95%) of the total plan assets are allocated to plan assets in the three major
countries: Germany (2022: 82%, 2021: 78%), UK (2022: 8%, 2021: 14%), and South Korea (2022: 4%,
2021: 3%).
Part of the plan assets in Germany is held by a trustee under a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA) for
the purpose of funding the pension obligations of adidas AG and insolvency insurance with regard to part of
the pension obligations of adidas AG. The trustee is the registered association adidas Pension Trust e.V.
The investment committee of the adidas Pension Trust determines the investment strategy with the goal to
match the pension liabilities as far as possible and to generate a sustainable return. In 2022, no additional
employer funding contribution was transferred to the trustee. The plan assets in the registered
association are mainly invested in fixed income funds, equity funds and real estate. Another substantial
part of the plan assets in Germany is invested in insurance contracts via a pension fund and a provident
fund. For this portion, an insurance entity is responsible for the determination and the implementation of
the investment strategy.
In the UK, the plan assets are held in an external trust. In principle the investment strategy is aligned with
the structure of the pension obligations in these countries. In the rest of the world, the plan assets consist
predominantly of insurance contracts.
The expected total employer contributions for the 2023 financial year amounts to € 29 million. Thereof,
€ 23 million relate to benefits directly paid to pensioners by the subsidiaries and € 6 million to employer
contributions paid into the plan assets. In 2022, the actual loss on plan assets (including interest income)
was € 56 million (2021: return on plan assets of € 43 million).

26 SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
As at December 31, 2021, the nominal capital of adidas AG amounted to € 192,100,000 divided into
192,100,000 registered no-par-value shares and was fully paid in.
With legal effect as of November 28, 2022, the nominal capital was reduced from € 192,100,000 to
€ 180,000,000 by cancelation of 12,100,000 treasury shares. The change in the nominal capital due to the
cancelation of shares and the capital reduction was registered for declaratory entry in the commercial
register. The entry was made on February 16, 2023.
There were no other changes to the nominal capital. Thus, as at the balance sheet date, the nominal
capital of adidas AG amounted to € 180,000,000 divided into 180,000,000 registered no-par-value shares
and is fully paid in.
Each share grants one vote and is entitled to dividends starting from the commencement of the year in
which it was issued. Treasury shares held directly or indirectly are not entitled to dividend payment in
accordance with § 71b German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG). As at the balance sheet date,
adidas AG held 1,462,802 treasury shares, corresponding to a notional amount of € 1,462,802 in the

by issuing new shares against contributions in kind and/or cash once or several times by no more than
€ 20,000,000 altogether (Authorized Capital 2021/II), and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to
─
exclude residual amounts from shareholders’ subscription rights, to wholly or partly exclude
shareholders’ subscription rights when issuing shares against contributions in kind and to exclude
shareholders’ subscription rights when issuing shares against contributions in cash if the new shares
against contributions in cash are issued at a price not significantly below the stock market price of the
company’s shares already quoted on the stock exchange at the point in time when the issue price is
ultimately determined, which should be as close as possible to the placement of the shares; this
exclusion of subscription rights can also be associated with the listing of the company’s shares on a
foreign stock exchange.
The authorization to exclude subscription rights under this authorization, however, may only be used to
the extent that the pro-rata amount of the new shares in the nominal capital together with the pro-rata
amount in the nominal capital of other shares that have been issued by the company since
May 12, 2021, subject to the exclusion of subscription rights, on the basis of an authorized capital or
following a repurchase or for which subscription or conversion rights or subscription or conversion
obligations have been granted through the issuance of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants
while excluding subscription rights, does not exceed 10% of the nominal capital existing on the date of
the entry of this authorization with the commercial register or – if this amount is lower – on the
respective date on which the resolution on the utilization of the authorization is adopted. The previous
sentence does not apply to the exclusion of subscription rights for residual amounts. The Authorized
Capital 2021/II must not be used to issue shares within the scope of compensation or participation
programs for Executive Board members or employees or for members of the management bodies or
employees of affiliated companies.
CONTINGENT CAPITAL 2022
The following overview of the Contingent Capital is based on § 4 section 4 of the Articles of Association of
adidas AG as well as on the underlying resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on May 12, 2022.
The nominal capital is conditionally increased by up to € 12.5 million divided into not more than
12,500,000 no-par-value shares (Contingent Capital 2022). The contingent capital increase serves the
issuance of no-par-value shares when exercising option or conversion rights or fulfilling the respective
option and/or conversion obligations or when exercising the company’s right to choose to partially or in
total deliver registered no-par-value shares of the company instead of paying the due amount to the
holders or creditors of bonds issued by the company or a subordinated group company up to May 11, 2027,
on the basis of the authorization resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2022. The
new shares will be issued at the respective option or conversion price to be established in accordance with
the aforementioned authorization resolution. The contingent capital increase will be implemented only if
bonds are issued in accordance with the authorization resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting
on May 12, 2022, (Agenda Item 7) and only to the extent that option or conversion rights are exercised or
the holders or creditors of bonds obligated to exercise the option or conversion obligation fulfill their
obligations to exercise the warrant or convert the bond, or to the extent that the company exercises its
rights to choose to deliver no-par-value shares in the company for the total amount or a partial amount
instead of payment of the amount due and insofar as no cash settlement, treasury shares or shares of
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
another public-listed company are used to service these rights. The new shares carry dividend rights from
the commencement of the financial year in which the shares are issued. In the event that, at the time of
issuance of the new shares, no resolution on the appropriation of retained earnings for the financial year
directly preceding the year in which the shares are issued has been passed, the Executive Board is
authorized, to the extent legally permissible, to determine that the new shares will carry dividend rights
from the commencement of the financial year directly preceding the year in which the shares are issued.
Furthermore, the Executive Board is authorized to stipulate additional details concerning the
implementation of the contingent capital increase.
The Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders’
subscription rights to the bonds insofar as this is necessary for residual amounts and also insofar as and
to the extent that this is necessary for granting subscription rights to holders or creditors of bonds already
issued before, which they would be entitled to as shareholders upon exercising their option or conversion
rights or upon fulfilling their option and/or conversion obligations or upon exercising a right to delivery of
shares referring to shares of the company. Finally, the Executive Board is authorized, subject to
Supervisory Board approval, to also exclude shareholders’ subscription rights insofar as the bonds are
issued against contributions in cash and after the Executive Board has concluded, following an
examination in accordance with its legal duties, that the issue price of the bonds is not significantly below
the hypothetical market value computed using recognized, in particular, financial calculation methods and
the number of shares issued does not exceed 10% of the nominal capital, neither at the point of becoming
effective nor – in case this amount is lower – at the point of exercising the aforementioned authorization.
Shares which are issued or sold in accordance with § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG during the term of this
authorization until its utilization shall be attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%. Furthermore,
shares that are to be issued or granted during the term of this authorization on the basis of a bond issued
with the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance with this provision utilizing another authorization
shall be attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%. The total number of shares that are issued under
bonds based on this authorization with the exclusion of subscription rights and shares that are issued from
an authorized capital with the exclusion of subscription rights during the term of the authorization may not
exceed 10% of the nominal capital on the date of the entry of this authorization with the Commercial
Register.
In the period up until the balance sheet date, the Executive Board of adidas AG did not issue any bonds
based on the authorization granted on May 12, 2022, and consequently did not issue any shares from the
Contingent Capital 2022.
REPURCHASE AND USE OF TREASURY SHARES
The Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2021, granted the Executive Board an authorization to repurchase
adidas AG shares up to an amount totaling 10% of the nominal capital until May 11, 2026. The authorization
may be used by adidas AG but also by its subordinated Group companies or by third parties on account of
adidas AG or its subordinated Group companies or third parties assigned by adidas AG or one of its
subordinated Group companies.
Based on the above-mentioned authorization, the Executive Board of adidas AG commenced share
buyback programs on January 10, 2022, and March 14, 2022, respectively. adidas AG repurchased
4,156,558 shares between January 10, 2022, and February 22, 2022, including, in the first tranche of a
multi-year share buyback program (‘Share Buyback Program 2022–2025/I’) and 8,978,138 shares between
March 14, 2022 and October 10, 2022, including (‘Additional Share Buyback Program 2022’). In the year
under review, adidas AG repurchased a total of 13,134,696 adidas AG shares for a total price of
€ 2,499,999,677.77 (excluding incidental purchasing costs) and at an average price of € 190.34 per share.
This corresponded to an amount of € 13,134,696 in the nominal capital and consequently to an
approximate notional amount of 7.30% of the nominal capital. Further information on the adidas AG shares

The company may use the repurchased shares for all purposes admissible under the authorization
granted on May 12, 2021. adidas AG, however, plans to cancel the majority of the repurchased shares.
Consequently, in the 2022 financial year, 12,100,000 treasury shares were canceled as part of a simplified
capital reduction pursuant to § 237 section 3 no. 2 AktG.
In the 2022 financial year, a total of 41,763 treasury shares were used as consideration for, inter alia, the
transfer or licensing of industrial property rights and intangible property rights due to contractual
obligations. Using treasury shares while excluding subscription rights enabled adidas AG to acquire
industrial property rights and intangible property rights (or licenses) from the respective owners at
attractive conditions while preserving the company’s liquidity. Based on the share price at the time, the
41,763 treasury shares transferred had a value of altogether approx. € 11 million, corresponding to a
notional amount of € 41,763 in the nominal capital and consequently to approx. 0.02% of the nominal
capital.
Moreover, adidas AG used 35,276 treasury shares in the context of the employee stock purchase plan
while excluding subscription rights. Based on the share price at the time, the 35,276 treasury shares
transferred had a value of altogether € 7,943,033, corresponding to a notional amount of € 35,276 in the
nominal capital and consequently to approx. 0.02% of the nominal capital.
Therefore, taking into account the 505,145 shares held by adidas AG as at December 31, 2021, the shares
purchased within the share buyback programs and the shares used and canceled during the financial year,
this results in 1,462,802 treasury shares held as at the balance sheet date. ► SEE DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO § 315A AND

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The company’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to uphold investor, creditor, and market
confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
adidas seeks to maintain a balance between a higher return on equity that might be possible with higher
levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. The company
further aims to maintain adjusted net borrowings below two times EBITDA (Earnings before interests,
taxes, depreciation and amortization and impairment losses and reversals) over the long term. adidas
received strong first-time investment-grade ratings by both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s in August
2020. Standard & Poor’s gave adidas an ‘A+’ rating, and Moody’s granted the company an ‘A2’ rating. The
initial outlook for both ratings was ‘stable’ as both rating agencies recognized the company’s strong credit
metrics, robust liquidity profile, and conservative financial policies. In November 2022, both Standard &
Poor’s and Moody’s revised their outlook for adidas to ‘negative’ due to a deterioration in credit metrics
amid pressure on the company’s operating performance from economic as well as company specific
challenges. In February 2023, Standard & Poor’s lowered its rating on adidas to ‘A-‘, while Moody’s
downgraded the company to ‘A3’, both with a ‘negative’ outlook. These downgrades reflected a further
downward revision of credit metrics following the release of the company’s financial guidance for 2023.
Overall, adidas' investment grade credit ratings continue to ensure an efficient access to capital markets.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Financial leverage amounts to 121.2% (2021: 39.4%) and is defined as the ratio between adjusted net
borrowings in an amount of € 6.047 billion (2021: € 2.082 billion) and shareholders’ equity in an amount of
€ 4.991 billion (2021: € 7.519 billion). EBITDA amounted to € 1.874 billion for the financial year ending
December 31, 2022 (2021: € 3.066 billion). The ratio between adjusted net borrowings and EBITDA
amounted to 3.2 for the 2022 financial year (2021: 0.7).

EBITDA as at December 31 1,874 3,066
In 2020, the definition of the net borrowings was adjusted to the criteria of the company's internal financial
guidelines and is therefore reported as adjusted net borrowings. It mainly complements the net
borrowings reported up to that point by the present value of future payment obligations from leasing and
pension commitments. The method of calculating adjusted net borrowings was revised in 2022 to align it
with general market practice and the approach of the rating agencies. The main change is the elimination
of the income tax adjustment from net borrowings.
The composition of the adjusted net borrowings is presented below:

The Executive Board of adidas AG will propose to use retained earnings of adidas AG in an amount of
€ 723 million as reported in the 2022 financial statements of adidas AG for a dividend payment of € 0.70
per share and to carry forward the subsequent remaining amount.
As at February 21, 2023, 178,537,198 dividend-entitled shares exist. This would result in a dividend
payment of € 125 million.

27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS WITH EMPLOYEES
In 2016, adidas announced the introduction of an open-ended employee stock purchase plan (the ‘plan’).
The plan is operated on a quarterly basis, with each calendar quarter referred to as an ‘investment
quarter.’
The plan enables employees to purchase adidas AG shares with a 15% discount (‘investment shares’) and
to benefit from free matching shares. Currently, eligible employees of adidas AG and 17 other subsidiaries
can participate in the plan. Up to two weeks before the start of an investment quarter each eligible
employee can enroll for the plan. The company accepts enrollment requests on the first day of the relevant
investment quarter. This is the grant date for the investment and matching shares. The fair value at the
vesting date is equivalent to the fair value of the granted equity instruments at this date. The employees
invest an amount up to 10% of their gross base salary per quarter in the plan. A few days after the end of
the investment quarter the shares are purchased on the market at fair market value and transferred to the
employees. Thereby the amount invested during the quarter plus the top-up from adidas is used. These
shares can be sold at any time by the employee. If the shares are held for a period of one year after the
last day of an investment quarter, employees will receive, as a one-off, free matching shares (one
matching share for every six adidas AG shares acquired). This plan currently constitutes an equity-settled
share-based payment for both elements. For the component of the matching shares relating to the
specific period of service an appropriate discount is taken into account. The effects are presented in the
following table:

EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES
In 2016, adidas entered into a promotion and advertising contract that includes a share-based payment
transaction with third parties. The contract has a general duration of five years until 2021 with an
automated renewal option of one year if no termination has taken place. In 2022 the contract has been
terminated. The first part of the agreement grants a transfer of basic shares, which correspond to a value
of US $ 5 million each year. In 2022 a transfer of bonus shares took place. ► SEE NOTE 26
As at January 1, 2022 (grant date), an amount of US $ 5 million was recognized as expenses for basic
shares over the vesting period of twelve months.
The second part of the agreement grants bonus shares of US $ 5 million if certain conditions are fulfilled.
This option can be granted twice. In 2022, the second option of bonus shares was granted, so that
26,868 shares were transferred. The shares from the tenth tranche of the share buyback program with an
average share price of € 273.50 were used for compensation. Due to this utilization, the provision for the
second option was used in the fiscal year (2021: € 4 million).
EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT FOR EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS
In 2018, adidas established a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for Executive Board members. In the
reporting year, a change in accounting policy was made for this item so that the LTIP is now accounted for
as equity-settled share-based payment. In the previous year, the LTIP was recorded as cash-settled
share-based payment as an accrual.
In implementation of the ‘Own the Game’ strategy applicable from the 2021 financial year, the LTIP
2021/2025 pursues the goal of aligning the long-term performance-based variable remuneration of the
Executive Board with the performance of the company and thus with the interests of the shareholders.
Against this background, the LTIP 2021/2025 is share-based. It consists of five annual tranches (2021 to
2025), each with a term of five years. Each of the five annual tranches consists of a performance year and a
subsequent four-year holding period. For the 2021/2025 LTIP, the Supervisory Board has set financial and
ESG-related performance criteria for each of the five performance years.
The annual LTIP tranche (‘Grant Amount’) is paid to the Executive Board members after approval of the
consolidated financial statements and is to be fully invested by the Executive Board members in the
acquisition of adidas AG shares. The shares acquired are subject to a holding period, which ends at the end
of the fourth financial year following the performance year. Only after the end of the holding period can the
Executive Board members dispose of the shares.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
As of December 31, 2022, the total number of adidas AG shares acquired since 2018 as part of the variable
performance-based compensation and subject to a holding period amounts to 78,698 no-par-value shares
(2021: 43,243 no-par-value shares). The number of adidas AG shares acquired by the members of the
Executive Board is shown individually below:

CASH-SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS WITH EMPLOYEES
In 2017, adidas implemented a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which is a share-based remuneration
scheme with cash settlement. RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) are granted on the condition that the
beneficiary is employed for three or four years by adidas AG or one of its subsidiaries in a position where
they are not under notice during that period. This minimum period of employment pertains to the calendar
year in which the RSUs are granted and the three subsequent calendar years. As an exception in 2022,
RSUs were granted with a minimum term of employment of one and two years, respectively.
The total value of the cash remuneration payable to senior management is recalculated on each reporting
date and on the settlement date, based on the fair value of the RSUs, and recognized through an
appropriate increase in the provision as personnel expenses that are spread over the period of service of
the beneficiary. Furthermore, social security contributions are considered in the calculation of the fair
value, if appropriate for the respective country regulations and the seniority of the participants. All
changes to the subsequent measurement of this provision are reported under personnel expenses.
Once a year, one tranche with a three-year term and another with a four-year term are issued. The
number of RSUs granted depends on the seniority of the beneficiaries. In addition, for the four-year plan,
the number of RSUs also depends on the achievement of a financial and ESG-related target. In 2022, the
option to issue two new tranches with a two-year and a one-year maturity was exercised.

Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents, short-term financial assets, and accounts
receivable and payable, as well as other current financial receivables and payables, their respective fair
values equal their carrying amount.
The fair values of non-current financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future
cash flows using current interest rates for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities and adjusted by
a company-specific credit risk premium.
Fair values of long-term financial assets are based on quoted market prices in an active market or are
calculated as present values of expected future cash flows.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
adidas designated certain investments as equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive
income (equity), because the company intends to hold those investments for the long term in order to gain
insights into innovative production technologies and trends. The designation of certain equity instruments
at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity) is based on a strategic Management decision.
In accordance with IFRS 13, the following tables show the valuation methods used in measuring Level 1,
Level 2, and Level 3 fair values, as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.
In 2022, a reclassification has been made in other equity investments from level 3 to level 2 and level 1.

FINANCIAL RISKS
CURRENCY RISKS
Currency risks for adidas are a direct result of multi-currency cash flows within the company. The vast
majority of the transactional risk arises from product sourcing in US dollars, while sales are typically
denominated in the functional currency of the respective companies. The currencies in which these
transactions are mainly denominated are the US dollar, British pound, Japanese yen, and Chinese
renminbi.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
As governed by the company’s Treasury Policy, adidas has established a hedging system on a rolling basis
up to 24 months in advance, under which the vast majority of the anticipated seasonal hedging volume is
secured approximately six months prior to the start of a season. In rare instances, hedges are contracted
beyond the 24-month horizon.
adidas uses a combination of different hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts,
currency options, and swaps, to protect itself against unfavorable currency movements. These contracts
are generally designated as cash flow hedges.
Furthermore, translation impacts from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into the
company’s functional currency, the euro, might lead to a material negative impact on the company’s
financial performance.
Further information about the accounting and hedge accounting treatment is included in these Notes.

Net exposure (1,528) 125 154 170
The exposure from firm commitments and forecast transactions was calculated on a one-year basis.
In line with IFRS 7 requirements, the company has calculated the impact on net income and shareholders’
equity based on changes in the most important currency exchange rates. The calculated impacts mainly
result from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments. The analysis does not include effects that
arise from the translation of the company’s foreign entities’ financial statements into the company’s
reporting currency, the euro. The sensitivity analysis is based on the net balance sheet exposure, including
intercompany balances from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Moreover,
all outstanding currency derivatives were re-evaluated using hypothetical foreign exchange rates to
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
determine the effects on net income and equity. The analysis was performed on the same basis for both
2022 and 2021.
Based on this analysis, a 10% increase in the euro versus the US dollar at December 31, 2022, would have
led to a € 13 million increase in net income.

The more negative market values of the US dollar hedges would have decreased shareholders’ equity by
€ 264 million. A 10% weaker euro at December 31, 2022, would have led to a € 15 million decrease in net
income. Shareholders’ equity would have increased by € 335 million. The impacts of fluctuations of the
euro against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi on net income and
shareholders’ equity are also included in accordance with IFRS requirements.
However, many other financial and operational variables that could potentially reduce the effect of
currency fluctuations are excluded from the analysis. For instance:
Interest rates, commodity prices, and all other exchange rates are assumed constant.
─
Exchange rates are assumed at a year-end value instead of the more relevant sales-weighted average
figure, which the company utilizes internally to better reflect both the seasonality of its business and
─
intra-year currency fluctuations.
The underlying forecast cash flow exposure (which the hedge instrument mainly relates to) is not
required to be revalued in this analysis.
─
Operational aspects, such as potential discounts for key accounts, which have high transparency
regarding the impacts of currency on our sourcing activities (due to their own private label sourcing
─
efforts), are also excluded from this analysis.
The credit risk is not considered as part of this analysis.
─
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The company also largely hedges balance sheet risks. Due to its strong global position, adidas is able to
partly minimize the currency risk by utilizing natural hedges. The company’s gross US dollar cash flow
exposure calculated for 2023 was around € 7.5 billion at year-end 2022, which was hedged using forward
exchange contracts, currency options and currency swaps.
CREDIT RISKS
A credit risk arises if a customer or other counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
contractual obligations. adidas is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities and from certain
financing activities. Credit risks arise principally from accounts receivable and, to a lesser extent, from
other third-party contractual financial obligations such as other financial assets, short-term bank
deposits, and derivative financial instruments. Without taking into account any collateral or other credit
enhancements, the carrying amount of financial assets and accounts receivable represents the maximum
exposure to credit risk.
At the end of 2022, there was no relevant concentration of credit risk by type of customer or geography.
The company’s credit risk exposure is mainly influenced by individual customer characteristics. Under the
company’s credit policy, new customers are analyzed for creditworthiness before standard payment and
delivery terms and conditions are offered. Tolerance limits for accounts receivable are also established for
each customer. Both creditworthiness and accounts receivable limits are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Customers that fail to meet the company’s minimum creditworthiness are, in general, allowed to purchase
products only on a prepayment basis.
Other activities to mitigate credit risks include retention of title clauses as well as, on a selective basis,
credit insurance, the sale of accounts receivable without recourse, and bank guarantees. Further
quantitative information on the extent to which credit enhancements mitigate the credit risk of accounts
receivable is included in these Notes. ► SEE NOTE 06
At the end of 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.
The Treasury department arranges currency, commodity, interest rate, and equity hedges, and invests
cash with major banks of a high credit standing throughout the world. adidas subsidiaries are authorized
to work with banks rated BBB+ or higher. Only in exceptional cases are subsidiaries authorized to work
with banks rated lower than BBB+. To limit risk in these cases, restrictions are clearly stipulated, such as
maximum cash deposit levels. In addition, the credit default swap premiums of the company’s partner
banks are monitored on a monthly basis. In the event that the defined threshold is exceeded, credit
balances are shifted to banks compliant with the limit. ► SEE TREASURY
adidas furthermore believes that the risk concentration is limited due to the broad distribution of the
investment business of the company with a high number of globally operating banks. At December 31,
2022, four banks accounted between 10% and maximum 20% of the investments of adidas. Including
subsidiaries’ short-term deposits in local banks, the average concentration was 2%. This leads to a
maximum exposure of € 119 million in the event of default of any single bank.
In addition, in 2022, adidas held derivatives of foreign exchange with a positive fair market value in the
amount of € 233 million. The maximum exposure to any single bank resulting from these assets amounted
to € 67 million and the average concentration was 8%.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the following table includes further information about set-off possibilities of
derivative financial assets and liabilities. The majority of agreements between financial institutions and
adidas include a mutual right to set off. However, these agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting

counterparty defaults.

INTEREST RATE RISKS
Changes in global market interest rates affect future interest payments for variable-interest liabilities. As
adidas does not have material variable-interest liabilities, even a significant increase in interest rates
should have only slight adverse effects on the company’s profitability, liquidity, and financial position.
To reduce interest rate risks and maintain financial flexibility, a core tenet of the company’s financial
strategy is to continue to use surplus cash flow from operations to reduce short-term gross borrowings.
Beyond that, adidas may consider adequate hedging strategies through interest rate derivatives in order to
mitigate interest rate risks. ► SEE TREASURY
SHARE PRICE RISKS
Share price risks arise due to the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which is a share-based remuneration
scheme with cash settlement, and the equity-neutral convertible bond with cash settlement. In order to
mitigate share price risks, it is company strategy to use swaps and options to hedge against share price
fluctuations. Swaps are used to hedge the Long-Term Incentive Plan and are classified as cash flow
hedges. The embedded cash option in the convertible bond is fully offset with a call option to mitigate the
cash settlement.
In line with IFRS 7 requirements, adidas has calculated the impact on net income based on changes in the
company’s share price. A 10% increase in the adidas AG share price versus the closing share price at
December 31, 2022, would have led to a € 5 million increase in net income and a € 3 million increase in
shareholders’ equity, whereas a 10% decrease in the adidas AG share price versus the closing share price
at December 31, 2022, would have led to a € 5 million decrease in net income and would have decreased
shareholders’ equity by € 3 million.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
FINANCING AND LIQUIDITY RISKS
Liquidity risks arise from not having the necessary resources available to meet maturing liabilities with
regard to timing, volume and currency structure. In addition, the company faces the risk of having to
accept unfavorable financing terms due to liquidity restraints. The Treasury department uses an efficient
cash management system in order to make best use of the operating cash flow. A twelve-month rolling
cash flow forecast on a monthly basis is established to manage liquidity risk. In line with the Financial
Policy, adidas aims to maintain a target leverage ratio and a target twelve months liquidity coverage.
Committed and uncommitted credit lines ensure further financial flexibility. Overall, adidas’ investment
grade credit ratings ensure an efficient access to capital markets.
At December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents together with marketable securities amounted to
€ 0.798 billion (2021: € 3.828 billion). Moreover, the company maintains € 4.090 billion (2021:
€ 4.169 billion) in bilateral credit lines, which are designed to ensure sufficient liquidity at all times.
Thereof, since November 15, 2022, there has been a € 2.0 billion syndicated credit facility in place with our
core partner banks. ► SEE TREASURY
Future cash outflows arising from financial liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated statement of
financial position are presented in the table.
This includes payments to settle obligations from borrowings as well as cash outflows from cash-settled
derivatives with negative market values. Financial liabilities that may be settled in advance without penalty
are included on the basis of the earliest date of potential repayment. Cash flows for variable-interest
liabilities are determined with reference to the conditions at the balance sheet date.

Some of the initial planned exposure for purchases and sales in foreign currencies ceased to exist, which
led to certain overhedge positions. In accordance with IFRS 9, hedge accounting was immediately
discontinued for hedging instruments that were no longer covered by a purchase or sales transaction, and,
at the time the over-hedged status was determined, the fair value was transferred from the hedging
reserve to the income statement. In 2022, a loss of € 6 million was reclassified into the net sales and a
gain of € 81 million was reclassified into the cost of sales, which includes a loss of € 13 million related to
the business in Russia. Since 2022, foreign exchange contracts for sales have been recognized in net sales
in order to better reflect the hedging structure in the income statement.
In addition, hedging instruments not designated as hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 were
canceled to minimize the economic risk.
For overhedges related to the Long-Term Incentive Plan from 2020 a loss of € 5 million was reclassified to
the financial result.

34 HYPERINFLATION
Due to the rapid devaluation of the Argentinian peso and the Turkish lira, Argentina, and Turkey are
considered to be hyperinflationary and as a result, the application of IAS 29 was adopted for the first time
in the third quarter of 2018 (Argentina) and the second quarter 2022 (Turkey). The financial statements of
those subsidiaries that have the Argentinian peso or Turkish lira as a functional currency had been
restated for the change in the general purchasing power retrospectively since January 1, 2018 (Argentina)
and January 1, 2022 (Turkey). The financial statements are based on a historical cost approach. The prior-
year figures of the Argentinian peso are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at
December 31, 2021. Pursuant to IAS 21 ‘Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates,’ paragraph 42, the
comparative amounts of the previous reporting period were not restated for the Turkish lira.
The Argentinian price index at December 31, 2022, was 15,047.61 (2021: 7,714.09). The price index in
Turkey at December 31, 2022, was 1,128.45 (2021: 686.95).
Both for Argentina and for Turkey, for the translation into the presentation currency (euro), all amounts
were translated at the closing rate at December 31, 2022. The net assets in the subsidiary’s local financial
statements were adjusted for changes in the price level.
35 INCOME TAXES
adidas AG and its German subsidiaries are subject to German corporate and trade taxes. For the years
ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, the statutory corporate income tax rate of 15% plus a surcharge of
5.5% thereon is applied to earnings. The municipal trade tax is approximately 11.4% of taxable income.
For non-German subsidiaries, deferred taxes are calculated based on tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the closing date.
DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if:
the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and
the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same
─
taxation authority on either:
─
the same taxable entity; or
different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net
─
basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in
─
which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or
recovered.
As a result they are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as follows:

Liabilities and provisions 111 44
Deferred tax liabilities 603 685
Deferred tax assets, net 1,082 1,141
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that the realization of the related benefit is probable.
For the assessment of probability, in addition to past performance and the respective prospects for the
foreseeable future, appropriate tax structuring measures are also taken into consideration.
Deferred tax assets for which the realization of the related tax benefits is not probable increased from
€ 222 million to € 406 million for the year ending December 31, 2022. These amounts mainly relate to tax
losses carried forward and unused tax credits of the US tax group, which begin to expire in 2029. The
remaining unrecognized deferred tax assets relate to subsidiaries operating in markets where the
realization of the related tax benefit is not considered probable.
adidas does not recognize deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German subsidiaries to
the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international operations. These earnings,
the amount of which cannot be practicably computed, could become subject to additional tax if they were
remitted as dividends or if the company were to sell its shareholdings in the subsidiaries.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
37 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
adidas operates predominantly in one industry segment – the design, distribution, and marketing of
athletic and sports lifestyle products.
As at December 31, 2022, following the company’s internal management reporting by markets and in
accordance with the definition of IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments,’ five operating segments were identified:
EMEA, North America, Asia-Pacific, Greater China, and Latin America.
Each market comprises all wholesale, retail and e-commerce business activities relating to the
distribution and sale of products of the adidas brand to retail customers and end consumers.
Other Businesses includes the business activities of the Y-3 label and other subordinated businesses
which are not monitored separately by the chief operating decision-maker. Also, certain centralized
corporate functions do not meet the definition of IFRS 8 for an operating segment. This includes, in
particular, functions such as Global Brands and Global Sales (central brand and distribution
management), central treasury, and global sourcing as well as other headquarter functions. Assets,
liabilities, income and expenses relating to these corporate functions are presented in the reconciliations.
The chief operating decision-maker for adidas has been defined as the entire Executive Board of
adidas AG.
Net sales represent revenue from contracts with customers. There are no intersegment sales between the
reportable segments. Accounting and valuation policies applied for reporting segmental information are
the same as those used for adidas. ► SEE NOTE 02
The results of the operating segments are reported in the line item ‘Segmental operating profit.’ This is
defined as gross profit minus other operating expenses plus royalty and commission income and other
operating income attributable to the segment, without considering headquarter costs and central
expenditure for marketing.
Segmental assets include accounts receivable as well as inventories. Only these items are reported to the
chief operating decision-maker on a regular basis. Depreciation, amortization, impairment losses (except
for goodwill), and reversals of impairment losses as well as capital expenditure for tangible and intangible
assets are part of the segmental reporting, even though segmental assets do not contain tangible and
intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization as well as impairment losses and reversals of
impairment losses not directly attributable to a segment are presented under line items ‘HQ’ and
‘Consolidation’ in the reconciliations.
Segmental liabilities only contain accounts payable from operating activities as there are no other liability
items reported regularly to the chief operating decision-maker.
Interest income and interest expenses as well as income taxes are not allocated to the reportable
segments and are not reported separately to the chief operating decision-maker.

38 ADDITIONAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
In 2022, net cash used in operating activities compared to the prior year results was primarily due to an
decrease in income before taxes and an increase in operating working capital requirements.
The net cash generated from investing activities in 2022 is mainly due to the sale of the Reebok business.
This is offset by payments for other intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment as well as the
change from purchase of/proceeds from investments and other long-term assets.
Net cash used in financing activities mainly related to dividend paid to shareholders of adidas AG,
repurchase of treasury shares and the repayments of lease liabilities. This is offset by two newly issued
bonds which were issued in the financial year.

contracts occurred, hence the decrease for the commitments mainly reflects the yearly amortization.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
As of December 31, 2022, contingent liabilities exists in connection with guarantees from leases in the
amount of € 73 million. These mainly relate to the Reebok business and could not be terminated upon its
sale.
LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL RISKS
The company is currently engaged in various lawsuits resulting from the ordinary course of business,
mainly in connection with commercial agreements as well as intellectual property rights and partnership
agreements. The risks regarding these lawsuits are covered by provisions to the extent a reliable estimate
of the potential liability can be made.In the opinion of Management, the ultimate liabilities resulting from
such claims will not materially affect the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the
Group. ► SEE NOTE 19
The company is in dispute with the local revenue authorities in South Africa (SARS) with regard to the
customs value of imported products. In June 2018, SARS issued a ruling claiming a customs payment
including interest and penalties for the years 2007 to 2013 in an amount of ZAR 1,871 million (€ 103
million). adidas has applied for a suspension of the payment demand and in 2019 instituted legal action
against the decision before the High Court in South Africa. In case the court rules in favor of SARS, adidas
will appeal against the decision to the Supreme Court of South Africa. Based on external legal opinions,
Management currently believes that it is more likely than not that the claim made by SARS will eventually
not result in an outflow of resources. Therefore, a provision was not recognized in the consolidated
statement of financial position.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
In connection with the financial irregularities of Reebok India Company in 2012, various legal uncertainties
were identified. At this stage, the respective ultimate risk cannot be determined conclusively. However,
based on opinions obtained from external counsel and internal assessments, Management assumes that
the possibility of any outflow in settlement is remote and therefore the effects will not have any material
negative influence on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company.
In October 2018, a former employee of the company’s US subsidiary was convicted of wire fraud in
connection with unauthorized payments to certain college basketball players or their families during the
former employee’s time at the US subsidiary. The company’s US subsidiary, with the full support of the
company, has cooperated with the prosecutors, including by conducting an internal investigation with the
assistance of outside counsel. Management believes that the actions of its former employee will not have
any material influence on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company.
In 2012, both adidas and Nike launched knitted upper footwear products. Nike’s products were labeled
‘Flyknit,’ adidas’ shoes ‘Primeknit.’ Since 2012, both companies have initiated various legal proceedings in
Europe and the US relating to the other company’s patents in the knitted upper space.
In December 2021, Nike filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission (ITC) alleging that
certain adidas footwear products infringe six US patents covering Nike’s Flyknit technology. Nike
requested in particular that the ITC (i) ban the import of adidas footwear products infringing Nike’s six US
Flyknit patents into the US and (ii) issue a permanent cease-and-desist order directing adidas to refrain
from importing, distributing, marketing, offering or selling knitted footwear products in the US that
infringe Nike’s six US Flyknit patents.
In parallel, Nike also filed a complaint for patent infringement against adidas AG, adidas North America,
Inc., and adidas America, Inc. with the US District Court in Portland/Oregon. Nike argues that certain
adidas footwear products using knitted uppers infringe nine of Nike’s US Flyknit technology patents. Nike
seeks (i) an injunction from the court preventing adidas from infringing Nike’s patents and (ii) monetary
damages from adidas for past sales of Primeknit products in the US. The District Court proceeding was
stayed until the ITC has rendered a decision.
The dispute between adidas and Nike was settled in August 2022 and, upon request of both parties, the ITC
and the US District Court in Portland dismissed the pending cases.
In connection with the termination of the Yeezy partnership, adidas has initiated arbitration proceedings
against Ye and entities controlled by him (Defendants) claiming, among others, damages. In this context,
Defendants filed certain counterclaims against adidas. Management currently believes that these
counterclaims will not result in any cash outflow.
40 RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES
According to the definitions of IAS 24 ’Related Party Disclosures,’ the Supervisory Board and the Executive
Board of adidas AG have been identified as related parties who receive compensation essentially in
connection with their function as key management personnel. These consolidated financial statements
contain detailed information about the compensation of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board of
adidas AG. ► SEE NOTE 41
In addition, a brand ambassador agreement existed during the financial year between adidas International,
Inc. and the Supervisory Board member Jackie Joyner-Kersee. For her services under this agreement,
Jackie Joyner-Kersee in 2022 received a fixed compensation of US $ 0.1 million (2021: US $ 0.1 million). As
of the reporting date, there were no outstanding balances in this context.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and their close family members are free to buy or
sell shares of the Company on the market. The shares held by this group of persons are regularly entitled

the Supervisory Board continued to receive salaries under their normal employment contracts. These

A schedule of the adidas AG subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements is shown in
Attachment I to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Balances and transactions between the
Company and its subsidiaries that are related parties have been eliminated in consolidation and are not
presented in this note. ► SEE SHAREHOLDINGS
In addition, adidas Pension Trust e.V., a registered association, is regarded as a related party. Based on a
Contractual Trust Arrangement, adidas Pension Trust e.V. manages the plan assets in the form of an
administrative trust to fund and protect part of the pension obligations of adidas AG. Employees, senior
executives, and members of the Executive Board of adidas AG can be members of the registered
association. adidas AG has the right to claim a refund of pension payments from adidas Pension Trust e.V.
under specific contractually agreed conditions. As of December 31, 2022, adidas Pension Trust e. V. held
plan assets of € 331.7 million (2021: € 355.1 million) in trust for adidas AG. In 2022, adidas AG made lease

November 11, 2022. For the remaining term of his service contract from November 12 to December
31, 2022, the contractual basic salary totaling € 0.3 million was also granted. In addition, a one-time
severance payment of € 12.0 million gross was agreed as compensation for the early termination of his
service contract, which was reported as a liability as of December 31, 2022 and is included in the total
remuneration as termination benefits. The termination agreement also provides for the payment of
compensation for a 18-month non-compete clause in the employment contract in the gross amount of
€ 0.2 million per month.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
Current members of the Executive Board were not granted any loans or advance payments in 2022.
Overall compensation of the members of the Executive Board and Board of Directors §314 (1) i.V.m.
§315e HGB
The overall compensation of the members of the Executive Board in the 2022 financial year amounted to
€ 6.5 million (2021: € 13.1 million). The Executive Board was not granted an LTIP bonus for the 2022
financial year (2021: € 14.2 million). A granted LTIP bonus must be invested in full in the acquisition of
adidas AG shares after deduction of taxes and social security contributions. These shares are subject to a
lock-up period which ends in the fourth financial year after the performance year. The LTIP payout amount
is considered earned only after expiry of the lock-up period and only then can the Executive Board
members dispose of the shares at their own discretion. By contrast, the amount deducted for income tax
and social security contributions is already fully earned at the time of payout following the adoption of the
consolidated financial statements by the Supervisory Board. The lower total remuneration in comparison
to the previous year is mainly attributable to the fact that the Executive Board members were not granted
a performance bonus in 2022.
The total annual remuneration to be paid to the members of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the
Articles of Association of adidas AG, including attendance fees, totaled € 2.8 million (prior year:
€ 2.2 million).
Former members of the Executive Board and their surviving dependents received a total of € 16.7 million
in benefits in the 2022 financial year (prior year: € 4.3 million). This amount includes the one-time
severance payment of € 12.0 million gross as compensation for the early termination of Kasper Rorsted's
employment contract, which was reported as a liability as of December 31, 2022.
Provisions for pension entitlements have been created for the former members of the Executive Board
who resigned on or before December 31, 2005 and their surviving dependents, in an amount of
€ 28.6 million in total as at December 31, 2022 before offsetting with the assets of the “adidas Pension
Trust e.V.” (prior year: € 43.0 million). There are pension commitments towards six former Executive
Board members who resigned after December 31, 2005, which are covered by a pension fund or a pension
fund in combination with a reinsured pension trust fund. From this, indirect obligations amounting to
€ 35.0 million (prior year: € 47.0 million) arise for which no provisions were created due to financing
through the pension fund and pension trust fund. Provisions for pension entitlements have been created
for two former members of the Executive Board who resigned on or after December 31, 2019 in an amount
of € 3.1 million (2021: 3.9 million).
COMPANIES OPTING FOR EXEMPTION UNDER § 264 (3) HGB
The subsidiary adidas CDC Immobilieninvest GmbH, Herzogenaurach, is opting for exemption under
§ 264 (3) HGB.
42 INFORMATION RELATING TO THE GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
INFORMATION PURSUANT TO § 161 GERMAN STOCK CORPORATION ACT (AKTIENGESETZ – AKTG)
In December 2022, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG issued an updated Declaration
of Compliance in accordance with § 161 AktG and made it permanently available to the shareholders. The
full text of the Declaration of Compliance is available on the company’s corporate website.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
43 EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
As part of the publication of the financial guidance on February 9, 2023, it was announced that the
company continues to review future options for the utilisation of its Yeezy inventory. Should the company
irrevocably decide not to repurpose any of the existing Yeezy products going forward, this would result in
the write-off of the existing Yeezy inventory and would lower the company’s operating profit in fiscal year
2023 by € 0.5 billion. This effect is, just like the negative revenue impact of around € 1.2 billion and the
corresponding adverse operating profit effect of around € 0.5 billion, included in the financial guidance for
the fiscal year 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the company assumed that the inventories will be utilized
and therefore they are classified as recoverable. If a decision would have been made before the reporting
date that the inventories would not be utilized, this would have resulted in an write-off on inventories of
€ 0.4 billion and a provision for onerous contracts of € 0.1 billion in 2022. It would not have had any other
significant impact on the assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or loss of the company (e.g.
measurement of goodwill).
No other company-specific subsequent events are known that might have a material influence on the
assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or loss of the company.
DATE OF PREPARATION
The Executive Board of adidas AG prepared and approved the consolidated financial statements for
submission to the Supervisory Board on February 21, 2023. It is the Supervisory Board’s task to examine
the consolidated financial statements and give their approval.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
REPRODUCTION OF THE INDEPENDENT
AUDITOR'S REPORT
Based on the results of our audit, we have issued the following unqualified auditor's report:
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To adidas AG, Herzogenaurach
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE
COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
OPINIONS
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of adidas AG, Herzogenaurach, and its subsidiaries
(the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2022, the
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated
statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from
January 1 to December 31, 2022, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary
of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the management report of the Company and
the Group (combined management report) of adidas AG for the financial year from January 1 to
December 31, 2022.
In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those components of
the combined management report specified in the Appendix to the Independent Auditor's Report.
The combined management report contains cross-references that are not provided for by law. In
accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the cross-references
specified in the Appendix to the Independent Auditor's Report or the information to which the cross-
references refer.
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,
the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as
adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to
─
Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these
requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of
December 31, 2022, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January1 to
December 31, 2022, and
the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the
Group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the
─
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately
presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the combined management
report does not cover the content of those components of the combined management report specified
in the Appendix to the Independent Auditor's Report. The combined management report contains
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
cross-references that are not provided for by law. Our opinion does not extend to the cross-references
specified in the Appendix to the Independent Auditor's Report or the information to which the cross-
references refer.
Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations
relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined
management report.
BASIS FOR THE OPINIONS
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report
in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as
'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the
"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined
Management Report" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in
accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we
have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In
addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not
provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2022.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
RECOVERABILITY OF INVENTORIES
Please refer to Note 02 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on the
accounting policies applied. In addition, we refer to Note 08 for information on write-downs on inventories.
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK
Inventories totaling EUR 5,973 million were reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as
of December 31, 2022; this includes write-downs of EUR 225 million.
Inventories initially measured at cost (taking into account incidental acquisition costs and reductions in the
cost of acquisition) must be reduced in value if the inventories are damaged, fully or partially obsolete or if
their net realizable values no longer cover cost. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. The purpose for which
the inventories are held is also considered when assessing the estimate of net realizable value.
The determination of the net realizable values is subject to judgment. Net realizable value requires in part
forward-looking estimates with regard to the amounts that are expected to be realized when selling the
inventories. Furthermore, the age of the inventories and the purpose for which they are held also play a
significant role.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
There is a risk for the financial statements that, as a result of volatile consumer behavior attributable to
the crisis and the resulting increase in inventories, the write-downs recognized do not correspond to the
loss of value actually incurred. In addition, due to the termination of the agreement with Kanye West
(Yeezy) in October 2022, there is the risk that the Yeezy inventories could be impaired.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Based on our understanding of the process, we assessed the design and establishment of the identified
internal controls, in particular relating to the appropriateness of the write-downs recognized in the past.
Next, we verified which items with a negative margin were in stock as of the reporting date and whether
the write-downs recognized for these items were appropriate.
In addition, on the basis of the Company's past experience, we assessed whether the write-downs
recognized were appropriate. We assessed this past experience using the Company's evaluations of the
price reductions made over the course of the last four years.
We verified management's assessment of the purpose for which the inventories are held.
OUR OBSERVATIONS
The assumptions underlying the net realizable value as well as judgments exercised by management are
appropriate.
OTHER INFORMATION
The Executive Board and/or the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information. The other
information comprises:
the components of the combined management report not audited for content specified in the Appendix
to the Independent Auditor's Report.
─
The other information also includes the remaining parts of the annual report. The other information does
not include the consolidated financial statements, the combined management report information audited
for content and our auditor's report thereon.
Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider
whether the other information
is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the combined management
report information audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or
─
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
─
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD AND THE SUPERVISORY BOARD FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT
The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that comply, in
all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German
commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position,
and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal
control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and
misappropriation of assets) or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Executive Board is responsible for assessing the
Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based
on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the combined management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects,
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the Executive Board
is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to
enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable
German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in
the combined management report.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.
AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE COMBINED
MANAGEMENT REPORT
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit,
complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of
future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated
financial statements and on the combined management report.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer
(IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this
combined management report.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of
the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
─
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud
is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
controls.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the combined
─
management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Executive Board and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the Executive Board and related disclosures.
─
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Executive Board's use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
─
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management
report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
─
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant
to Section 315e (1) HGB
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and
─
on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.
Evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial
statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.
─
Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the Executive Board in the
combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in
─
particular, the significant assumptions used by the Executive Board as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these
assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the
assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ
materially from the prospective information.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant
independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or
safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.
OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
Combined Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with
Section 317 3a) HGB
We have performed assurance work in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the combined
management report (hereinafter the 'ESEF documents') contained in the electronic file 'adidasag-2022-12-
31-de.zip' (SHA256 hash value:
587FB133A19783931A261F4FB884ADE9E799F2EB5207E0480DA70026E100534D) made available and
prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Section 328
(1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ('ESEF format'). In accordance with German legal
requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the
consolidated financial statements and the combined management report into the ESEF format and
therefore relates neither to the information contained in these renderings nor to any other information
contained in the file identified above.
In our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management
report contained in the electronic file made available, identified above and prepared for publication
purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic
reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements and the accompanying combined management report for the financial year from
January 1 to December 31, 2022, contained in the "Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements and the Combined Management Report" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on
the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the file
identified above.
We conducted our assurance work on the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the
combined management report contained in the file made available and identified above in accordance with
Section 317 (3a) HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance Work on the Electronic Rendering of
Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with
Section 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AsS 410 (06.2022)) and the International Standard on Assurance
Engagements 3000 (Revised). Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described below. Our
audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: Requirements for Quality Management in
Audit Firms (IDW QS ).
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
The Company's Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the
electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report in
accordance with Section 328 (1) sentence 4 item 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with Section 328 (1) sentence 4 item 2 HGB.
In addition, the Company's Executive Board is responsible for such internal control that they have
considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional
or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting
format.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process of preparing the ESEF documents as part
of the financial reporting process.
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from
material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB. We
exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We
also:
Identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the
requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those
─
risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
assurance opinion.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order
to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
─
expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.
Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the file made available containing
the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815,
─
as amended as of the reporting date, on the technical specification for this electronic file.
Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the
audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report.
─
Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in
accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Commission Delegated Regulation
─
(EU) 2019/815, as amended as of the reporting date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-
readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.
FURTHER INFORMATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 10 OF THE EU AUDIT REGULATION
We were elected as group auditor at the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2022. We were engaged by the
Supervisory Board on August 2, 2022. We have been the group auditor of adidas AG without interruption
since financial year 1995.
We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to
the Audit Committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
OTHER MATTER – USE OF THE AUDITOR'S REPORT
Our auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and
the audited combined management report as well as the examined ESEF documents. The consolidated
financial statements and combined management report converted to the ESEF format – including the
versions to be entered in the company register – are merely electronic renderings of the audited
consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report and do not take their
place. In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely
together with the examined ESEF documents made available in electronic form.

OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
ASSURANCE REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR REGARDING THE COMBINED
NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT32
To the Supervisory Board of adidas AG, Herzogenaurach
We have performed an independent limited assurance engagement on the non-financial statement of
adidas AG, Herzogenaurach (further “Company” or “adidas”), that is combined with the non-financial
statement of the parent company (further “combined non-financial statement”), for the period from
January 1 to December 31, 2022. The parts of the combined non-financial statement are integrated in the
company’s annual report and marked accordingly with ⌐ ¬.
Furthermore, we have performed a reasonable assurance engagement on the quantitative and qualitative
disclosures related to the KPI “Sustainable article offering” in the section “Environmental impacts –
Materials” in the chapter “Sustainability” of the combined non-financial statement. These are marked
accordingly with [ ] in the combined non-financial statement.
As described in the section “Social Impacts – Supply Chain – Working Conditions” in the combined non-
financial statement, 1,222 social compliance and environmental audits at suppliers were performed by
inhouse technical staff as well as external third-party monitors commissioned by adidas business entities
and licensees. The reasonableness and accuracy of the conclusions from the performed audit work were
not part of our assurance engagement.
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY
The legal representatives of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the combined non-
financial statement in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB (Handelsgesetzbuch,
German Commercial Code) and with Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate
sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (further “EU Taxonomy Regulation”) and
the supplementing Delegated Acts as well as the interpretation of the wordings and terms contained in the
EU Taxonomy Regulation and in the supplementing Delegated Acts by the Company as disclosed in Section
“Sustainable Finance – EU Taxonomy” of the combined non-financial statement.
This responsibility of the legal representatives includes the selection and application of appropriate
methods to prepare the combined non-financial statement and the use of assumptions and estimates for
individual disclosures which are reasonable under the given circumstances. Furthermore, the legal
representatives are responsible for the internal controls they deem necessary for the preparation of the
combined non-financial statement free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (manipulation
of the combined non-financial statement) or error.
The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the supplementing Delegated Acts contain wordings and terms that are
still subject to substantial uncertainties regarding their interpretation and for which not all clarifications
have been published yet. Therefore, the legal representatives have included a description of their
interpretation in Section “Sustainable Finance – EU Taxonomy” of the combined non-financial statement.
They are responsible for its tenability. Due to the innate risk of diverging interpretations of vague legal
concepts, the legal conformity of these interpretations is subject to uncertainty.
32 Our engagement applied to the German version of the combined non-financial statement 2022. This text is a translation of the Independent Assurance Report
issued in German, whereas the German text is authoritative.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY ASSURANCE OF THE ASSURANCE PRACTITIONER’S FIRM
We have complied with the independence and quality assurance requirements set out in the national legal
provisions and professional pronouncements, in particular the Professional Code for German Public
Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of the Institute of
Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance requirements
in audit practice (IDW QS 1).
PRACTITIONER’S RESPONSIBILITY
It is our responsibility to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the combined non-financial
statement and with reasonable assurance on the quantitative and qualitative disclosures related to the KPI
“Sustainable article offering” in the section “Environmental impacts – Materials” in the chapter
“Sustainability” of the combined non-financial statement based on our work performed.
ENGAGEMENT TO OBTAIN LIMITED ASSURANCE
We conducted our work in the form of a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other
than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, published by IAASB. Accordingly, we have to
plan and perform the assurance engagement in such a way that we obtain limited assurance as to whether
any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the combined non-financial statement
of the Company for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2022 has not been prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and with the EU Taxonomy
Regulation and the supplementing Delegated Acts as well as the interpretation of the wordings and terms
contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and in the supplementing Delegated Acts by the legal
representatives as disclosed in Section “Sustainable Finance – EU Taxonomy” of the combined non-
financial statement. We do not, however, issue a separate conclusion for each disclosure.
As the assurance procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less comprehensive than
in a reasonable assurance engagement, the level of assurance obtained is substantially lower. The choice
of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judgment.
Within the scope of our engagement we performed, amongst others, the following procedures:
− Inquiries of group-level personnel who are responsible for the materiality analysis in order to
understand the processes for determining material topics and respective reporting boundaries for
adidas
− Inquiries of personnel who are responsible on group-level to obtain an understanding of the
procedures used to identify relevant economic activities according to the EU Taxonomy
− A risk analysis, including media research, to identify relevant information on the company’s
sustainability performance in the reporting period
− Reviewing the suitability of internally developed Reporting Criteria
− Evaluation of the design and the implementation of systems and processes for the collection,
processing and monitoring of disclosures, including data consolidation, on environmental, employee
and social matters, respect for human rights, and combating corruption and bribery
− Inquiries of group-level personnel who are responsible for determining disclosures on concepts, due
diligence processes, results and risks, performing internal control functions and consolidating
disclosures
− Evaluation of the design and the implementation of systems and processes for the collection,
processing and monitoring of disclosures on turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure
for the taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities
− Inspection of selected internal and external documents
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
− Analytical procedures for the evaluation of data and of the trends of quantitative disclosures as
reported at group level by all sites
− Evaluation of local data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the reliability of
reported data based on a sample of the sites in Herzogenaurach, Germany and Spartanburg, United
States
− Performing evidence-based assurance procedures, in particular testing of internal and external
evidence
− Evaluation of the process for the identification of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic
activities and the corresponding disclosures in the combined non-financial statement
Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures
─
The legal representatives have to interpret vague legal concepts in order to be able to compile the relevant
disclosures according to Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Due to the innate risk of diverging
interpretations of vague legal concepts, the legal conformity of these interpretations and, correspondingly,
our assurance thereof are subject to uncertainty.
ENGAGEMENT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE
For the selected non-financial information on the KPI “Sustainable article offering”, we conducted our
assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE
3000 (Revised) as reasonable assurance engagement. This standard requires that we have to comply with
our professional duties and that we plan and perform the assurance engagement in such a way that we,
respecting the principle of materiality, reach our conclusion with a reasonable level of assurance. The
selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the own professional judgment of the assurance
practitioner.
In addition to the assurance procedures mentioned above, we performed the following assurance
procedures:
− Evaluation of the design and implementation of systems and processes for identifying, processing and
monitoring the underlying data, including the consolidation of data for the selected non-financial
information on the KPI “Sustainable article offering”
− Performance of control-based assurance procedures to assess the design and effectiveness of
controls over the identification, processing and monitoring of the underlying data for the selected non-
financial information for the KPI “Sustainable article offering”
− Performance of evidence-based assurance procedures on the selected non-financial information on
the KPI “Sustainable article offering”, in particular testing internal and external evidence and
performing procedures on a sample basis in relation to the underlying data.
In our opinion, we obtained sufficient and appropriate evidence for reaching a conclusion for the assurance
engagement.
CONCLUSION
Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the combined non-financial statement of adidas AG for the period from January 1
to December 31, 2022 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in
conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the supplementing
Delegated Acts as well as the interpretation disclosed in Section “Sustainable Finance – EU Taxonomy” of
the combined non-financial statement.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
In our opinion, the selected non-financial quantitative and qualitative disclosures related to the KPI
“Sustainable article offering” of adidas AG for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2022 have been
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB.
We do not express an assurance opinion on the mentioned audits performed by inhouse technical staff as
well as external third-party monitors commissioned by adidas business entities and licensees.

GLOSSARY
/ A
ACCESSORIES AND GEAR
A product category that comprises equipment that is used rather than worn by the consumer, such as
bags, balls, sunglasses, or fitness equipment.
ADICLUB
‘adiClub’ is a membership program that helps us deepen the relationship with our consumers. Linking all
adidas apps, events, communities, and channels into one single profile, the program rewards members
with points for interacting with the brand, e.g., when making a purchase or using the ‘adidas Running’ or
‘adidas Training’ apps. Depending on the number of points, exclusive benefits are unlocked, including
access to hype sneaker and apparel drops or invitations to special events.
ATHLEISURE
The term is composed of the words athletic and leisure. It describes a fashion trend of sportswear no
longer being just meant for training but increasingly shaping everyday clothing.
/ C
CASH POOLS/CASH POOLING
A cash management technique for physical concentration of cash. Cash pooling allows adidas to combine
credit and debit positions from various accounts and several subsidiaries into one central account. This
technique supports our in-house bank concept where advantage is taken of any surplus funds of
subsidiaries to cover cash requirements of other subsidiaries, thus reducing external financing needs and
optimizing our net interest expenses.
CLIMATE NEUTRALITY
Our definition of climate neutrality is aligned with the requirements by the ‘Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change’ (‘IPCC’): Climate neutrality refers to a concept of a state in which human activities result
in no net effect on the climate system. Achieving such a state requires balancing residual emissions with
emission removals as well as accounting for regional or local bio-geophysical effects of human activities
that, for example, affect surface albedo or local climate.
CONTROLLED SPACE
Includes own retail business, mono-branded franchise stores, shop-in-shops, joint ventures with retail
partners, and co-branded stores. Controlled space offers a high level of brand control and ensures
optimal product offering and presentation according to brand requirements.
/ H
HALO STORES
‘Halo stores’ represent our most exclusive and high-end retail store concept. Under this name, we cluster
our best stores, which form the pinnacle of our store fleet.
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
/ I
INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURING PARTNERS
We outsource almost 100% of production to independent manufacturing partners. They are defined on a
supplier group level, which means one independent manufacturing partner might produce in several
manufacturing facilities. The majority of our independent manufacturing partners are located in Asia.
/ L
LEADERSHIP, BETTERMENT, AND PERFORMANCE
Leadership, Betterment, and Performance are the three pillars of our people strategy:
Leadership: We will develop leaders to own the game and act as role models empowering all people to
realize their possibilities.
─
Betterment: We believe in a mindset of continuous learning and improvement and are committed to
providing relevant learning opportunities to upskill and reskill for the future.
─
Performance: We build the best teams that play to win, recognizing and rewarding both individual and
team performances.
─
LIFESTYLE CATEGORY
Under the ‘Lifestyle’ category, we subsume all footwear, apparel, and ‘accessories and gear’ products that
are born from sport and worn for style. ‘adidas Originals,’ which is inspired by sport and worn on the
street, is at the heart of the ‘Lifestyle’ category.
/ M
MARKETING EXPENDITURE
Expenditure that relates to point-of-sale and marketing investments. While point-of-sale investments
include expenses for advertising and promotion initiatives at the point of sale as well as store fittings and
furniture, marketing investments relate to sponsorship contracts with teams and individual athletes as
well as to advertising, events, and other communication activities. Marketing overhead expenses are not
included in marketing expenditure.
MORE SUSTAINABLE COTTON
For adidas, ‘more sustainable cotton’ means certified organic cotton or any other form of sustainably
produced cotton that is currently available or may be available in the future, as well as ‘Better Cotton.’
/ O
OPERATING OVERHEAD COSTS
Expenses that are not directly attributable to the products or services sold, such as distribution and selling
as well as general and administration costs, but not including marketing and point-of-sale expenses.
/ P
PARLEY FOR THE OCEANS
‘Parley for the Oceans’ is an environmental organization and global collaboration network. Founded in
2012, the initiative aims to raise awareness for the beauty and fragility of the oceans, and to inspire and
OUR COMPANY FINANCIAL REVIEW STATEMENTS
empower diverse groups such as pacesetting companies, brands, organizations, governments, artists,
designers, scientists, innovators, and environmentalists in the exploration of new ways of creating,
thinking and living on our finite blue planet.
PARLEY OCEAN PLASTIC
‘Parley Ocean Plastic’ is a material created from upcycled plastic waste that is intercepted from beaches
and coastal communities before reaching the ocean. The organization ‘Parley for the Oceans’ works with
its partners to collect, sort and transport the recovered raw material (mainly PET bottles) to our supplier
who produces the yarn, which is legally trademarked. It is used as a replacement for virgin plastic in the
making of adidas x Parley products.
PERFORMANCE CATEGORY
Under the ‘Performance’ category, we subsume all footwear, apparel and ‘accessories and gear’ products
that are of a more technical nature, built for sport and worn for sport. These are, among others, products
from our most important sport categories: Football, Training, Running, and Outdoor.
PROMOTION PARTNERSHIPS
Partnerships with events, associations, leagues, clubs, and individual athletes. In exchange for the
services of promoting the company’s brands, the party is provided with products and/or cash and/or
promotional materials.
POLYBAGS (LDPE)
A type of product transport packaging made of recycled low-density polyethylene (‘LDPE’) that offers a
more sustainable option to virgin plastic polybags, as they have a lower environmental footprint than
conventional bags and most alternatives. Recycled LDPE polybags meet our quality and performance
standards to effectively protect our products during shipping and handling, are available globally and can
be recycled via existing waste streams.
/ S
SINGLE-SOURCING MODEL
Supply chain activities limited to one specific supplier. Due to the dependency on only one supplier, a
company can face disadvantages during the sourcing process.
/ W
WET PROCESSES
Wet processes are defined as water-intense processes, such as dyeing and finishing of materials.
