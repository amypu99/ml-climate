CEO Message
I'd like to express my heartfelt
appreciation to all shareholders,
customers and other
stakeholders for your ongoing
support and interest in what
KEPCO and Group
companies do.
In 2022, we have seen more severe climate change and
supply-demand disruptions as a result of energy supply
shocks. Rising fuel prices for natural gas, oil, and fossil
fuel have pushed global energy companies to the verge
of bankruptcy. KEPCO was also confronted with an
unprecedented financial crisis.
To overcome the crisis, KEPCO and Group companies
have undertaken high-level finance improvement
measures as well as comprehensive management reform.
At the same time, we continue to invest in infrastructure
to ensure a stable supply of electricity, which is integral
to our nation's economy. Furthermore, we are making
every effort to prepare for a sustainable future in areas
such as climate change responses and energy security.
We declared the objective of「Zero for Green」in 2021 in order to take the lead in carbon neutrality efforts. We have also
been at the forefront of the transition sector by creating joint technology development strategies with group companies
power group companies. This year, we want to carry out carbon neutrality initiatives under the leadership of the Carbon
Neutrality Promotion Committee, while also broadening global cooperation to secure core technology. This year, we are
publishing a comprehensive Sustainability Report in collaboration with group companies for the first time.
We have a long road ahead of us to achieve sustainability management in the face of increasing energy uncertainties.
We must overcome challenges such as the financial crisis while also achieving carbon neutrality and energy security.
Furthermore, we will continue to invest in the future to improve the global competitiveness of the electric power
industry. To that end, we will prioritize and promote five key areas.
First, we will enhance financial soundness by taking extensive improvement.
KEPCO and Group companies created the Emergency Response Committee to aggressively pursue financial soundness
initiatives, including self-rescue actions. We want to take every conceivable measure to strengthen the financial
structure, including investment efficiency, asset rationalization, and profit maximization, while decreasing costs as
much as possible within the range that does not threaten energy supply stability. In addition, we will build a cost-
based power price system that accounts for cost-changing factors such as fuel, climate, and environmental costs.
Second, we will prioritize energy efficiency to attain effective carbon neutrality.
With energy efficiency improvement projects for energy-intensive sectors, small-to-medium-sized businesses, and
root companies, we will drive effective carbon neutrality by converting the industry to low-consumption and high
efficiency. We will also work together to adopt GHG reduction strategies with a broader implementation scope that
includes indirect emissions (Scope 3). In addition, we will build a planned site that fully considers the system and
location conditions for an orderly and scale renewable energy distribution. Energy security will be realized through
the development of a green energy supply system that incorporates new carbon-free power sources like hydrogen
and ammonia, as well as the development of small modular reactors (SMR).
Third, we will create a positive cycle of shared growth in the electric power industry.
We will enhance the overall competitiveness of the industry with the solidarity and cooperation among all
stakeholders. We will strengthen open R&D cooperation by connecting industry, academia, and research, while also
supporting technology commercialization through life-cycle technology development support for innovative
companies. We will construct an Innovation Cluster with energy convergence complexes that will serve as a hub for
innovative companies to demonstrate and test their new business models and technologies without barriers, thereby
encouraging private-led innovation and growth.
Fourth, we will safeguard future growth engines by launching new business initiatives and reorganizing overseas businesses.
To help revitalize new, local energy projects, we will be more open and share power data, as well as leverage business
platforms such as charging for electric vehicles. In addition, we will restructure our overseas project portfolio to
include profitable eco-friendly businesses such as large-scale power transmission networks and renewable projects,
hydrogen full-cycle projects, and carbon new-growth businesses. We will also actively encourage related local
businesses to enter the global market with us. Furthermore, we will complete the UAE nuclear power plant project
successfully. Based on such a milestone, we will construct a worldwide cooperation system to boost Korea's ability to
secure nuclear power project deals.
Fifth, we will value and maintain safety and integrity above everything else.
Under the principle of "Safety First, Construction Next", we are fundamentally redefining the management paradigm
around "Safety and Life". We will construct a complete safety system that eliminates all accident causes and
possibilities to assure the safety of workers and citizens, as well as the stability of the energy supply. Furthermore, by
aggressively implementing the Ethics Compliance Management Certification System(K-CP) and regularly certifying the
anti-corruption management system in accordance with international certification(ISO 37001), we will take the lead in
building a corporate culture of integrity.
KEPCO and Group companies will continue to innovate and communicate openly with stakeholders in order to grow
as a "Global Energy Platform Company." I would appreciate your continued encouragement and support. Thank you.

KEPCO Business Status
KEPCO operates the domestic transmission, distribution, power sales, and demand management, as well as overseas power
generation, transmission and distribution, new energy business, and grid businesses. In Korea, we are developing and operating a
multi-loop transmission and substation infrastructure that will reliably connect the whole country. We continue to focus on the
development of power distribution businesses such as expanded distribution facilities and enhanced reliability for ideal quality
energy power supply in order to respond to rising power consumption. Furthermore, we purchase electricity produced by KEPCO
group companies, private power generation companies, and district electric operators, from the Power Exchange and sell it to
customers, all while developing new services to meet customer needs and managing power demand to encourage customers to
consume in a reliable manner. Overseas, we are expanding the market by securing orders for thermal power, nuclear power, and
new and renewable energy construction and operation projects, and also by concentrating our efforts in central areas.
Furthermore, we are actively engaged in many domains such as transmission and distribution network construction, consulting,
automation, remote meter reading, and skilled worker training utilizing our technology and know-how in domestic transmission
and distribution. We are reorganizing our overseas project portfolio, in particular, on new and renewable energy, such as solar and
Mid-to-Long-Term Strategy

generating KRW 4.2 trillion in annual growth business sales, securing 602 core technologies, and attracting 1,250 energy valley
companies. We have developed and implemented five strategic directions to that aim. To achieve goals in a systematic manner, we
have defined strategic and action agendas, as well as key performance indicators (KPI) to help understand and monitor
implementation performance using quantitative metrics.

Value Chain of the Electric Power Group
In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where intelligence and connectivity are emphasized, the electric power
industry's value chain is shifting from the existing power generation, transmission and distribution, and sales to an
integrated business structure that can demonstrate convergence capabilities between different types of businesses. This is
a shift toward a 'Platform-based' environment. As a result, KEPCO and group companies are laying a solid basis with new
value chains to meet the expanding demand for 4IR.

ESG Strategies
ESG Trends in Power Industry
International crises triggered by COVID-19, trade wars, and the Russia-Ukraine war are reawakening the importance of ESG in
financial markets and industries . ESG trends across the economy, including management, consumption, and investment, have
become a daily routine. KEPCO identifies ESG trends in advance, manages them systematically, and establishes ESG management
strategies thereupon. In particular, the electric power industry is in a significant transition period with the 2050 carbon neutrality
declaration and the energy transition policy in response to climate crisis. We are facing the demands from various stakeholders to
fulfill environmental and social responsibilities in terms of the continuous growth of the company and shareholder value
enhancement. With the shift of the paradigm, KEPCO will not only actively manage risk factors related to key ESG issues in the
power industry, but also uncover new opportunities and develop business models to come up to the external expectations.
As the global climate crisis is intensifying, the energy industry is faced with disruptions, such
as greenhouse gas reduction, green energy, and the decarbonization of the entire value
chain, leading to rapid changes in the industry. In line with the great shift, carbon neutrality
is one of the core issues in the power industry. Korea is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050
in pace with the global trend. Accordingly, it is inevitable to transform the overall power
Accelerated
industry to be achieve net-zero in the energy transition sector by making energy
Pace of
transportation and consumption efficient, generating power from zero-carbon or low-

carbon sources, and optimizing the energy mix. We aim to play a clear role in achieving
carbon neutrality with the electric power group companies and expand our renewable
energy and energy efficiency businesses, while acquiring key net-zero technology through
cooperation. In addition, we will help the entire industry achieve carbon neutrality by
increasing our net-zero efforts.
Investors in and outside Korea, including pension fund managers and asset managers, are
demanding active climate responses from companies by utilizing their investment/financial
capabilities. For instance, they have introduced a negative screening strategy for coal-
related companies. They are also asking companies they are engaged in to improve mid-to-
Spread of long-term performance and ESG management by considering ESG in investment/financial
ESG-based decision-making and expanding responsible investment. As a listed company on the Korea
Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, KEPCO seeks to declare the suspension of
Responsible
overseas coal-fired power projects, advance the decision-making system, such as

establishing the ESG Committee, and reorganize the structure to focus on renewable
energy and future energy businesses as the call for ESG management from investors is
increasing. With the mid-to-long-term ESG strategy, we are identifying and implementing
measures to improve performance and manage ESG-related risks.
The discussion on regulating the disclosure of non-financial information centered on ESG is
making progress. In the EU, ESG information disclosure is mandatory for companies with a
certain number of employees. In 2019, Korea implemented the mandatory disclosure
system of corporate governance reports for large-scale listed companies with total assets
of KRW 2 Trillion or more in response to the demand. The Financial Services Commission

announced a gradually compulsory ESG disclosure plan that will expand the publication

duty of corporate governance reports and sustainability reports to all KOSPI-listed
ESG companies from 2026 and 2030 respectively.
Information Preemptively responding to the mandatory information disclosure, KEPCO has disclosed
ESG information transparently and in detail in the Sustainability Report(First published in
2005) and the Corporate Governance Report Report(First published in 2017). We also meet
the demand for ESG information from stakeholders by disclosing our ESG-related policies,
systems, activities, and performances on our website.
ESG Strategy System
Here at KEPCO, we established our ESG vision and goals. In order to achieve this, we created an ESG strategy system by
synthesizing improvement measures for each ESG area that had been disconnected. To achieve our ESG vision, 'Achieving a global
top-level sustainability management in solidarity and cooperation with stakeholders', we have set 'ESG-based paradigm shift',
'Leading ESG efforts in the public sector', 'Enhancing ESG values for stakeholders', and 'Ranking highest in third-party ESG
assessments' as our goals. 'Shift to green energy in response to climate crisis' is the aim in the environment area, 'Creating a
synergy effect from cooperation by leading the change in the industry' in the social area, and 'Establishing a clean governance
trusted by all stakeholders' in the governance area. Thus, we have a total of 9 directions and 12 tasks under the 3 major aims and 4
major goals that we are implementing.

ESG Performance Management System
KEPCO implements the ESG management in the long term to create the social value effectively and set the KPI by ESG strategic
task to examine the quarterly performance to internalize the ESG management. Also, integrity and KPI are linked to compensation
by reflecting them on performance contract of executives. When assessing performance of operations, dispatching people, we
consider the ESG factors. Other than this, we adopted the model that can quantify the non-financial values such as SROI, profits of
stakeholders, and environmental and social impacts to implement the ‘ESG impacts assessment’, reflecting them on the business
deliberation process to prevent major ESG risks caused by business operation.

Stable Power Supply
Increasing Reliability of Power Facilities
KEPCO and group companies seek to transition to green energy sources on the premise of stable power supply for low-carbon
economy and society. To operate LNG power generation stably in the course of the transition to green energy sources, we detect
points of concern in the facilities early, increase facility capacities, and upgrade facilities proactively. We also prevent an
unexpected stop of the facilities by using digital technologies, such as an AI-based predictive, control system and mock training
with VR simulators.
We strive to build the optimal operation system to secure the stability of the power system and invest in improving the power grid
to guarantee an access to electricity in response to potential insufficiency of electricity in the course of transition and volatility in
the supply. KEPCO and group companies will contribute to the national economic growth and provide convenience to customers
by supplying high-quality electricity stably even during the transition period.

Stable Operation of Power Infrastructure
Stability of Power Generation Facilities
Optimal Operation of Power Generation Facilities
With the aim of stable power supply, KEPCO and group companies are sparing no effort in making the power generation facilities
reliable under the company-wide power supply plan. We take thorough measures to prevent major failures, such as replacing old
parts in the electric/control facility, by monitoring and diagnosing points of concern in the facilities. Moreover, we regularly
conduct planned preventive maintenance actions on the boilers, turbines, control facilities, data facilities, etc. under the standard
model for planned preventive maintenance to minimize major damage and failures in the power generation facilities that may
hinder power supply. We are working on manufacturing core parts domestically and securing our own technology in terms of gas
turbines and nuclear power plants to allow immediate maintenance in emergency, and we contribute to the stable supply of
electricity by constructing power plants in a timely manner. We have secured stable fuel supplies (e.g., overseas resource
development) through the cooperation between, and we introduced an advanced purchase management system in preparation
for fuel price volatility the electric power group companies to procure fuels in an economical and timely manner. Furthermore, we
have diversified our global supply chain in response to the supply chain crisis due to COVID-19 and trade wars, while improving our
facilities to make the use of equipment more efficient.

Increased Reliability of Electricity System
Supply of High-Quality Electricity
KEPCO has established the optimal plan to operate the power system based on the prediction on future power demands and the
power generation equipment composition , built transmission and distribution facilities in a timely manner, and operate the
distribution facilities optimally and efficiently to provide electricity stably and economically . To minimize power loss and optimize
the power system, we addressed power system overload by increasing transmission and distribution facilities(substations and
transmission lines), integrated the operation of light-load transformers, increased the capacity of facilities to re duce reactive
power, replaced overloaded or old facilities, and used low-loss equipment and intelligent systems. In addition, we are
strengthening the reliability of the power supply system by using digital diagnostic technologies for substations and more. While
managing the distribution net spread out across the country, we are developing or adopting the Advanced Distribution
Management System (ADMS) to manage ESS, EVs, and other resources efficiently. We also have measures in place, such as a special
inspection in preparation for natural disasters, to prepare for power outage failures to supply high-quality electricity.

Stable Power Supply
KEPCO manages facilities strictly and has established an emergency response system in case of potential crises in power supply.
Every summer and winter, when electricity demand is at its highest, we conduct an emergency training in order to maintain power
supply and check step-by-step measures in case of emergencies even in situations where reserve power is rapidly reduced , such
as in the case of a generator failure. In addition , we prepare for unexpected incidents and accidents via inspecting and replacing
of power facilities in areas where power use is expected to surge, relieving power system overload, and inspecting the blackout
prevention diagnosis system and recovery system.In 2021, 595 underground (complex) substations under multi-purpose facilities
and major transmission lines, such as a national industrial complex, were inspected, as were 20 distribution stations to prevent
regional blackouts and 48,774 substations that were expected to be overloaded, among which 1,931 were replaced to stabilize
power supply. There were 4 on-site inspections in cooperation with a government agency to strengthen response capacities in
partnership with relevant agencies in case of a power supply emergency. Employees were designated to large-capacity clients and
clients using the emergency power saving service to take rapid measures, including demand management, in case of an
emergency. We are equipped with load management and high-efficiency equipment for the peak seasons in the winter and
summer and to spread power demands. With the use of load management equipment, such as the maximum power management
device, the maximum power decreased by 21MW, as well as 490MW with high-efficiency transformers and energy-efficient
equipment at old facilities.

Stable Power Supply with HVDC* Transmission System
KEPCO is pushing for the large-scale construction of transmission lines using HVDC. The HVDC system is becoming more needed
as power supply is complex and its scale is growing with the current power system. The HVDC system can control the amount of
power transmitted, which enables an stable operation of the power grid and prevents regional blackouts in case of potential
failure in the 765kV transmission lines. Moreover, power transmission towers can be smaller and simpler in shape, which creates
better views, and the transmission lines can be more accepted by local residents because the electromagnetic waves reduce with
the uniform scale and direction of voltage and current.

Facility Inspection with Autonomous Drones
KEPCO reduced the time and cost of inspection by about 20% while preventing safety
accidents by using drones to inspect lines and minimizing people climbing up control
tower. By adding an AI automated tracking system for transmission facilities to drones, we
automated the inspection process from take-off, flying, recognition, filming, and landing.
We developed a 3D map and the "Drone Road" based on the 3D grid using facility
information that hinder the drones from flying, such as transmission towers and high-
voltage lines, for the drones to fly outside the visibility range safely. The transmission lines
work as median strips that divide the two directions of the drone road to minimize collision

Business Case Optimal Electricity Supply in K-Semiconductor Belt
Following the government's plan to invest in building a K-Semiconductor Belt to stabilize the supply of
semiconductors, KEPCO will build the optimal electricity supply chain in the belt based on the integrated facility
plan for high-capacity clients, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. The long lines in the semiconductor
cluster of Samsung Electronics will be replaced with short-distance integrated substations to secure power supply
capacities, and the separate lines of SK Hynix and KEPCO will be integrated to cut the total length and investment
cost in the cluster of SK Hynix. We expect that local residents will be more accepting of the optimal power supply
chain than a complicated one, while lowering investment costs compared to the clients building individual
supply chains.

Increasing Supply of Renewable Energy
Renewable Portfolio Standard
The Renewable Portfolio Standard makes it mandatory for power generation companies(Suppliers) with a capacity of 500MW or
more to include at least a certain share of renewable energy(Mandatory supply) in the total power generated. As KEPCO and the
electric power group companies participate in the RPS, we strive to increase the share of renewable energy in Korea through
various efforts, such as building renewable energy facilities and purchasing renewable energy certificates.
Contribution to Reaching National Renewable Energy Supply Target
The government is pursuing net-zero policies, such as phasing out coal-fired power plants and increasing renewable power plants
as per the 9th Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand Following that, 30 out of 60 coal-fired power plants will be shut down by
2034 and 24 out of the 30 plants that are shut down will turn into LNG power plants. KEPCO is successfully operating the
Southwest Jeollabuk-do Offshore Wind Power Demonstration Project(60MW), which is the nation's first public-led large-scale
offshore wind power project, and is planning on a total of 2.8GW offshore wind power projects, including the project in
Jeju(100MW), Southwest Jeollabuk-do(100MW), and Shinan(1.5GW). We also run the Miryang Hope Light Solar Power Project, in
which the profit is shared with local residents, and building a 110MW-capacity solar power facility on idle land in a school campus
or a local government. The target s hare of renewable energy by 2030 is 21.5% as per the Working-Level Plan of the 10th Basic Plan
for Power Supply and Demand, and we will raise the share of renewable energy in a rational and planned way once the 10th Basic

Transition to Zero-Carbon Sources(Hydrogen & Ammonia) by 2050
KEPCO and the electric power group companies plan to make a large R&D investment into the transition to zero-carbon energy
sources using only hydrogen and ammonia by 2050. We will replace coal-fired and gas-fired power by mixing coal with ammonia
and natural gas with hydrogen to produce electricity.
As for coal-fired power, we aim to develop a source technology of producing power by mixing 20% ammonia with coal by 2024, build
coal-fired power facilities with 20% ammonia by 2025, and complete the demonstration of using 20% ammonia by 2027. We will mix
20% ammonia at commercial-scale power plants by 2030, and gradually increase the proportion of ammonia to 100% by 2050.
As for gas-fired power, we aim to develop a source technology of producing 80MW power with 50% hydrogen by 2023, and we plan to
demonstrate 150MW hydrogen-mixed power generation by 2028. We will commercialize the technology to mix hydrogen for 30% or
more by 2035, and gradually increase the proportion of hydrogen to 100% at remaining gas-fired CCPPs by 2050 to go zero-carbon.

group companies, we are developing a blue hydrogen production technology that uses the oxidation(Hydrogen) and
reduction(CO2) reaction of metal to convert methane and water vapor into hydrogen while collecting CO2. We plan to secure a MW-
level engineering technology upon the demonstration in 2022. We also aim to develop a P2G(Power to gas) technology that
produces and stores green hydrogen that does not emit GHG through electrolysis with renewable energy and demonstrate a 2MW
P2G system, which is the largest in Korea. We would like to expand our business into technology verification and operational
technology by 2024 by demonstrating the production of green hydrogen using renewable energy.

Activities to Improve Energy Efficiency Based on EERS
KEPCO recognizes the need to improve the efficiency throughout the electricity demand market and is initiating various projects
to improve energy efficiency centered around the EERS(Energy Efficiency Resource Standard) system. EERS system enables energy
providers to establish the energy reduction target in line with the energy sales and thus achieve the target, which is one of the
demand-side key measures for carbon neutrality and reasonable energy use, obligating efficiency improvement. In order to
strategically implement energy efficiency activities, KEPCO has diversified the implementation measures to achieve the EERS
target, while building the system to examine the evaluation in terms of energy reduction.

Improving the Awareness toward Energy Efficiency
KEPCO is expanding and implementing the project to improve awareness toward energy efficiency by establishing a cooperative
network with relevant organizations and diversifying the project to change the consumer behavior attended by Korean people.
We are providing the fund and prime rate according to the energy saving performance combined with electricity big data and
financial incentives, while revitalizing the energy cashback project that provides incentives depending on energy saving. Moreover,
in connection with local governments, KEPCO is initiating projects to provide funds depending on the result of energy inspection
and saving amount.

Promoting the Distribution of Regions in Electricity Demand
By distributing the electricity demand present in the metropolitan areas, KEPCO aims to prevent inefficient infrastructure investment
and optimize the electricity consumption, thereby encouraging the diversification of the facilities which consume a lot of energy. To
this end, KEPCO promotes the locational demand diversification by enabling consumers using a lot of energy to make a reasonable
choice through the preemptive and strategic demand diversification policy, not just accepting and managing the electricity
application as we did before. In short term, we plan to provide comprehensive incentive packages, such as by expanding the voltage
options and reducing the cost for facilities especially for newly established data centers located in non-metropolitan areas. In
contrast, in long term, we plan to promote the construction of the integrated complex of local data centers cooperating with the
government. We will ensure the reduction in social cost caused by concentration in metropolitan areas and establish electricity grid
harmonized with new renewable energy.
Making a Foundation to Utilize New Renewable Energy
Supporting the Promotion of Domestic RE100
RE100(Renewable Electricity 100%) is a voluntary campaign that encourages companies to consume 100% renewable energy in
electricity consumption by 2050. In 2020, 274 global companies and 6 domestic companies engaged in this campaign and it has
increased to 341 glob al companies and 14 domestic companies. As more and more insiders are interested in RE100, KEPCO is
operating the ‘third-party PPA intermediary’ and ‘green premium’ to encourage the domestic industry to implement the RE100
successfully. KEPCO carried out bidding twice after the adoption of green premium and then came up with the systematic
foundation to implement the third-party PPA intermediary. Going forward, KEPCO expects to encourage companies to participate
in RE100 and contribute to achieving 2050 carbon neutrality by increasing the measures to implement RE100 through our
dedicated electricity trade platform.
Introducing and Operating the Green Premium Successfully
KEPCO successfully adopted the green premium that enables consumers to additionally pay premium as well as the existing
electricity bill and purchase electricity from new renewable energy. The bidding of green premium is carried out in the first half and
second half of every year, while KEPCO is revitalizing the promotion utilizing press releases and online briefing sessions to improve
awareness toward green premium. KEPCO made contracts with a scale of 1,441 GWh among 2021 bidding supply, which accounts
for 98% of the performance of RE100. Moreover, utilizing the profits regarding RE100, and investing in renewable energy R&D.
Establishing the third-party PPA Foundation and Engaging in PPA Design Directly
KEPCO amended the business process standard organizing the TF with a view to revitalizing the third-party PPA intermediary,
while renovating the operation system throughout the whole purchase cycle, including contracts, meter reading, bill charges, and
receipts. Moreover, KEPCO facilitated the efficient electricity trade in renewable energy by recommending the optimal contract
target and providing bill simulation service in case of third-party PPA through the development of an electricity trade system
utilizing the energy market place (EN:TER) platform. In addition, KEPCO actively participated in the stage of designing the PPA
system to encourage the adoption of the government's direct PPA system, while also working hard to build relevant infrastructure
s an d improve the system to operate the system smoothly. Going forward, in order to revitalize t he domestic RE100, the company
aims to create the practical performance, encourage the industry sector to engage in the system b y actively participating in the
process of establishing an d improving the system led by the governmental agency.

Making Efforts to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions
KEPCO and group companies announced carbon neutrality vision, ZERO for Green, showing the willingness to achieve the carbon
neutrality by 2050. To this end, we plan to actively reduce the greenhouse gas emissions caused by power generation, such as by
implementing zero carbon transition in existing power generation infrastructures, including ammonia dual fuel and hydrogen dual
fuel, increasing the proportion of renewable energy power generation, and stopping the coal power plants. In addition to this,
KEPCO is discovering and implementing external reduction projects in cooperation with diverse stakeholders utilizing our own
greenhouse gas reduction technologies to additionally cut down greenhouse gas emissions.
Moreover, in order to establish the climate change response strategy in line with the global standard, KEPCO is currently carrying
out a research project to establish a carbon neutrality roadmap applying Scope 3 emission. Through this research project, KEPCO
plans to develop the measurement methodology and classification system to measure greenhouse gas emissions, including Scope
1/2/3, while also establishing the power companies’ greenhouse gas reduction strategy including Scope 3. Going forward, KEPCO
will establish and implement the phased greenhouse gas reduction target and implementation strategy in a timely manner in line
with the government’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and the Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand.

than forests. Accordingly, we will implant 400m2 of sea grass in the
ocean around the Yeongheung Power Generation and additionally
implant the 10,000m2 of sea grass. With the expansion of spawning
grounds and habitats through sea grass implantation, it is expected
that the number of marine species will increase and 500tons of CO2 Forming blue carbon sea forest
will be reduced every year per 10,000m2 of sea grass.

Distribution of Code of Conduct for Suppliers
KEPCO has adopted a Code of Conduct for Suppliers’ as sustainability standards for all suppliers to comply with. The Code of Conduct
for Suppliers is based on the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact(UNGC), OECD Due Diligence Guideline and Fundamental
Conventions and defines specifies ethical, environmental, and social standards. It provides guidance to all domestic and foreign
partners in business relationships with KEPCO, along with their employees, agents and sub-contractor s and ask them to comply with
the guideline.

Supply Chain ESG Risk Management
KEPCO is reflecting non-financial risk evaluation indicators in the existing supply chain evaluation process to diagnose and improve non-
financial(ESG) risks within the supply chain. Non-financial risk evaluation indicators include economic indicators such as credit rating,
equipment quality rating, quality management system(ISO 19001) certification, environmental indicators such as eco-friendly product
certification, production environment management and violation of environmental laws, and social indicators such as sanctions for anti-
corruption and subcontracting law violation, safety accidents, and safety of equipment securing.
Supply chain evaluation is conducted in written evaluation and on-site inspection. The written evaluation is the evaluation based on the
responses and evidence(data, etc.) submitted by the suppliers for each evaluation index at the time of contract bidding, and is used as
basic data to identify potential risks of the suppliers. In addition, for low performers in the quality evaluation, the test to evaluate
equipment performance and quality inspection are conducted to prevent quality risk.

Supply Chain Evaluation Follow-up Management
KEPCO conducts on-site inspections of suppliers likely to have high risk based on the results of our supply chain evaluation in order to
establish and implement a corrective action plan and regularly conduct follow-up management. We also impose sanctions such as
suspension of registration and cancellation of registration for ineligible companies who have violated regulations, including bid rigging
or false or forged documents, depending on the degree of violation following a decision by the Reward and Punishment Committee.
Supply Chain Fairness and Transparency Improvement
KEPCO is striving to improve our systems and processes to protect partner companies’ rights and interests and establish a fair economic
order. We are reviewing and amending our terms and conditions, guidelines, etc., in order to discover elements of unfairness across our
company rules and regulations related to transactions with business partners. Furthermore , we became the first domestic company to
introduce a reward system(up to KRW 20 Million) for reporting unfair procurement practices. We also continue to make concerted and
diverse efforts at increasing the transparency of contract work, expanding information disclosure by prohibiting contact with retirees,
operating a reporting system, and establishing an integrated management system for small-value private contracts.
Key Supplier Management
Here at KEPCO, we designated major power equipment, such as transformers and switchgear, that significantly impact power quality
and supply stability, as ‘Trusted Items’ and only allow pre-registered companies with the required manufacturing capabilities and quality
systems to participate in bidding. After pre-examining those companies who registered their trusted items in terms of quality and
process, we manage them as key suppliers, classifying them into the following categories: transmission; substation; distribution; and
ICT. In addition, we are managing supplier chain risk by having the pre-registered suppliers of trusted items receive permission in
advance before using core parts.

Establishing Comprehensive Safety Management Measures
In December 2021, comprehensive safety management measures for ‘Safety First, Work Later’ were adopted and implemented to
eradicate the three major accidents. To prevent electric shock accidents, direct live wires were immediately removed, and indirect live
wires were adopted and the practice of power outages during the work was expanded. To prevent jamming accidents, it has become
mandatory to install anti-jamming devices for work vehicles and check whether they are installed through remote monitoring. In
addition, to prevent fall accidents, workers riding on the pole was completely prohibited and a steel tower fall prevention devices were
installed in all areas. As a result of these efforts, the three major accidents decreased by 66% compared to 2020, and the total number of
industrial accidents decreased by about 19%.

Transmission and Substation Safety Management
KEPCO is strengthening preventive measures to achieve Zero major accidents, such as falls from heights and accidents due to lack
of safety measures. For this purpose, KEPCO developed a fall prevention safety device to ensure safe move in the upper part of
the machine, and removed the risk of tower falling and fall accidents, adopting safety clamp to remove possible cause of fall. In
addition, work and safety experts are inspecting the site to detect blind spots and come up with improvement plans, providing
improvement measures for 132 cases detected in each area in 2021 . We are also implementing smart field safety management,
adopting facial recognition-based substation access control system, monitoring on harmful and dangerous situations, and
automatic risk detection and alarm system.
Safety Management in Distribution Work
Surveys on work environments were conducted to prevent electric shock accidents, and safety construction methods and tool
improvement plans were defined from idea contests. Based on this field information , KEPCO is accelerating the conversion to
safer construction methods, and in 2021, achievements were made in six joint developments including replacement of suspension
insulators, application of safety construction methods to 70% of the total construction methods through expansion of safety
construction, and reduction of tool weight by 20% through adoption of lightweight work tools, etc. In addition, we are actively
conducting activities to prevent possible falls accidents while working on electric poles and jamming accidents while operating
work vehicles.
Safety Management in Overseas Projects
KEPCO has successfully completed the construction of UAE Unit 1, the first nuclear power plant exported, based on its
technological and business management capabilities. As it shifts from construction to operation, we adopted a world-class safety
management program to respond to evolving accidents types and risks. Team Korea–Team UAE joint safety campaigns were held
four times a year, and joint safety inspections by management were conducted 52 times a year. In particular, special safety
inspection on electric shocks and fall accidents were conducted to prevent 247 accidents likely to happen. From August 2017 to
June 2021, the UAE nuclear power plant project achieved 100 million accident-free hours.

Preemptive Preparation for Extreme Weather Conditions
To preemptively prepare for the continuous occurrence of extreme weather, KEPCO added a forecasting system on the disaster response
system centered on Prevention-Preparation-Response-Recovery to strengthen the efficient use of disaster response resources and
capabilities. The forecasting system reinforced disaster response capabilities by integrating various disaster information on earthquakes,
typhoons and others to predict the expected area and scale of damage, so that disaster recovery and response resources are promptly
invested in advance. In addition to the forecasting system, efforts are made to make continuous improvement in prevention activities
including strengthening of design criteria for adaptation to climate change and introduction of IoT diagnosis technology, response activities
such as improvement of mobile app functions for disasters monitoring and reimbursement management, and recovery activities including
operation of a wide-area recovery support system using resources such as manpower and equipment.
Special Inspection on Power Facility
KEPCO preemptively prevents large-scale disaster factors through safety management by facility and period, and conducts intensive
inspections of power facilities during the times of vulnerability to prevent safety accidents and strengthen the stability of power supply A
preemptive self-diagnosis of safety measures was conducted at 54,000 locations during the thawing season and dry season(February-April).
In addition, in preparation for heavy snowfall and cold snap in winter(December-February), thermal insulation facilities were installed and
inspected, and in summer(June-September), in preparation for typhoons and heavy rain, special inspection was conducted to prevent
possible soil loss and drainage facilities damage

Spreading Information Security Culture
KEPCO encourages the active participation of management and employees across the company to strengthen the information
security system and spread the information security culture. Adopting 'Basic Information Security Guidelines' to define step-by-step
response procedures to information security threats that all executives and employees can access and read and at the same time,
KEPCO established information security training plan to boost awareness of executives and all employees and provide customized
practical training related to information security. In addition, trainings are provided for employees to respond to external attacks such
as DDoS and to swiftly respond when business systems are at risk of information security.
KEPCO is operating a reward system for employees showing excellent performance in information security to create a work culture in
which employees can autonomously detect, report, improve, and receive feedback on information security vulnerabilities, rather than
providing one-way education for employees. In 2021, a total of 122 information security vulnerabilities were identified by executives
and employees, and 50 executives and employees were for detecting and making improvement on critical security vulnerabilities. As
a result of these efforts, KEPCO has achieved ‘Zero information security incidents’, ‘Actively participation in cyber security contests by
st
government agencies and achieving the highest score(1 place in the contest by the National Intelligence Service and by MOTIE)’.
We are running security review procedures for cyber assets and information security systems at all times, and implementing

Active Work Support and Eradication of Passive Administration
We have extended the application period for ‘Active Duty Exemption’, in which executives and employees are exempted from liability for partial
procedural defects in the process of faithfully and actively carrying out their work to promote the public interest. In addition, executives and

company. In order to eradicate possible infringe upon the rights and interests of customers or financial losses to the company due to passive behavior
such as omission or neglect of duty by executives and employees, personnel management measures were strengthened when 'passive
administration' was detected in the audit. To prevent this 'passive administration', we made preventive education mandatory for employees.

Practical Support for Work-Life Balance
Improvement in Work-Life Balance System
With changes in the external environment related to the improvement of working conditions, such as 'Encouraging Childbirth to Tackle
Population Decline' and 'Reduced Working Hours for a Life with Family Dinner', and internal expectations such as growing interest in
work-life balance and welfare programs among employees, KEPCO established company-wide work environments and implemented
corporate culture improvement activities. We adopted 3-year parental leave per child, higher than the legal standard(1 year), and
employees can split the period to take the leave. In addition, a flexible work hour is implemented to improve work efficiency with self-
directed work time design, and work infrastructure has been strengthened following the implementation of the telecommuting system
such as in-house mobile phone apps and cloud PCs.
We are also contributing to the creation of new jobs by strengthening parental leave, encouraging male employees to use parental leave,
and securing additional hiring capacity for vacancies caused by the flexible work system. Proving the excellence of these activities to
improve the working environment and change the organizational culture, KEPCO has earned the ‘Family-Friendly Certification’ of the
Ministry of Gender Equality and Family for 11 consecutive years from 2011 to 2021.

management goals to be achieved during the term, we make management contracts with the government(Minister of the Ministry
of Trade, Industry and Energy) and are assessed by the Public Institution Management Evaluation Group regarding the
implementation performance. The salary of inside directors, including CEO, is set by the ‘Executive Salary Guideline for Public
Institution and quasi-governmental departments’ to set the salary limits and the salary is paid within the approved compensation
limit determined by the Board of Directors. Bonus is determined reflecting the implementation performance and the bonus of CEO
is divided and paid for three years through the mid-term bonus system. In addition, whether the outside director serves a second
term or not is determined by the performance of their duties and is paid a job allowance according to the internal guideline. The
information on salary payment is disclosed on the business report and ALIO (All Public Information In-One).

Efforts to Ensure the Rights of Stakeholders
KEPCO is carrying out various activities to ensure the rights of shareholders. We ensure the basic right, such as profit-sharing right,
participation of shareholders’ meeting and exercising voting rights, and information provision for exercising voting rights
stipulated in the Commercial Act. Furthermore, various communication channels allow the reliable communication with
shareholders and DART and website disclose the IR material(Management performance and prediction information), thereby
providing shareholders and potential investors with useful information for decision making. In addition to that, IR and NDR collect
various requests and opinions from shareholders to ensure the reasonable management activities.
Voting Rights System (Electronic Voting System)
KEPCO regulates that recruitment announcement should be made at least before two weeks to make sure that shareholders
recognize the proposal of shareholders’ meeting in advance. Furthermore, for shareholders who are not able to participate in the
shareholders’ meeting due to the location and time, we adopted the electronic voting system from December 2015. Therefore,
shareholders of KEPCO can exercise the voting rights on online without having to attend in person.
Grant One Share and One Vote
Based on the Commercial Act and Articles of Association, we ensure the voting rights according to the one-share-one-vote rule. As
of late 2021, the total shares of common shares are 641,964,077 and we don’t have treasury share.

Reinforcing the Risk Identification and Preemptive Response
KEPCO and group Companies are facing unprecedented risks including climate change, energy
supply disruptions and sudden rises in energy prices, and concerns about the economic
slowdown. Amid the uncertainty of external conditions, we are planning to secure the future-
oriented growth engine and dominate the overseas markets and new industries through
preemptive technology innovation and energy system transition, turning the risk into
opportunities to achieve win-win growth. To this end, Audit Committee under BOD, the highest
decision-making body, ESG Committee, and Advisory Committee will play a major role in
preventing and minimizing the risks preemptively from the professional view.
KEPCO
As KEPCO is facing unprecedented crises including a sudden rise in material costs and stricter ESG regulation, we are sharing
electric business-related issues and maximizing the risk management capabilities by organizing consultative groups such as
‘Meetings with the presidents of electric group companies’ and ‘Emergency Planning Committee of group companies.’
Furthermore, we established the disaster countermeasures for stable electricity supply and sustainable supply chains by
providing subcontractors with ESG transition support, thereby establishing the ESG-based risk management system
throughout the electric industry. Going forward, we will consistently strive to communicate and cooperate with major
stakeholders such as group companies and subcontractors to supply sustainable ‘Human-centered Clean and Warm Energy ’

The company is speeding up the large-scale solar photovoltaic power business and offshore wind power business to convert
the coal thermal power generation into new renewable energy generation. In addition, we are diversifying the low-carbon
technologies such as CCUS(Carbon Capture, Utilization, and storage) to achieve a 100% reduction of net greenhouse gas
emissions, cultivating the climate-related new industry. Going forward, we will keep strengthening the capabilities of climate
change risk management by communicating with stakeholders, ushering in the energy transition era, and achieving 2050
carbon neutrality.

and general risks, monitoring the human rights risks by the business site in advance, and improving the shortcomings
gradually. Going forward, we will pursue transparent governance and ethical compliance management to win the trust of
various stakeholders and Korean people, thereby becoming a reliable public institution.

In February 2022, European Parliament revealed the ‘Due Diligence Guideline of Supply Chains’ that requires companies to

different from existing support activities for supply chains. In response to this, KOSPO is taking the lead in managing the ESG-
related risks of supply chains by encouraging subcontractors to improve their ESG levels and implementing safety level
strengthening business. For effective ESG management, we established the ESG Committee in May 2021 and turned it into an
‘Open ESG Management Committee’ by recruiting private experts. Going forward, we will endeavor to realize sustainable ESG
management through the solidarity of the industry ecosystem.

a priority on workers’ safety when it comes to its management. Last year, Korea East-West Power monitored all activities
related to regulations, systems, and the way of work by operating the ‘Special Safety TF’ led by the CEO and improved the
shortcomings to prevent industrial disasters. Going forward, Korea East-West Power will strive to strengthen the constitution
of safety management to prevent ESG risks and become the leading company in terms of the eco-friendly energy transition.

terms of KRI, we set the standard according to the three years of fluctuation by indicators and scenarios and manage them in accordance with 5
stage risk level(Preparation, Attention, Caution, Alert, Serious).
Profitability Decline caused by the Fuel Cost Increase
#1
(Explanation and effects) When price fluctuation is not reflected on the electric bill, the hike in fuel cost such as
bituminous coal, petroleum, LNG may not be reflected on the current electricity bill. As a result, the financial soundness of
KEPCO may be undermined.
(Easing activities and plans) By applying the cost-linked bill, we disclosed the basic oil cost(Electricity Bill) in December
2021 and we decided that the fuel cost is 46.6 won per kwh, up 9.8 won. Considering the burden of people, we decided to
increase the basic fuel cost by 4.9 won/kwh in April 2022 and by 4.9 won in October.
Increase in Power Generation Costs caused by Stricter Environment-related Regulations
#2
(Explanation and effects) Policies and laws managing the climate change (reduction in greenhouse gas emission and
coal-power development according to the Nationally determined Contributions (NDC), Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)
are regulated and stricter. In response to this, new renewable energy development facilities and technology investment are
required and this may decline the financial soundness in KEPCO and group companies.
(Easing activities and plans) We are planning to make investment to respond to legal risks including the infrastructure
investment for renewable energy power generation. To this end, in January 2021, the company introduced the cost-linked
electricity rate system to clarify the link between climate and environmental costs and electricity rate and improve
transparency by charging such costs separately. ‘Climate and environmental costs’ were separated from the existing
‘electricity rate’ to reflect the costs related to RPS and ETS and the reduction in coal power generation. In December 2021,
we announced the climate and environmental costs that will be applied from 2022 by considering the increase of climate
and environmental costs in 2021 in accordance with the adoption of a cost-linked electricity rate system.
Non-financial Risk Management
In the rapidly changing management environment, various types of risks are taking place in economy, society, and environment. KEPCO regulated
the ‘Risk Management Business Guideline’ to effectively manage such risk factors and designated the responsible departments and relevant
departments in conflicts, health, terror, disasters, and promotion to establish the risk management system and stipulate the necessary matters that
are required for risk management activities. Together with that, ‘Risk Management Portal’ allows the consistent management activities, and KEPCO
published the ‘Risk Management Manual’ to respond to risks quickly.

Direction of Climate Change Risk Response
Climate change risks of KEPCO consists of transition risks and physical risks. Transition risks are risk factors that may change the policy, technology, and
market and affect the company image and reputation while responding to climate change and the risks are managed by establishing the response
strategies by item. Physical risks are chronic and acute risk factors in power facilities caused by abnormal climate. To respond to this, we analyzed the
comprehensive climate change impacts through scenario analysis (RCP 8.5) and came up with the ‘Climate Change Adjustment Measure’ to reflect it on
the management strategy.

Independent Audit
KEPCO defines the composition, position, and rights in the operation regulation of the Audit Committee and carries out audit duties. A standing
auditor is appointed by the decision from shareholders’ meeting after recommendation from the Executive Recommendation Committee and non-
standing auditor is appointed by the decision from shareholders’ meeting among outside directors, carrying out audit duties regarding executives
independently. Also, we established the internal audit organization under the Audit Committee to separate from the executive agency, securing the
independence.

Stricter Ethical Compliance Management
We signed the ‘Ethical Compliance Management Certification Pilot Company MOU’ and
adopted the ‘Ethical Compliance Management Certification System', announcing that
our company will implement the ethical management. Ethical compliance
management certification is the governmental monitoring and evaluation system that
allows public institutions to establish the ethical management system and prevent,
identify, and improve corruption risks in accordance with the international anti-
corruption standard. Certification is approved by adopting the ethical management
compliance program(K-CP) and screening them. Through the certification system,
KEPCO is taking the lead in 5 topics, including the establishment of K-CP’s environment,
Ethical Compliance Management Certification Pilot
corruption risk mapping, prevention and management of corruption risks, monitoring

and improvement, sanctions and incentives.
Support the Ethical Compliance Consultation and Operate the Prior Consulting System
KEPCO is operating the ethical compliance support system in the internal control system to support the employees’ ethical compliance
management. An ethics/integrity implementation leader, a code of conduct officer, and an anti-solicitation officer are supporting the ethical
consultation and an in-house lawyer and legal advisors are supporting compliance-related consultation. In addition, ‘Prior Consulting System’
supports the compliance duties and expands the prevention audit function.

Big Data-based Effective Anti-corruption Monitoring
KEPCO strives to prevent violation in advance by establishing the anti-corruption monitoring system. While we focused on chronic corruption like
bribery, we are managing the new corruptions, such as abuse of power and unfair exercise of authority, to raise the effectiveness. We stay away
from collecting information passively or carrying out audit by depending on human resources, we monitor the situation and prevent corruption in
advance based on big data-based anti-corruption monitoring system by identifying corruption signs in advance and signaling them.
Revitalize the Reporting Channel and Protect Whistleblowers
KEPCO allows internal and external stakeholders to get consultation or report regarding violation of ethical compliance matters. Reporting
channels for corruption (irrationality) consist of e-people, irrationality anonymous reporting system, report system for abuse of power, K-Whistle.
The KEPCO website discloses the reception status by reporting channel, detailed information about misconducts, result of disciplinary actions
transparently. In addition, the identity and reporting-related information should not be disclosed without approval from whistleblowers according
to the Act on Anti-corruption and the Establishment and Operation of the Anti-corruption & Civil Rights Commission and the audit department
takes disciplinary actions after identifying the situation when the information is disclosed without approval.

Prevent Interest Conflicts in Carrying out Duties
Act on the Prevention of Conflict of Interest Related to Duties of Public Servants prevents public servants pursuing the private interests related to
their duties, banning the interest conflicts that may arise while carrying out duties and ensuring the fair duty performance to secure the reliability
from the public. The act consists of 10 detailed conducts and each of them are divided into reporting and submission obligation and restriction and
prevention conducts. It was legislated on May 18, 2021 and will be implemented on May 19, 2022. KEPCO established the preemptive response
system before implementing it in earnest to make sure that employees raise their awareness toward the act and implement them.
10 Detailed Conducts to Prevent Interest Conflicts
Reporting and submission obligation Prevent interest conflicts in carrying out duties
 ① Avoid reporting private stakeholders
 ② Report possession and purchase of real assets   ⑥ Prevent recruiting family members
related to duties of public institutions  ⑦ Prevent private contract
 ③ Report the trade with people related to duties  ⑧ Restrict external activities related to duties
 ④ Report private contacts with retired people  ⑨ Prevent the private use of public institutions
 ⑤ Submit work activities of high-ranking officials   ⑩ Prevent the use of confidentiality in the job
in private sector
First of all, we evaluated the awareness level related to the act to figure out whether they know about important matters and allowed public
servants to discover and strengthen the necessary matters for initial establishment. As a result, 46% of employees responded that they understand
the act, 32 % responded that they understand the 10 detailed conducts, 49 % understand the private interests, 34% understand the reporting
process. Most of them responded that promotion and training should be strengthened to raise the awareness and establish the system initially.
Accordingly, we raised the awareness by operating customized training program and pledges for stakeholders and support the expansion of the
culture of integrity by signing the convention on the prevention of conflict of interest for internal and external stakeholders. For high-ranking
servants, the vice-chairman of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission was invited to give a lecture regarding the act. For employees, we
encouraged them to take the course of ‘Understandable Act on the Prevention of Conflict of Interest Related to Duties of Public Servants’. 99.5% of
them completed the course. By implementing the mock training regarding the reporting method and process measures when interest conflicts
take place, we allowed 582 employees to participate in the training. By doing so, there has been no violation regarding the interest conflicts as the

Fair Trade and Anti-corruption of Subcontractors
KEPCO ensures the rights of subcontractors and helps establish the mutual trade model by raising the transparency of contract process for fair
trade with subcontractors. To secure safety of subcontractors, we established the system to give extra points when subcontractors obtain ISO45001
(Safety and Health) when it is eligible and regulated the safety guideline and safety management table for service providers. To operate the fair
contract system and promote transparency, we established the estimated price calculation system and computerized a bid, improving the
unreasonable factors when writing the estimated price manually. In addition, the retired person in terms of prevention of contacts with retired
people is within 2 years from the retirement date, thereby eradicating unfairness.
Operate the Internal Control System
KEPCO’s internal control system consist of ‘Autonomous Compliance’ for prior prevention and ‘Internal Audit’ activities centered around follow-up
audit. It consists of detailed content to make sure that internal check is carried out. We raise the reliability of consolidated financial information by
establishing the internal accounting system collectively.

Active Response to Human Rights Issues
Raise the Human Rights Awareness
As KEPCO is aware of the importance of respect for human rights and prevention of human rights risks, we established the cooperative system
between departments to select human rights-related tasks and implement them. In particular, as the result of human rights inspection, we are
taking actions to improve awareness regarding major human rights issues discovered. With regard to sexual harassment and sexual assault, we
conducted the customized training for mangers, counselors, and new employees and implemented the training for prevention of workplace
harassment. Regarding the organization culture, our company expanded the junior board operation, the communication channel between MZ
generation and old generation, by 4-fold compared to previous year. Also, we are raising the human rights awareness by making books and videos
for organization culture, thereby expanding training and communication regarding human rights.
Identify and Respond to Human Rights Issues
In terms of potential human rights issues, gender parity (discrimination), sexual harassment and sexual assault (harassment), and mental health
issues have been identified for employees. For subcontractors, safety accidents, discrimination and disadvantages (inhumane treatment) have been
identified. Also, noise and environmental pollution issues have been identified in the local community. KEPCO will keep complementing the
standards and process for human rights identification and identify the risk types, including forced labor, child labor, freedom of assembly, collective
bargaining, discrimination, and risk ranges, including employees, women, children, immigrant workers, local communities

The assurance provider assured key information included in the report, such as sustainability management policies, systems,
activities, performance, and goals of KEPCO and its six group companies. Quantitative information in the report included data
from the past three or five years, and qualitative information included activities from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 in the
scope of verification. For specific subjects, data and activities until 2022 were included in the scope of verification.
Description of Methodology
The assurance provider conducted assurance engagement to Type 1 and Moderate levels of AA1000AS v3, and also checked
compliance with the four principles of AA1000AP(2018). In addition, it was assured whether the ‘specific subject matter’ derived
from the materiality test satisfies the disclosure standards of the GRI Standards.

on assuring that there were no significant errors, omissions, or misrepresented information.
• Through KEPCO's on-site inspection, we identified items that require detailed assurance such as performance data and
certificates, and conducted internal employee interviews related to the information included in the report.
• Only written assurance was performed for the ‘Electronic Disclosure System Disclosure Data’ and ‘Korea Electric Power
Corporation and Electric Power Group Company Website’ posted materials, and among the reporting boundaries, information
from outside (KEPCO's partners, contractors, etc.) was excluded from the scope of verification.
