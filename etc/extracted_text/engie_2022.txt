JOINT EDITORIAL
2021, a year of decisive acceleration
An accelerated energy transition is central to ENGIE’s
strategy. In 2021, the Group reaffirmed its industrial
strategy and committed to the transformation of its
organization. The foundations have been laid for long-
term sustainable growth aligned with its purpose.
This 8th edition of the integrated report is designed to
share, with all our internal and external stakeholders,
our vision of the energy world, business model, strategy,
and creation of financial and non-financial value in a
simple and educational way.
What happened within the Group during 2021 that
should be remembered?
Catherine MacGregor: 2021 was a good year for ENGIE! I
am proud of everything we accomplished in such a short
time. In agreement with the Board of Directors, we
repositioned ENGIE and refocused our activities around
our four core businesses: renewables, of course; energy
solutions; networks; and thermal generation with energy
supply. We reaffirmed the Group’s industrial approach
and the priority we place on operational excellence. We
accelerated our growth investments in Renewables and
Energy Solutions. As we were engaged in an extremely
ambitious transformation, our teams demonstrated
exemplary mobilization in the challenging context of the
pandemic. I would like to express my deepest gratitude
to them. However, I regret our poor results in health and
safety. We are fully mobilized and currently
strengthening our actions everywhere we operate, both
with our teams and with our contractors.
In concrete terms, what do you consider the highlights
of 2021?
Catherine
Jean-Pierre Clamadieu: This year was marked by a
MACGREGOR historic rise in energy prices that impacted consumers
and manufacturers. This price surge adds further
Chief Executive Officer
meaning to our commitments in terms of social and
societal responsibility, in line with our goal to lead a just
transition wherever we operate. Guided by our purpose,
our strategy – which places our performance within a
comprehensive CSR approach – contributes to the
Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.
Therefore, we are fully reaffirming our historic adherence
to the 10 Principles of the United Nations Global Pact.
Catherine MacGregor: There were so many highlights
during my first year at ENGIE! We commissioned an
additional 3 GW of renewable assets and won major
contracts in energy solutions, such as the contract with
Georgetown University in the United States or the
contract with the City of Paris, which entrusted its
cooling network to us for twenty years. We entered into
several strategic partnerships in the renewable gas
segment, such as with CMA-CGM to decarbonize maritime
transport, or with Masdar in the United Arab Emirates to
develop green hydrogen. All while we continued to assist
our individual customers in moving toward a
decarbonized economy. We also completed the disposal
of EQUANS under good terms and conditions. This will
offer amazing development opportunities to the teams.
2021 was marked by renewed mobilization on climate
change. How is ENGIE positioning itself in this context?
Jean-Pierre Clamadieu: 2021 indeed marked a turning
point in this area: in the United States, President Biden
took the initiative to rejoin the Paris Agreement soon
after his inauguration. At COP26, for the first time,
governments paved the way for a gradual phase-out of
fossil fuels. The framework set up in Paris in 2015 is now
complete and functional. For their part, the mobilization
of economic players around voluntary coalitions was a
remarkable accelerator.
Mobilization is also on track in Europe: it has increased
its 2030 emissions reduction goal to 55% compared to
1990, and established a “Fit for 55” road map. A major
transformation of our economy is underway and ENGIE is
determined to be a major player.
Catherine MacGregor: In the first half of the year, the
Group presented a stronger climate goal to be “Net Zero
Carbon” on its three scopes by 2045 by following a “well
below 2°C” trajectory, currently being certified by SBTi*.
All our teams are enthusiastically mobilized around this
goal. This is a major commitment in which we have
already made progress. I salute their determination to
meet the exciting challenges of the energy transition and
to build tomorrow’s low-carbon energy system today.
At a time when the world is experiencing a historic crisis
in Ukraine, how is the Group being impacted?
Jean-Pierre Clamadieu: ENGIE has strongly condemned
the invasion of Ukraine and we have of course
committed to comply in every respect with the
applicable sanctions. We have expressed our solidarity
Jean-Pierre
with the affected populations and our employees
affected by these events. Our teams are mobilized and CLAMADIEU
on the ground with the support of the ENGIE Foundation.
Chairman of the Board of Directors
The Group is solid and we can approach this new crisis
with confidence and in a spirit of solidarity.
Catherine MacGregor: As a world player, we assume our
responsibilities. ENGIE immediately mobilized all its
resources to ensure the safety of its employees affected
by the conflict. Our priority is also to ensure the security
of supply of our customers. We are currently working to
this end by accelerating the filling of our storage facilities
and diversifying our gas purchases. In the longer term,
this conflict reinforces our ambition to be carbon neutral:
to accelerate the decarbonization of our activities,
particularly in renewable gases.

Clean, affordable energy • Goal 7.1 “Access to energy”
In the current context of rising prices, ENGIE has taken action to maintain affordable access to energy. Thus, in France where
ENGIE supplies 8.5 million individual contracts at market prices, more than two-thirds at fixed prices are not affected by
the recent increases. Customers with regulated rates benefit from the government price shield. The Group proposes offers
to consume less and better, with the possibility in France, for example, of controlling one’s gas heating or delaying one’s
consumption of electric heating and thus getting off the electricity grid during peaks in consumption. Finally, for all our
customers with financial difficulties, customer representatives are working on payment installments.

The fight against climate change is one of the greatest collective challenges and requires the
participation of populations. The question of the cost and safety of the energy transition and of the
co-construction practices with the regions will be key for its appropriation. As industrialists, we are
convinced that energy efficiency will be indispensable and that an energy mix based on a range of
energies will ensure a more secure transition and best protect the purchasing power of households and
business competitiveness. This is why we are accelerating our development in renewable energies and
in renewable gases, biomethane and green hydrogen, which will be key for sectors that are difficult to
decarbonize otherwise, such as heavy mobility and certain industrial uses.

RENEWABLES
Our strategy: Developing green energy production resources in an integrated system.
As a key player in the sector, ENGIE is stepping up investments in renewable energies, with a target to increase its capacities
by 4 GW per year on average by 2025, and by 6 GW per year by 2026.
Investments will be made in onshore wind power and ground-mounted solar power. Offshore wind power is also a key
priority, with a target of 5 to 7 GW commissioned or in the pipeline by 2025.
Where we stand:
The acceleration in renewable energy was marked in 2021 with the acquisition, in partnership with Crédit Agricole
Assurances, of Eolia, one of the largest renewable energy producers in Spain. Over the period of 2019-2021, the
Group commissioned 9 GW of renewable capacity. It plans to again accelerate the development of its annual additional
renewable energy capacities, which will then be 4 GW on average per year by 2025 and reach 50 GW at the end of 2025.
To do so, it has identified a set of projects for a capacity of approximately 66 GW.
Interview with Paulo Almirante,
Executive Vice President in charge of Renewables, Energy Management and Nuclear Activities
Where does ENGIE stand in terms of its objective to step up its renewable energy production to
reach 50 GW by 2025 and 80 GW by 2030?
In line with what was announced at the beginning of 2019, ENGIE commissioned an additional
9 GW between 2019 and 2021, i.e. 3 GW per year, despite challenging circumstances related to
Covid-19 in 2020 and supply chain tensions in 2021. By end-2021, the Group had a total installed
renewables capacity of 34 GW. And ENGIE is ramping up the development of renewable energy
in order to reach 50 GW of installed capacity by 2025. Most of this new capacity will be achieved
through organic growth and will originate from wind and solar power projects. In the second half
of the decade, between 2026 and 2030, an average of 6 GW of additional renewable capacities will
be commissioned per year, with offshore wind power making a significant contribution. ENGIE can
rely on a solid projects portfolio and highly experienced teams in achieving these ambitious but
attainable goals.
What is your road map for 2022?
In 2022, our goal is to increase the Group’s installed renewables capacity by 4 GW. We will
commission major wind and solar power projects, such as Moray East, a 1 GW offshore wind farm in
Scotland. We will also continue to improve the operational performance of projects and assets, with
workplace safety a top priority. The Group’s objective is both to respond to the sustained growth in
energy demand and to actively contribute to decarbonization, in line with ENGIE’s commitment to
achieving Net Zero Carbon by 2045.
ENERGY SOLUTIONS
Our strategy: Offering integrated decarbonization solutions to our customers through long-term contracts.
The Group will focus on the development of decentralized energy networks (urban heating and cooling networks, on-site
utility production, decentralized solar power, urban networks and low-carbon mobility), as well as on related services, with a
target of 8 GW commissioned by 2025.
Where we stand:
After a period of uncertainty due to the pandemic, the year 2021 was marked by the resumption of the commercial
development of Energy Solutions’ activities. Several major contracts were won, including the contract with the City of
Paris in December 2021. ENGIE and its partner Groupe RATP were selected to manage the cooling network. They obtained
the renewal of a 20-year concession that covers the production, storage, transmission and distribution of cooling for the
city. ENGIE will also be responsible for extending the network by 158 km by 2042, in order to serve all the districts of
Paris and to open it up to new customers (hospitals, day-care centers, schools and retirement homes).
NETWORKS
Our strategy: invest in high-performance networks, designed to achieve a balanced, carbon-neutral energy mix.
The strategy has four main objectives: to maximize the value of existing assets; to rebalance the portfolio to include
international markets and electrical grids; to promote the production of biomethane in France and a number of other target
countries internationally; and to convert assets to hydrogen.
Where we stand:
The Networks activity continued its international development with the start of commercial operations of Gralha Azul
and the first power tests on Novo Estado, two electricity transmission lines built by the Group in Brazil. The gas networks
in France have maintained high reliability and recorded solid performance, both in operational efficiency and in the
development of renewable gases, where 147 new biomethane production sites were connected to the ENGIE network. This
brings the total number of connected sites to 351, a possible contribution to annual production that may reach 6.1 TWh.
THERMAL GENERATION AND ENERGY SUPPLY
Our strategy: Developing and operating low-carbon activities and supporting the transition of current electricity systems.
In addition to investments in renewables, the Group is focusing on the development of its thermal capacity, in line with its
carbon emissions reduction pathway. Depending on the specific needs of each country, ENGIE meets the flexibility needs of
the electricity system and supports the decarbonization of its customers. The phase-out of coal capacities is underway, and
the first initiatives to convert to green gas plants have been launched, primarily using biomethane and hydrogen.
Where we stand:
These activities offer significant flexibility in a context of intermittent renewable energies and contribute to the security
of future supply. In 2021, they again demonstrated their reliability by recording an unplanned internal unavailability
rate of less than 5%. On October 31, 2021, the combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) projects at Vilvorde (Belgium) and at
the Awirs site, each with a capacity of 875 MW, were selected for a 15-year contract in the first auctions of the Capacity
Remuneration Mechanism in Belgium. These plants will be able to use green gases and will move over the long-term to
carbon neutrality. The Group entered into a strategic alliance with MASDAR in the United Arab Emirates to develop green
hydrogen throughout the Gulf countries. The plan to exit from coal continued with the disposal of Jorge Lacerda in Brazil
and the end of operations at Tejo (Portugal), its last coal-fired power plant in Europe.
Interview with Sébastien Arbola,
Executive Vice President in charge of Thermal Generation and Energy Supply activities
What is your road map for 2022?
ENGIE is committed to being net zero by 2045. The challenge for the Thermal Generation & Energy
Supply GBU is to continue to provide the flexibility that ENGIE and the electricity system require
while reducing its CO emissions. This means growing our business selectively, greening our asset
2
portfolio and helping our industrial and individual customers to achieve carbon neutrality.
We will also continue to strengthen our industrial expertise and our digital know-how with regard
to managing operations. This means making our power plants more flexible and responsive, while
guaranteeing the highest level of occupational health and safety for our teams and cybersecurity
for our sites.
What challenges are associated with hydrogen as regards ENGIE’s strategy?
Renewable hydrogen is the link between the Group’s strategic pillars, namely renewables, networks
and customer decarbonization. ENGIE has therefore set ambitious goals and is developing projects
that position the Group among the world leaders in this field.
As of today, ENGIE’s portfolio includes more than 70 projects worldwide, aimed in particular at
developing hydrogen ecosystems for industry and mobility, export chains and hydrogen transport
and storage demonstration facilities. The next step is to move to industrial scale through key
partnerships, industry collaboration and strong public support.
GLOBAL VALUE CREATION
ENGIE aims to create value in the medium and long term for the benefit of all its stakeholders.
The Group’s performance is guided by setting objectives in three categories: planet, people and
economic prosperity.

Combining agroforestry and wind power to preserve biological diversity
In order to compensate for a loss of habitat for farmland fauna linked
to the establishment of the Mont de la Grévière wind farm in France,
ENGIE Green sponsored the planting of agroforestry trees on 18
hectares of agricultural plots in 2016. In 2019, we began assessing the
effectiveness of this initiative by undertaking environmental
monitoring of these plots in partnership with the Association Française
d’Agroforesterie (French Agroforestry Association) and the
Mélanie Le Bris Regroupement des Naturalistes Ardennais (Ardennes naturalists group).
Biodiversity Officer The findings in this first year of monitoring were promising: water
at ENGIE Green percolated 11 times faster where there were trees than elsewhere; the
number of insects per hectare was nearly four times higher than in the
control plots; and species diversity was more than 10 times higher. To
even out the effects of weather-related fluctuations, we will monitor
the progress of this measure for at least five years.

Interview with Cécile Prévieu,
Executive Vice President in charge of Energy Solutions activities
How is ENGIE supporting its customers in their decarbonization strategies?
Our support focuses on two main areas: the reduction of energy consumption and the greening
of production methods. We work with our customers across the entire value chain, from the
assessment of their specific situation, through engineering and construction, to the operation of the
appropriate energy network. To do this, we use several levers: recognized technical expertise in
our businesses coupled with a geographical footprint that guarantees a sound knowledge of local
issues and close proximity to our customers; the ability to finance the solutions we implement;
and commercial production through rolling out multi-site solutions based on a global geographical
presence.
What are the main challenges and priorities for 2022?
As we saw during COP 26, many customers are committing to ambitious emission reduction targets
in an increasingly short time frame. That is excellent news but also poses a challenge. Our role is to
offer them the best strategies and solutions to achieve this, which means we have to step up our
development of low-carbon networks and services for our customers in 2022 and to continuously
innovate. Our recent commitment to the City of Paris to extend its cooling network by an additional
158 km by 2042 as part of an effort to decarbonize and adapt to climate change is a perfect
example.
RENEWABLE GASES, AN ESSENTIAL ENERGY SOURCE
FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY
As a renewable resource, biomethane is a component of the circular economy. Though it remains
marginal in the global energy mix, it is an energy source of the future that is needed, alongside low-
carbon hydrogen and synthetic gases, to achieve carbon neutrality.
What are renewable gases?

through fuel cells. As a highly versatile fuel, hydrogen can
be transported and stored in liquid or gaseous form.
Hydrogen: an accelerator of decarbonization
To achieve a carbon-neutral future, ENGIE relies on a
diversified energy mix and, in particular, on an ambitious
program to develop hydrogen production, transport,
storage and distribution capacities. This gas can be stored
in underground saline cavities over long periods. It can be
injected as a mixture into the gas network, or used in pure
form for a variety of purposes, in particular in industry and
the mobility sector, or converted into low-carbon electricity.
It contributes to solving the problem of the intermittence of
renewable energies.
Another fundamental advantage of hydrogen is the fact
that it can be produced from locally established renewable
energies, thereby promoting the short energy circuit and
local jobs. Thanks to in-depth knowledge of the regions in
which it operates and its ability to intervene in the entire
value chain – from the development and financing of
hydrogen projects to sales to end customers – ENGIE has
major assets to bolster its development.
Hydrogen is therefore the promise of a new technological,
energy and industrial sector, both locally and globally,
with new jobs at stake, essential as a contribution to the
decarbonization of the energy mix. The governments
have understood this: in Europe, more than 10 countries
(including France) and the European Commission have
published their “National Hydrogen Strategy” road map, with
the related promises of funding.

A strategic partnership for the decarbonization
of maritime transport
The CMA CGM Group – a world leader in maritime
transport and logistics – and ENGIE have entered into a
long-term strategic and industrial cooperation on projects
to produce low-carbon fuels. The goal is to ensure the
development of a synthetic methane production and
distribution chain that can benefit the maritime
transportation sector. An initial project for the production
of liquefied biomethane (bioLNG) dedicated to maritime
transport has already been initiated at the Marseille
Maritime Port Authority, and other industrial projects are
in the pipeline. The partnership will facilitate the pooling
of knowledge and R&D efforts, particularly in key
technologies such as carbon capture and green hydrogen
production. Today, liquefied natural gas (LNG) reduces
sulfur oxide emissions by 99%, fine particle emissions by
91% and nitrogen oxide emissions by 92%.

Using new technologies to reduce methane leakage
ENGIE is involved in a European scientific project whose objective is to improve knowledge and the use of new
technologies in order to quantify methane emissions in networks and thereby bolster actions to reduce these
emissions. 14 European gas network managers and gas associations are involved in the project coordinated by the
European Gas Research Group (GERG) and ENGIE is present via GRTgaz’s Research and Innovation Centre (RICE), which
has identified the most promising technologies to be tested. In addition to on-site measurements, as close as possible
to the equipment, these new remote measurement technologies aim to quantify the overall emissions of a geographical
area and give an overall assessment. Embedded in drones, moving vehicles on the ground or in the air, or installed on
site, 12 different technologies are being tested to assess their accuracy and reliability. This collective project illustrates
the efforts being made by gas operators to significantly reduce methane emissions in order to contribute to short-term
climate change mitigation and reinforce the environmental value of gas and gas networks in the energy transition.

renewable gas sectors and promoting the key role of gas and gas networks in achieving the energy
transition. Lastly, in Brazil, ENGIE will continue the construction of its electric transmission lines.
What were the key achievements of the Networks GBU in 2021?
We should note, first of all, that despite the impacts of the health crisis, we maintained a high level
of operational and financial performance in our gas networks, both in France and abroad.
In addition, we continued to prepare the future of our gas networks in France. We took many
actions to promote and scale up the biomethane sector. As such, we should applaud the fact that,
at the end of December 2021, France had 351 units in production for a capacity of 6.2 TWh, two
years ahead of the target set by the PPE. We also helped our customers with ambitious projects,
as demonstrated by the signing of a partnership agreement with CMA-CGM to support the
decarbonization of maritime transport through the development of synthetic methane and bio-
LNG. We pursued our innovation efforts as well, with the inauguration of GRTgaz’s R&D platform
(FenHYx) and demonstration projects for the conversion of our gas networks to hydrogen (MosaHYc,
HYpster, Jupiter 1000, etc.).
Lastly, we continued the construction and commissioning of our 2,800 km of electric transmission
lines in Brazil (Gralha Azul and Novo Estado projects).

Pierre-François Riolacci
Executive Vice President in charge of Finance, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Purchasing
ENGIE is a major economic player and must practice responsible and sustainable finance.
This is reflected in the rigorous management of its financing and debt capacities, but also
in the selection of growth investments that contribute to the necessary energy transition
towards a decarbonized world. In 2021, ENGIE invested more than €4 billion in growth
capex, of which more than 90% related to the strategic priorities and nearly 80% aligned
with the EU taxonomy. These investments were financed in particular by green bonds on
the market in which ENGIE remains a key player with over 14 billion issued since 2014.
In addition to this financing, ENGIE is a responsible company that supports its millions
of customers through its decarbonized offers and efficiency solutions. At a time when
prices are rising sharply, ENGIE is helping its individual customers by implementing the
government’s measures to freeze regulated rates in France and welcoming the customers of
defaulting suppliers thanks to responsible pricing.

A pacesetting financing structure
Engaged in a decarbonization pathway, Chile has committed
to becoming a net zero emission country by 2050. ENGIE is
helping with its transition by activating several levers. The
Group and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have
therefore developed a pilot financing structure that will be
used to monetize the cost of decarbonization. It consists of a
loan whose costs are reduced by a carbon price determined
by a tailored methodology established by the IDB. This
initiative could be replicated in the future by other Group
subsidiaries.
This funding approach will help accelerate the transition
by activating several levers: ending coal-based electricity
production by 2025 (with the shutdown of plants and the
conversion of the more recent plants to gas and biomass);
developing 2 GW of renewable capacities; and setting up
pilot projects in favor of renewable hydrogen. The full plan

year, the compensation policy for managers and corporate

recommendation of the Appointments, Compensation and

Shareholders’ Meeting.

seriousness of the accidents that occurred in 2021 and on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer, a 15% reduction in the target bonus, i.e. €150,000, will be applied to the bonus to be
paid in 2022 for 2021, which will thus be reduced to €1,109,000.
In 2022, three changes will be made to the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation: performance units will be replaced by
performance shares; a fourth CSR criterion will be introduced for the annual variable component, relating to the recruitment
of 35% women managers; and the occupational accident frequency rate criterion will be replaced by a set of three indicators:
frequency rate, severity rate and number of fatal accidents. Senior managers’ variable compensation is structured around the
same model as that of the Chief Executive Officer.
A TRANSVERSAL GOVERNANCE
OF CLIMATE CHALLENGES
ENGIE relies on a specific governance of climate issues in order to implement its purpose: acting to
accelerate the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and achieving its goal of Net Zero Carbon by
2045. It not only includes specific responsibilities for each body but also the integration of climate-
related issues into the Group’s investment and planning processes

A GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY
The diversity of its activities and locations exposes the Group to various risks (see p.16). To limit
their occurrence, minimize their impact and anticipate them, ENGIE has a global risk management
policy.
This policy lays out ENGIE's ambition to “control its risks management system in the activities and entities it controls,
in order to ensure its performance” and advocates taking in compliance with the governance rules applicable to each
risks that are legally reasonable, acceptable to the public entity. The annual risk assessment process is organized as
