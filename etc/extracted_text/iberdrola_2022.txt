Letter from the chairman
■ GRI 2-22
Ignacio S. Galán
Chairman
“In 2022, a year characterised by a complex and uncertain environment, Iberdrola
has continued to accelerate the electrification of energy uses with the development
of more renewables, grids and storage, and also with the drive for green hydrogen.
With these investments, we are making possible structural improvements in energy
costs, efficiency, security of service and emissions. Our activity is also generating
industrial infrastructure and jobs, and we contribute to promoting education,
innovation, tax revenues to pay for public services, and improvement in the balance
of payments through the reduction of fossil fuel imports. All of the foregoing,
together with numerous activities relating to the protection of the most vulnerable
communities and other social causes, shows Iberdrola’s commitment to the
creation of prosperity and the protection of the environment, today and for future
generations.”
In 2022, which was characterised by a highly uncertain and unstable economic, political, and social
environment, Iberdrola’s workforce continued to work and innovate to provide efficient, high-quality
service to the 100 million people who trust us all over the world. To ensure that we can continue to
build a better future for all, we have also made every effort to speed up the transformation of the
energy sector in terms of guarantee of supply, competitiveness and environmental impact.
Both tasks, which are strongly intertwined, have guided our activities in dozens of countries,
including Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, Germany, Australia
and Japan.
The €11,000 million invested last year firstly allowed us to implement new electricity transmission
and distribution, as well as to strengthen and digitalise existing ones. These include, for example,
the projects carried out in the United States, which will enable us to continue to improve the grids in
New England and New York in coming years; and the new investments in transmission in Brazil, like
the Rio Formoso line and the eight new infrastructure projects under development that will placed
into service over the next three years.
The networks team also engaged in major projects to maintain and restore service in emergency
situations, like the Celia storm in Spain, the Dudley, Eunice and Franklin storms in the United
Kingdom, and the Elliot storm in the United States. The investments made and the optimisation of
grid management made possible by digitalisation have allowed the group’s supply quality
parameters to continue to progress despite these incidents.
Our investment effort has also led to the creation of more than 2,000 new MW of clean energy and
to progress in the construction of approximately 7,700 additional MW. We have already invested
approximately €6,000 million in this new capacity under construction, with the allocation of 60% of
this amount to 3,500 MW in offshore wind farms in the United States, the United Kingdom, France
and Germany. This cements our leadership in this technology, in which, in addition to these projects,
we have 1,300 MW in operation.
Our position at the forefront of energy storage has been strengthened by the launch of the Tâmega
gigabattery, the largest clean energy project in Portugal. This pumped hydroelectric storage, one of
the largest in Europe with a capacity of 1,200 MW, is already capable of storing 40 million kWh in
energy, equivalent to the needs of 11 million people for 24 hours.
Iberdrola’s contribution to the transition from a fossil fuel-based model to a fully decarbonised model
in 2022 has been especially visible through two highly meaningful milestones. Firstly, definitive
abandonment of coal, with the demolition of the chimney of our last facilities of this kind in the world,
in Palencia (Spain), which plant was closed in 2017.
Secondly, the completion of the Puertollano (Spain) green hydrogen plant, the largest for industrial
use in Europe at the time, which is part of the portfolio of more than 60 projects under development
in eight countries to help to decarbonise sectors like the chemical industry and heavy-duty transport.
As a result of all this activity, which increases the investments made by Iberdrola in the last 20 years
to €140,000 million, net profit earned in 2022 reached €4,339 million, 11.7% more than last year.
The decision to grow in countries like the United States and Brazil has allowed us to offset the
results of Iberdrola España, which shrank by 16% in an environment strongly affected by the high
energy prices.
The Group’s results in 2022 enabled us to propose to the shareholders an approximately 10%
increase in shareholder remuneration, in line with the increase in net profit, to €0.49 per share,
which is equivalent to dividend yield of 4.5%.
In accordance with our current strategy, last year’s growth was achieved by maintaining our financial
strength, rating and full access to the capital markets, as shown by the issue of more than €9,500
million in green and sustainable financing instruments during the year.
Financial markets rated the Group’s performance in 2022 very highly. Iberdrola registered a total
shareholder return of 9.8%, beating the IBEX 35 (-5.5%) and the European sector index, Eurostoxx
Utilities (-14.4%).
Contributing to a more prosperous, fair and sustainable society
Iberdrola’s growth in terms of size and strength has gone hand in hand with the reinforcement of our
commitment to the social dividend.
Just last year we made 4,700 new hires within the Group, and support 400,000 jobs at thousands of
suppliers across the world through our purchases, which exceeded €17,800 million this year. And we
have continued to contribute to support public services for all citizens with taxes in the total amount
of €7,500 million, €2,600 million of which were paid to the Spanish public treasury.
We continue to promote the talent and professional development of our workforce – with more than
68 hours of training per employee per year – as well as future professionals through scholarships,
grants and technical training provided to thousands of young people every year. And we continue to
be fully committed to our responsibility to contribute to full equality between men and women,
through actions to foster scientific and technological careers among women and facilitate their
access to professions traditionally dominated by men, including the Escola de Electricistas
electricians’ school for women in Brazil.
We have also proven our leadership in caring for the environment by reducing our emissions to just
59 g/kWh, one fourth of those of our competitors in Europe, aspiring to achieve zero net emissions
at our generation plants and our own consumption by 2030, and across our entire business by 2040;
and of having zero or a positive impact on biodiversity by 2030. We are convinced that this
aspiration is achievable and compatible with the generation of value for our shareholders,
employees, suppliers and other stakeholders.
We have also further strengthened the wager on innovation as a strategic key factor that spans all
our businesses and activities: We have allocated more than €360 million to cutting-edge initiatives to
promote electrification, which led the European Commission to consider us again as the private
utility that invests the most in this concept in the world.
In these turbulent times, support for disadvantaged groups must be ever more present in the
decision-making of all economic and social players. For this reason, in 2022 we engaged in various
activities to protect our vulnerable customers: we offered work integration opportunities to
impoverished young people in partnership with institutions like Unicef and the Red Cross; we
promoted social action through the group’s foundations across the world, which allocate more than
€20 million to these tasks; and, of course, we continued to support our nearly 17,000 volunteers,
who have continued to contribute their free time to help those most in need.
This report shows, once again, our Group’s industrial and economic success. But, above all, it
shows that Iberdrola is an enterprise of long-term responsible social transformation, the continuation
of which is reflected in the new strategic plan presented in November, which establishes a record
investment of €47,000 million up to 2025 in order to continue to promote a sustainable energy model
based on electrification, which generates wealth and opportunities for all.
We are proud of what we have built in the last twenty years, in accordance with our century-old
history. And we know that, by continuing to make our history, we will achieve a society that is more
fair, equitable, sustainable and prosperous, as well as a more inhabitable planet for future
generations.

Purpose and values
■ GRI 2-23
Iberdrola’s corporate purpose, which is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030
Agenda of the United Nations, mirrors the main social trends and addresses major economic, social
and environmental challenges, reflecting the expectations of Stakeholders and defining Iberdrola’s
role as an agent of social change and transformation in the energy sector. It is expressed as follows:
To continue building together each day a healthier, more
accessible energy model, based on electricity.
This purpose, which is in line with the creation of shared value, social dividend and corporate social
responsibility, expresses:
• The Iberdrola group’s commitment to the well-being of people and the preservation of the
planet.
• The Iberdrola group’s commitment to a real and comprehensive energy transition, based on
the decarbonisation and electrification of the energy sector and of the economy as a whole,
which contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — particularly the fight
against climate change — and generates new opportunities for economic and social
development.
• The conviction that a more electricity-based energy model – which abandons the use of fossil
fuels and mainstreams the use of renewable energy sources, efficient energy storage, smart
grids and the digital transformation – is also healthier for the population, whose well-being
depends on the environmental quality of their surroundings.
• The aspiration for the new energy model to also be more accessible to all, and to favour
inclusiveness, equality, equity and social development.
• The intent to promote this new model in collaboration with all agents involved and with
society as a whole to ensure the availability of local energies that contribute to security of
supply.
To attain this Purpose, the Iberdrola group has condensed its corporate values into the following
three concepts:
• Sustainable energy: the group seeks to always be a model of inspiration, creating
economic, social and environmental value in all of its surroundings, and with the future in
mind.
• Integrating force: the group works with strength and responsibility, combining talents, for a
Purpose that is to be achieved by all and for all.
• Driving force: the Iberdrola group brings about small and large changes in order to make
people’s lives easier, always seeking to improve, and to do so efficiently and with high self-
imposed standards.
A successful and well-established business
Iberdrola firmly believes that the transition to a carbon neutral economy by 2050 is technologically
possible, economically viable and socially necessary. The energy transition to a low-emissions
economy is a great opportunity to create independence and wealth, generate employment and
improve the state of the planet and people’s health. The group is therefore committed to leading the
way, a path it embarked on more than 20 years ago with a firm commitment to renewable energies
and that has led it to invest more than €140,000 million since then. And it will continue with an
ambitious investment plan of €47,000 million between 2023 and 2025, focused on increasing its
installed renewable, onshore and offshore wind, photovoltaic, battery and hydroelectric capacity,
plus electricity grids. This plan aspires to achieve carbon neutrality for Scopes 1 and 2 by 2030,
offsetting any residual emissions after 2030. The ultimate aspiration of this commitment is to achieve
Net Zero emissions by 2040. Iberdrola is therefore making a decisive contribution to the
development of an autonomous, safe, clean and competitive energy model, supporting industry and
employment in the communities where it operates.
This commitment will be fulfilled by promoting:
A business model with characteristics that accelerate value creation for all
1. Aimed at satisfying the expectations of its stakeholders by incorporating ESG+F
factors into the company’s strategy and management.
2. Investment is particularly focused on the networks business, which has predictable
regulatory frameworks with investment incentives, and constitutes essential infrastructure
to handle the transition of the energy model.
3. It is supplemented by selective investments in renewables, thus optimising the risk-return
profile. This mainly includes offshore wind, photovoltaic, onshore wind, hydroelectric, battery
and green hydrogen production projects, all of which are necessary to achieve a
decarbonised energy and economic model.
4. Geographical diversification, with a focus on countries with high credit ratings.
5. Historical commitment to a robust financial position that preferentially relies on green
finance instruments thanks to the fact that the investment plan is highly aligned with the EU
Taxonomy.
6. Dividend policy establishes a strong and growing dividend in line with the increase in the
company’s profits.

Corporate and governance structure, ownership and
legal form
■ GRI 2-1 2-12 2-24
Iberdrola is an independent public company (sociedad anónima) with a registered office in Bilbao
(Plaza Euskadi, 5), organised under Spanish law and listed on the stock market, and is configured
as the holding company for an international group with a presence in Spain, the United Kingdom,
the United States of America, Brazil, Mexico, and other EU member states and Australia, among
other countries.
Using country subholding companies and head of business companies, the group combines a
decentralised structure and management model with coordination mechanisms that ensure the
global integration of all businesses and an effective system for separation of functions, checks and
balances, and controls. In addition, the Governance and Sustainability System provides for a
number of measures that give listed country subholding companies a special framework of
enhanced autonomy.
The corporate and governance structure of the Iberdrola group is reflected in the following chart:
The company’s governance structure is based upon this corporate configuration, which duly
differentiates between strategic definition and supervision, on the one hand, and day-to-day and
effective management, on the other:
a. The Board of Directors of Iberdrola (holding company) is vested with powers relating to
strategic definition and the governance model, as well as strategic supervision, organisation
and coordination.
a. The chairman of the Board of Directors and the chief executive officer, with the technical
support of the Operating Committee and the rest of the management team, are responsible
for the supervision, organisation and strategic coordination of the group.
b. The country subholding companies strengthen strategic organisation and coordination
through the dissemination, implementation and supervision of overall strategy and basic
management guidelines at the country level, for which they have non-executive directors and
audit and compliance committees, in addition to their own internal audit and compliance units
or divisions. These entities group together the shareholdings in the head of business
companies and one of their main functions is to centralise the provision of common services
to these companies.
d. The listed country subholding companies (AVANGRID, Inc. and Neoenergia, S.A.) have a
special framework of enhanced autonomy in regulatory matters, related party transactions
and management.
e. The head of business companies assume decentralised executive responsibilities, enjoy
the independence necessary to carry out the day-to-day administration and effective
management of the businesses and are responsible for the day-to-day control thereof. They
are organised through their respective boards of directors and specific management
decision-making bodies; they may also have their own audit committees, internal audit areas
and compliance units or divisions.

20 October 2020, he was reappointed as a member of the Board of Directors on an interim basis.
6 On 1 January 2023, Santiago Martínez Garrido and Ainara de Elejoste Echebarría were appointed to the positions of non-director
The Board of Directors is composed of two executive members
(14%) and twelve non-executive members (86%).
Independent directors make up 71% of total members,
including the two deputy chairmen, the lead independent
director and the chairmen of all the consultative committees.
The Board of Directors is characterised by its independence (86% non-executive directors and 71%
independent directors), gender balance (each gender representing 50% of non-executive directors
and no gender with a representation of less than 43% of all directors), and the diversity of skills,
experience and nationalities of its members.
The gender and age diversity of the members of the Board of Directors are shown below:
■ GRI 405-1 2-9

fact that each gender represents 50% of non-executive
directors since 2021, surpassing the percentages envisaged in
Directive (EU) 2022/2381 for 2026
Separation of functions, checks and balances, and controls
■ GRI 2-11 2-13
The chairman of the Board of Directors is considered the executive chairman and reports to the
Board of Directors.
He exercises the power to represent the Company individually, its senior management, the
leadership of the Board of Directors (moderating debates and ensuring that the Board and the
Executive Committee, which he also chairs, are functioning properly), and the other powers granted
by the Board of Directors, the Governance and Sustainability System, and by law.
In his capacity as executive chairman, he also assumes all duties not expressly assigned by the
Board of Directors to the chief executive officer. The areas, divisions and positions that do not report
to the chief executive officer or other specific bodies report to him.
The company has had a chief executive officer, as a separate position from the executive chairman,
since 25 October 2022. The chief executive officer coordinates the businesses of the group’s
companies as the person in overall charge of all of them.
The chief executive officer strengthens and facilitates the exercise of the powers attributed to the
chairman of the Board of Directors, to whom he is subordinate. He therefore reports to the executive
chairman. He also reports to the Board of Directors and regularly reports to the Board on his
management, making any necessary proposals for decisions on matters within the scope of its
powers.
Subordinate in turn to the chief executive officer are the directors of the global businesses of the
Group’s companies, along with the chief executive officers of the country subholding companies,
among others, who are hierarchically subordinate to their boards of directors and, in the case of
listed country subholding companies, with full respect for the special framework of enhanced
autonomy given to them by the Governance and Sustainability System.
In addition, the company has a structure of executives and professionals authorised to implement its
strategy and basic management guidelines, with powers provided according to two operating
principles: (i) the principle of joint action, which governs the exercise of powers of a decision-making
or organisational nature; and (ii) the principle of joint and several action, which governs the exercise
of powers of mere representation.
The management team regularly reports to the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee and the
consultative committees as described in the Annual Activities Report of the Board of Directors
and the Committees thereof.
The structure of the Board of Directors —with a large majority of independent directors—, the
configuration of its positions, and the existence of consultative committees, provide the structure for
a system of checks and balances that ensures that neither the executive chairman, the chief
executive officer nor the Executive Committee have decision-making powers that are not subject to
the appropriate checks and balances, thus ensuring that they are under the effective supervision of
the Board of Directors.
In particular, the first deputy chair and lead independent director and the second deputy chair, both
of whom are independent Board members, serve as a counterbalance to the executive chairman,
ensuring that his actions are subject to the appropriate controls.
Similarly, the group’s corporate and governance structure is designed in such a way that
management power is not centralised in a single governing body or in a single person, but rather is
decentralised among the boards of directors of the head of business companies, with the
Company’s main function being supervision, organisation and strategic coordination at the group
level.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Executive Committee
■ GRI 2-9 2-11 2-24
The Executive Committee has all the powers inherent in the Board of Directors other than those that
cannot be delegated pursuant to law or the Governance and Sustainability System.
The main activities of this Committee consist of continuously monitoring the implementation of the
strategy, meeting objectives, the governance model, and submitting proposals to the Board of
Directors or making decisions regarding strategic issues in cases of urgency. In particular, this
includes investments and divestments that are significant for the Company or its group, assessing
whether they are in line with the Company’s budget and strategy, analysing and monitoring business
risks, and taking into consideration any environmental and social aspects.
Consultative committees
■ GRI 2-9
Consultative committees are permanent, internal, informational and consultative bodies within the
Board of Directors, without executive powers, with informational, advisory, control and proposal-
making powers within their respective scopes of activity, which focus on the following:
• Audit and Risk Supervision Committee: internal audit, internal control and risk monitoring
systems, preparation of financial and non-financial information, the audit of the financial
statements, and compliance in accordance with the terms set out in its Regulations.
• Appointments Committee: selection, appointment, re-election and removal of the members
of the Board of Directors and of the Company’s Senior Management as provided for in its
Regulations.
• Remuneration Committee: remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and of
senior management as provided in its Regulations.
• Sustainable Development Committee: review and update of the Governance and
Sustainability System, preparation of the Statement of non-financial information, and
supervision of the policies on sustainable development, people management, inclusion and
diversity, equal opportunity, occupational health and safety, stakeholder engagement, respect
for human rights, sustainability, etc., in accordance with the terms set out in its Regulations.
For more detailed information regarding the composition, operation and activities of the company’s
governance bodies, see the Annual Activities Report of the Board of Directors and of the
Committees thereof.

Introduction to the Governance and Sustainability
The Company has a Governance and Sustainability System, which evolved from the former
Corporate Governance System, and which is structured around three pillars: environmental, social
and corporate governance.
Leadership in sustainable development, social commitment, good governance and transparency is
one of the hallmarks of Iberdrola’s identity. The Board of Directors therefore regularly reviews the
Governance and Sustainability System, keeping it updated and ensuring that it includes the
By-Laws
The By-Laws at the core of the internal regulations and make up the backbone of the Governance
and Sustainability System. Based on the Purpose and Values, they constitute the guidelines that
define the identity and uniqueness of the Company and its business enterprise.
Code of Ethics
■ GRI 2-12 2-23
Iberdrola, S.A. strives for its conduct and that of the people related thereto to comply with and
conform not only to current law and its Governance and Sustainability System, but also to
generally accepted ethical and sustainable development principles.
The Company therefore promotes a preventive culture based on the principle of “zero tolerance”
with regard to committing illegal acts and all forms of fraud and corruption
The Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A. has approved the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola
group, which sets out the raison d’être and the ideological and axiological basis of the business
enterprise of the companies that form part of the Iberdrola group and governs their day-to-day
activities. The content of the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group is further developed and
specified in the Code of Ethics of Iberdrola, S.A.
The Code of Ethics is intended to serve as a guide for the conduct of directors, professionals and
suppliers in a global, complex and changing environment. The code has been prepared taking into
account the good governance recommendations generally accepted in international markets and the
sustainable development principles accepted by Iberdrola, S.A., which constitute a basic tool for
monitoring the activities of the Iberdrola group’s companies. It also meets the company’s prevention
obligations with regard to the criminal liability of legal entities. It includes the commitment made by
Iberdrola, S.A. to the principles of business ethics and transparency in all areas of activity,
establishing a set of principles and guidelines for conduct intended to ensure ethical and responsible
behaviour by all directors, professionals and suppliers of the Iberdrola group’s companies.
The code therefore applies to all directors, professionals and suppliers of the Iberdrola group’s
companies, and to investees that are not part of Iberdrola, S.A. but over which the company has
effective control, within the legally established limits, regardless of their rank, geographical location
or functional reporting, and of the group company where they perform their services.
Excluded from the scope of application are listed country subholding companies and their
subsidiaries, under their own special framework of strengthened autonomy, as they have their own
code of ethics or conduct, inspired by a purpose and values that are ultimately in line with the
Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and governed by the principles set forth in the Code of
Ethics.
The Code of Ethics forms part of the Governance and Sustainability System, which was
approved by the Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A. in 2002 and last amended on 20 December
2022.
For more detailed information on the group’s Compliance System, see the "Ethics and integrity"
section of chapter "IV.1. Good governance, transparency and Stakeholder engagement".
Policies and commitments
■ GRI 2-23
The Iberdrola group has a set of corporate policies that further develop the principles reflected in the
Governance and Sustainability System and that contain the guidelines governing the conduct of
the company and the companies of its group, as well as those of the directors, officers and
employees thereof, within the framework of the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group.
These policies, the full versions of which can be found in the Corporate Governance tab of the
website, are grouped into four categories.

In particular, these policies and rules are structured into four parts
• Corporate governance and regulatory compliance policies

Long-term risks and opportunities. Comprehensive Risk
System
Iberdrola’s Board of Directors and senior management is firmly committed to and engaged in the
management of the group’s risks:
• Ex-ante:acceptable levels of tolerance to risk are reviewed and approved on an annual basis
through risk policies that establish (through limits and indicators) the qualitative and
quantitative risk appetite at the group level and at each of the main businesses and
corporate functions, in accordance with the objectives established in the strategic plan and
the annual budgets.
• Ex-post: periodic monitoring of significant risks (key risk maps) and threats and the various
exposures of the group, as well as of compliance with the approved limits and indicators.
Risk management within the group is based on foresight, independence, commitment to the group’s
business objectives and the engagement of senior management and the Board.
Functions of the Risk Committee
Active management
Credit risk
• Analysis and approval of counterparties and limits, establishment of
approval criteria, and monitoring of exposures in order to minimise
credit losses.
Market risk
• Analysis and approval of detailed limits and monitoring of exposures
in order to constrain the effects of volatility in the markets in which the
group operates.
Coordination of second lines / Enterprise Risk Management
(ERM)
To ensure, under the internationally recognised three lines model, that
there are mechanisms for all significant risks of the group to be controlled
at all times and that they are regularly reported to the various committees
and externally.
By way of supplement, the group has a Compliance
Overall supervision of operational risk through the group’s corporate
System, linked to the Board’s Sustainable Development
Insurance, Security and Cybersecurity, Information Technology and
Committee, with elements that include the Code of
Occupational Safety and Health units and the businesses.
Ethics and the Compliance Unit.
Comprehensive Risk Control and Management System
The group´s General Risk Control and Management Policy approved by the Board of Directors
establishes the mechanisms and basic principles for appropriate management of the risk/opportunity
ratio, at a risk level that makes it possible to:
• Attain strategic goals with controlled volatility
• Ensure the group’s corporate stability, financial strength and reputation (Stakeholders).
• Contribute to achieving the SDGs, with a special focus on goals seven and thirteen
• Disseminate a risk culture
In accordance with the three lines model, the General Risk Control and Management Policy and
related policies are implemented within a comprehensive risk control and management system,
supported by a Risk Committee, which is based on properly defining and assigning duties and
responsibilities at the operational and supervisory level to develop suitable procedures,
methodologies and support tools
Risk policies and limits of the Iberdrola group
The General Risk Control and Management Policy is further developed and supplemented with
the specific policies established in relation to certain risks, corporate functions or businesses of the
group, which are also annually approved by the Board of Directors of the group’s parent company,
and which include limits and indicators that are subsequently monitored.
The country subholding companies adopt the group’s risk policies and specify the application
thereof, approving the guidelines on specific risk limits, based on the nature and particularities of the
businesses in each country. The listed country subholding companies, and companies with
significant interests held by other shareholders, approve their own policies under their own special
framework of strengthened autonomy
Principal risk factors of the Iberdrola group
The risk factors to which the group is subject are generally grouped into the following categories
Category Definition
Corporate Non-compliance with applicable law, the Governance and Sustainability System, the recommendations set
Governance forth in the CNMV’s Code of Good Governance, and international standards
Exposure to volatility in variables like electricity and other energy commodity prices, emission rights, exchange
Market
rate, interest rate, solvency, liquidity, inflation, raw materials, etc.
Contractual breach by a counterparty, causing economic or financial losses, including payment and
Credit
replacement cost risks
Uncertainty as to the behaviour of variables intrinsic to the business, including characteristics of demand,
Business
hydraulic resources, wind, solar, etc
Regulatory and Regulatory changes made by the regulators that can affect remuneration of the regulated businesses,
political environmental or tax provisions, etc
External events or inadequate internal procedures, including those stemming from i) technical failures, human
error and technological obsolescence, ii) operation and construction of facilities, iii) supply and the supply
Other* chain, iv) cybersecurity and systems, v) safety and health, vi) pandemics, extreme natural phenomena and
climate change, vii) regulatory compliance, viii) reliability of financial and non-financial information, ix) fraud
and corruption, and x) litigation, arbitration and tax matters.
Potential negative impacts on the company’s reputation arising from situations or events that fail to meet the
Reputational
expectations of its Stakeholders
* Operational, technological, environmental, social and legal
Given the multidimensional nature of the risks, the taxonomy defined in the system contemplates
additional classification variables for better monitoring, control and reporting of such risks. These
additional categories include the classification of risks into Structural Risks, Hot Topics and
Emerging Risks, the latter being understood as potential new threats, the impact of which is as yet
uncertain and the probability of which is undefined, but which are growing and could become
significant for the Group.
The system contemplates the continuous monitoring and detection of emerging risks and other non-
financial risks, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks with significant
reputational consequences
Evaluation of risk management processes
■ GRI 2-12
Generally, the group’s Comprehensive Risk Control and Management system allows for proper ex

The group’s Risk Committee meets at least on a monthly basis. This committee is supplemented
with the Credit Risk and Market Risk Committees, which also meet on a monthly basis. On at least a
quarterly basis, the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of the Board of Directors monitors trends
in the group’s risks:
• It reviews the group’s quarterly risk report, which includes monitoring of compliance with the
risk policies and limits and the updated key risk maps submitted by the group’s Risk
Management and Internal Assurance Division.
• It coordinates and reviews the Risk Reports sent periodically (at least half-yearly) by the
Audit and Compliance Committees of group companies that have such a body.
• On at least a half-yearly basis, it prepares a risk report for the Board of Directors.

Introduction to climate action
■ GRI 201-2 ■ SASB IF-EU-110a.3
Iberdrola, a global leader in the fight against climate change, firmly believes that the transition to a
carbon-neutral economy by 2050 is technologically possible, economically feasible and socially
necessary.
A common denominator of all of Iberdrola’s activities is the sustainable creation of value, in
accordance with its social dividend, in addition to the search for leadership. For this reason, in the
last two decades, Iberdrola has undertaken a commitment to lead the energy transition, through a
sustainable model executed with innovation, flexibility and efficiency in all of its business lines.
Anchored in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and the energy transition, Iberdrola’s climate
action Plan reflects the way in which the Group faces the energy transition based on its experience
in the renewable energy sector, maximising opportunities arising from climate change and
anticipating energy and innovation needs, while optimising resources and reducing the risks posed
by climate change in the areas in which the Group does business. Levers are established that drive
Iberdrola’s strategy towards the decarbonisation of the company and society, including related
metrics and targets, as well as potential financial impacts for the climate scenarios under analysis.
All of the foregoing is performed in accordance with recommendations of the "VI.7. TFCD content
index".
Climate action Plan
Iberdrola’s Climate Action Plan establishes an ambitious roadmap aimed at achieving zero net
emissions of CO equivalent by 2040. This Plan establishes the levers, actions and associated
2
metrics which in turn contribute to the decarbonisation of the economy as a whole, as well as the
values supporting it.
We believe that this aspiration will also promote the sustainable creation of value and is based on
the commitment to ensuring a positive contribution to nature and society, contributing to social and
economic development through the generation of jobs and wealth. This commitment was presented
at COP27, held in Egypt in November 2022.
Climate goals
Iberdrola updated its Strategic Prospects for 2025 and 2030 in 2022. The new investment plan
(focusing on renewables, smart grids and efficient storage), together with the investments already
made in recent years, has enabled the Group to increase the ambitiousness of its emissions-
reduction targets.
The commitment to accelerate the decarbonisation of the economy involves the maximum reduction
of each economic player’s direct emissions, as quickly as possible. Iberdrola supports immediate
action in the main climate forums: the planet cannot wait. For all these reasons, Iberdrola will use its
best efforts to achieve the emissions reduction that science demands of the electricity sector (for
Scopes 1 and 2) ten years before the required date (2040). In this way, Iberdrola aspires to
achieving carbon neutrality for its Scopes 1 and 2 by 2030, offsetting any residual emissions after
2030. Iberdrola follows the current fledgling methodological and market developments on the offset
of emissions, and a detailed market survey will be conducted to work under the highest quality
The ultimate aspiration of this commitment of the Iberdrola group is to achieve Net Zero emissions
by 2040. If this commitment is achieved, by 2039, the group’s absolute emissions will have been
reduced by 90% compared to 2020, and residual emissions will be neutralised.
Iberdrola undertakes to use its best efforts to achieve this commitment, for which purpose it will align
its strategy, investments, operations and public positioning therewith. In any case, Iberdrola is also
committed to facing the energy transition by ensuring the creation of value for its shareholders,
employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which it does business. The company
therefore reserves the ability to adjust its planning to successfully perform in significant material
aspects, such as the company value, quality of supply, social/labour conditions, and a fair transition.
Levers of the Action Plan
The actions identified to date to achieve this commitment are grouped into four main levers and one
cross-dimensional lever that spans all scopes:
a. Investment in 100% renewable technology generation, increasing storage capacity and
promoting new technologies (e.g., hybridisation).
b. Investment in 100% smart and robust grid operation as an essential pillar of a decarbonised
and electrified energy system.
c. Designing and offering customers green solutions that contribute to the electrification and
gradual decarbonisation of energy demand.
d. Green purchases through the acquisition of renewable energy for own consumption, on the
one hand, and the establishment of alliances and partnership agreements for joint reduction
of emissions and to speed up and facilitate the development of green products, on the other.
e. The promotion of partnerships in green technologies and decarbonisation.
These levers are supported by an ambitious investment plan and a strong network of partnerships,
which drive Iberdrola’s strategy towards the decarbonisation of the company and of society.
Investment plan
To meet the commitment set out in the Climate Action Plan, Iberdrola will continue to promote and
spearhead a business model and an investment plan fully integrated into a decarbonised future.
The 2023-2025 Iberdrola Strategic Plan commits €47,000 million up to 2025 in order to promote the
energy transition, with more than €27,000 million allocated to networks and investments and
€17,000 million in renewable energy, to deliver 52,000 MW of renewable installed capacity by the
end of the period (from ~40 GW in 2022), while increasing storage capacity to 102 GWh. In addition,
€3,000 million will be allocated to the development of green products providing added value to
customers. For private customers, proposals focus on solar self-consumption, electric mobility, and
green climate control. Industrial customers are offered plans for decarbonisation through climate
control and green hydrogen.
This plan reasserts the 2030 view driven by growth across all markets and the acceleration of
electrification. It is expected that by the end of the decade more than €65,000 million will have been
spent in grid assets and 80,000 MW of renewable installed capacity will have been created, thanks
to new investments between €65,000 and €75,000 million between 2026 and 2030.
In line with the investment plan, over the next years, €2,000 million euros are expected to be
invested through 2025 and €4,000 million through 2030, thus doubling R&D efforts by the end of the
decade, which will make it possible to continue to strengthen our model, promoting the development
of innovative and sustainable technologies.
Partnerships, global climate agenda, and awareness-raising
Our aspirations are supported by a strong network of partnerships to promote decarbonisation. In
keeping with its strategy, Iberdrola supports ambitious approaches in the framework of its climate
policies and the establishment of plans and objectives. Through partnerships, statements and
campaigns, Iberdrola also publicly supports ambitious and robust frameworks to face the current
challenges as regards climate, energy, environmental and other issues, seeking to generate value
and prosperity for society as a whole. In this context, there is a need for all players to be aligned with
and committed to the fight against climate change, which makes awareness-raising among society a
key.
Iberdrola is an active participant, with a high degree of visibility, in the main milestones of the
multilateral climate agenda, participating in a large number of technical seminars and high-level
conferences. Iberdrola wants to actively and decisively contribute to a sustainable, low-carbon future
– an effort that will also promote social and economic development through the creation of
employment and wealth. To this end, the Company is committed to conducting its policy-impacting
activities within its areas of influence and alliances in which it participates, in line with the objectives
of the Paris Agreement.
Hence, Iberdrola has played an important role in the inauguration of and parallel events at meetings
of the United Nations General Assembly and the various editions of New York Climate Week, climate
conferences such as the European Green Growth Summit and the 2022 Green Growth Forum, as
well as at the multilateral meetings organised by the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Iberdrola also belongs to various international coalitions, backs diverse external initiatives and
cooperates with numerous international organisations, business and/or multi-actor coalitions, think
tanks and research centres, supporting ambitious global climate action.
Iberdrola has been a member of the UN Global Compact since 2002, and it has belonged to the Red
Española del Pacto Mundial since 2004, as a founding member. Through this membership, Iberdrola
has assumed, inter alia, the commitment to implement the Ten Principles and to promote the 2030
Agenda, contributing to the attainment and dissemination of the SDGs. The company has been
identified as a LEAD company on numerous occasions, owing to its high levels of commitment to the
principles of the Global Compact, and it has been at the forefront of the climate action platform since
its inception in 2016, and which has focused this year on working on a fair transition thinklab as a
forum for collaboration and to drive climate action from an inclusive point of view and create value
for society as a whole.
Iberdrola has been one of the companies most intensely involved in the successive Conferences of
Parties (CoPs) on Climate Change, organised by the UNFCCC on an annual basis. At COP27 held
in Sharm el-Sheikh in November 2022, Iberdrola was an official partner of the main business
alliance on climate, We Mean Business, worked with the United Nations on organising a high-level
event at its pavilion, and played a leading role, organising more than 10 high-level events with more
than 60 impactful presentations at the principal meetings and events.
Iberdrola is very actively involved in the We Mean Business initiative through its support for specific
campaigns, including the implementation of initiatives in Spain to promote climate action among
small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME Climate Hub). As part of the New York Climate Week,
We Mean Business mentioned Iberdrola as a leading company in climate action thanks to its
contribution to a more sustainable energy model, placing it at the head of the ‘4A’s’ (Ambition,
Action, Advocacy y Accountability) campaign.
As part of the coexistence between renewable energy and the preservation of biodiversity, as well as
its contribution to social and economic development, Iberdrola forms part of CLEANAction (Coalition
Linking Energy and Nature for Action), founded by BirdLife International, WWF, IRENA and The
Nature Conservancy, among others.
Iberdrola is also part of Race to Zero, a global alliance promoted by the High Level Climate
Champions and the United Nations, bringing together companies, governments and various players
in civil society committed to reaching a zero net emissions future no later than by mid-century.
One of the most prominent initiatives in which Iberdrola takes part is the Alliance of CEO Climate
Leaders, a part of the World Economic Forum platform. This is a global community of CEOs who
support and promote action to achieve the transition to a net zero emissions economy. Iberdrola’s
chairman, Ignacio Galán, has joined this alliance along with 70 other business leaders in various
industries and regions.
Another noteworthy initiative is the Corporate Leaders Group, a business alliance with broad
recognition in Europe and internationally for spearheading the most ambitious stances on climate
policies, in which Iberdrola actively participates at all levels, holding the vice presidency.
Iberdrola has also been a member, since its inception, of the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), a
coalition of governments, regions and companies focused on promoting the shutdown of coal within
the framework of a fair transition to a clean energy model. Here, with a broader approach to a just
transition, it has contributed to the creation of the collaborative platform promoted by BSR and
BTEAM called Energy for a Just Transition.
Industry campaigns, which contribute to sending a signal of demand for green products, and which
thus have a driving effect on the various players in the supply chain, include its joining the SteelZero
initiative of The Climate Group, which brings together organisations committed to speeding up the
transition to a net zero steel industry, in 2022.
Along these lines, Iberdrola was the first Spanish company to adhere to the EV100 initiative,
intended to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, as Iberdrola has made a commitment to
electrify its entire vehicle fleet and to facilitate recharging by its employees in Spain and the United
Kingdom by 2030.
Iberdrola’s support for the “Leadership for Net Zero” project of the Madrid Club, to highlight the role
of democratic leadership in the fight against climate change, has played an important role in
reinforcing multilateral dialogue for climate action.
In 2022, within the framework of COP27 and the main international climate milestones, Iberdrola has
joined in important declarations, alliances and campaigns, including the following:
• 1.5°C Business Sign-on Statement at COP27, promoted by the We Mean Business
Coalition to reaffirm the commitment and maintain efforts to limit the rise in temperature to
1.5°C, reducing global emissions by half by 2030.
• Global wind energy manifestoGlobal wind energy manifesto for COP27 of GWEC,
released beforehand in September, signed by more than 100 leading companies in wind
energy, asking the signatories of the Paris Agreement to optimise planning and permits,
update grid infrastructure, and develop energy markets to accelerate the deployment of
renewable energy.
• World Economic Forum (WEF) letter in support of ambitious frameworks for climate policies:
Open Letter for world of the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders at the United Nations
Climate Change Conference (COP27).
• COP27 Action Declaration on climate policy engagement promoted by Corporate
Knights in support of ambitious climate policy frameworks to reduce emissions by half by
2030 and achieve the net zero global goal by 2050.
Iberdrola also supported the Green Jobs for Youth initiative, promoted in partnership with the
International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), seeking to promote the creation of green jobs
among young people.
IBERDROLA UNICEF Alliance
Iberdrola has entered into an alliance of great social impact with UNICEF to promote education and
employment for vulnerable young people, as part of the opportunities offered by the energy
transition and climate action, both in Spain and at the international level.
In Spain, Iberdrola promotes the alliance by contributing our knowledge, experience, innovation,
financial resources, human resources and the involvement of our value chain. To this end, Iberdrola
designs training itineraries of a high technical quality in the various areas of the green economy and,
together with social entities supporting the young people, it develops their abilities to obtain
internships and/or employment within our value chain.
At the international level, Iberdrola supports Learning Passport, UNICEF’s global education platform,
and supports projects in Somalia and Brazil. In Brazil, with the 1 Million Opportunities (1MiO)
programme for the inclusion of vulnerable adolescents and young people in the job market,
promoting young people’s skills, work opportunities, and green jobs, particularly in the Semiarid and
Amazon regions. In Somalia, with the UPSHIFT Social Innovation programme, which seeks to train
children in innovation and entrepreneurship so that they can develop social-impact projects to help
their communities. In the Learning Passport programme, which provides ongoing access to quality
education, Iberdrola provides content on climate change to create opportunities for children and
young people so they can learn about and become committed to climate action
Climate action values
Due to its cross-dimensional nature, the Climate Action Plan is based on the aspiration of making
climate action compatible with the general social interest and contributing to sustainable
development, so as to contribute to building an energy model in harmony with nature and human
beings.
Iberdrola’s “Convive” programme is a clear example of this ambition, as it brings together all
initiatives and alliances that create bridges for energy transition in harmony with nature and with
people.
Positive for society
In supporting energy transition and the green economy, Iberdrola is committed to a just and inclusive
transition, promoting economic and industrial development, as well as universal access to
competitive energy.
Thus it becomes an economic and industrial driver, encouraging the creation of new business lines
and industries of the future, contributing to the strength of the industrial fabric and to the creation of
new jobs connected to the green economy.
The Iberdrola UNICEF alliance described above is an example of an initiative seeking to promote
training and employment.
Iberdrola is also aware that the transition toward a decarbonised model will entail structural changes
with a strong impact on certain regions, areas and groups. So that no one is to be left behind, this
transition must be fair and inclusive.
On this path, Iberdrola is part of the Agreement for a just transition for coal power plants: jobs,
industry and territories, along with the Ministry for Ecological Transition, Ministry of Labour and
Social Economy, other companies that own coal-fired thermal power plants in Spain, and union
organisations, assuming the commitments established for fulfilling the 2015 Paris Agreement and
the Energy and Climate Strategic Framework in its Fair Transition Strategy. This strategy promotes
ensuring that workers and territories make the most of the transition opportunities and minimise the
negative impacts thereof through support and recovery measures
This year, Iberdrola has continued to work on the open innovation platform launched in 2020 to
channel entrepreneurship initiatives that serve as to accelerate the processes for collaboration
between citizens, public entities and companies in the regions where Spanish coal plants have been
shut down, Lada and Velilla. This innovative tool promotes the generation of knowledge among the
parties involved, actively seeking interests and synergies so as to tackle the specific demographic
and economic challenges of each area. This initiative follows the principles, methodologies and
goals established by the European Commission for a new European “Green Deal”, which assign
Spain a number of specific objectives and resources. It is based on listening and co-creation
methods, which are the basis for the development of a portfolio of social and economic development
initiatives at 5 different levels of action: (1) community initiatives, (2) social entrepreneurship
projects, (3) large-scale public-private actions, (4) new public services, and (5) experimentation in
new regulations.
General objectives
• To accompany the closure of Iberdrola’s plants in Lada and Velilla with a process to identify
new social and economic opportunities for these areas.
• Promoting new initiatives associated with the SDGs in the area.
• Offering a space for advanced experimentation for the European Commission’s Green Deal
strategy in Spain
Specific objectives
• Designing, implementing, and assessing an open innovation platform as an instrument of
intervention for the closure of first-generation thermal plants.
• Promoting a portfolio of innovation projects directly associated with the aspirations of local
citizens.
• Creating a network of public and private players associated with the platform to work as an
open innovation platform.
• Identifying a set of principles, criteria and methodologies for the transformation of territories
facing the closure of polluting energy plants (fair transition processes).
• Attracting potential financing partners for this type of process.
Work on the Platform is expected to be completed in 2023, when a detailed study of the impact on
the area will be conducted.
Iberdrola is also accelerating universal access to competitive energy as a lever for human and
economic development. As part of the Electricity for All Programme, the goal is to provide electricity
to 16 million persons who currently lack it by 2030. It also attends to customers who are
economically disadvantaged or in any other situation of vulnerability, establishing specific
procedures of protection and collaborating in providing ongoing access to energy supply in
accordance with the policies established by the competent government authorities in each case.
Positive for nature
Climate action is supported by a strong commitment to the protection of nature, jointly tackling the
threefold environmental crisis (climate, biodiversity and overexploitation of resources) that we are
facing.
Iberdrola interacts with different ecosystems and species in various geographic areas. Aware of the
urgent need to stop and reverse the unprecedented loss of biodiversity denounced by the scientific
community, Iberdrola has strengthened its commitment to the protection of and action for biodiversity
and nature with the 2030 Biodiversity Plan, which applies to the entire Iberdrola group and sets out
its commitment to have a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2030. Along these lines, the
Iberdrola 2020-2030 Trees Programme has the goal of planting 20 million trees by 2030, and it is
estimated that it will contribute to the capture of up to 6 MtCO2eq in 30 years, a clear example of a
project that makes it possible to achieve this twofold goal of leading change and generating a
positive impact. More information can be found in the "Objectives and Biodiversity Plan 2030".
Iberdrola also supports a circular economy model encompassing the entire value chain within
Iberdrola’s boundary and including both internal actions (optimisation and improvement) and driving
actions, in relation to both suppliers and customers. The greatest lever to promote the circular
economy is currently the reduction in the use of fossil fuel thanks to the goals of deploying
renewable technology.
For example, in 2022, Iberdrola, through its PERSEO programme and FCC Ámbito, a subsidiary of
FCC Servicios Medio Ambiente, launched EnergyLOOP to lead the recycling of components of
renewable facilities, one of the greatest medium- and long-term challenges in the sector. This
initiative will also contribute to the energy transition and to boost the circular economy in Spain.
More information can be found in the “Innovation and digital transformation projects” section.
Climate governance
Iberdrola was a pioneer in establishing the fight against climate change as a priority in the
Corporate Governance System, now the Governance and Sustainability System. The first policy
relating to the measures taken by the Company was approved in 2009. The Climate Action Policy
establishes the framework for Iberdrola’s strategy and business model in the fight against climate
change, which is in line with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. Through this policy,
Iberdrola is committed to continue assuming a leadership position (directly and by establishing
partnerships), promoting awareness (impacts, challenges and benefits of its achievement) and
contributing to a carbon-neutral and sustainable future.
Iberdrola’s principles of conduct include implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force
on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and of other leading organisations for identifying
and reporting long-term risks relating to climate change. Along these lines, Iberdrola was one of the
first companies to publicly commit to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). For this purpose, the company created an internal
multidisciplinary working group in 2017 to coordinate all the work performed in this area.
So as to be always focused on the best compliance with and implementation of the policies, the
Company has several corporate bodies and internal committees that ensure the monitoring of
those policies. The amendment of the By-Laws approved by the shareholders in June 2021
formalises the obligation of the Board of Directors to approve, supervise and regularly report on
the Climate Action Plan. This Statement of Non-Financial Information is the instrument through
which the Company and its Board of Directors fulfil this obligation.
In line with the need for professionalisation, diversification and qualification on relevant topics, the
Board has a training and refresher programme for its members, the topics of which include
decarbonisation and the fight against climate change. In 2022, there were a total of 8 meetings to
discuss topics pertaining to climate change within the corporate decision-making of Iberdrola, S.A. In
particular, the directors of Innovation and Sustainability and of Climate Change and Alliances met on
a recurring basis with the Sustainable Development Committee, and the director of Risk and Internal
Assurance met with the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee. Both environmental risks and the
risks associated with climate change were discussed at these meetings, as were the corresponding
alert mechanisms to properly monitor them. The Sustainable Development Committee was also
presented at several meetings with the proposed amendment to the Climate Action Plan, which was
ultimately approved by the Board of Directors in October 2022. Finally, the programme for the
information and training of the Board of Directors and its committees also considered this matter last
year, for these purposes including the preparation of a training document for the Board of Directors
in relation to the technologies available in the context of the energy transition, and a physical
meeting was held with the Sustainable Development Committee on innovation and major elements
for better climate change governance.
In turn, the remuneration structure for executive directors and the management team takes
into account economic/financial, operational and sustainability aspects. A long-term remuneration
plan (2020-2022 Strategic Bonus) was approved in April 2020. This plan sets out parameters
relating to the Sustainable Development Goals, such as reducing the average intensity of CO
2
emissions and increasing the number of suppliers subject to sustainable development standards,
among others (see additional details in the "Remuneration policy" section under "Corporate
Governance").
More detailed information can be found in Section "I.2. Governance and Sustainability System",
as well as the following link: Governance and Sustainability System.
The group is exposed to various risks inherent in the different countries, industries and markets in
which it operates, and the activities it performs, and which may prevent it from achieving its
objectives and implementing its strategies. The Company’s Board of Directors, being aware of the
importance of this aspect, is committed to fully developing its abilities to ensure that the significant
risks of all of the group’s activities and businesses, including the risks of climate change, are
adequately identified, measured, managed, and controlled.
Management of climate opportunities and risks
Climate change is a systemic, global risk, and one of the global crises faced by Humanity.
Companies should contribute to the fight against this risk through actions to mitigate climate change,
reducing their emissions and decarbonising their business model; as well as acting against the
impacts of climate change, improving their adaptation and resilience. Climate change poses various
risks, with increasing long-term impacts that, to a greater or lesser degree, may not be considered
new risks for the sector. Climate change accelerates the existing risks set out in the Iberdrola
group’s risk catalogue (see General Risk Control and Management Policy) ), which are
therefore monitored. They may be classified as:
• Physical, stemming from possible material impacts on the facilities and the supply chain as a
result of effects of the future evolution of climate variables (higher temperatures, rising sea
levels, changes in precipitation patterns, increased extreme weather events in terms of both
frequency and intensity, etc.). Based on TCFD nomenclature, a distinction is made between
acute risks and chronic risks.
• Transition, associated with all the risks that can appear in the gradual global decarbonisation
process, such as regulatory changes, market, technological and reputational risks,
grievances (such as for deficient reporting), changes in demand, etc.
• Other risks may arise as a result of these risks, including those relating to deterioration in the
credit of counterparties (suppliers, banks, others), social phenomena (humanitarian crises,
impacts on crops and fishing, refugee crises, epidemics) and greater competition for financial
resources.
The identification, analysis and management of the risks arising from climate change are addressed
through a multi-departmental focus, with cooperation between corporate and business functions.
Iberdrola faces climate change risks from a favourable position, as it has:
a. Extensive experience in the management of risks accelerated by climate change, both
physical (at the operational level) and transitional (such as regulatory and market risks).
b. Financial strength.
c. A diversified business (from the business, geographic and technological standpoint), with low
exposure to gas assets and no coal plants.
For more information on Iberdrola’s risks, as well as its governance, identification and monitoring
systems, see the “Long-term risks and opportunities. Comprehensive Risk System" of this
report, the Climate Change Risks section of the Management Report of the Consolidated
Annual Financial Report 2022, Section E of the Annual Corporate Governance Report 2022

Identification and evaluation of the opportunities and risks of transition
The main risks of transition, such as regulatory and market risks, require a management approach
that is generally national in nature. This is because of the crucial influence of governments and
regulators on the structure and operation of markets and public utility sectors. The physical risks to
facilities and their operation require global management, applying best practices and selecting the
appropriate technologies: Iberdrola’s growth, through strong development of renewable energy and
flexible and smart grids, is an example of this.
Iberdrola has been a pioneer in promoting renewable energy and fighting climate change, and has
achieved a leadership position allowing it to benefit from opportunities and anticipate the potential
risks of transition, such as those included in the following table, thus actively contributing to global
decarbonisation.
Analysis of transition scenarios
The new strategic plan for the 2022-2025 period, internally updating forecasts to 2030, was
published in 2022. The risks and opportunities of various climate transition scenarios in the short,
medium, and long term were analysed within this framework.
Iberdrola has analysed risks and opportunities in different scenarios since 2018. Working groups
were expanded in 2022 to increase the involvement of the countries in which the Iberdrola Group
has a presence. This has strengthened and homogenised the internal tools that support compliance
with national regulations on TCFD reporting.
Benchmark scenarios
During the last year, specific transition scenarios were built, adjusted on the basis of benchmark
scenarios, considering the specificities of each geographic area in which the Iberdrola group has a
presence. Elements from international and regional public scenarios as well as other internal
regional considerations were included. The goal was to formulate them at a scale suitable to the
businesses of the Group.
Three transition scenarios were considered for the analysis of risks and opportunities. A baseline
scenario, in line with the group’s strategic forecasts, and two alternative scenarios, for which the
potential risks and opportunities by comparison to the baseline scenario were assessed:
• FOCUS ON ENERGY TRANSITION (FET)_This is the baseline scenario, based mainly on the
forecasts made in the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) published by the International
Energy Agency in the Word Energy Outlook (WEO ’21), and is in line with the Paris goals.
Iberdrola’s strategy has been consistent with this scenario in recent years, and it continued to
be in force during the work to prepare for Capital Markets Day (held on 9 November 2022). Two
more recently published scenarios were also taken into account to establish this baseline
scenario: the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) (WEO ‘22) and the Consumer Transformation
Scenario (CT) published by the National Grid in the Future Energy Scenarios set (FES ‘22). The
APS scenario assumes that all the aspirational goals announced by governments, including
energy access and long-term net zero goals, will be met on time and in full. If implemented on
time and in full, a temperature increase of about 1.7º C in the APS by 2100 would be
maintained. The UK CT scenario is based on a high level of electrification, arising from
customers’ willingness to change behaviour, high efficiency and improved demand flexibility.
• SLOWER TRANSITION SCENARIO: this scenario considers a slowdown in fulfilling more
ambitious commitments or potential breaches of commitments made. As a result, global
warming would be limited to less than 2º. This scenario is based on the forecast published by
WEO22 for the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which shows the trajectory of the policies
currently approved. Regional scenarios like the Falling short Scenario (FS) published by
National Grid (FES 2022), which involves not reaching Net Zero in the United Kingdom by 2050,
have also been combined.
• FASTER TRANSITION SCENARIO: this third scenario considers more optimistic and ambitious
hypotheses, based on the estimates in the Net Zero Scenario (NZ) (WEO2022), which
describes a way to globally achieve stabilisation of a 1.5º C increase in global average
temperatures, together with universal access to modern energy by 2030. It is also based on the
regional projections made by National Grid for its accelerating decarbonisation scenario,
combining increased consumer commitment with significant great technological and investment
advances, called the Leading the Way Scenario (LW) (FES 2022).
2023 - 2025 period
The short term is described by the period covered by the Strategic Plan published by Iberdrola at
Capital Markets Day 2022, which updates the group’s strategy describing the opportunities for
growth identified for the next 3 years. In this Plan, Iberdrola reaffirms its strategy for growth based
on smart grids and renewable energy, optimising the implementation of its project portfolio in a
complex macroeconomic context. The key risk-inducing variables are inflation, interest rates,
economic growth, commodity prices, exchange rates and regulation.
To minimise risks, Iberdrola opts for sustained investment in grids, in predictable frameworks with
incentives for investment. It provides for selective investment in renewables, ensuring the projects
with the best risk profile are chosen, seeking to build a portfolio with future growth and viable
alternatives. Priority is given to investment in financially appealing markets, with a high rating,
ambitious electrification goals, and regulatory stability. Iberdrola is committed to maintaining its
financial strength, always taking the social, environmental and governance pillars into account.
All of this allows for the affirmation that no significant risks arising from climate transition scenarios
other than the basic case in the short term have been observed, thanks to the resilience of the
business model and the strategy of the Iberdrola Group.
However, the exceptional situation arising from the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has led to the
implementation of various measures by governments, particularly in Europe, that might delay
progress towards a low-carbon economy (intervention in electricity markets, rate hikes, etc.) The
Iberdrola Group supports measures that provide a “green exit” from the crisis.
2025 - 2030 period
It is in the medium term that climate transition scenarios are a key tool for evaluating the impact of
climate change on the company and its current strategy. The analysis of the three scenarios
described for the 2025-2030 period is intended to identify the impacts and opportunities offered by
variations in key parameters in the energy sector and macroeconomic domain for the businesses
and geographic areas in which the Iberdrola Group has a presence. The key parameters in the
scenarios are linked to operational business indicators, such that changes therein have both positive
and negative impacts on the businesses. The levels of correspondence (medium or high) between
the main parameters examined in the climate scenarios and the key parameters of the group’s
businesses are specified below.
As discussed, the potential scenarios analysed by Iberdrola consider plausible projections made by
highly credible organisations, as well as internal assumptions based on the particularities of the
specific geographic areas in which Iberdrola has a presence within the countries. The regional
values of the parameters selected from each climate scenario have thus been specified. For
example, electricity demand could potentially be reduced by 18% in the Slower scenario, or increase
by 9% in the Faster scenario compared to the baseline scenario; as for renewable installed capacity,
potential reductions of up to 44% are projected in the Slower scenario, and increases of up to 33%
in the Faster scenario, in certain geographic areas to be analysed where the Group has a presence.
To conduct the analysis, the behaviour of the parameters most sensitive to potential changes in the
climate scenarios for each country was analysed, both in the main geographic areas in which the
group has a presence and in other high-activity countries as shown in the map below:
This analysis of scenarios has allowed for the identification of the main risks and opportunities by
business and geographic area, as well as the absence of significant impacts in some cases. The
table below provides a qualitative description of the trend of the most relevant operating indicators
for each business and geographic area under the two alternative scenarios.
The Slower scenario shows, in the mid-term, a slower speed in the increase in demand for
electricity and for the installation of new renewable generation, and a lower penetration of
generation in the mix with respect to the baseline scenario. There is also a smaller change in
consumers’ mindset, with the home gas consumption percentages remaining high and electricity
percentages remaining low. All of the foregoing is compared to the baseline scenario forecast by
Iberdrola for 2030. The main impacts on the group’s businesses and geographic areas are:
• Europe retail: due to the slower speed of electrification reached in this scenario, the
projections in the strategic plan for Europe might be negatively affected by a medium
magnitude.
• Spain and USA renewables: some of the developments currently forecast for 2030 would
slow down, and their implementation would be postponed due to the reduction in installed
renewable capacity compared to the projection in the base case for 2030.
• The impact on the USA and UK grids would be less significant: due to lower investment in
grids than forecast in the plan, as well as lower electrification for homes and vehicles.
• The rest of the businesses would maintain the expected growth rates.
In the Faster scenario, focusing on achieving net zero by 2050, the key indicators for the
decarbonisation scenarios, which are drivers for growth for Iberdrola’s businesses, would already be
strongly boosted by 2030. It must be supported by more ambitious commitments from countries and
the establishment of the regulatory frameworks and accelerated procedures required to meet this
goal. It will also require strengthening and ensuring the financial instruments for technological and
infrastructure deployment across all geographic areas. The following opportunities for Iberdrola
stand out:
• Spain, USA and IEI renewables: where the impacts could be very high if these more
ambitious increases in renewable energy are achieved, driven by European and American
commitments and policies. They would also generate significant opportunities in Australia
and new Asian countries.
• Spain, USA and UK networks: This is the scenario with the highest investment in renewables
and in transmission and distribution networks to accelerate the network reinforcement and
infrastructure improvement projects needed to ensure integration of the system and quality of
supply.
• No significant impacts on the rest of businesses are found, as the investments and
developments in the current plan are guaranteed.
The variations in the operating parameters described above have an impact on financial indicators
for the various businesses and geographic areas. The positive and negative impact on EBITDA with
respect to the expected data for 2030 in both transition scenario alternatives to the base case is
described below. By 2030 there could be more opportunities than risks overall, mainly driven by the
Group’s renewable businesses.
In the Slower scenario, the variations in the operating parameters identified above could have an
impact on the Iberdrola group’s businesses, reducing EBITDA by €100 million to €300 million in
2030, except for the Networks business , which would undergo an impact lower than €100 million. In
the Faster scenario, opportunities for growth are identified for the Networks businesses of €100
million to €300 million, and of more than €300 million for the Global Generation businesses, driven
by the results of the renewables business in Spain, the USA and IEI. Finally, smaller opportunities
could arise in the retail business, achieving slight improvements in EBITDA, estimated to be far
below €100 million.
The Net-Zero scenario has been evaluated assuming organic growth and a stable balance sheet
structure.
2030-2050 period
The projections of the key transition parameters become more uncertain in the long term. However,
the strengths of Iberdrola’s management of its strategy are always based on stable and sustained
growth in the geographic areas, with lower financial risks, greater regulatory stability, and assurance
of the Group’s profit. Thus, with the currently available projections, no significant risks to the
decarbonisation path being led by the Iberdrola Group in key geographic areas are expected. Any
opportunities that may emerge are expected to be significant, so Iberdrola continues to lead
investment, but also innovation and the promotion of new technologies, thus fostering global
progress in the industry as well as capitalising on new opportunities are they arise.
To conclude, the group’s current positioning, based on the levers of its action plan (see "Climate
Action Plan" section), places it in a favourable position to maximise opportunities and efficiently
face transition risks in the various climate scenarios analysed.
The group believes that the opportunities stemming from the decarbonisation of the global economy
(growth in renewables, investments in integrated smart grids, storage, electrification of industrial
sectors and transport, green energy, etc.) outweigh the risks.
Identification and evaluation of physical opportunities and risks
Physical risks arising from climate change are specific to each site, gradual, associated with each
technology, and occur over relatively long periods, although, as in the specific case of extreme
weather events, an increase in the frequency and intensity thereof can already be seen in the short
term.
Iberdrola monitors and manages physical risks arising from climate change through a permanent
climate science analysis process and applies it in the Company's usual procedures.
As part of the ongoing learning and knowledge improvement process, Iberdrola is part of the
International Energy Agency (IEA) working group on resilience for energy security, among other
initiatives. The Iberdrola Group has contributed with its review of and contributions to the Climate
Resilience for Energy Security’report, published in November 2022.
Analysis of physical scenarios
In 2022 Iberdrola applied its methodology to identify and assess physical impacts arising from
climate change in line with the requirements set out in the EU sustainable activities taxonomy.
Iberdrola has analysed the evolution of the main climate threats based on regionalised projections
obtained from leading climate tools in the various regions in which it operates, including Copernicus
(Europe), AdapteCCa (Spain), UK Climate Projections, the INPE platform (Brazil), etc. After a prior
analysis of the evolution of different climate variables in an RCP4.5 scenario7vs an RCP 8.5
scenario in the 2030-2050 time horizon, the conservative RCP 8.5 scenario was selected as the
baseline to identify and assess the main climate risks to the company’s various assets.
Taking the methodology defined by IPCC as a reference, the steps taken to identify the main
impacts, risks and associated opportunities were the following:
• Analysis of the sensitivity of each technology to the variations in the different climate
variables.
• Impact level based on the sensitivities and expected evolution of climate threats at the
regional level.
• Estimation of risk based on the presence of assets by technology in the different geographic
areas and the adaptive capacity thereof.
The assessment shows that many of the physical risks arising from climate change, both chronic
and extreme, affect usual business variables, and thus variables that are managed to a greater or
lesser extent in its usual operational processes. However, climate change will affect the probability of
occurrence of these risks and potentially the intensity thereof. As part of the analysis of the Group’s
various assets within the DNSH framework of adaptation to the EU taxonomy, extreme weather
events are identified as one of the main threats for the various technologies and jurisdictions.
The table below summarises, individually for the various technologies included in the taxonomy and
before considering their adaptive capacity/resilience, the estimated impact of the evolution of the
main climate variables and the presence (e.g., installed MW) in the various geographies. The impact
reflected is global by type of asset, resulting from the combination of the results obtained for the
different regions in which Iberdrola operates.
7The most recent IPCC report (AR6) includes a new set of illustrative scenarios of emissions that explore the climate response for a broad
range of emitters, soil uses and pollutants. The impact of the new scenarios on the evaluation of risks will be revised based on the

As can be seen in the table above, in terms of impact, extreme temperature and the associated
fires, strong winds and extreme precipitation, together with water scarcity, are some of the variables
that most affect the various assets of Iberdrola. It should be borne in mind, as mentioned above, that
this table shows global results that are the outcome of the analysis conducted within the EU
Taxonomy framework in each of the regions where Iberdrola operates.
The conclusions of this analysis and of the assessment of the adaptive capacity of the various
assets lay the basis for in-depth analysis of future physical risks, focusing in particular on those
geographies where significant potential impacts and a wide asset base are identified.
Based on the potential impact, the degree of resilience of the various assets of Iberdrola should be
considered to determine the risk level to which they are exposed. Iberdrola analyses the resilience
of the various business areas based on three key concepts for framing it: robustness (derived from
design and construction procedures), recovery (derived from early-detection tools and action
protocols) and adaptive capacity. Some of these measures are summarised in the table below by
way of example:

Risk management and resilience mechanisms
The group believes that the opportunities stemming from the decarbonisation of the global economy
(growth in renewables, investments in integrated smart grids, electrification of transport, green
energy, etc.) outweigh the risks.
In terms of physical risks, based on the impacts described in the previous sections (which consider
the current uncertainty associated with climate projections) and the mitigating factors considered, it
is estimated that the physical risks associated with climate change might not have a significant and
permanent impact on the group’s consolidated figures, which is believed to be globally resilient.
In terms of transition risks, the group’s current positioning as a result of its investment focus on grids
and renewable energy puts it in a favourable position for facing such risks.
To summarise, the group’s main risk management mechanisms, as well as its mitigating actions, are
listed below:
• Integration of climate change as a key management and corporate governance element.
• Many risks deriving from climate change affect the normal variables of the business, and,
consequently, variables already managed (to a greater or lesser degree) in the usual
operations of the businesses (e.g. redundancy of equipment, emergency plans, crisis plans,
digitalisation, line burying and meshing, etc.), which have management processes that
already contribute to climate resilience.
• The fact that many impacts are primarily medium/long-term means that, to a large extent, it is
the group’s future assets, rather than its current assets, that will bear the most severe
impacts, given that its assets are gradually renewed when they reach the end of their useful
life.
• Regulatory coverage in the Networks business.
• Insurance coverage.
• Diversification (geographic, by technology, age, etc.) of assets.
• Strong business model, with financial capacity.
• Partnering with other industry players and in the processes of acquiring knowledge from
climate science, as a key action to move forward in a cost-efficient manner in developing the
resilience of our activities.
• Innovation remains a strategic variable for the group.
• The consideration of climate change in decision-making on new investments.
Climate change and new investments
Under the philosophy of continuous improvement, and in line with the Board of Directors’ commitment to facing the risks of
climate change, the Group’s Investment Policy establishes the need to conduct a specific analysis of these risks in the
construction dossiers, on which investment decisions on new assets (“FID”, in international terminology) are based.
Given that the networks businesses are built around multi-annual reviews and that future investments in thermal power plants
will be quite small, it has been considered appropriate to focus the analysis on new onshore wind and photovoltaic facilities.
Based on the experience gained, the model will be expanded in the future to include offshore wind farms.
The model, promoted by several corporate divisions with the help of Renewables, has been constructed on the basis of a
survey. This document must be completed by the Business (from a technical perspective), taking into account the particularities
of each site, as well as climate projections from various sources, with different levels of granularity and time frames, which are
made available to the Business specifically for each project.
Based on the survey, appropriate conclusions are drawn and included in the Investment Dossier. The analyses conducted in
2022 within the EU Taxonomy framework will serve to improve the survey.
However, as part of Iberdrola’s philosophy of constant improvement and taking into account the
evolution of the science (new projections, more powerful tools, etc.), the markets and applicable law,
as well as demands from society, the company must continue advancing and analysing the potential
risks, both physical (associated with specific facilities) as well as transitional, and continue to
strengthen the inclusion of the climate change variable within the various process of the Company
and project phases.
Indicators and metrics
Iberdrola includes major indicators in this document to report on aspects relating to climate and to
the strategy of the fight against climate change, which are key for the constant monitoring of the
strategy's resilience in view of the scenarios analysed. In particular, these indicators include the
greenhouse gas emissions inventory, the intensity of emissions, reduction targets, the use of energy,
energy intensity, the energy mix, renewable installed capacity, water use, source of water, R&D and
Capex in the development of low-emission products, services and/or technology.
Iberdrola believes that consistent and improved disclosure of the financial risks relating to climate
change will allow for the establishment of a constructive and well-informed dialogue between
investors and companies regarding the opportunities and risks relating to their activities.
In addition, for information on the company’s actions to mitigate and adapt to the consequences of
climate change, see the “Management of climate opportunities and risks section" of this chapter
as well as the specific Leading the fight against climate change section of the website.
Other aspects associated with the energy transition
Demand-side management
■ GRI 201-2
As part of its demand-side management programmes, Iberdrola’s main objective is to improve
energy efficiency and the smart use of active electrical grids to thus contribute to the more efficient
use thereof by consumers and thereby reduce CO emissions and contribute to the fight against
2
climate change.
The types of actions taken include those relating to information, training and the provision of
solutions and technologies that help consumers improve energy efficiency and reduce the
environmental impact of their energy habits and consumption. Iberdrola engages in demand-side
management in all of its geographic areas and for its various types of customers.
The main activities performed are broken down separately due to the unique nature and law of each
country or market.
Iberdrola offers home energy management services through internet-connected devices that allow
customers to better manage their electricity consumption and thus obtain energy savings (range of
Smart Home products). The industrial and commercial sectors also have initiatives to diagnose and
propose measures for energy savings and to improve energy efficiency, like photovoltaic solar
energy installation, electromobility, efficient lighting, efficient air conditioning, optimisation of heating
and cooling processes, etc.
■ SASB IF-EU-420a.2
The percentage of the electricity served through the group’s smart grids is close to 100 % in Spain,
above 55 % in the United States8 and 48 % in the United Kingdom.
Availability and reliability
The companies of the Iberdrola group have no direct responsibility for long-term production capacity
planning processes, or on the respective electricity systems connecting that capacity, in the
countries in which they operate.
Government authorities conduct studies to anticipate the long-term needs of the respective
electricity system, and Iberdrola’s companies act as market agents, making investment decisions
consistent with their business plans.
Fuel
A key element in managing the availability of electricity service is the supply of the necessary fuel.
Iberdrola is supplied through short- and medium-term gas contracts and purchases on wholesale
markets, adjusting to the needs of each territory. It also ensures that it has a stable, long-term and
low-risk supply of nuclear fuel.
Nuclear plant decommissioning
Iberdrola is the only 100%-owner of a nuclear plant in Spain (Cofrentes). It also has interests in
Almaraz I and II (52.69%), Trillo (49%), Vandellós II (28%) and Ascó II (15%), as indicated in the
"Scope of information section".
According to Law 25/1964 on nuclear energy, the management of radioactive waste, including spent
nuclear fuel, and the decommissioning and closing of nuclear plants, is an essential public service
reserved to the State, pursuant to Article 128.2 of the Spanish Constitution. This law entrusts
Empresa Nacional de Residuos Radiactivos S.A. (Enresa) with the management of this public
service. Therefore, in accordance with the sixth General Radioactive Waste Plan (Plan General de
Residuos Radiactivos) (PGRR) currently in effect, the State assumes ownership of the radioactive
waste and is responsible for the monitoring that may be required after the closure of a nuclear plant,
once the period established in the relevant closure declaration has passed.
Enresa prepares the PGRR, which, together with the corresponding economic/financial study, is the
basic reference document setting forth the strategies to be followed and activities to be carried out in
Spain in the fields of radioactive waste management and plant decommissioning. The PGRR is sent
to the Ministry of Ecological Transition in Demographic Challenge every four years, or whenever so
required by the Ministry, for approval by the Council of Ministers after a report of the Nuclear Safety
Council, after hearing from the Autonomous Communities with respect to territorial and
environmental ordinances. The first PGRR was adopted in 1987, and the sixth, approved in June
2006, is currently in force.
The financing system in Spain for PGRR activities is based on contributions from waste-generating
entities and is known as the “Fund for the Financing of the General Radioactive Waste Plan
Activities”. The fund is managed by Enresa and includes provisions for the decommissioning of
nuclear power plants.
8 In the case of Brazil as at the closing date, information was not available on the same basis to report this indicator according to the
Iberdrola makes contributions to the fund through a fee calculated by Enresa and approved by the
government, which covers all expenses relating to managing the spent fuel and the radioactive
waste generated at its plants, as well as those corresponding to the decommissioning and closure
thereof, as provided in the PGRR.
Iberdrola also records a reserve on its balance sheet to cover the pre-decommissioning stage of its
nuclear power plants. Pre-decommissioning refers to the period from the final cessation of
operations of the plant until the decommissioning approval, at which time ownership of the plant is
transferred to Enresa. The current sixth PGRR establishes a period of 3 years for this stage.
In March 2019, Iberdrola signed a protocol agreement for the closure of the nuclear plants between
2025 and 2035. This protocol includes the schedule for a gradual, orderly closure of the reactors
making up the nuclear installations in Spain.
I.4. Our ESG+F proposal
• ESG+F Goals: The sustainability roadmap
• Iberdrola’s contribution to the SDGs
• Our main focus: SDGs 7 and 13
ESG + F Goals: The sustainability roadmap
The group’s Strategic Plan 2023-2025 integrates ESG issues within strategy and operations, thus
constituting a key reference point for long-term planning.
These issues are based on three key factors:the corporate purpose that structures the company’s
positioning, stakeholders’ expectations, and finally the demands of the capital markets,
represented by the ESG indices and ratings, voting policies, and institutional investor alliances.
These factors are included in the materiality analysis reflected on the preceding page.
Iberdrola’s commitment to sustainable development, the social dividend, and the generation
of value shared with all stakeholders is reflected in multiple indicators that make it possible to
measure the positive impact generated by the group; such as, for example, a contribution to GDP of
more than €33,000 million per year and the creation of more than 400,000 jobs globally.
In addition, Iberdrola’s capacity to create value is reflected in the way in which the group conducts its
operations, seeking the maximisation of positive impacts and the avoidance and mitigation of
negative ones.
Iberdrola’s commitment to the creation of value materialised in 2020 with the launch of its
Sustainable Development Plan 2020-2022, “Energy to Advance”, a roadmap with goals defined
around the group’s environmental, social and governance priorities. The current market context, with
ever increasing investor scrutiny of the company’s ESG and ever more demanding regulations,
requires reviewing these goals, aligning them with best market practices, and ensuring that they are
sufficiently ambitious to anticipate the various Stakeholders’ demands and to ensure that Iberdrola
maintains its current shared leadership position.
The company updated this roadmap in November 2022, publishing an ambitious set of goals that
have a positive impact on all its stakeholders. Iberdrola thus reasserts its determination to be an
active player in the creation of a more sustainable and inclusive energy model for future
generations, maintaining its recognition as the leading utility in ESG.
In environmental terms, the goal is to continue to contribute to the creation of an energy system in
harmony with nature and human beings, facing the threefold environmental challenge of the fight
against climate change, the preservation of biodiversity, and the circularity of resources.
In social terms, the company continues to focus on maximising its positive impact through the
generation of quality jobs, focusing on diversity, safety, health and education; on improving the
products and services offered to our customers; on creating a responsible value chain; and on
developing the communities in which we do business.
In terms of governance, the goal is to maintain robust corporate governance and compliance
standards, continually revised and evaluated to ensure their adaptation to the context, regulations
and best market practices.
ESG issues are thus integrated throughout the company’s operations, as well as within the
company's financial strategy and objectives. Iberdrola has provided the market with a recurring flow
of green and sustainable financial instruments for years, and it intends to continue to issue the
majority of its financing under green or sustainable standards.
All this has given rise to 39 global goals included in the following table.
Iberdrola’s contribution to the SDGs
As a result of the continuing dialogue with its Stakeholders, and aware of the unquestionable
economic, social and environmental impact of all its activities, Iberdrola has a sustainable
development strategy aligned with the group’s implementation of a business plan focused on the
sustainable creation of value, primarily based on its Purpose and Values, and respect for human
rights. Thus, it promotes initiatives that contribute to bringing about a more just, equal and healthy
society, and, in particular, to achieving the SGDs, notably those relating to Affordable and clean
energy (SDG 7) and Climate action (SDG 13), through specific lines of action focused on universal
access (SDG 7.1), increasing renewable energy (SDG 7.2) and developing measures to improve
energy efficiency (SDG 7.3) using tools such as fostering innovation (SDG 9), education (SDG 4),
protection of biodiversity (SDG 15), gender equality (ODS 5) in particular, and reduced inequalities
(SDG 10) in general, which essentially entails protecting disadvantaged groups. Iberdrola defends
the role played by the SDGs and Agenda 2030 as a global social compact, because global problems
such as climate change and the pandemic call for global solutions and agreements.
Iberdrola has linked its business and sustainability strategy to the Sustainable Development Goals
(ODS) since they were set in 2015, and in 2018 it approved an update of its Corporate Governance
System, which was mainly intended to formalise the Iberdrola group’s commitment to the SDGs,
underscoring the group’s contribution to achieving them with the social dividend generated through
its business activity.
In December 2020 Iberdrola reformulated its Governance and Sustainability System structuring it
around ESG standards aligned with its sustainable development strategy and its social dividend,
which cemented the company’s position at the forefront of best international corporate governance
practices.
The SDGs thus inspired or are included as a fundamental element in the following areas:
• By-Laws
• Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group y Code of Ethics
• Environmental policies.
• Social commitment policies.
• Policies and rules relating to Corporate Governance..
Ultimately, this is an attempt to see that all Stakeholders participate in the social dividend generated
by the company’s activities, or shared value, which is the sum of all the economic, social and
environmental impacts that a company generates through its activity, within the environment in
which it does business.
The General Sustainable Development Policy introduces the principles governing the various
corporate policies relating to sustainable development. Section I.3 "Policies and commitments" se
describes the content and focus of these policies.
The company’s commitment to contribute to the SDGs is supervised by its governance bodies.
Thus, the Sustainable Development Committee of the Board (the composition and duties of which
are described in the “Corporate Governance” section of chapter IV.2), is vested with the power to,
among other things, “Monitor the group’s contribution to the achievement of the SDGs”.
Our main focus: SDGs 7 and 13
Iberdrola focuses its efforts on the SDGs where its contribution is most significant: the supply of
affordable and non-polluting energy (Goal 7) and climate action (Goal 13). This commitment forms
part of its governance model and of the sustainable management of the company, and is formalised
in objectives tied to the remuneration of the management team: the shareholders at the 2017
General Shareholders’ Meeting approved a long-term incentive plan linked to their contribution to the
achievement of these two goals. At the 2020 General Shareholders’ Meeting, the Board of Directors
approved a new long-term remuneration plan (Strategic Bonus 2020-2022) linked to both economic/
financial performance (changes in Net Profit, Financial Strength and Total Shareholder Return) and
the contribution to the UN 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. In relation to the latter point, these
objectives refer to the fight against climate change, the drive for sustainability in the supply chain
and the commitment to equal pay for men and women, which contribute to SDGs 3, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14
and 15.
The table below summarises how the company contributes to achieving these goals and their
associated targets.

II. Environmental
Iberdrola has always had a firm commitment to the environment, focusing its activities on the
construction of an energy model in harmony with nature and with human beings, in which the
reduction of emissions, the conservation, protection and promotion of biodiversity, and the
sustainable and efficient use of resources are integrated into all its activities and processes.
At the operational level, the decarbonisation of the company’s activities is associated with the start-
up and operation of emissions-free power generation facilities as well as supplementary initiatives
like the replacement of equipment using ozone layer-reducing substances, the operation of almost
980,000 m2 of offices and work centres in accordance with the highest sustainability and efficiency
standards, and the gradual replacement of the group’s fleet, which currently has more than 13,500
industrial vehicles, by an emissions-free fleet. Along these lines, Iberdrola was the first Spanish
company to join the EV100 initiative, intended to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, as
Iberdrola has made a commitment to electrify its entire vehicle fleet and to facilitate recharging by its
employees in Spain and the United Kingdom by 2030.
The reduction of indirect emissions is also implemented through Iberdrola’s commitment to the
supply of green energy, products and services to its customers and the gradual decarbonisation of
its supply chain. To this end, in 2022 it joined the SteelZero initiative of The Climate Group, which
brings together organisations committed to speeding up the transition to a Net Zero steel industry.
Climate action is supported by a strong commitment to the protection of nature, jointly tackling the
threefold environmental crisis (climate, biodiversity and overexploitation of resources).
Efficient use of natural resources to approach the energy transition is another great challenge faced
by Iberdrola and the energy sector as a whole. In particular, Iberdrola pays special attention to water
resources, due to their environmental and social implications, and makes efforts to make rational
and sustainable use of water and face the risks associated with its scarcity.
The company also works with its supply chain and other players in its value chain on the
development of circular production systems that decrease the pressure on the available resources.
For example, in 2022 Iberdrola and FCC launched EnergyLOOP to lead the recycling of wind turbine
blades on an industrial scale, one of the greatest medium- and long-term challenges in the sector.
Loss of biodiversity is critical for Iberdrola, as the company interacts with different ecosystems and
species within a broad geographic scope. Aware of the urgent need to stop and reverse the
unprecedented loss of biodiversity, and in response to demands of the scientific community,
Iberdrola has launched the 2030 Biodiversity Plan, which applies to the entire Iberdrola group and
sets out its commitment to have a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2030. The plan covers the
impact of the group’s activities on ecosystems and species throughout the life cycle, taking into
account the supply chain and creating economic and social value through ecosystemic services.
Innovation is the lever that enables Iberdrola to approach all these challenges and launch the
relevant action plans to benefit from opportunities as they arise. Innovation will make it possible to
find solutions to currently unsolvable problems, as well as find more efficient ways to carry out the
activities currently performed.
Considering these priorities, the company has set the following environmental goals:
II.1. Fight against climate change and
protection of biodiversity
• Iberdrola with nature
• Environmental governance and management
• Reduction of emissions
• Sustainable use of resources and the circular
economy
• Protection of and action for biodiversity
Iberdrola with nature
An energy model in harmony with nature and human beings
The preservation of the planet and the well-being of people are priorities that Iberdrola includes in its
business strategy and business model. Nature is the foundation of our economy, and our well-being
and progress would be compromised without a robust, healthy and functional environment. This is
why decades ago Iberdrola made a firm commitment to the environment, focusing its activities on
building an energy model in harmony with nature and with human beings and that would be
competitive, resilient, based on local sources, and a source of sustainable development. In short, a
model that allows value to be created without putting the future of new generations at risk.
The group is committed to developing a sustainable energy model where the reduction of emissions,
the conservation, protection and promotion of biodiversity, and the sustainable and efficient use of
resources are integrated into all its activities and processes. This is a model in which Iberdrola is a
leader and is based on using renewable energies, smart grids, efficient energy storage and driving
the electrification of demand as an energetic vector for competitive and efficient decarbonisation.
To ensure that the group’s activities are carried out in harmony with nature, Iberdrola works on three
fronts that, together, address its main potential impacts:
• Climate action plan: establishes the strategy, work plans and goals for reducing emissions
and combating climate change.
• Circular economy plan: aims to achieve the sustainable use of resources by increasing the
life of its assets and reducing the use of raw materials and the generation of waste.
• Biodiversity plan: sets out the strategy, programmes, targets and mechanisms to include
the conservation of biodiversity in the decision-making process, increase actions regarding
conservation and restoration, and support the transformation to halt and reverse the loss of
biodiversity.
The companies of the group regularly review and update the action plans associated with each line
of work.
Environmental governance and management
Iberdrola’s commitment to the environment and sustainable development is embodied in its
Governance and Sustainability System which meets ESG criteria and is intended to ensure that
the Company’s Purpose and Values are achieved and that its business goals and objectives are
reached.
Environmental policies
The environmental policies formally define and establish the Company’s decisive response to the
challenges, objectives and goals posed by climate change, preservation of the environment and the
loss of biodiversity, while helping to identify and take advantage of the opportunities arising from the
energy transition. They are therefore the expression of Iberdrola’s commitment, shared by all its
stakeholders, to create an integral business value that takes into account and respects the natural
and environmental capital on which its activities are based.
These environmental policies, which are in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the
United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, are as follows:
Sustainable Management Policy
Iberdrola implements and promotes a sustainable energy model, with its actions aimed at
contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its activities are therefore designed so
that they are environmentally sustainable, competitive, with high quality of service, that generate
shared value, that respect human rights, and that promote the use of energy. The instruments used
to reduce the environmental impact associated with its operations include an ambitious climate
action, focusing on the conservation and protection of biodiversity, improving the circularity of its
activities and its suppliers, promoting the rational and sustainable use of water, and avoiding or
mitigating polluting emissions and their effects on human health.
■ GRI 3-3
Environmental Policy
Iberdrola’s Environmental Policy sets out the principles for developing a sustainable model that
respects nature, biodiversity and historical heritage and that promotes the conservation, protection
and promotion of the development and growth of natural heritage through innovation and
Stakeholder engagement. It therefore implements a common environmental management model for
the group, which applies the precautionary principle and the principle of continuous improvement,
places the environment at the centre of the decision-making process, and is in line with the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The policy also defines three high-priority lines of action, namely: the circular economy, natural
capital and biodiversity protection. All of these pillars are essential to achieving fully sustainable
activity in harmony with nature.
Biodiversity Policy
The Biodiversity Policy establishes the principles of conduct for implementing a business model in
harmony with nature so that its activities protect and promote the development and growth of natural
assets. In this policy, Iberdrola makes a formal commitment to ending and reversing the loss of
biodiversity, and to generating a net positive impact on biodiversity in the context of its operations
and activities. This Biodiversity Policy establishes four lines of action for these purposes: protect
biodiversity and ensure the sustainable use of natural capital; identify, quantify and continuously
assess the impacts and dependencies of the group’s activities; work with Stakeholders; and
Climate Action Policy
This policy establishes the framework for Iberdrola’s strategy and business model,which is in line
with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, in the fight against climate change. Through this
policy Iberdrola is committed to continue assuming a leadership position (directly and by
establishing alliances), promoting awareness (impacts, challenges and benefits of its
achievement) and contributing to a carbon neutral and sustainable future.
For more detailed information, see section "I.3. Climate action and TFCD".
Environmental Management System
The commitments made in the various environmental policies mentioned above are embodied in the
Iberdrola group’s Environmental Management System. This system enables the alignment of the
environmental dimension within the group’s sustainability model, integrating the SDGs and
coordinating the mechanisms for measuring and assessing the group’s environmental performance
in terms of the life cycle, including the concepts of circular economy and natural capital in the
group’s management.
The group’s Environmental Management System establishes a common, homogeneous, integrated
and environmental framework that is a benchmark for all of the organisations and facilitates the
development of an ongoing diagnosis of the company’s environmental behaviour at each of its
management levels.
Corporate Environmental Footprint
To gauge the group’s environmental performance, Iberdrola calculates its Corporate Environmental
Footprint (CEF), which is a multi-criteria measure of environmental performance from a life cycle
perspective (ISO/TS 14072:2014 standard).
The Corporate Environmental Footprint is part of the company's environmental management model,
the ultimate goal of which is to bring the environmental aspect into line with the company’s
sustainability model, integrating the universality of service, safety, competitiveness, energy efficiency
and the reduction of the company's environmental impact, all from a life cycle perspective.
The calculation of the Corporate Environmental Footprint at Iberdrola has meant that the Group has
been able to:
• Demonstrate transparency and consistency in environmental management.
• Improve the identification of opportunities to reduce its environmental impact.
• Drive innovation and business capabilities that seek continuous improvement in
environmental management.
• Obtain recognition by third parties of Iberdrola’s position and achievements, including the
fight against climate change, the destruction of the ozone layer, and the depletion of natural
resources.
Consistent with this line of work, Iberdrola took part in the European Rules Electricity Environmental
Footprint (REEF) project, which developed the Environmental Footprint (EF) product rules for the
electricity sector, and will make it possible to have common rules for calculating the industry’s EF.
For more information, see Iberdrola’s Environmental Footprint.
Certifications
Iberdrola's environmental management system is rooted in international procedures and standards
that are audited by prestigious independent agencies. The company currently holds the following
environmental certifications:
• ISO 14001-2015 This standard covers activities consisting of the product generation,
transmission, distribution and marketing, office management and general services. In
particular, more than 80% of its energy was generated at certified facilities in 2022.
• Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). The group's thermal power generation
plants hold certificates under this standard.
• ISO 14064-2018. Iberdrola verifies its greenhouse gas emissions under this standard.
• ISO TS 14072-2014 under which Iberdrola verifies its Corporate Environmental Footprint. It
is the only company in the industry to have obtained this certificate.
• ISO 20121. Sustainable Event Management. Under this standard, Iberdrola certifies the
most important events for shareholders and investors, i.e. the General Shareholders'
Meeting, presentations of results and Investor Day.
More information is available online, in the Certifications and Verifications section of the website.
Reserves and insurance coverage for environmental risks
Iberdrola also has insurance policies that cover environmental risks. The main types of corporate
insurance policies that the company has obtained with environmental coverage are:
• Environmental Liability Insurance.
• Civil Liability Coverage for Sudden Accidental Pollution in the general civil liability policy.
Reduction of emissions
Iberdrola is a global leader in the energy transition and the fight against climate change within the
energy sector. Its ambitious decarbonisation targets place it among the most advanced companies
in this regard.

11 As noted in the EU2 indicator of the “Key operating figures” section of chapter I.1, Iberdrola uses the reporting criteria regarding its
generation activities in this report, distinguishing between its “own” output and installed capacity and output and installed capacity “for third
parties”. The latter parameter reflects the particular operating conditions of some of our plants in Mexico, which Iberdrola operates as an
Independent Power Producer (IPP) under the auspices of the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission (Comisión Federal de la
Electricidad) (CFE). Under these conditions, Iberdrola believes that the IPP plants do not comply with the requirement set out in the GHG

in a dramatic drop in direct emissions in Brazil (-89%), which significantly contributed to a drop of
more than 10% in the group’s scope 1 emissions.
Iberdrola’s inventory of emissions is verified by AENOR in accordance with UNE ISO 14064-1:2018
for the direct and indirect emissions from all of its activities.
The verified information is available in the Greenhouse Gas Inventory (Carbon Footprint)

Iberdrola has incorporated the life cycle perspective into its management model, which includes
knowing the long-term impacts of the value chain. New elements are thus included each year in the
calculation of its Scope 3, indirect emissions that result from the company’s activities at sources not
owned or controlled by it. They include the following:Emissions (due to fuel consumption) from
electrical power generation facilities used in production for third parties. (GHG Protocol Category 3).
• Emissions associated with the transport of employees for work purposes (hired and private
vehicles, aircraft and trains). (GHG Protocol Category 7).

Sustainable use of resources and the circular economy
For Iberdrola, the circular economy is a key element to
achieve sustainable development and represents an
opportunity as a driver for climate action and the energy
transition.
Iberdrola’s circular economy model is based on the following pillars:
• Reduction of emissions.
• Use of renewable resources in production.
• Improved efficiency.
• Resource optimisation and maximisation of use of waste.
The challenges of sustainability cannot be approached in an isolated manner, but rather must be
addressed holistically. Therefore, in 2019 Iberdrola defined its circular economy model, which
includes the entire value chain from suppliers to customers, along with its operations.
Based on this circular economy model, in 2022 Iberdrola approved Circular Economy Plan 2030,
which specifies various goals in line with its sustainable energy model.
Four levers will be available to achieve these goals: the four Rs (redesign, reduce, reuse, and
recycle). The goals set are shown in the diagram below:

Apart from fuel, there is also consumption – to a much lower extent – of chemical products (in water
purification, filtering of gases, etc.), oil and grease, etc.

Rational use of water22
■ GRI 303 ■ SASB IF-EU-140a.1. IF-EU-140a.3.
Water is a basic and irreplaceable natural resource in many of Iberdrola’s activities. The company's
awareness of this dependency and of the risks arising from water shortages has led it to set a goal
of ensuring its increasingly responsible use of this resource.
The group’s main actions for a more sustainable use of water are:
• Continually improving processes at facilities to reduce consumption and impact.
• Implementing and controlling ecological flows as required by government authorities at
hydroelectric generation reservoirs.
• Conducting awareness-raising campaigns to achieve a more efficient and responsible use of
sanitary water by employees at offices.
■ GRI 303-1 303-2
The water cycle needed to generate power at Iberdrola's thermal generation plants is based on the
following three phases:
• Withdrawal: performed within regulatory limits.
• Use: Use in cooling and auxiliary services of plants.
• Return to the environment: the quality of effluent discharged into the environment is always
within the required limits and even improving on them compared to the values of water
withdrawn.
Ensuring compliance with the law and seeking methods to minimise the risk of spills applies to all of
Iberdrola’s facilities, including generating plants, renewables facilities and distribution substations.
To avoid the risk of polluting discharges, with a possible negative impact, Iberdrola has:
• Consolidated Environmental Management Systems: ISO 14001 and EMAS certificates, in
which possible anomalies and incidents are managed, establishing plans to minimise
spillage risks, by implementing predictive, preventive and corrective actions that ensure the
proper condition of the water.
Water consumption and discharges by the facilities in 2022 were within the limits indicated by the
relevant comprehensive environmental permit for each facility, and no anomalies were detected that
might materially affect the water resources or associated habitats.
■ GRI 303-3 303-4 ■ SASB IF-EU-140a.1.
The following table gives total water consumption, considered to be the difference between total
water withdrawn and water discharged, with a breakdown of total water withdrawal by the group by
source and water stress area. The areas are classified according to the Aqueduct Water Risk
Atlas.
22 Iberdrola has changed its methodology to calculate water consumption, including two aspects that had not been considered until now:
contribution of rainwater and contribution of water to customer processes. The failure to consider these two aspects was affecting the
figures for the Almaraz nuclear plant, reducing its reported water consumption, and cogeneration, increasing water consumption. These

48% of Iberdrola’s thermal plants are located in areas of high water stress, according to the water
stress indicator of the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. 69% of the water withdrawn is seawater or
saltwater that does not affect water stress.
Total water withdrawal is the sum of the various sources, and is obtained by direct measurement
(flowmeters) or by estimating the output of the water withdrawal pumps.
99% of total water withdrawn is used in cooling processes. The rest of the water withdrawn
corresponds to other auxiliary services of the generation plants and consumption at offices.
All of the withdrawals of water intended for use in generation are regulated strictly by government
authorities, which issue the permits and determine the maximum permissible withdrawal volumes, to
avoid significant negative effects.
43% of the water withdrawn and 76% of the water consumed is from high water stress areas.

Efficiency in energy consumption
■ GRI 302
The Iberdrola group optimises the use of energy throughout its entire value chain (production,
transmission, distribution, marketing and end use), contemplating energy efficiency from a three-fold
perspective:
• As an electricity generator and distributor, it seeks to improve efficiency by introducing the
most advanced technologies, equipment and digitalisation.
• As an energy consumer, Iberdrola promotes the ongoing improvement of energy efficiency
across all its activities (offices and buildings, mobility, etc.).
• As a supplier of energy solutions, the company informs, promotes and supplies
comprehensive efficiency solutions aligned with the emission reduction strategy, thereby
contributing to more efficient energy use by consumers, while encouraging the reduction of
the environmental impact of their energy consumption habits.
Energy consumption within the organisation
■ GRI 302-1
Energy consumption within the organisation (internal consumption) includes energy consumption at
all Iberdrola group facilities, buildings and offices, and is calculated as:
The fuel consumption figure in terms of energy (GJ), obtained by directly measuring the fuel used at
each facility based on its lower heating value (LHV):
The value of energy purchased or sold is obtained by direct measurement at the facilities, buildings
and offices.

In keeping with its commitment to transparent disclosure to its Stakeholders, Iberdrola provides
additional information about its nuclear power generation park (“General Radioactive Waste Plan”,
Enresa30). The radioactive waste that is generated undergoes reduction, reuse, segregation,
recycling and recovery processes as part of the safe management thereof.
Iberdrola’s nuclear power plants are covered by the Environmental Radiological Monitoring
Programme of the Nuclear Safety Council of Spain, the purpose of which is to monitor the dispersion
into the environment of controlled discharges from facilities and to determine and monitor
radiological quality throughout the country.31

Protection of and action for biodiversity
Governance and biodiversity management
■ GRI 304
The degradation of ecosystems and the unprecedented decline in biological diversity, which the
scientific community universally considers to be a direct result of the impact of human activities,
entail grave environmental, economic and social risks. This requires urgent action to revert the loss
of biodiversity.
Given the location of our infrastructure and their interaction with the territory, Iberdrola has believed
for more than fifteen years that biodiversity is a material issue for its Business Model, and for this
reason places respect for biodiversity and ecosystems in a key place within its business strategy.
Since 2007, Iberdrola has had a Biodiversity Policy which forms part of its "I.2. Governance and
Sustainability System". In this policy, which was strengthened in 2021, Iberdrola commits to
assuming a position of leadership in the fight against the loss of biodiversity and in generating a
positive net impact on biodiversity from its activities.
These commitments involve integrating biodiversity into strategic planning, managing risk through
continuous assessment of impacts and dependencies throughout the life cycle, applying the
mitigation hierarchy (avoid, mitigate, restore and offset) in all our activities, avoiding the placement
of new infrastructure in protected areas, implementing biodiversity action plans, working together
with Stakeholders, and encouraging awareness and communication. It also entails promoting, along
with its Stakeholders, a social culture in which biodiversity is valued, preserved, restored and
sustainably used, maintaining ecosystem services, favouring a healthy planet, and providing
essential benefits for all.
Iberdrola supports ambitious objectives in the negotiations of the new global framework of the
Convention on Biological Diversity approved in Montreal in December 2022. The Biodiversity Plan
2030, approved in October 2022 after being presented to the company’s corporate bodies, is aligned
with the goals approved in the Global Biodiversity Framework. Of particular importance is Goal 15,
relating to the reporting of impacts and biodiversity impacts covered by Iberdrola in this report and in
its Biodiversity Report. Moreover, Iberdrola is already working with the Task Force of Nature
related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) and WBCSD to evaluate the draft recommendations and
provide feedback.
In addition to the Biodiversity Policy, Iberdrola has the following mechanisms to integrate the
protection and conservation of biodiversity within management, and for it to be taken into account in
decision-making processes:
• Biodiversity Policy
• Comprehensive Risk Control and Management System
• Environmental Management System of the group
• Tools for evaluating impacts and dependencies
• Biodiversity Plan
• Environment and biodiversity committees
Objectives and Biodiversity Plan 2030
At Iberdrola, we have strengthened our commitment to nature and set ourselves the goal of having a
positive net impact on biodiversity by 2030, i.e. the year by which our activities have contributed to
preserving and improving biodiversity.
Objective 2025: No net deforestation
As part of its actions to achieve this goal by 2030, Iberdrola also commits to ensuring that its activity
does not generate net deforestation by 2025. This commitment applies both to direct actions and to
actions in the group’s supply chain.
Biodiversity Plan 2030
To achieve this ambitious goal, Iberdrola has launched the Biodiversity Plan 2030 (the “Plan”), which
applies to all of the Iberdrola group’s facilities and activities, and which has three areas of action:
measure, act and transform.
This approach is aligned with the Science-Based Targets for Nature (SBTNs) and its vision of the
Framework for Action “AR3T1” and with the landmark pillars provided by the Taskforce on Nature-
related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).
The Biodiversity Plan 2030 is a continuation of years of work on the protection and preservation of
biodiversity, and its integration into the strategic planning and decision-making of the group. The
commitments and procedures derived from this Plan are:
i. conservation hierarchy;
iii. application of solutions based on the preservation of nature; and
iv. supply chain involvement.
All of them, together with other measures, constitute adequate tools to guarantee the achievement
of the objectives of the Plan in 2030.
Interaction with biodiversity
Main impacts and dependencies
■ GRI 304-2
Iberdrola identifies impacts and dependencies stemming from the interaction of these activities on
biodiversity and natural capital, in order to avoid, minimise, remedy and/or offset these impacts and
dependencies. Iberdrola has been working on developing and implementing tools to identify,
quantify and assess the impacts and dependencies of its activities on natural capital since 2012.
The identification of these impacts and dependencies is an iterative process. Below are some of the
information sources and tools used:
• Corporate Environmental Footprint
• Assessments of environmental impact at new projects
• Impact surveillance, monitoring and re-evaluation programmes
• Matrix of impacts and dependencies by technology developed in the Natural Capital and
Energy Working Group
• Matrix of materiality of activities with regard to drivers of biodiversity loss
• Results of pilot natural capital assessment projects at Iberdrola’s facilities.
In this regard, in 2022 Iberdrola continued work on the pilot projects to quantify the net effect of our
activities on biodiversity at several of our facilities in Spain, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Mexico,
using international benchmark methodologies and obtaining the initial results of the projects.
Identification of dependencies
Carrying out operations and maintenance activities requires, in addition to raw materials, the
services that nature provides. By identifying these dependencies, we are able to assess those
services and plan actions to prevent their modification and to protect and preserve them. An analysis
of the group’s activities makes it possible to identify dependencies on the following ecosystem
services:
• Waterway maintenance service, through the hydrological cycle. The water cycle makes it
possible to recover river flows, which is necessary to produce energy at hydro plants and for
cooling processes at thermal plants.
• Climate regulation service, which is obtained through nature by means of the long-term
storage of carbon dioxide in soils, plant biomass and the oceans. This service is important for
all generation facilities.
• Terrain stabilisation and erosion control. Vegetation on slopes prevents avalanches and
landslides. This service is important for hydroelectric plants and transmission and distribution
grid facilities.
• Protection against floods and storms, through the buffer provided by vegetation during such
events. This service is important for hydroelectric plants and grid facilities.
• Water. This resource is the source of production at hydroelectric plants, and it is necessary
for cooling at thermal plants.
• Mineral and non-mineral (gas and uranium) resources as fuel in power generation at thermal
plants.
• Gas as a product served to customers and users of gas networks.
Identification of impacts
Activities and operations that may have impacts during the different phases of the life of facilities are
identified in order to avoid, minimise and appropriately correct such potential impacts, as shown in
the figure below:
Based on these actions, the potential significant impacts on biodiversity arising from the group’s
activities, products and services are in turn identified:
■ GRI 304-1
Facilities in protected spaces or high biodiversity-value areas
The areas in which Iberdrola conducts its activities serve as habitats for a variety of flora and
wildlife, some of which are under some form of protection. This is mainly due to the fact that the
construction work was performed prior to the issuance of the declarations of protection by the public
authorities. This is the case of certain hydroelectric plants in Spain. There are also facilities for which
– after an analysis of the alternatives, giving priority to avoiding protected areas, and after an
environmental assessment process in which the mitigation hierarchy was applied – the competent
authorities authorised the project. Such authorisation is based on the consideration that while the
protected areas or high biodiversity-value areas could not be avoided, the preventive and palliative
measures prevented the activities from having significant impacts on the protected habitats and
species.
Therefore, following the impact assessment process, it was determined that the presence of such
facilities in protected spaces or in high biodiversity-value areas was compatible with the protected
elements, with the consequent implementation of measures to prevent, mitigate and compensate
possible adverse effects.
The following table shows the Iberdrola facilities within or adjacent to protected spaces or in high
biodiversity-value areas:

Threatened species in the vicinity of the facilities
■ GRI 304-4
Awareness of the species that live in the vicinity of the facilities is fundamental to the prevention of
effects on them - all the more so if they are protected.
Iberdrola has identified threatened species included on the IUCN Red List and on the national and
regional lists of the areas in which it operates that potentially could be affected by our facilities. It
also conducts species monitoring programmes and research projects at many of its facilities with a
view to learning more about their patterns of behaviour and incorporating this knowledge into its
operations (see indicators GRI 304 and GRI 304-3).

Action for biodiversity
In its Biodiversity Policy,Iberdrola establishes its priority lines for action, which are integrated in
management of the operational units in action programmes and specific actions. These are:
• Protecting biodiversity and making sustainable use of natural capital, adopting a
conservation hierarchy, integrating into its management the best practices along the entire
lifecycle and promoting actions in favour of regenerating and conserving natural heritage.
• Continuously identifying, quantifying and evaluating the impacts and the dependencies of the
Group’s activities on natural capital, with a focus on biodiversity during the entire lifecycle of
facilities, by promoting research and improving knowledge of the ecosystems in the
environments of the territories in which it operates.
• Partnering with Stakeholders, considering their needs and expectations regarding
biodiversity in order to integrate these needs and expectations in action plans, and
participating in research projects.
• Commitment to raising awareness and reporting on the importance of biodiversity and
internally and externally communicate the impact of our activities and actions for the
preservation of biodiversity.
Iberdrola engages in more than 800 activities for the protection of biodiversity each year and
publishes its Biodiversity Report which includes many of these activities, on a regular basis.
Tackling the drivers of biodiversity loss
The analysis of the impact of the group’s activities on these drivers enables Iberdrola to take the
measures required to prevent or minimise them. The drivers of biodiversity loss identified by the
Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) that can be tackled by
Iberdrola are analysed below, as are the measures taken to prevent and minimise the impact of its
activities.
Changes in land use
In a context of increased energy demand and decarbonisation, it is necessary to build new clean
energy facilities, which must be environmentally friendly. This infrastructure often causes changes in
land use and potential habitat loss, displacing species.
The Biodiversity Plan 2030 intensifies the company’s efforts to integrate the search for opportunities
to make the generation of renewable energies compatible with other uses and improve biodiversity
in those territories in which it operates.
The Plan also reinforces the work done by the company to implement the mitigation hierarchy
(avoid, reduce, mitigate, and compensate as a last option) in all project phases, from the design and
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes to decommissioning after operation.
Most impacts resulting in diversity loss can be prevented in the design phase, for which reason we
support knowledge of the area as the best tool to prevent or minimise effects on the environment. To
properly select a site, Iberdrola avoids locating new infrastructures in protected areas (including
World Heritage sites, national protected areas, Nature 2000 Network, and the respective
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (UICN) categories, as well as unprotected areas
of high biodiversity value, unless there are no alternatives or the only alternatives are less
compatible with the environment. If significant impacts are identified during the evaluation process,
the project is modified to the extent possible, and the best available techniques and any measures
identified as necessary are employed to correct and minimise these impacts. Stakeholders are
involved and consulted with throughout the entire design process, which makes it possible to
incorporate good construction practices, going beyond the applicable legal requirements in each
case. Once this process has ended, and during construction, Iberdrola continues to work with
stakeholders, seeking to ensure that the environmental impact is as low as possible, restoring the
affected areas and offsetting residual impact.
Iberdrola works to ensure that new infrastructure projects are a shelter for biodiversity while
preserving local jobs. One example is photovoltaic plants in Spain, which have gone from being
agricultural land to becoming biodiversity reservoirs thanks to the measures taken.
Habitat and species loss
■ GRI 304-3
A proper habitat is essential for ensuring the successful survival of local species, for which reason
Iberdrola implements specific programmes and actions to avoid, reduce, restore and offset effects
on habitats and species at its infrastructure, as well as to monitor their interactions in order to
remedy the impacts. It also promotes volunteer programmes that contribute to reversing the loss of
biodiversity in ecosystems. The most noteworthy actions and programmes carried out in 2022 are
listed below. More information can be found in Iberdrola’s Biodiversity Report.
Habitat conservation, restoration and compensation programmes
Iberdrola is committed to preserving and restoring forest ecosystems. For this reason, in 2020 it
created the Trees Programme in 2020 for forest biodiversity and ecosystems in order to promote the
conservation and planting of 20 million trees by 2030. Since its launch, the group has promoted the
planting of 2.5 million trees.
Of particular note is the work carried out in Brazil in recent years, where conservation and
regeneration activities have been carried out on more than 8,975 hectares and monitoring and
conservation actions on more than 18,400 hectares in Permanent Preservation Areas. Activities in
2022 include a continuation of the creation of the Biodiversity Corridor in order to establish
connectivity between the forest areas of Iguaçu National Park (PNI) and the Direct Influence Areas
(AID) of the Lower Iguaçu Hydroelectric Plant, in the environs of the reservoir. Conservation
activities have been carried out on 1,135 hectares as well as planting on 50 hectares to date. The
corridor will comprise more than 3,000 hectares. Work has also continued to develop the Permanent
Preservation Areas of Corumbá, Telespires and Itapebi. 25,000 trees were also voluntarily planted in
partnership with Fundación SOS Mata Atlântica, as part of the Florestas do Futuro Programme, in
the municipality of Marabá Paulista.
In the United Kingdom, more than 520,000 trees were planted in 2022 in the Kilgallioch, Mark Hill,
Hare Hill, Black Law, Halsary and Glen App wind farms to improve habitats, provide benefits to
wildlife, and to offset the construction of wind farms. Restoration work was also carried out on the
land taken up by the landline cable at the East Anglia One offshore wind farm, where more than
1,600 trees were planted, 35 ha of grassland were sown, and 3,500 linear metres of hedges were
recovered.
In Spain, monitoring works continued on nearly 2,000 hectares of voluntary reforestation, and an
additional 57 hectares were planted in 2022 in Toledo and Ciudad Real.
In Mexico, the more than 25 hectares already planted in 2019 at the La Venta III wind farm
continued to be maintained.
Iberdrola also promotes the restoration of other ecosystems. In 2022, work continued on the
Habitats Management and Monitoring Plan with respect to the wind farms in Scotland, covering a
total area of more than 10,000 hectares.
Iberdrola also works to ensure that new infrastructure projects are a shelter for biodiversity while
preserving local jobs. This is exemplified by photovoltaic plants in Spain, as, for example, the
creation of a new flora reserve to preserve orchids and other singular species at the Núñez de
Balboa photovoltaic plant and the measures to encourage the settlement of species such as the
lesser kestrel, vegetation management through sheep, and the promotion of ecosystemic services
and local jobs, such as the placement of beehives at several of the photovoltaic plants during certain
months of the campaign.
Fauna and flora species protection and conservation programmes
Iberdrola is working to minimise the impacts of its facilities on fauna and is taking actions to foster
the protection and conservation thereof. Special attention has been paid to the effects of our
windfarms and grids on fauna, particularly birdlife. Numerous actions have been taken in this regard,
from adapting supports – more than 123,000 in Spain since 2018 – to implementing new bird
protection methodologies, such as the installation of biological distancers to dissuade Furnarius
rufus from building nests on distribution network poles in Brazil. Work continues to be carried out to
reduce the risk of wind farm impact, implementing innovative detection and stoppage measures for
wind farm turbines when birds and bats fly by, such as the installation of artificial intelligence
surveillance cameras and deterrents such as painted blades and the placement of eye-patterned
vinyls, among others.
Significant fauna and flora protection actions were taken at the Tâmega hydroelectric plant in
Portugal, including the installation of 5 bat shelter boxes, reaching a total of 55 boxes in late 2022
and the restoration of 13 fish egg-laying sites. Reproduction work within the river mussel
reproduction centre at the Tâmega Environmental Interpretation and Awareness-Raising Centre also
advanced by 26% in 2022. The cumulative total of the reproduction work is 63%.
Wildlife protection materials were also installed at the substation transformer and other substation
equipment at onshore wind farms in the United States to minimise the risk of wildlife incidents and
plant shutdowns.
In the implementation of new projects, there are numerous activities to conserve and improve the
habitats of threatened or unique species. In France, birds were protected through actions to fight the
depredation of sea birds by carrion crows in Cap Fréhel at the Saint-Brieuc offshore wind farm.
Measures to protect sea life, particularly sea mammals and sea turtles, are implemented at offshore
wind farms in the United States. The purpose of the actions is to protect such species as
Balaenoptera borealis, Balaenoptera musculus, Balaenoptera physalus, Caretta caretta, Chelonia
mydas, Dermochelys coriacea, Eretmochelys imbricata, Eubalaena glacialis, Lepidochelys kempii y
Physeter macrocephalus.
Wildlife tracking and monitoring programmes
Iberdrola carries out programmes to track threatened species or habitats that may be affected by its
activities, in order to evaluate the success of its corrective measures, identify possible impacts and
implement new measures to reduce such impacts where necessary. In addition to the tracking of
birdlife and chiroptera at the group’s wind farms, measures are underway to monitor fish and water
bodies so as to protect the water environment in Spain, in addition to monitoring programmes with
respect to herpetofauna, ichthyofauna and mastofauna at the hydro plants in Brazil, monitoring of
feline species at the combined cycle plant in Altamira and benthic and marine mammal monitoring at
offshore wind farms.
Vegetation management programmes
Iberdrola applies the best techniques to minimise effects in the form of soil loss due to erosion and
acidification. These techniques include maintaining the vegetation cover at photovoltaic plants and
refraining from using herbicides as well as avoiding the mass cutting of trees for street cleaning work
related to fire protection lanes.
Programmes to foster knowledge and research for habitat and species conservation
Iberdrola is committed to supporting knowledge and research as key measures to protect and
conserve biodiversity. Along these lines, the company continued in 2022 to support research such
as the work carried out through the Coralizar Project on the effects of climate change on coral reefs
and the Flyways Project to monitor wading and migratory birds, some of which are at risk of
extinction, in northeastern and southern Brazil.
In Spain, studies on the evolution of biodiversity were carried out at several photovoltaic plants, the
accounting framework for diversity was developed to monitor the group’s Biodiversity Plan 2030, and
work was done on the assessment of the natural capital at several facilities. The Migra Project also
continued, the objective of which is to study the migratory movements of birds in Spain, with the
launch of a project with the Migres foundation to analyse actions for the recovery of ospreys in
Spain. Work is also under way to conserve habitats and species, such as the protection of feline
species and mangroves in Mexico.
In addition, Iberdrola actively participated in the Montreal Biodiversity Summit, COP15, in the
working groups of the National Commission of the Environment (CONAMA), and promoted
conferences such as the one on biodiversity and offshore wind held on World Oceans Day through
Scottish Power Renewables and in partnership with the UN Compact and the UICN, as well as
conferences on ornithology, and has also sponsored the international conference of the International
Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA21) , among other activities.
Climate change
All information on Climate Action can be found in chapter " I.3. Climate action."
Pollution
Eutrophication and eco-toxicity are problems derived from pollution. Iberdrola applies the
precautionary principle and its environmental guidelines include preventing water and soil pollution
through spillage or dumping.
To this end, pollution prevention programmes have been implemented within all organisations of the
group, through actions to improve the safety and containment measures to prevent harm. These
planned actions include building tanks to collect oil in the event of a mass spillage at substations
and transformation centres, the insulation of retaining troughs, and the installation of containment
barriers in sensitive environments.
Invasive species
Invasive species are animals, plants, or other organisms that develop outside their natural area of
distribution, in habitats that are not their own or in an unusual abundance, causing alterations in
ecosystem richness and diversity.
Control of these species is fundamental for the equilibrium of ecosystems. Iberdrola contributes to
reducing these species both in the operation of its facilities (vegetation management and zebra
mussel control programmes) and through dedicated volunteering actions.
III. Social
In the social dimension, Iberdrola focuses on continuous improvement of its engagement with its
various Stakeholders and management of their expectations, as well as on respect for Human
Rights in all its activities and those of its partners in the value chain.
Iberdrola works on creating and maintaining quality jobs. Its pillars in employee management are
equality of opportunity, non-discrimination and talent development and management, without
forgetting the concern for the health and safety of all its workers.
Iberdrola seeks to continuously improve the quality of the products and services offered to its
customers through digitalisation and sustainability, developing solutions that take its customers’
actual needs into account and provide them with increased independence.
Finally, in its commitment to the generation of value for all stakeholders, Iberdrola collaborates in the
development of the communities in which it has a presence through various initiatives channelled
through its subsidiaries or investees and its foundations in different countries.
In its commitment to continuously improve its relations with its stakeholders and management of
their expectations and needs, Iberdrola has set the following goals as part of its sustainability
roadmap:
III.1. Protection of human rights
• Iberdrola’s commitment to human rights
• Human rights due diligence system
Iberdrola’s commitment to human rights
■ GRI 407 408 409
Iberdrola has a firm commitment to the defence of human rights, and has a set of tools that ensure
and promote the protection of and respect for people, in order to prevent, mitigate and redress any
negative impact on human rights.
To achieve this, the company’s practices are aligned with:
• the Principles underlying the United Nations Global Compact,
• the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (GPBH),
• the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises,
• the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and the Social
Policy of the International Labour Organization,
• the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) (including convention 169
concerning indigenous and tribal peoples), and
• the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) approved by the United Nations.
Iberdrola’s commitment to human rights is formalised in its Policy on Respect for Human Rights,
approved by the Board of Directors in 2015 and last revised in December 2022. This policy
establishes the mandatory principles of conduct for all the group’s professionals, as well as the need
to have the governance procedures and systems required to ensure respect for human rights in
relation to the company’s business, the countries where it operates, and its value chain.
Through this policy, the company has made the following commitments, among others, associated
with international human rights standards:
• To respect human rights, including the labour rights recognised in domestic and international
law, as well as comply with international standards in those countries in which human rights
legislation has not reached an adequate level of development.
• To reject child labour and forced or compulsory labour or any other form of modern slavery
and to respect freedom of association and collective bargaining, as well as non-
discrimination, the freedom of movement within each country, and the rights of ethnic
minorities and of indigenous peoples in the places in which it does business.
• To respect the right to the environment of all communities in which it operates, considering
their expectations and needs and understanding access to energy as a right related to and
linked to other human rights.
• To advance a culture of respect for human rights and promote awareness-raising in this field
among its professionals within all companies of the group, and especially at those where
there may be a higher risk of violation of such rights.
To guarantee compliance with these commitments, Iberdrola has established the adequate
governance and management structures to ensure that duties and responsibilities in this area have
been assigned.
The Company has also defined an overall human rights due diligence framework with the aim of
better integrating all issues relating to human rights into a single system.
This system is in turn based on the Governance and Sustainability System and on the Control
Model of the Company based on three lines of defence (prevention, monitoring, and human rights
management assessment). It is a process of continuous review that seeks to promote the
implementation of the UNGPs, adjusted for the size of the company and the diversity and
particularities of the facilities in the various countries. (For more information, see the: "Human
rights due diligence system" section of this chapter).
The cross-dimensional nature of the due diligence system is assured through specific management
policies for significant human rights issues. The Policy on Respect for Human Rights is thus
reflected in various policies and operational procedures that apply across all group companies, as
well as in non-integrated investees over which the Company has effective control, within legal limits.
Other policies and standards that directly affect or are related to the company’s commitment to
human rights have also been approved: Regulations of the Board of Directors and Regulations

Human rights risk map
■ GRI 407-1 408-1 409-1
Iberdrola has a human rights risk map that covers both the country in which the group operates and
those from which it obtains its supplies.
The map is updated on a regular basis through independent external specialists. Unlike other
generic indices on the market, it allows the risks specific to the energy sector to be weighted and
supplemented with the particular characteristics of Iberdrola’s activities, providing results more
closely aligned with the company’s reality.
The results of the risk map are cross-checked with the list of the main locations of operation to
identify those facilities where there may be a greater risk of human rights violations.
Iberdrola carries out a human rights risk analysis at 100% of its main locations of operation (259
locations of operation). The result of this analysis in 2022 showed that 60% of these locations, in the
United States, Brazil, Mexico and Greece, present possible risks in one or more of the following
human rights issues: labour conditions; environmental impact; occupational safety and health; public
safety; indigenous peoples; and lands and property.
Likewise, Iberdrola evaluates 100% of its main providers of general supplies and fuels regarding
compliance with certain corporate social responsibility principles established in their contracts, which
consider human rights among other aspects. The results of this analysis are included in the
“Suppier social assesment” section of this report.
Human rights due diligence system
Iberdrola understands the Human Rights Due Diligence System as an ongoing process intended to
identify and manage the risks and impacts associated with the performance of all phases of its
operations (planning, construction, operation, maintenance, and closure of electricity and energy
sector facilities), considering the geographic and social context and the characteristics of its supply
chain.
As a result of a broad definition of human rights, the due diligence system is based on various
subsystems and their procedures (e.g., Compliance, Health and Safety, Purchases, and
Cybersecurity, among others), which manage the matters for which they are responsible.
The implementation of the due diligence system ensures the identification of actual and potential
impacts on human rights, the integration of the conclusions of this analysis and relevant action,
follow-up on the company’s responses, and communication of the way in which negative
consequences are dealt with.
Identification of impacts
Identification of impacts is the first step in the implementation of the system. The methodology
employed for this purpose adopts the UNGP recommendations and allows for the evaluation of
potential impacts, significant issues, and issues of priority regarding human rights.
1. Potential impacts, understood as those impacts that might be caused by the very nature of
the business and the countries in which the company operates, as well as other additional
factors. According to the risk map, the areas of potential impact and the Stakeholders that
might be affected would be the following:
2. Relevant impacts for the company, determined on the basis of the severity, reach, and
possibility of remediation, as well as their likelihood and the extent of the company’s
connection to them. In accordance with these criteria, the main relevant human rights
impacts for Iberdrola pertain to:
• Labour practices (including the supply chain).
• Local communities and the rights of indigenous peoples (including the environment).
• Cybersecurity and information privacy.
• Citizen insecurity and labour practices in the hiring of security services.
3. Priority impacts, for which an action plan is established based on their significance.
After identifying the potential impacts, Iberdrola triggers measures to prevent and mitigate them,
which are horizontally integrated across all levels of the company.
■ GRI 2-25
However, even valid risk prevention systems are unable to prevent adverse impacts in all cases. For
this reason, when the due diligence system detects an actual negative impact, mitigation plans are
implemented to reduce the magnitude of the impact. In those cases in which this is not fully
possible, remedial action is required. Iberdrola implements remedial actions or measures to
ensure that victims and affected people have access to an effective remedy through legitimate
processes and active cooperation. Remedial actions are intended to restore one or more of the
affected rights, returning the affected people to the situation prior to the impact or, if this is not
possible, reestablishing it as much as possible through various types of remedy.
Along these lines, Iberdrola has taken certain actions to prevent and mitigate its main human rights
impacts.
As regards its employees, the company has worked, for instance, to ensure that their labour
conditions provide them with a decent wage, a safe workplace that takes their mental health into
account, as well as respect for diversity, inclusion, non-discrimination and equality of opportunity.
These measures are described in the “Commitment to quality employment”, “A safe work
environment” and “Diversity and inclusion” sections of this report.
In the area of Labour Practices, Iberdrola has also taken action to ensure that the labour practices
adopted in its supply chain make it possible to prevent or mitigate the impacts identified. Thus, the
company has integrated various factors to ensure respect for human rights in the various stages of
its engagement with its suppliers, together with other support and training initiatives for their
improvement. Both types of measures are described in the chapter “III.5. Promotion of socially
responsible practices in the supply chain”.
Within Labour Practices, other relevant issues are modern slavery and forced labour, which are
some of the most serious human rights impacts that may arise, both regarding company employees
and those in its supply chain. The group pays special attention to the potential risk of forced labour,
due to its seriousness and to the fact that ScottishPower is bound by the UK Modern Slavery Act
and Iberdrola Australia is bound by the Commonwealth Modern Slavery Act. For this reason, in 2022
the company modified its Policy on Respect for Human Rights to specifically state its
commitment on this matter. Iberdrola also worked to better understand and assess this risk and
incorporate its management into the good practices already existing within the group, in particular
those arising from Australia and the United Kingdom.
Local communities are other stakeholders on whom Iberdrola’s activities can have potential or
actual impacts. The company has taken various actions to prevent and/or mitigate, including
measures to reinforce safety at power grids, ensure that the displacement of populations respect the
affected parties’ rights, guarantee responsible supply that takes into account the rights of
communities in access to natural resources, and, finally, respect the rights of indigenous peoples
and ethnic minorities in accordance with applicable law. These measures are specified in the “III.6.
Contribution to the well-being of our communities" section, as well as in this chapter of the
report.
The hiring of security services with potential impacts on the physical safety of communities is
another significant risk identified by Iberdrola. The company has a Corporate Security Policy, as
well as various procedures to ensure that its implementation is compatible with the applicable
regulations. It has also specified protocols of conduct for all the activities provided by the Security
Division. This management approach goes hand in hand with other actions, as well as with a
significant effort in training for own and subcontracted personnel performing security activities, as
described later in this chapter.
Iberdrola has also launched several initiatives pertaining to the potential impacts that may affect the
customers and users of its services. In this context, cybersecurity and information privacy are a
priority, which the company manages with a unique governance model, specific technical and
organisational techniques in each business and area, and a data protection management system,
among other actions. Each of them is described in more detail in the "Cybersecurity and
information privacy" chapter.
The company also considers supply quality and universal access to energy as another area that
could produce various impacts in terms of human rights, which have been worsened by the
COVID-19 pandemic, the latest increase in energy prices due to the rise in commodity prices, and
other international factors. The main measures implemented by Iberdrola in this area are described
in the “III.6. Contribution to the well-being of our communities” chapter.
In addition to these actions to manage specific impacts on human rights, Iberdrola has developed a
wide range of management measures that are generally integrated into the relevant functions
and internal processes across the group. Examples include the establishment of incentives
associated with sustainability and responsible fiscal conduct (see ”IV.1. Governance,
transparency, and stakeholder engagement" section), training and qualification in human rights
(described in this chapter), as well as the analysis of indices and rankings and participation in multi-
player initiatives relating to human rights that make it possible to identify trends and integrate
lessons learned.
Finally, in accordance with the UNGP, Iberdrola has also implemented a system to monitor the due
diligence measures adopted, allowing for examination of the way in which the company has
responded to an impact, and whether this response served to prevent and mitigate it and the extent
to which it did so.
To achieve this goal, regular assessments are carried out through internal monitoring of all relevant
human rights information, independent experts are consulted, and quantitative and qualitative
indicators are used to specify potential improvement actions. This monitoring is based on internal
and external sources of information, including ethical mailboxes and channels for complaints and
grievances, among others. The Company’s Human Rights Report summarises the methodology
to conduct this monitoring, as well as the main conclusions reached (See section 3.4).
Complaint and grievance mechanisms
■ GRI 2-25
Iberdrola has developed mechanisms to file complaints and grievances in accordance with the
UNGP, to face any potential negative consequences early, and carry out remedial actions where
applicable.
These mechanisms allow the affected parties to convey their concerns, complaints and grievances
to the company, and also play a key role in monitoring the effectiveness of the measures previously
implemented to mitigate and/or remedy impacts.
The main mechanisms are the ethical mailboxes available online and on the intranet, on-site
complaint channels, corporate inboxes, and judicial and/or administrative complaints, among others.
There is a procedure in place to classify, monitor, and report complaints and reports with a
potential impact regarding human rights, which facilitates the classification of the complaints
received through the different channels and ensures that all cases are resolved.
The information related to human rights complaints and grievances received in the area of
Compliance are described in the chapter on "Ethics and Integrity" and those relating to workplace
discrimination of company employees in indicator GRI 406-1.Complaints and grievances relating to
human rights are specified in the "Social Assessment of Suppliers" section as it is a case
pertaining to a contractor.
Those relating to the Environment are reported in the " II. Environmental" chapter and in the
"III.6. Contribution to the well-being of our communities" section, while those on Cybersecurity
and Information Privacy are included in indicator GRI 418-1.Finally, those relating to Social and
Economic Compliance are reported in indicator GRI 2-27.
This report also provides some examples of remedial actions carried out during the year to respond
to the complaints and grievances that required this type of response. These actions are described in
the “Population displacement management”, “Social impact assessments” and “Development
programmes for local communities".
Progress and results
Iberdrola’s achievements in human rights management in 2022 include:
• Modification of the Governance and Sustainability System to attribute to the Sustainable
Development Committee the power to regularly report on human rights to the Board of
Directors regarding the measures and procedures adopted by the group to implement and
monitor the policy on respect for human rights.
• Specific inclusion in the Policy on Respect for Human Rights of the company’s
commitment to preventing modern forms of slavery and also requiring this of its suppliers.
• Update of the human rights risk maps in operations and countries of supply based on the
specific methodology implemented.
• Communication and reporting on advances in the due diligence system is one of the key
pillars of an effective due diligence system, for which reason accountability on human rights
management was increased in 2022 by means of Iberdrola’s first Human Rights Report,
which was externally assured by an independent third party.
• Incorporation of specific modern slavery issues to analyse this risk in the registration of new
suppliers.
III.2. Stakeholder engagement
• Stakeholder engagement
Stakeholder engagement
■ GRI 2-16 2-29
Iberdrola’s Stakeholder Engagement Policy –approved by the Board of Directors in February
2015 and last amended in December 2021– emphasises that “it is not possible to achieve the social
interest and develop a responsible and sustainable business model without the strong engagement
of the Company’s Stakeholders, which are defined as those groups and entities whose decisions
and opinions have an influence on Iberdrola and who, at the same time, are affected by the Iberdrola
group’s activities”. The value chain comprised of Iberdrola’s businesses means that there is a large
number of these groups, for which reason the company has decided to group them into eight
different categories that constitute its Stakeholders.
The initial identification and selection of Iberdrola’s Stakeholders was carried out through processes
of internal reflection conducted by the management team. The Stakeholder Engagement Policy
later ratified the Stakeholder categories described in the preceding section in 2015 and subsequent
updates.
On this basis, for the proper management of each of the Stakeholders, Iberdrola’s various areas and
businesses identify different subgroups that they deem relevant for more specific treatment.
Approach to Stakeholder engagement
Iberdrola has a responsible, sustainable and resilient business model that puts Stakeholders eat
the centre of its decisions. The company’s objective is thus to build relations of confidence with the
various Stakeholders, as well as to deepen their participation, engagement and collaboration.
The By -Laws, the Purpose of the Iberdrola group and the various corporate policies express the
company’s focus on the creation of shared sustainable value for Stakeholders related to our
business activities and our institutional reality in view of the commitments made in the Code of
Ethics.
In this regard, the Stakeholder Engagement Policy further develops this business philosophy
and establishes five objectives and seven principles of conduct, which serve as a guide for all the
group’s professionals to act and engage with Stakeholders.
Iberdrola has decisively driven compliance with its Stakeholder Engagement Policy (mentioned
above), through a Global Stakeholder Engagement Model based on the AA1000 Stakeholder
Engagement Standard 2015 (AA1000SES 2015), the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles 2018
(AA1000AP 2018) standard, and in its four principles of inclusiveness, materiality, responsiveness
and impact.
Among other objectives, this Model seeks to systematise Stakeholder relations throughout the
Iberdrola group, in all countries and businesses, and to create a corporate culture with respect to the
significance of dialogue with the Stakeholders for more sustainable performance by the company.
The Model constitutes a process of continuous improvement in and of itself, as shown below:
This process is implemented in the management of Iberdrola’s eight Stakeholder group in the five
main countries and at most of the Generation and Sustainable Energy facilities, as well as in the
various geographic areas of the Networks business.
It should be noted that the Model addresses the concept of impact from three different points of
view: the impact of reputational risks on Iberdrola; the impact of the action plans on Stakeholders;
and the impact of significant events on Stakeholders. This last aspect was recently introduced in the
Model, taking into account the latest reporting trends and standards. The ultimate goal is to enhance
positive impacts and minimise/mitigate those that are more negative for Stakeholders and the
company itself.
Relationship channels, significant topics and best practices
Iberdrola keeps the relationship channels32 with its Stakeholders updated and makes continuous
efforts to identify the issues that are most important to each of them. An analysis of these issues
shows that, while there are issues exclusive to each geographical area, most are common to
Iberdrola’s five main countries. The company also identifies best practices in relation to
Stakeholders, which are shared by the entire group.
32 The By-Laws state that "the Company´s corporate website its presence on social media and its digital communication strategy generally
Set out below is a summary of the most important Stakeholder engagement channels, both face-to-
face and online, and the main global issues detected, both generally among all Stakeholders and
specific to each Stakeholder group. Also included is a best practice example for each of the main

interest refer to regulatory compliance, the economic and social impact of the facilities on local
communities, and environmental impacts and the mitigation thereof.
Best practices by country
Special Stakeholder Engagement Plan for the Duero River Basin (Castilla y León)
Over the past two years, Iberdrola has developed a special Engagement Plan for the area surrounding its facilities in
the Duero river basin, the purpose of which has been to strengthen relations with Stakeholders in the area. This Plan
is based on a process of active listening and has allowed Iberdrola to gain an in-depth understanding of the
expectations of the main players in the area, and to explain in detail the technical management of the reservoirs by
our company. This initiative has been a beneficial exercise in communication with local and regional authorities,
Spain
business associations and local groups (fishermen, sports clubs, irrigation users, etc.). Iberdrola has therefore
launched various initiatives related to sustainable mobility (such as the installation of recharging points), the
commitment to the environment and the fight against climate change (reforestation in various municipalities), and
sports activities (hiking).
People-centred employee networks
ScottishPower’s employee networks are created and managed with a real drive and interest in bringing people
together, since their different backgrounds and experiences make the teams stronger. Supported by ScottishPower
and run entirely by employees, the growing number of networks have helped to build the business and also to attract
United
and retain diverse talent and to create an open and supportive workplace where everyone can grow. There are
Kingdom
currently several specific networks, including those related to professional development, LGBT, gender, parenting
and care, climate, multi-ethnicity, people with disabilities, etc.
Campaigns for active listening and public dissemination of projects
Community information and involvement work is carried out by specialised public outreach teams for each of
AVANGRID’s Network Business projects. The community is therefore given a voice and a communication channel is
created through which the needs and expectations of the Stakeholders on the different projects are identified. This
United
allows important issues to be addressed at an early stage in order to avoid potential obstacles in the future and
States
achieve positive results. The different public outreach campaigns include face-to-face meetings with the community,
distribution of information brochures, website, surveys and billboards, among other activities.
Public safety awareness campaign in relation to the electricity grid
Neoenergia companies launched the Safe Community Programme in 2022, which focuses on the safety of the
population through proper use of electricity. The campaign aims to improve how people coexist on a daily basis with
the distribution network through awareness-raising actions. These actions are based on identifying the main causes
Brasil of accidents involving the grid and will be carried out mainly at schools, community organisations, social institutions
and companies. They promote training and conferences, including the distribution of accident prevention bulletins. As
a result, the number of accidents and fatalities fell considerably during the year.
Responsible and sustainable partner company
Iberdrola Mexico carries out various social and environmental projects that are of common interest to all
stakeholders.
These programmes most notably include Luces de Esperanza, which brings electricity through solar power to rural
communities that do not have an electricity supply; Impulso STEM, which encourages women to pursue STEM
careers; and Huertos Comunitarios, which seeks food self-sufficiency, among other programmes.
México To enhance the connections with our stakeholders, the Sustainable Partnerships Programme was created with the
aim of strengthening this relationship, especially among our customers, through volunteering, workshops and
webinars.
All of these programmes have a positive impact on the communities, and significantly improve the public’s
knowledge and opinion of the Company.
Iberdrola’s response to all of these issues is reflected not only in the various indicators of this
Statement of non-financial information. Sustainability report, but also in the various Annual
reports of the Company. The corporate website and the websites of the businesses and the
foundations also contain information in this regard.
33 In the case of the cogeneration plants, the main Stakeholder group is ‘Customers’, for whom the most significant issue is customer
Similarly, this Statement of non-financial information. Sustainability report includes Iberdrola's
main impacts on its various Stakeholders, in line with the “social dividend” concept established by
Iberdrola's Governance and Sustainability System, understood as “the direct, indirect or induced
contribution of value that its activities represent for all Stakeholders”.
In recent years, Iberdrola has launched numerous measures to strengthen internal culture regarding
the importance of stakeholder engagement throughout the group. These measures include the
global working group called the Iberdrola Stakeholders’ Hub and the internal dissemination of ten
guidelines on how to relate to and engage with its Stakeholders.
The methodology described in the preceding sections enables the company to identify material
issues through direct sources. This analysis is completed with analysis through indirect sources,
such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DSJI), the Carbon Disclosure Project, the Materiality
Analysis, etc., described in the “Defining report content” section.
Considering all of the foregoing, Iberdrola has a complete Stakeholder management system, subject
to a process of continuous improvement, which allows it to increasingly engage all of the groups with
which it relates and to encourage their participation in all of the company’s decisions34.This is shown
by the fact that Iberdrola achieved the highest rating in the “stakeholder engagement” section of the
DJSI index in 2022, for the third year in a row.
34 Iberdrola prepares an annual Management Report on Iberdrola’s Stakeholder Relations, which summarises issues of interest detected within the various

Non-employee workers
■ GRI 2-8
Iberdrola encourages the use of technology in renewable and smart grids, which allows for progress
in the energy transition towards cleaner energy. It does so in part with the support of third-party
specialists ((contractor personnel), whose main jobs include those characteristic of Iberdrola’s own
activity: operation and maintenance, as well as inspections at technical facilities, activities regarding
preparedness and emergency response. They can also carry out maintenance work not
characteristic of Iberdrola’s main activity (maintenance of administrative buildings). Activities include
support to nuclear operation, mechanical, electrical and usage maintenance, onshore and offshore
wind farm construction activities, solar and cogeneration facilities, civil works, electromechanical
assembly, and startup. General services include staff for industrial cleaning, decontamination,
painting, and civil works. There are staff for IT, administrative, surveillance, and training support. As
regards security, there are physical security, radiological control, and fire protection personnel.
At some companies, we also have workers from Temporary Employment Agencies, who usually
carry out short-term jobs, helping to cover the positions of workers on leave or due to an occasional
increase in work, usually administrative work. They can also provide specialised work required for a
specific project, such as transmission, distribution and renewables.

Recruitment and selection: new hires
■ GRI 202 401-1
Iberdrola considers talent to be key factor in ensuring the organisation’s success each day. For this
reason, all of the companies forming part of the Iberdrola group work together to attract, select,
empower and retain their professionals, whose performance, knowledge and skills are aligned with
the company’s purpose, values and current and future needs.
The group has specific policies approved by the Board of Directors that regulate recruitment
activities (such as the Recruitment and selection policy and the Equality, Diversity and
Inclusion Policy), as well as a broader recruitment and selection process applied at the global level.
This process also relies on local practices in order to ensure that the best talent is attracted and
selected in line with the needs of each specific territory and is adapted to the specific legal system.
In 2022, in keeping with the reality of the global social context following the COVID-19 pandemic,
Iberdrola engaged in various activities to attract, select, empower and retain the best and most
diverse talent pool across its various territories. These actions include the following:
• The Iberdrola International Graduate Programme was launched in 2022. It is aimed at recent
graduates starting their professional careers, and its goal is to create an international pool of
graduates to meet future needs across the group. This 2-year programme includes a
development plan structured in a number of rotations, accelerating the acquisition of
knowledge and the learning curve. 164 vacancies were offered globally in 2022, 75% of
which had been filled by professionals by the end of the year.
• Attendance at job forums and holding talks and conferences, both in person and virtually, to
share the values of our company with students and encourage them to take part in our
selection processes. Iberdrola also has a presence at leading universities, taking part in
talent groups, round tables and specialised forums.
• A global campaign to recruit profiles for the offshore wind farm renewables business was
launched in 2022 to incorporate experienced professionals so as to develop new
international projects in the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Spain and Asia
Pacific, as well as the European market. 3,600 candidates applied through this campaign.
We have also continued with the following projects:
• Agreements with prestigious universities such as Comillas Pontifical University, Universidad
de Salamanca, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Yale University, Strathclyde
University, Instituto Tecnológico de Monterrey, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco and
Hamad Bin Khalifa University.
• Training programmes at the company. A combined total of 198 vocational students and 798
university students have begun their training at Iberdrola España, ScottishPower,
AVANGRID, Neoenergia, Iberdrola México and Iberdrola Energía Internacional.
• International scholarship programmes for master’s studies. In 2022, Iberdrola awarded 33
scholarships for master’s degree studies in the company’s areas of interest, and 10 more
scholarships are still to be awarded in Brazil.
• Encouraging the use of internal employee channels to promote opportunities for internal
promotion and international mobility: in 2022, 43.6% of published vacancies were filled
internally.
All of these initiatives form part of the activities that Iberdrola performs to attract and select talent.
The lesser degree of representation of women in the labour market, for certain technical profiles,
makes it difficult to achieve gender parity in new hires. These limitations are specific to the energy
sector, for which reason Iberdrola is engaging in numerous activities to promote an interest in
technical studies among school-age girls. Some examples of these initiatives are:
• STEAM alliance for female talent. Girls for science: Iberdrola España has joined this initiative
of the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, which includes, among other activities,
promoting teacher’s training in these areas, STEAM projects for education institutions, and
the creation of a quality stamp for companies and entities that engage in activities to promote
these disciplines.
• Eureka!, a five-year educational programme sponsored by AVANGRID, aimed at girls from
low-income families, minorities, and those who would be the first to go to university in their
family (in partnership with Girls Inc., a programme for young women with an interest in STEM
careers).
• In the United Kingdom, ScottishPower partners with Forth Valley College to design an online
programme with useful educational resources so that students can receive the best STEM
training.
• In Brazil, the Escola de eletricistas for women seeks to encourage women to join the industry
through learning programmes in theory and practice.
• Iberdrola México has developed the STEM Promotion Programme with the Institute for
Renewable Energy (IER) at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and
Universidad Tecnológica de los Valles Centrales de Oaxaca (UTVCO), seeking to encourage
the study of engineering among Oaxaca youth, particularly young women.
The principles described in the “Diversity and equal opportunity” and “Non-discrimination””
sections of this report apply both to remuneration and to the selection of professionals. The current
collective bargaining agreements at the companies of the Iberdrola group ensure equality in starting
wages for men and women.

Collective bargaining agreements
■ GRI 2-30
The relationship between the company and trade unions is based on respect and recognition of the
legitimacy of these institutions as workers’ representatives, within the principles and ethical values
that guide good trade union practices. The parties rely on negotiation as the main form of
establishing mutual rights and duties. Trade union negotiations are part of the labour relations
management model at group companies, and collective bargaining agreements are established to
reflect modern and advanced labour practices, while respecting the regional characteristics and
areas of activity of the various group companies and seeking to go beyond compliance with legal
requirements.
In this regard, the Company has significant experience in trade union relations and has worked with
these entities in accordance with the ethical and transparent principles that guide good negotiation
practices, which has resulted in reaching collective bargaining agreements.
Generally speaking, the collective bargaining agreements of the Iberdrola group apply to all
employees working under an employment relationship and for the account of the companies of the
group, regardless of the type of contract entered into, the professional group to which they are
assigned, their occupation or the job performed.
47 This table represents individuals who identify as men or women, so the figures segmented by gender may not coincide with the total
However, issues relating to corporate organisation, the law of each country or even the practices
and customs in each country lead to certain groups being expressly excluded from the scope of
collective bargaining agreements (for example, executive officers in Spain are not covered by the
agreement). In most situations the working conditions of these employees are determined by
collective bargaining agreements covering all other employees or by personal contracts based on
individual bargaining (e.g. salary, benefits, etc.), with all other conditions based on the collective
agreement itself. In the case of Brazil, Neoenergia has a national Human Resources Policy for those
cases in which employees may not be covered by collective bargaining agreements, on which the
premises of this policy are applied until an agreement is reached with the local trade union.
This is why there is not 100% coverage, as indicated in the table below:

The different organisational changes and significant events are formally reported in compliance with
the various legal provisions applicable at both the global and local level, as well as any applicable
terms of the collective bargaining agreements with regard to the labour relations of the group
companies. The minimum periods for giving notice, if they apply, range from less than one week to a
maximum of four weeks in the main countries in which the group operates.
Benefits
■ GRI 401-2
Iberdrola offers a number of benefits to its employees, including:
• Life insurance
• Medical insurance
• Disability insurance
• Maternity/paternity leave
• Pension fund
• Remuneration in the form of company shares
Diversity and inclusion
Governance model
■ GRI 405
Iberdrola has demonstrated its commitment to diversity and inclusion, and aims to reflect as faithfully
as possible the diversity of the communities of which it is part. The company seeks to strengthen
individual capabilities based on the firm belief that each person brings a special and unique talent
that enriches everyone. This commitment is shared with the Stakeholders with whom the company
interacts directly or indirectly: employees, partners, shareholders, suppliers, and customers.
To achieve a truly inclusive workplace, it is crucial to take action regarding the company culture, for
which reason diversity is integrated in the corporate values and conduct that define the way in which
the leaders and employees of Iberdrola conduct themselves.
With this goal in mind, the organisation has a robust governance system that specifies and promotes
the diversity and inclusion strategy, and has specific mechanisms that guide actions in this area,
such as, for example:
• Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy: seeks to create a good environment that
facilitates and promotes equality of opportunity, non-discrimination, diversity, and inclusion
for the professionals in group companies, consequently seeking a human resources
management model committed to professional excellent and quality of life
• Boards of Directors Diversity and Member Selection Policy: its purpose is to ensure that
proposals for the appointment of Company directors ensure a diversity of skills, knowledge,
experience, origin, nationality, age and gender within the composition thereof.
• Global Diversity and Inclusion Committee: Executive committee seeking to propose,
promote, and coordinate the company’s Diversity and Inclusion positioning in line with the
group’s strategy, and to involve the Senior Management of each of the subsidiaries in these
issues.
To guarantee a discrimination-free work environment, and in line with the Code of Ethics, the
Group is explicitly committed to not discriminate by reason of any condition (gender, sexual
orientation, age, disability, origin, or any other characteristics not related to the requirements to
perform the job) and has procedures to prevent conduct that violate this standard.
In addition to the global guidelines, the companies of the group have additional policies and
mechanisms to expand their commitment and adjust to country requirements.
Strategy and Commitments
To ensure proper coordination in the execution of the strategy established by the group, a common
working framework has been defined that considers the organisation’s current and future needs and
those of the communities in which it operates. Its scope focuses on gender, age, disability, origin,
sexual orientation, and war veterans, although the goal is to encompass all individual
characteristics.
The group promotes diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) through initiatives focused on talent,
culture, customers, and social contribution, partnering with its employees and other Stakeholders to
achieve an inclusive, innovative and sustainable energy future for all.
The group published its ESG commitments at the 2022 Capital Markets & ESG Day, as described in
section "I.4. Our ESG+F proposal". In the Social pillar, goals have been included that drive
diversity and inclusion and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda, as
mentioned in the "Targets ESG Social" section, including diversity and inclusion goals like women
in leadership positions and positions of responsibility, inclusive solutions for our customers, the
Electricity for All Programme, strong social activities with vulnerable groups through our Foundations
and volunteers, as well as with our suppliers, emphasising local purchases and the robust
sustainability and ESG policies and practices.
Apart from the global goals, these commitments are supplemented at the country level, taking into
account the social context.
Iberdrola has worked with major institutions for years, joining the United Nations Global Compact in
2002, and continues to support UN WOMEN, the UN body that supports progress towards equality
between women and men. It also supports the European Round Table for Industry (ERT), acting in
the working group that seeks to give greater visibility and support and connect large companies in
this regard.
2022 performance
The management of diversity and inclusion is seen not only as an urgent issue of equity or fairness,
but also as an opportunity for value creation from different perspectives. In this context, the company
launched its annual work plan under the motto “Our differences make our strength”, the main
activities of which include:
a. Global Diversity and Inclusion function: Creation of a global organisational structure to
articulate D&I commitment across the organisation.
b. Creation and implementation of an internal index to measure subsidiaries’ performance in
this area, identifying strong points and opportunities for improvement, so as to guide action
and share internal best practices. Review of processes aimed at ensuring a discrimination-
free work environment, taking into account the requirements of the market indices.
c. Review of alliances and partnerships with external entities that promote D&I to maximise
results and continue to influence social change.
d. Identification of opportunities to improve in Human Resources processes and more robust
data management - evaluation of the internal procedures to reach the goals set and
systematisation of D&I metrics.
e. Strengthening of internal communications and celebration of significant dates, through
activities that seek to raise awareness, foster dialogue, make role models from minority
groups more visible, and ensure the commitment of the workforce. There is a full week of
D&I activities at the main geographical locations.
f. Training programmes mainly focusing on promoting inclusive leadership and providing the
knowledge to value individual differences.
To the company’s commitment are added: Employee activities in the corporate volunteering
programme, through various D&I initiatives and the work of the foundations (ScottishPower
Foundation, AVANGRID Foundation, Fundación Iberdrola México, Instituto Neoenergia, and
Fundación Iberdrola España) to promote equality of opportunity in access, education, and the job
market, particularly for vulnerable people.

Relating to labour practices (including the supply chain)
Non-discrimination was an issue that was particularly significant for Stakeholders in this regard.
■ GRI 406
The principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunity applied within the Iberdrola group are set
out in both the Code of Ethics and the global policies and procedures that have been approved and
implemented (People Management Policy, Recruitment and selection policy, Equality,
Diversity and Inclusion Policy, etc.) and they are intended to avoid any discrimination on the basis
of gender, gender identity, age, origin, race, colour, language, religion, political opinion, social status,
belonging to an indigenous community, disability, health, marital status, pregnancy, sexual
orientation or other personal circumstances unrelated to requirements for performing one’s job.
In addition, specific plans and policies are in place in each country to ensure that the most relevant
challenges are addressed at the local level (policies to prevent discrimination against any type of
group, harassment prevention policies, etc.).
Group employees can report behaviour that may constitute labour discrimination both through the
ethics mailbox and through their respective supervisors or Human Resources.
The group received 50 grievances regarding labour discrimination through the various channels in
2022. 17 are under review and the other 33 have already been closed. Of the grievances already
closed, none ended in a written warning and 12 ended in dismissals as a result of improper action
relating to human rights. In addition, three complaints were received in Spain concerning the right to
organise. The Human Resources area is in charge of taking the appropriate disciplinary action.

Although there has been an apparent increase in the number of claims alleging discrimination, this
does not have a correlation with the actual number of cases.
Work-life balance and labour disengagement policies
Iberdrola promotes a work-life balance, as well as co-responsibility in the performance of family
obligations, providing measures for looking after family members and children, maternity leave and
breastfeeding benefits.
The most recent organisational dynamics and the implementation of new technologies promote
organisational efficiency, but at the same time blur the boundaries between work and private life. As
indicated in the People Management Policy, the group has made it a priority to ensure that its
professionals can fully enjoy their personal lives in a way that is compatible with their work.
This Policy therefore establishes guidelines that allow employees to effectively separate their
personal and work life, with special attention paid to disconnection from digital devices, without
favouring or discriminating against those professionals.
The uninterrupted schedule in Spain and Mexico is noteworthy of mention, with the company being
the first IBEX-35 company in Spain to establish this type of shortened workday. Flexible hours,
remote working and out-of-office work have also been implemented. Other measures that are
applied locally include the freedom for employees to choose the most appropriate workplace
depending on their function and measures to control overtime, switching off lights and computers
after certain working hours.
As a result of COVID-19, and to ensure safety, productivity and expectations in unprecedented
circumstances, the importance of communication between all levels of the Company was
emphasised. This has resulted in a more flexible working environment and hybrid and/or remote job
positions. In addition, policies to care for the health of employees were improved and actions to
promote quality of life and the well-being of its professionals were expanded. All this was carried out
while ensuring the quality of the essential service for the community provided by Iberdrola 365 days
a year, 24 hours a day, despite COVID-19.

Defending salary equality
Iberdrola facilitates and promotes equality of opportunity, non-discrimination, diversity, and inclusion
for Group professionals through its Equal opportunity and reconciliation policy, which calls for
equal pay for men and women for equal work and a wage review with uniform criteria for both
genders. The current collective bargaining agreements at the companies of the Iberdrola group
ensure equality in starting wages for men and women.
The total average salary of men and women at Iberdrola is quite similar. The ratio of men’s average
salary to that of women is 94.8% in 2022, taking into account fixed and variable salary and salary
supplements.
The salary gap in 2021 and in 2020 was 93.3% and 93.2% respectively, taking into account that
average salary, composed of base and variable salary, was used for the calculation thereof in 2020.
The underlying cause of the salary gap in certain age groups is the smaller presence of females
within the staff, a common situation in the energy sector, and which is more pronounced in
management and technical positions.
To mitigate this reality, Iberdrola is working in the following areas:
• On equitable professional development through the implementation of specific training plans
for women.
• On including new generations and promoting STEM careers in groups within the industry
with a higher minority representation.
• On promoting scientific careers among youth and women students, who will go on to form
part of the talent pool that Iberdrola will access in the future.
• On promoting measures of work-life balance that equally benefit men and women, so that
they can exercise co-responsibility in family duties and thus establish the conditions required
for parity.
• On gradually increasing the presence of women in positions of responsibility. As regards
Iberdrola’s current situation, positions of responsibility held by women in 2022 rose to 34.0%,
compared to 33.7% at the close of the prior year.
As regards leadership and other positions reporting to the Board of Directors or its committees, the
percentage of women in significant positions increased by year-end 2022 to 26.1% compared to
24.4% at the close of the prior year.

Safe work environment
The safety and health of people is a top priority for the Iberdrola group and therefore strongly
influences how all its activities are designed and carried out. This commitment forms part of the
group’s vision and values, and is formally set out in the Occupational Safety and Health Risk
Policy approved by the company’s Board of Directors, the basic goals of which are to:
• Achieve a gradual reduction in accident rates at the Iberdrola group’s businesses.
• Continue to improve safety conditions at work and make workplaces increasingly healthier.
• Promote a culture of excellence and coordinate global preventive actions at the group’s
companies.
Occupational Health and Safety Management System
■ GRI 403 403-1
The Iberdrola group has implemented Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems with
different scopes (country subholding, businesses), which allows it to comply with both current legal
provisions in the territories in which it operates and with the ISO 45001:2018 international standard.
All staff, workplaces and activities under Iberdrola’s control are covered by these systems, which
ensure that all requirements of the ISO 45001:2018 standard and local legal obligations in this
regard are covered.
The systems rely on a number of tools to meet these requirements:
a. prevention plans
b. operating procedures
c. management standards
In which the following are perfectly defined and identified:
a. duties and responsibilities
b. applicable policies
c. targets and indicators
d. desirable goals and resource requirements
All of the above aims to comply with local and international health and safety regulations in the
company’s different areas of operation, including aspects such as management of employees and
interested parties, leadership and commitments, policies, responsibilities, consultation with
employees, planning, identification of hazards and opportunities, legal requirements, resources,
skills, communication, document management, operations, change management, purchasing,
performance evaluation, management review, emergency response measures, ergonomic and
psychosocial risk management, continuous improvement, etc.
In recent years, the Iberdrola group, through its various subsidiaries and businesses, has also
implemented specific management and prevention measures in connection with COVID-19 focusing
on the protection of individuals and groups, as well as mental and emotional health tools for its
employees.
Examples of these measures include adjustment of sanitary, communication, cleaning and
disinfection measures; adjustment of spaces and compliance with safety distances in the new
COVID-19 environment; the establishment of prevention protocols; monitoring infected and
recovered persons on a biweekly basis; launching awareness campaigns; distributing
questionnaires to identify and assess psychosocial risk factors; creating specific well-being and early
intervention programmes and applications; proposing physical activity challenges for employees;
and providing a number of training resources, including a course on managing psychosocial factors
for mental health, face-to-face workshops on emotional management, online workshops on personal
well-being at work, the Más Apoyo programme, the COVID-19 helpline and the quality of life week.
Workers covered by the occupational health and safety management system
■ GRI 403-8
The Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems are designed in accordance with current
legal and regulatory requirements and apply to the entire workforce, contractors, suppliers and
visitors to protect their health and safety.
Information on incidents is collected, assessed and reported based on the procedures established
by law and internal company regulations. Certification under the ISO 45001:2018 management
system is a tool used to ensure uniformity with regard to the methodology for implementing these
protocols.
In general, all employees are covered by the occupational health and safety system in their
respective locations. However, there may be exceptions in certain locations as a result of specific
local norms. In Brazil, steps continue to be taken for 100% of the employees to be included in the
scope of the ISO 45001 certification. Although 75% of employees at Iberdrola Energía Internacional
are covered by the management system, it does not reach the minimum number of employees to
certify management systems in many of the countries in which it has a presence.

Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation
■ GRI 403-2
A process has been established to identify occupational safety and health hazards, which includes
the evaluation and prevention of occupational risks, in all the countries in which Iberdrola operates.
The procedures established by standardised institutions are followed in each country, as well as
those under the ISO 45001 standard. To manage this process, tools such as the following are used:
• Workplace risk assessment questionnaires.
• Regular risk assessments.
• Regular assessments identify the information needed for the annual review of the
occupational health and safety management systems, and are used to develop action plans
to mitigate risk.
• Safety inspections.
• Information sessions, regular training for employees identified as at risk, etc.
• Internal and external audits to ensure the effectiveness of their processes.
• Expanded analysis of causes that affected other systems in order to apply the findings and
prepare preventive and corrective actions to eliminate the causes of the event.
• Comprehensive assessment of low- and medium-potential incidents, investigation reports for
incidents with high potential or major consequences. All with a view to determining corrective
actions and lessons learned.
Iberdrola has and promotes the use of mechanisms to enable its employees, partnering companies
and other personnel affected to report any identified occupational health and safety hazards. These
mechanisms include various communication channels such as: telephone hotlines, computer
applications, ethics mailboxes, etc., but under no circumstances may these communications lead to
reprisals or adversely affect an employee, given that they are part of Iberdrola’s preventive culture.
All new employees are informed of this possibility, both in their orientation courses and in the safety
manual and instructions given prior to accepting the job position.
In line with this prevention culture, workers are always instructed to not proceed with work, or give
priority under any circumstance to performing any task that involves a risk without having the means
and knowledge needed to mitigate or eliminate the effects of the risk. Hence, at all locations,
employees have the right to speak out and to stop work or refrain from working if they feel that a
situation is unsafe. Lastly, when an incident is reported in any country, an investigation is carried out
on the possible root causes and contributing factors. In addition, general procedures are
implemented to monitor and complete the corrective actions resulting from the investigation (through
the hierarchy of controls stemming from applicable law).
■ GRI 403-7
One of the Iberdrola group’s pillars of action is to promote the health and safety of its employees.
This includes strict compliance with labour law, integrating occupational safety at all levels of the
hierarchy, and the use of systems to mitigate any impact on occupational health and safety.
These systems include the evaluation of occupational risks (including psychosocial risks), providing
theoretical and practical courses, carrying out regular health exams, designing mechanisms to
detect possible negative impacts on the health of staff, and implementing specific plans to mitigate
the negative impacts of work on health and safety.
This internal procedure must also be implemented by all partnering companies to manage the health
and safety of their contractors. This includes pre-qualification, selection, approval, supervision and
management of contractors to reduce risks and ensure the well-being of the employees.
Occupational health services
■ GRI 403-3
Iberdrola has occupational risk prevention policies that include regular legal assessments, hygiene
measurements, internal and external audits, ISO 45001 management system controls, health
monitoring, and accredited medical services.
These programmes include professional occupational health services, advice and support to
effectively manage occupational health and safety risks, absence management, drug and alcohol
testing, health monitoring, international travel assistance, sick leave management, first aid,
rehabilitation, specialist health counselling, overseas employee services, overseas business travel
health assessment, voluntary medical exams, employee self-referrals, early intervention, specialist
support services, wellness programmes, mental health programmes, skills development
programmes and healthy eating programmes. These services are protected by medical
confidentiality and files are kept in such a way so as to guarantee the confidentiality of the
information contained in the files.
Worker participation, consultation and communication on occupational
health and safety
■ GRI 403-4
The Iberdrola group companies strive to implement a culture of communication, consultation and
participation on topics relating to occupational health and safety. This is achieved through the
dissemination of prevention plans, the creation of joint and collective occupational health and safety
committees (with regular meetings), the provision of formal and informal channels for consultation by
employees, training plans on occupational risk prevention, general communication and consultation
procedures, panels of qualified employees, strategic safety meetings, the use of the corporate
intranet, and other media such as magazines, display screens at the plant, etc. On this basis:
In Spain, there is a Central Occupational Health and Safety Committee.
In the UK, there is a Health and Safety Governance Committee, as well as executive teams, a
Health and Safety Department, and Health and Safety Forums.
In the United States, the company has employee-qualified panels and a Strategic Safety Board that
meets on a monthly basis.
Brazil has Health and Safety Committees, as does Mexico, which has a Health and Safety
Committee. Iberdrola Energía Internacional (IEI) has committees that vary from country to country.

Worker training on occupational health and safety
■ GRI 403-5
Iberdrola España has training courses that cover the needs regarding information and training on
and awareness of occupational risks at the workplace.
In the United Kingdom, new employees are invited to a corporate introduction event and are
introduced to a number of senior executives who present various aspects of Iberdrola’s business.
They are also offered training on the Health and Safety Management System, along with technical
and operational training and assistance from experts in the field and suppliers.
In the United States, employees at AVANGRID receive technical and safety training through a
combination of fieldwork, classroom instruction and online training.
In Brazil, employees at Neoenergia receive training on the hazards, risks and controls associated
with each job function, and are not allowed to perform the work until they demonstrate the skills and
knowledge necessary to do so safely.
In Mexico, a training plan is established based on the performance evaluation.
At Iberdrola Energía Internacional (IEI), all employees take specific health and safety training
courses.
Promotion of health among workers
■ GRI 403-6
The Iberdrola group has established various procedures, measures and programmes to ensure
better occupational health and well-being of its employees. This includes human and material
resources, functions and responsibilities in the medical, monitoring and control areas.
In addition, there are flu vaccination campaigns, programmes for promoting health and preventing
diseases such as colon cancer, prostate cancer, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes
and glaucoma, as well as recommendations for healthy diets, access to physical exercise and
seasonal vaccination campaigns.
At Iberdrola España, Occupational Medicine activities fall within the scope of the Prevention Service.
Employees are offered a comprehensive benefits package that includes medical, dental and vision
coverage. These benefits are also extended to the immediate family members of employees. In
addition, the company assists in providing external medical therapies and treatments.
At the international level, access to medical services is managed by the Human Resources
divisions. These benefits include doctor’s visits, surgery, hospitalisation, medical exams and dental
care.
In the United Kingdom, two strategic initiatives were launched to improve the mental health of
employees, along with a plan to prevent and reduce physical problems at the workplace.
Furthermore, in Brazil there are outsourced contracts for flu vaccination, doctor’s visits and
screening services through a health plan, prevention campaigns and access to benefits from
physical exercise.
Two specific programmes to promote health were developed at Iberdrola Mexico: Total-pass (benefit
to promote the physical activity of personnel members) and Cuadro Médico (an electronic medical
file database containing the medical examinations and recommendations from the doctor at the
plant).
In the other countries, the Iberdrola group offers campaigns and programmes to promote health, as
well as psychosocial risk assessments and psychological support to employees.

Professional training and development
■ GRI 404
Iberdrola’s commitments to the training and development of its professionals extend to all
professional categories and all levels of responsibility.
Implementation of the Strategic Training Framework
The implementation of our Learning Strategy was strengthened in 2022 with new solutions that
reinforce the development of strategic skills. The main goal is for the training offering to cover
strategic priorities, adapting to all group companies.
Ongoing learning is a key element for promoting innovation, competitiveness and the progress of
Iberdrola’s professionals. For this reason, Iberdrola has a solid training model that reaches all of its
professionals in all categories. This firm commitment to training translated into more than 2.7 million
employee training hours in 2022. Along these lines, we continued to strengthen our ongoing learning
culture through initiatives like “Keep Learning”, which promotes employees’ active involvement in
their training.
It includes the following activities:
• The Group’s companies continued to adjust training plans and actions to the social and
economic context to meet employee needs.
• Training activities were carried out in Spain in 2022 in connection with our company’s current
activity and strategic orientation, focusing on key aspects of digitalisation, particularly through
the use of Multiplayer spaces with Digital Twins, which provide greater autonomy in content
creation, shortening the student’s learning curve and improving the benefits from the training.
Special efforts were made in actions with senior talent, through contrast activities at the
Networks business , in order to transfer the technical knowledge of more experienced
professionals while sharing good practices.
• In the United Kingdom, face-to-face training resumed in 2022 after the lifting of pandemic-
related restrictions, including the new awareness-raising programme on security for the
Networks business, and training in frequency converters for the technicians in the
Renewables business who will face the growth of the solar business.
• In 2022, the LinkedIn Learning offering continued to expand in the United States by means of
training courses designed to reinforce development programmes and initiatives, e.g., the
Engineering Development Program and Unconscious Bias Training. Furthermore,
training in “How to have difficult conversations” was launched, and resources were expanded
to help leaders to manage teams remotely.
• In Brazil, language programmes, integration for new employees, MBA/Postgraduate courses,
actions focusing on skills, as well as mandatory technical training are being offered, covering
strategic lines in our business, face-to-face and remotely, through the incorporation of more
digital tools.
• Mexico is using new learning methodologies, such as gamification, which have made it
possible to significantly reinforce training in D&I, through the LinkedIn Learning catalogue,
and in languages, through the Go Fluent platform.
• Due to geographic and linguistic dispersion, Iberdrola Energía Internacional has opted for
online training, through multilanguage platforms like Learning Light and LinkedIn Learning.
Professional Development Programmes
At the Iberdrola group, we will continue to train and develop our employees in accordance with the
commitments specified in the model designed by the company in 2019. The behaviours are inspiring
guidelines for professionals to act at each stage in their professional career.
Locally, the implementation of the model continues to be strengthened through various training,
development, and internal communication initiatives.
In Spain, several activities have continued due to their success and popularity, including
“Development Conversations”. Interviews in digital format with leaders in various fields, in line with
our values and principles of conduct, focusing on STEM professionals in 2022. Training itineraries
based on our principles designed in LinkedIn Learning. “An idea in 5 minutes” – development videos
with well-known speakers in areas of expertise relating to business and general issues aligned with
our principles. Team Leader Programme, with a four-year modular structure that is based on our
principles. “The change show” – internal videos where employees who are a leaders in each of the
principles recount their first-hand experiences and challenges. There was work in 2022 on
“Simplifying to be agile” and “Empowering to grow”.
All these resources are available to employees on a self-development platform structured around
the behavioural principles, while the Savia programme offers training courses based on their needs.
In the United Kingdom, the self-assessment process continued so that all employees have a clearer
vision of where they stand in relation to each of the six principles, including areas to be developed
and suggested training activities.
In the United States, the behaviours have been reinforced in the various learning tools and through
internal communications, as well as through the design of LinkedIn Learning pathways. A system of
questions was created for the selection processes that is in line with the behavioural model and
adapted to the different levels.
In Mexico, in addition to the internal communication initiatives, there have been several “TED Talks”,
an online conference format with internal leaders in each of the six behavioural principles. Each
leader gave a live talk where they shared their challenges and professional experiences related to
each principle, providing a space for questions and dialogue with those attending.
In Brazil, several internal communication initiatives are being developed, as well as the “letters of
recognition” programme, linked to each of the six principles of behaviour, the aim of which is for
leaders and employees to be able to make acknowledgements by sharing these letters, by email,
WhatsApp, Yammer or LinkedIn.
Promoting an environment where our employees can manage their own growth and development is
a priority for Iberdrola. To this end, in 2022 we continued to work globally to support our future
leaders in their development journey, as well as our established leaders, with multiple initiatives that
seek to offer opportunities to develop their skills. These are some of the global talent initiatives: IB
Talent Talks, conversations between established company leaders and high-potential employees in
the early stages of their careers. Leader for a Day Training: a work day in which a high-potential
employee shadows an experienced executive to experience situations that facilitate learning and the
development of leadership skills. Global Talent Mentoring Program, described below, is a mentoring
programme aimed at high-potential professionals. Leadership Academy: we offer our professionals
access to specific leadership development resources in partnership with Coursera. Finally, the
Experts Academy is aimed at very experienced specialist employees, with knowledge groups in 3
strategic areas: Cybersecurity, Smart Grids, and Smart Solutions.
Mentoring Programmes
Mentoring programmes — which involve pairing up an employee with a long professional career or
specific knowledge and a less experienced employee or an employee who needs to broaden their
knowledge in a specific area — facilitate the ongoing training of employees, strengthen a
collaborative culture, and promote the exchange of ideas and knowledge.
The following initiatives were carried out across the group:
The second global Digital Mentoring programme was completed in May 2022. This initiative seeks to
contribute to the digital transformation process at Iberdrola by connecting employees who need
support in innovation and digital transformation projects with others who have previous experience
in these areas. In this second year, more than 2,500 hours were dedicated to the programme, with a
participant satisfaction rating of 4.9 out of 5.
The initiative also contributes to the company’s inclusion strategy by connecting employees of
different generations, genders and cultures. In this second year, 44% of the 94 pairs were from
different countries, and 47% from different generations. Because of its success and popularity, the
programme has been strengthened within the development offering, and was held for the third time
in October 2022.
Two new global mentoring initiatives were also added in 2022:
• Women in leadership mentoring Program: its purpose is to boost these women’s careers,
providing them with leadership role models, strengthening their networking, and contributing
to their preparation to take on greater professional challenges. It was launched as a pilot
programme with 14 pairs, connecting high-potential female workers with executives in senior
positions across the Group. User satisfaction was 4.9 out of 5.
• Global Talent Mentoring program: with a similar goal as the previous programme, targeting
high-potential employees, and it also seeks to speed up their development by providing them
with training and leadership role models. 26 pairs took part, spending more than 560 hours in
the sessions.
Both through local and global initiatives, skills have been developed relating to the strategic needs of
the business, including: new technologies, knowledge management, transformative leadership,
change management, resilience, and diversity and inclusion.
Programmes to support transition
At the Iberdrola group, we are committed to our professionals throughout their careers, and in those
cases in which a career transition is necessary, we provide programmes to support transition, to
facilitate continued employability as well as career-end management.
In Spain, qualification plans are carried out on a planned basis, both in terms of training and of
methodologies, anticipating new production and/or environmental needs (greater digitisation, green
jobs, etc.) This allows workers to have the knowledge to remain at excellent levels of internal
employability.
Both in the United States and in the United Kingdom, outplacement services are offered through a
partner company that assists employees to identify and prepare their next professional move. It is a
tailor-made service that adapts to the employee’s specific needs to benefit as much as possible from
opportunities for employment.
Iberdrola Energía Internacional has developed a transition and support programme, comprising a
set of techniques worked on together with the employee in three fundamental aspects: improving the
employability of their profile through training; defining a job search strategy; and assistance in an
enterprise of self-employment, should the employee so desire.
Programmes for skills management and lifelong learning
■ GRI 404-2
The Iberdrola group is convinced that professional development helps the company achieve its
results and makes the organisation more efficient, by equipping employees with the skills and
competencies they need to perform their work efficiently today, while preparing them to undertake
greater responsibilities and challenges down the line.
All of Iberdrola’s training and development activities are based on the 70% experience / 20%
relationships / 10% training learning model.
• Iberdrola has various programmes aimed at high-potential professionals, including the MBA
in the Global Energy Industry, which is offered by Comillas Pontifical University in Madrid and
Strathclyde University Business School in Glasgow. This is a global programme that lasts
two and a half years, in which professionals from Spain, the United States, the United
Kingdom, Brazil and Mexico, and other locations take part. In 2022, this programme was
carried out for the fifth time, and more than 130 employees have been trained since it
launched in 2017.
• Iberdrola has an extensive training and development catalogue for professionals pursuing a
career in management. In 2022, the latest global programme was held in partnership with
IMD, in an online format, intended for professionals with technical degrees, in order to
provide them with the required behavioural skills and techniques. Leading employees on
various topics were also identified to share their knowledge with the rest of employees
through various internal channels.
• Iberdrola offers its technical specialists, middle managers and some of its executives a global
development model based on the group’s Behavioural Principles Model, which makes it
possible to specify individual development plans based on areas for improvement and
opportunities for growth.
Specific training for executives
For its management team, Iberdrola has for years been carrying out a number of development
programmes in partnership with the best internationally recognised schools and institutions:
• Energising Leadership Programme, an advanced management programme offered by
ESADE Business School.
• NEXUS, in collaboration with IMD, which offers training resources such as round-table
discussions for C-level executives from around the world, and the “First 90 Days”
programme, which seeks above all to support employees who take on critical management
positions during the change phase.
• The offering of regular digital Masterclasses and lectures was broadened for the entire global
management team in 2022. The classes were taught online by globally recognised experts
discussing strategic and current topics, with the participation of approximately 1000
professionals.
A major evaluation and update of the programme catalogue was carried out in order to keep them in
line with the company’s strategic needs and the state of the art.
2022 saw the first School of Leadership Alumni Event (SOLAE) - a meeting of alumni employees
who took part in Global Leadership School Programmes. This event was a great opportunity to
share learning, strengthen ties, and convey the Company’s strategic priorities and vision for the
future.
At the local level, training initiatives for executives have also been adapted in many cases to the
online format.
• In Spain programmes such as Leadership in change processes and Strategic people and
team leadership were offered. The Lead your Personal Effectiveness and Leader
Communication programmes also continue. As a result of the 2021 evaluation, several
programmes targeting managers were offered in 2022, focusing on the key areas identified.
• In the United Kingdom there is a continuation of the Advanced Leadership: Leaders of
Leaders and the Leadership Mastery Programme: New Senior Leaders, designed on the
basis of the needs identified in the organisation, as well as the Introduction to Management
programme for team leaders, and the Connected Leaders Community initiative.
• In the United States, there are several training programmes for the management team, such
as the Purpose-Driven Leaders programme, in partnership with Yale University, the
Leadership Essentials programme for new team leaders, and the Advanced Management
People: Leading People programme. All reinforced by the AVANGRID Mentoring
programme.
• Brazil has expanded its Lidera for the various executive levels with Lidera Gerentes and
Lidera superintendentes, following the results of the recent evaluation. The new format is
provided by the renowned Fundação Dom Cabral, which implements innovative training
methodologies through its international teachers.
• Mexico has the ADN del líder programme for the entire management team, including an
executive version for senior management. Negotiation workshops were also offered to the
management team.

Employees receiving performance and career development reviews
■ GRI 404-3
As indicated in Iberdrola’s People Management Policy, employee performance evaluations, and
communication of the results to the employees evaluated, are considered essential aspects for their
professional development. Some of the basic principles of conduct relating to this aspect and
described in the policy are:
• Perform regular evaluations of the performance of the professionals of the Group’s
companies based on objective standards.
• Communicate the results thereof to the employees evaluated, so as to favour their
professional development, contributing to the creation of a feedback culture.
At the Iberdrola group, employees are included in formal performance review processes, which vary
based on professional category and level of responsibility, as well as the country in which the
employees are located.
Employees can be reviewed through two types of processes, according to professional category and
the level of responsibility relating to their position.
Leadership
• Goals review (“What”): measurable, quantifiable and specific goals to be achieved over the
course of the review period, relating to the goals of the Company.
• Performance review (“How”): review of conduct during achievement of the goals, which must
be aligned with the Iberdrola group’s mission and purpose.
Qualified technicians, skilled workers and support personnel
• Performance review (“How”): employees are reviewed on the basis of a number of personal
competencies, which must be aligned with the Iberdrola group’s mission and purpose.
These processes are based on a corporate tool that allows management of the Human Resources
processes relating to the review. In this way, all users involved in these processes (employee,
evaluator and Human Resources team) can work globally in real time. Furthermore, the main
advantage of this tool is that it makes it possible to standardise and unify the focus and the
applicable guidelines and criteria.

Innovation and digital transformation projects
Today Iberdrola is the utility company of the future thanks to its ongoing commitment to innovation,
as shown by the fact that it has been recognised as the private utility company that invests the
most in R&D worldwide, according to the European Commission’s ranking.
Iberdrola invested a total of 363 million euros in R&D in 2022, a 7% increase over 2021. The R&D
efforts within the Iberdrola group are organised around five main pillars, which in turn are aligned
with the fundamental vectors of transformation of the energy industry, decarbonisation of generation,
promoting the use of smart grids and the electrification of demand:
• Disruptive technologies that are increasingly efficient, sustainable and environmentally
friendly, enabling optimisation of facilities and processes. Green hydrogen, innovative
renewable energy, sustainable mobility, energy storage, smart grids, the electrification
of heat, and the recycling of clean technology components will contribute to industrial
transformation, with a focus on sustainability, green and affordable energy, and employment.
• New products and competitive services that meet customers’ needs, with more
personalised content and offerings.
• Digitisation and automation in all businesses and processes, with the introduction of
new technologies such as blockchain, big data, the Internet of Things, virtual reality, artificial
intelligence, etc.
• Innovation with start-ups, entrepreneurs and suppliers, intended to develop partnerships
and new, disruptive business models, encourage the exchange of knowledge, and act as a
driving force among its partners.
• A culture of innovation and talent. Iberdrola promotes a culture of innovation through the
transfer of knowledge, the attraction of talent and the encouragement of the entrepreneurial
spirit. The Universities Programme, Iberdrola U, involves the development of various
initiatives with academia, such as endowed chairs, R&D projects, student training, in-house
training and young entrepreneurs.
This year’s highlights include the inauguration of the largest green hydrogen plant for industrial
use in Europe, located in Puertollano, with an electrolyser capable of producing 3,000 tonnes of
renewable H2 per year. This pioneering plant will generate 100% green hydrogen with zero CO
2
emissions thanks to the use of 100% renewable sources. In addition, the first Innovation Week
was held at the Global Smart Grid Innovation Hub, a week dedicated to analysing the role of
electricity grids in the energy transition. All of these activities are included in the new Iberdrola
Innovation Report 2020-2022, along with other significant R&D initiatives and projects carried out
in recent years.
Some of the innovative initiatives are set out below, classified by major category:
Renewable energy
Improved efficiency at wind farms, photovoltaic plants and hydroelectric facilities.
There has been continued development of Big Data techniques for the MeteoFlow Forecasting
System to obtain weather forecasts. Along these lines, there has also been continued development
of tools like CHINOOK to account for climate variability, including solar variability, and Weather
Research and Forecasting (WRF), optimising their performance. The implementation of WRF-Hydro
for hydrological forecasting has also been optimised. There has also been progress in calculating
theoretical solar and wind production capacity in the ENERPREDIC project. In the operations area,
there has been work on developing new solutions to improve the efficiency of the tools of the
DOMINA system. As regards wind power, the RECURSO project has devised a methodology for the
hybridisation of wind farms — both those operational and under development — with photovoltaic
power. With regard to solar power, progress has been made in analysing the variability of the
horizontal resource using ground stations, incorporating the spatial variability of solar radiation. Also
noteworthy of mention is the company’s participation in Next Generation Earth Modelling Systems
(NEXT GEMS), which explores these lines of work in depth by applying high-performance computing
(HPC) and Earth-system Models. In the area of maintenance, work continues on the ASPA system,
an artificial intelligence methodology that allows the theoretical behaviour of the wind turbine to be
simulated at all times through a digital model. Lastly, the AEROEXTENS and DIAGNOSGRE
projects provide new knowledge on the behaviour of wind turbines in terms of machine control
strategies. As regards grid integration, the THIRTIES project aims to optimise decentralised voltage
control and a system of joint participation at the point where services are provided. In addition,
storage solutions have been studied in the ALMACENLAD battery project. Also noteworthy of
mention is the study on the possibility of installing floating photovoltaic sites on hydroelectric power
plant reservoirs. This work has been brought together in the HIBRIDAR project.
Improvements in the field of circular economy
During 2022 there was analysis of the needs for future capacity, the best location and the best
technologies to make it possible, including reversible variable-speed turbines and lower-cost
penstocks (NEWPUMPING project). These improvements, together with the digitalisation of
management and hybridisation, will improve the management of all renewable generation. In this
regard, two projects stand out — HYDROSMART and HYDRODEMAND —, which supplement the
development of these lines of work. The other two projects related to pumped capacity that have
been launched are HYDROSES and AVANHID.
Improvement in innovation in offshore wind farm projects
The ROMEO and FLAGSHIP projects are still underway, and MEGAWIND, a project focusing on
methods for welding joints on foundations, has been launched. With regard to floating offshore wind
power, the MARINFLOAT project, which aims to implement a portfolio of projects in Spain, has
continued to carry out bird and marine mammal studies, environmental impact studies, metoceanic
studies and theoretical studies of the terrain.
Improvement in new lines of work
Research has been carried out into new technologies for the recycling and recovery of wind turbine
blade waste; in agrovoltaics, which is based on the combination of renewable energy with
agricultural and livestock energy; new developments in photovoltaic solar power generation have
been analysed to optimise the use of solar resources in the NUEVASOLAR project, through new
solar panel technologies, dry cleaning methods for panels and new more efficient structures; the
ECOSIF project was launched to study the metal structures that support the panels to find the best
solutions depending on the type of soil.
In relation to promoting a culture of innovation, the YO SOY INNOVADOR and the Renewables
Digital Evolution Plan (2018-2022) initiatives launched in previous years have continued.
Clean generation technologies
Efforts in the generation area focused on digitalisation, operational flexibility and efficiency, reduction
of environmental impact, and improved safety at the facilities during 2022:
In the field of nuclear power, work continues on integrating digital tools and processes that
contribute to maintaining the high levels of safety, reliability and efficiency of the power plants in a
clear commitment to digital transformation. In this regard, the COATI project was launched for the
development of software to enable the implementation of specific loading plans for spent fuel
elements, which caught the interest of potential users. In addition, 3D models are being used to
simulate critical processes such as container loading, along with the use of augmented reality and
virtual reality. Licensing for the new fuel also continues, and various tasks are being carried out in
relation to its validation process and use at the Cofrentes nuclear power plant.
In the field of thermal generation, the company continues to develop the lines of work established
and to expand on the digital transformation of the power plants to adapt them to the new operating
scenarios with low pollutant emissions, and to the growing demands for efficiency, flexibility and
speed of response. Within the framework of emissions reduction, the pioneering REDEMIS project
was successfully completed and achieved exceptional results in reducing start-up times and CO2,
NOx and CO emissions. Work was also completed on the SIRO project, which involved
technological development based on artificial intelligence and other digital technologies, and aimed
to develop and validate a robotic inspection system for generators. Progress also continued on the
FLAGSHIP project, which aims to develop advanced simulation and optimisation tools for operating
combined cycle power plants, creating digital twins of the facilities that allow actual simulations of
off-design scenarios.
In the area of energy management, the aim is to bring greater flexibility to the electricity system.
With this objective in mind, a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) was created to provide services as an
aggregator of distributed energy resources — for both generation and consumption — that can be
managed from our control system to then be managed in the electricity market. Work also continued
on the Flexener Project, where new technologies are being researched in the areas of generation,
storage and even demand for the integration of a 100% renewable, flexible and robust electricity
system. New voltage control strategies for transmission grids are being developed to find a
solution to the technical challenges of voltage control with renewable generation. The company also
continues to participate in European projects such as Posytyf, which analyses from a theoretical
approach the contribution of renewable technologies to providing services for balancing and
controlling voltage through Virtual Power Plants. It also collaborates in the BeFlexible project, which
aims to design an ecosystem that not only provides the technology and helps to increase
participation in flexibility markets, but also facilitates appropriate coordination between all players
involved in providing services to the distributor, with a special focus on the consumer. Green
hydrogen is also being promoted and applications are being developed, for example in the
FEDECOM project, to enable the smart integration of electrolysers into the system to help build and
manage an increasingly complex renewable energy mix.
Retail - New projects and services
Innovation is essential in retail activities, in order to offer customers the products and services best
suited to their needs, which rapidly evolve. Thus, in 2022 Iberdrola worked on:
New initiatives to improve customers’ experience:
Work continued on new functionalities integrated into the Iberdrola Customer Apps. The
alerts and personalised consumption notifications have therefore been updated, and tips
have been included to help our customers save money and allow them to move towards
more sustainable consumption patterns. All of this is done using data analytics and predictive
models. At the level of self-consumption facilities, the entire process can be traced so that
customers understand their situation at all times. In addition, integration with the
Consumption Monitor has evolved to provide more real-time information. Lastly, there was
the launch of the Solar Communities solution, which is a fully digital format from the moment
it is contracted.
New products and functionalities:
• In relation to the distributed generation solution for self-consumption, known as Smart Solar,
the Solar Cloud service was incorporated, where residential customers can use their surplus
energy to reduce the bills of other points of supply owned by the same customer. In turn, this
service allows energy surpluses to be carried over to other months where they can be offset
against the bill for the residence. It also allows for incorporating a storage system. The first
Smart Solar communities have also been enabled, through which neighbouring customers
receive 100% renewable energy and savings on their bills. Iberdrola also created a Solar
Communities website so that customers can contract this service online.
• With regard to Smart Home, the Advanced Smart Assistant was developed, which is a
comprehensive energy management system based on AI that is capable of autonomously
managing all Smart Solutions that customers have in their homes. This generates added
value on each of the solutions, and savings on the customer’s bill, both through the
optimisation carried out by the assistant itself, and through personalised messages and
recommendations that the user will receive.
• Smart Mobility most notably includes the boost given to the deployment of high-power
stations in the public charging network that will facilitate intercity travel in electric vehicles,
enabling vehicles to charge more than 200 km in 5 minutes. In addition, the launch of the
global charging point management system, or EVA Platform, will provide technological
support for the deployment of charging points that Iberdrola intends to undertake in the
countries in which it operates. In the last year, the company led a project to develop the first
Mediterranean Corridor for heavy road transport that is 100% electric. In the field of
micro-mobility, the electrification of transport in urban areas also involves promoting Personal
Mobility Vehicles (PMVs) such as bicycles, scooters or electric motorbikes. Iberdrola has
also promoted the Net-Zero MAR Alliance, a non-profit collaborative platform that aims to
“accelerate” the decarbonisation and electrification of the maritime sector in Spain. The
company also collaborates on proposals with municipal councils and urban developers,
proposing solutions that have an impact on citizens.
• Smart Clima is committed to the refurbishment and energy efficiency of buildings, providing
solutions for energy savings and the decarbonisation of both single-family homes and
buildings. The proposal consists of a final turnkey product that combines different solutions:
efficient electrical air conditioning and heating with heat pumps, steps taken towards the
thermal insulation of the house (façades, roofs, windows), energy supply and optimal
maintenance of equipment. It is therefore able to provide customers with simplicity, quality
• The aim of the Industrial Decarbonisation team is to completely electrify and decarbonise
production processes in the industrial sector. The most important technologies to be able to
carry out this electrification include heat pumps, electric boilers and thermal storage. This has
led to the launch of projects like that of the AN Group, which consists of implementing an
industrial heat pump at the Vicolozano factory. Iberdrola is also promoting the development
and implementation of heating and cooling networks in Spain with the aim of decarbonising
heating, cooling and hot water systems in cities using renewable energy sources.
Smart grids
In 2022 i-DE Smart Grids augmented the strategic Global Smart Grids Innovation Hub (GSGIH)
project, a pioneering centre and global leader in smart grid innovation. The GSGIH closed the year
with more than 90 partners, and a dynamic organisation based on multidisciplinary working groups
in which an open, transparent and streamlined innovation model is developed with the industrial
innovation ecosystem. The GSGIH ended the year with the launch of a new laboratory, the
Innovation Data Space (IDS), to promote artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics. The
centre hosted its first Innovation Week, a week dedicated to analysing the role of electricity grids in
the energy transition, which brought together young talent, partnering companies, universities and
institutions. The GSGIH also had a presence at ENLIT and in various media and social networks,
communicating the importance of innovation in electricity grids to society.
In general, work is carried out in accordance with the New Low Voltage Grid model, enhancing the
digitalisation of the grid with various projects such as installing the firmware of the new smart CN
with high added value functionalities and providing the smart transmission centre with advanced
sensors, which enables anomalies to be detected, and faults and incidents to be anticipated; as
regard the active operation of the LV grid, the most notable projects include the eLVIS project, a low-
voltage control system, the management of incidents through mobility applications, and the
Technical Supply Management project, which provides new grid calculation and simulation
capabilities.
At the European level, the BeFlexible project was launched, the main objective of which is to
increase the participation of prosumers in order to increase the flexibility of the electricity system.
Work continued on the ONENET project, which focuses on developing new customer-centric
flexibility tools, with an open, streamlined architecture based on the concept of an interoperable
network of platforms with coordinated operation. There was also the successful completion of the
COORDINET project, which involved companies and institutions from ten countries to provide a
favourable framework to facilitate the participation of all agents. Work continued on the FLEXENER
project, the main objective of which is to research new simulation technologies and models in the
areas of renewable generation, storage systems, flexible demand management and operation of the
distribution network. In the field of network integration, work on the second phase of the Caravaca
BESS project continued. There was completion of the FLEXIPOWER project, with the goal of
achieving the integration of various battery energy storage systems (BESS) in operation, as an
alternative to reinforce the weak areas of the grid with photovoltaic generation. Progress has also
been made in the DSO-DTR project, with the completion of the first pilot programmes and the
launch of a project to improve line sensor technology, which gives information on the actual capacity
at any given time depending on meteorological variables and network operation.
In Spain, work continues on the new smart substation, through the development of a
comprehensive substation control system in accordance with international standards, thus achieving
a sustainable facility. In the field of cybersecurity, the TrueValSec project was completed in 2022
with the aim of designing the security mechanisms used at the different levels of communication in
the electric metering infrastructure of Smart Cities. The SEC2GRID project was also approved to
develop new smart electronic devices for an electricity distribution grid that is more secure against
cyber-attacks. Progress was made on the project for the digital substation model so as to improve
efficiency through the automation of monitoring and remote operation. This project includes
developing the cloud platform for managing and viewing the new sensors distributed throughout the
grid through easily integrated IoT protocols. The scope of the new processes associated with the
STAR+ project continue to be expanded, and LV incidents are detected and diagnosed without
needing to receive a call from the customer, thus resolving the incident in less time through smart
diagnostics.
In the United Kingdom, various projects in the digital and data management area should be noted,
such as Digi-GIFT, which looks at developing an interoperable data exchange platform;
Predict4Resilience, which aims to develop actionable forecasts of extreme weather events weeks
in advance; and TWINe, which looks at deploying a digital twin of the entire network. In the field of
heating, the Flexible Heat project will maximise the flexibility of domestic heating to reduce and
smooth peak demand, and the Heat Balance project will assess different thermal storage solutions
that can be part of heating networks. Projects are also being developed to electrify rail transport and
transform railway stations into connected multi-energy centres.
In Brazil, grid innovation aims to transform the customer experience, providing efficient and
personalised digital channels, contributing to the expansion of smart grids, and supplying electricity
efficiently, sustainably and economically. Work is being carried out in areas such as security,
improving the automation of grid maintenance, modernisation of information infrastructure,
standardisation of processes, preservation of network assets, and increased reliability and control,
etc. Noteworthy is the GODEL project, the aim of which is to identify and reduce technical and
commercial losses, and the Digital Connection project, which focuses on transforming the
customer experience through smart solutions such as the Remote Virtual Assistant (RVA).
In the United States, there is continue implementation of smart technologies like smart meters (AMI),
automating substations and circuits, and implementing advanced distribution management systems
(ADMS) and distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS). All this allows control of
operations in real time and improves grid reliability.
Iberdrola Innovation Middle East, Iberdrola’s technology hub in Qatar, is developing various
initiatives such as developing devices for real-time thermal monitoring of the grid and predicting
faults or analysing the grid’s capacity to accommodate distributed energy resources. In addition,
work is being carried out on designing an Adaptive, Smart Building Energy Management System,
and the application of a cyber-secure transactional energy framework to design, operate and
manage smart and connected communities.
Green Hydrogen
Iberdrola has made progress in consolidating the use of Green Hydrogen to decarbonise other
sectors (industry, transportation, et.).
The IPCEI seal was obtained during the year for the construction of the next phases of the
Puertollano I, Puertollano II, Palos de la Frontera I and Palos de la Frontera II hydrogen projects.
The Puertollano I Project (20MW electrolyser) will generate 1,200 tonnes of green hydrogen to be
incorporated within ammonia generation processes. In addition, with regard to the decarbonisation
of mobility, the first phase of the new Barcelona hydrogen plant has begun commercial operation,
making it possible to supply hydrogen to 24 TMB buses.
At the national level, two industrial research projects are being led: the ATMOSPHERE project,
which aims to develop new technologies for storage, generation and safety in green hydrogen
plants, and the AVOGADRO project, which aims to develop an advanced hydrogen refuelling
system for mobility applications. At the international level, there was a decision to participate in the
FEDECOM project, which will develop tools for optimising the Puertollano and TMB plants, in the
AMBHER project, which will work on MOF storage systems and ammonia synthesis, and in the
HYLICAL project, which will work on new hydrogen liquefaction technologies.
Lastly, construction began on the 1.25 MW green hydrogen plant for IFF in Benicarló, where all
grey hydrogen will be replaced by green hydrogen currently used in manufacturing perfumes.
Iberdrola Ventures - Perseo
Iberdrola Ventures - PERSEO is the start-up programme created by Iberdrola in 2008 with €200
million in funding in order to encourage the development of a dynamic ecosystem of start-ups and
entrepreneurship in the energy sector. The programme focuses on new technologies and business
models that allow for improvements to the sustainability of the energy model through greater
electrification and decarbonisation of the economy.
Since its creation, the programme has channelled investments of more than €125 million in start-
ups in the energy sector worldwide. Its base of more than 36 million consumers and more than
60 GW of installed capacity have allowed Iberdrola to provide the start-ups with a sizable “real-life
laboratory” that is aiding the technological and commercial development of the companies. The
major achievements in 2022 include:
• Pilot projects: In 2022 there were more than 25 pilot projects with start-ups in technological
areas like IoT, robotics and batteries, as well as in areas like network construction and
maintenance, hybridisation of land use (agrovoltaics), electric mobility, and energy efficiency.
• Challenges: In 2022 Iberdrola brought 10 challenges to the start-up community in areas like
renewable generation, onshore and offshore wind energy and photovoltaic energy; energy
efficiency and decarbonisation in sectors like data centres, agriculture, and farming; and
operation and maintenance of power grids and their protection against natural disasters.
• Investment: There was the launch of a new €300 million Venture Capital Fund, Seaya
Andrómeda Sustainable Tech Fund I FCR, in partnership with other investors, to invest in
European technological scale-ups related to sustainability, the energy transition, and the
electrification of the economy.
• “Venture Builder”: Perseo continued the initiative launched in 2020 for investing in and
creating (from scratch) electrification and the circular economy businesses — in areas such
as the recycling of photovoltaic modules, wind-turbine blades and batteries — and in sectors
resistant to decarbonisation, such as industrial heat production and heavy transport. The
initiative has led to the organisation of the companies C2Nature, a platform to generate CO2
credits through the promotion of highest-quality projects, and EnergyLoop, a company
created with FCC to lead the recycling of renewable facility parts, with the initial goal of
recovering wind turbine blade parts.
Perseo also invested in Basquevolt, an initiative launched in 2022 to start a leading solid-state
battery production line in Europe.

Our commitment to our customers
Supply quality
■ GRI EU 28 ■ SASB IF-EU-550a.2
Quality of service and its ongoing improvement is one of the fundamental goals of Iberdrola’s
activity. A quality-evaluation system and the implementation of rigorous internal and external
processes enables the achievement of objectives linked to this ongoing improvement. Moreover, all
the distribution companies have regulatory incentives or penalties linked to improvement in the
quality of supply. By the end of 2022, the Group’s Networks business improved its supply quality
levels (compared to 2021) in all the countries in which it is present.
Iberdrola monitors the quality of the service provided in the various countries, measuring it on the
basis of the frequency and duration of interruptions in supply. However, the measurements in each
country are made according to different standards following the respective legal or regulatory

Customer satisfaction
■ GRI 2-29
Iberdrola uses various mechanisms to measure customer satisfaction levels and to gather customer
opinions, verify compliance with its quality standards within the customer service and sales
channels, and implement suggestions for improvement. The most significant studies by country are:
In Spain, in the Electricity Production and Customers Business, there are various indicators for
measuring users’ satisfaction level, including the Detailed Satisfaction Study. Once a year, it
measures overall satisfaction with the service received by the customer and offers detailed
information about attributes such as agility, training, and handling of channels, clarity of the invoice,
claims management, quality of supply, price competitiveness and electronic billing, whether for large
customers, companies, small businesses or residential customers. In 2022, for the eighth
consecutive year, overall satisfaction exceeded a score of 7 out of 10.
65 Quality data for Spain (NIEPI and TIEPI) include commercially sensitive information.
66 The value reported for 2021 does not exclude specific exceptional events (force majeure), as, at the closing date for this Report, the
The company also has a Voice of the Customer Measurement Programme, which allows
satisfaction surveys to be performed in a transactional manner (immediately following an interaction)
at various key times in the customer relationship, while also analysing unstructured information
through the use of text analytics and machine learning. All of the foregoing enables more agile
detection of customers' opinions and the prioritisation and implementation of improvements. This
programme measures and analyses factors in the following principal areas:
• Attention to the Telephone Channel
• Attention to the Customer Service Points
• Attention to the Digital Channels (Web/App)
• Use of products and services
Most of the studies use the NPS (Net Promoter Score) index, which ranks the recommendations
made by Iberdrola’s customers. This index highlights points received for customer service and the use
of products and services.
Regarding the Networks Business, calls are made periodically to customers who have contacted the
company, giving them the opportunity to complete a satisfaction survey about the service that was
provided. These results are used for the Customer Satisfaction Index and to detect and resolve
problems with the service.
In the United Kingdom, customer satisfaction is measured by a number of internal and external
studies conducted by the Customer Insight department. These analyses include various satisfaction
surveys that vary in frequency from monthly to annually.
At the external level, the key comparative studies measuring the satisfaction of ScottishPower’s
customers as compared to its competitors' customers are Uswitch, Which? (with annual surveys) and
the UK-CSI study, which is published twice per year. These studies analyse specific areas, such as
customer billing, campaign follow-up and complaints. ScottishPower received an overall customer-
satisfaction rating of 60.7% in the Uswitch survey, improving in the categories of renewable services,
energy efficiency, mobile apps and the installation of smart meters. In Which? it received a score of
55 out of 100. In UK-CSI, its satisfaction indicator was 66.5 out of 100.
The most significant internal analysis is Pulse, which is performed monthly and measures confidence,
loyalty, ease of use, value, etc. Based on this analysis, measures are being implemented to improve
the handling of customer complaints. Several thousand customers also participate in the TalkEnergy
panel, which gathers information on important topics and prepares action plans.
In the regulated business, the scores reported in the Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction
(BMCS) study conducted by Ofgen (the British electricity market regulator) were used as an indicator
to set the regulatory incentive. The index is calculated on the basis of a survey that covers all
customers who requested customer service, and takes into consideration various aspects of the
service that the customers received. The scores received by the distributors SP Manweb, SP
Distribution and SP Transmission in 2022 were 9.18, 9.09 and 8.26 out of 10, respectively.
In the United States, the subsidiaries of AVANGRID measure perception of the service and customer
satisfaction through telephone surveys. In 2022 the AVANGRID companies obtained an overall score
of: RG&E 80.4%; NYSEG 84.7%; CMP 87%; UI 89%; CNG 88%; SCG 89%; and BGC 93%.
In Brazil, the Brazilian Association of Electric Power Distributors (Associação Brasileira de
Distribuidores de Energia Elétrica - ABRADEE) carries out a satisfaction study known as the
Perceived Service Quality Satisfaction Index (ISQP) based on an evaluation of performance in the
following areas: operational excellence, economic/financial management, customer assessment,
social responsibility and management quality. The ISQP is obtained through evaluations made by
customers through the surveys administered by Instituto Innovare. Neoenergia received a score of
69.6% for overall satisfaction in 2022.

89.1% in Spain, 88.9% in the United Kingdom, and 86.7% in the rest of Europe.
Responsible communication
Marketing communications
■ GRI 417
Iberdrola goes beyond regulatory compliance in its advertising and marketing communications, and
adopts mechanisms and voluntary codes that ensure such communications are transparent and
truthful. The Code of Ethics also applies in this area for all employees regardless of their area of
responsibility.
Iberdrola not only complies with applicable advertising practices codes in all locations, but has also
implemented internal approval procedures to ensure that all advertising material presented to
society is in accordance with responsible advertising practices.

■ GRI 417-1
Regarding labelling, Iberdrola informs its customers about the sourcing of the energy placed on the
market and its associated environmental impact, generally through its electricity bills and other
commercial communications, and always abiding by assurance standards and the format required
by the various national agencies (CNMC in Spain, Ofgem in the United Kingdom, ANEEL in Brazil,
etc.).
Information on customer complaint mechanisms and communication channels is included in the
“Stakeholder engagement” section.

Health and safety of customers and of the general population
■ GRI 416
Users’ safety is of paramount importance to Iberdrola. For this reason, it makes information and
training available to the various emergency services and law enforcement services in order to
explain the conflicts that they may encounter during the performance of their work and how to act in
situations involving electrical risks.
All stages of the life-cycles of electricity and gas (planning, production activities, transmission and
distribution, marketing) are closely regulated because these products are essential to the country’s
economy and improve the quality of people’s lives.
At all stages, alignment with each country’s environmental and labour regulations is essential to
minimise possible operational risks (operation of generation plants, electrical risks and risks
associated with the handling of gas, etc.). In addition, in the planning and marketing stages, public
participation (through social and political representatives) and communication with consumers are
two other key factors for protecting public health and safety.
■ GRI 416-1
All processes required for the supply of electricity and gas at all stages as described above ensure
that these products arrive at the consumer with an appropriate level of assurance for their health
and safety. The impact on health and safety of 100% of the significant product and service
categories is assessed to improve them.
The following table lists incidents in terms of impacts of products and services on the health and
safety of customers. There were 68 incidents leading to fines in 2022, all in the United States, due
primarily to alleged violations of federal safety regulations for facilities. A non-monetary penalty was
also imposed.

Furthermore, as described above, the construction, operation and maintenance of electric
infrastructure involves certain risks, which may at times give rise to incidents affecting people
outside of the company. In most of the cases detected, the incidents are related to third parties
working without safety measures in the areas around the distribution facilities, as well as accidental
contacts with the network.
The following table shows the accidents of this kind that occurred during 2022. Nine of these
accidents (including one death) occurred in the United Kingdom; five in Spain (including three
deaths); 13 in the United States (one death); and 112 (including 31 deaths) in Brazil. Year after year,
significant work has continued in the areas of awareness-raising and training for the general public
in order to reduce these numbers as much as possible.

Electromagnetic fields
Historically, the possible influence of electrical and magnetic fields on human health has been the
subject of a certain amount of public debate. However, the various studies performed in this regard
have identified no detrimental effects on human health for the maximum emission figures
established by applicable law. Iberdrola, following the precautionary principle, applies the rules in
this regard and has shown itself willing to work with the public authorities in adopting such
preventive or mitigating measures as may be deemed appropriate to avoid risks or harm to health.
In 2022 one complaint connected to electromagnetic fields (EMF) was received in Spain. It should
be pointed out that electromagnetic field levels of facilities in Spain, be they transformation centres,
lines, or power substations, are far below legal limits, which in turn were set, with an extremely wide
safety margin, by the Recommendation of the Council of European Communities of 12 July 1999
(1999/519/CE), which was transposed in Spain by RD 1066/01 of 28 September, and was also
ratified in Spain by the Ministry of Health and Consumption and by the Royal Academy of Exact,
Physical, and Natural Science.
The values of the electric and magnetic fields generated by facilities are measured on a regular
basis by means of two reports, which are audited by AENOR.
Education on the safe use of electricity
To ensure consumers’ health and safety, it is very important to inform them of and educate them on
safety guidelines for using electricity.
Iberdrola thus uses the group’s websites to provide recommendations and information to consumers
on the safe use of electricity and gas, as well as guidelines to follow in case of an electrical accident.
It also publishes informational booklets on the potential risks of electricity that affect its proper use
and promotes informational and educational campaigns on safety measures and energy savings for
the general public.
Depending on the location and its level of exposure to adverse weather conditions or other external
contingencies, Iberdrola also provides information and recommendations on actions to take in the
event of an emergency.
Competition
■ GRI 206
As provided in the Code of Ethics, the group undertakes to compete fairly in the market and not to
engage in advertising that is misleading or denigrates its competitors or third parties.
The group also undertakes to obtain information from third parties in accordance with regulations, to
promote free competition for the benefit of consumers and users and to encourage transparency
and free market practices, as set out in the group’s General Sustainable Development Policy.
At the country level, each of the country subholding companies endeavours to ensure strict
compliance with legal provisions on separation of activities and, in many jurisdictions, the applicable
internal regulation goes beyond what is required by law, significantly reinforcing measures to prevent
any unfair competitive practices stemming from the lack of separation between liberalised and
regulated businesses.
The liberalised head of business companies also have specific controls to avoid any type of anti-
competitive practices, particularly in areas like advertising campaigns directed towards individuals
and price manipulation.

Cybersecurity and information privacy
Companies in the energy sector rely on a technological infrastructure, both physical and digital, to
support their processes and operations. Growing reliance on technology, highlighted by the
COVID-19 pandemic, can expose businesses to a range of risks, which, if exploited, could disrupt
operations, harm assets, put people’s safety at risk, undermine the organisation’s ability to deliver
reliable energy services, or expose the company to penalties or third-party liability.
As a leader in innovation and smart grids, Iberdrola attaches strategic importance to cyber-
resilience, and in 2015, the Board of Directors approved a Cybersecurity Risk Policy, pledging to
introduce the necessary measures for promoting a robust cybersecurity culture throughout the
Group by encouraging the secure use of cyber-assets, and strengthening the capacity to detect,
prevent, defend against, and respond to cyberattacks or cybersecurity threats.
Its scope of application includes not only information and communications systems and
technologies, but also the protection of industrial control systems and smart grids, whether operated
by its own personnel or supported by third-party operations and services.
The Policy builds on a set of cybersecurity rules underpinned by the Global Cybersecurity
Framework which, in turn, is further developed by the Global Incident Response Framework and the
Global Assurance Framework and other cybersecurity regulations focused on the different aspects
of cybersecurity threat.
To lead the deployment of the Policy throughout the Group, Iberdrola has appointed a Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to senior management. The CISO is responsible for
defining, leading and supervising the cybersecurity strategy throughout the Group, as are the CISOs
of the various country subholding companies to ensure the implementation of the Policy in each
country, taking into account the regulations and legislation applicable in their territory. The global
CISO and the CISOs of each country subholding company regularly report to the audit and risk
supervision committees of their respective boards of directors, which are tasked with supervising
this risk.
The Iberdrola group’s defined cybersecurity risk strategy and global framework are focused on
integrating cybersecurity in all strategic and operational decisions of the company and on taking it
into account beginning with the design of new projects and processes, and is supported by the
following pillars:
Governance: Iberdrola adopts a risk management approach to cybersecurity and uses the three
lines of defence model to assign functions and responsibilities in managing cybersecurity risks,
ensuring a coordinated approach and appropriate segregation of duties.
The Corporate Cybersecurity Risk Policy assigns responsibility for cybersecurity risk
management to the businesses and corporate areas (first line of defence) and entrusts the CISO of
Corporate Cybersecurity (second line of defence) with establishing the necessary governance,
coordination and supervisory mechanisms to ensure adequate treatment of cybersecurity risks
throughout the Group, taking into account the high interconnectivity of the networks and systems.
In this regard, Business Information Security Officers (BISOs) have been appointed in IT and in each
business, and are responsible for establishing and rolling out the necessary action plans in their
respective areas of competence. A Global Cybersecurity Committee has been established to ensure
proper coordination and alignment.
Cybersecurity culture: Iberdrola believes it is essential to promote a strong cybersecurity culture
throughout the group, ensuring that all employees at all levels of the organisation have the training
and knowledge necessary to minimise exposure to cybersecurity risks, including an understanding
of risks and internal regulations and access to tools that allow for proper protection. The
cybersecurity training programme covers the entire workforce, and includes annual training
initiatives, simulated phishing campaigns and ad-hoc training for technical groups or those exposed
to specific risks. The Board of Directors also receives specific cybersecurity training, which is also
included in the orientation programme for new directors.
Risk management: The company’s various businesses and divisions define, implement and
prioritise the necessary technical or organisational measures based on an analysis of cybersecurity
risks in their respective areas of responsibility, focusing on systems that support critical infrastructure
and essential services, personal data and other sensitive information, as well as other business-
critical processes. To this end, there is a global risk methodology and a global framework of
capabilities, supported by a governance, risk and compliance (GRC) system, which includes
measures for controlling identities and access, the protection of communications, equipment and
systems and the secure design and development of new projects, as well as the management of
supply chain related cybersecurity threats. All of this is set out in multi-year cybersecurity master
plans, specific to each Business and to IT, which are approved and supervised by the Cybersecurity
Committee, and whose effectiveness is monitored through a global cybersecurity dashboard.
Proactive threat and vulnerability scanning programmes are also in place, including mechanisms
such as scheduled and regular vulnerability scanning activities, ad-hoc security reviews (penetration
tests, Red Teams, etc.), system audits in the context of auditing financial statements, critical
infrastructure or the General Data Protection Regulation, and the review of cybersecurity ratings
through specialised market services, allowing potential risks to be anticipated. The cybersecurity
measures extend to the protecting our customers, suppliers and other Stakeholders against possible
risks of social engineering attacks that impersonate our brand.
Resilience: With a view to minimising the impact on the business and on the continuity of essential
services, Iberdrola has implemented technology (SIEMs/SOCs) and global and local cybersecurity
incident response teams (CSIRTs), which operate 24x7 and act as a point of contact to ensure the
successful detection and management of security threats, vulnerabilities and incidents. Iberdrola’s
global CSIRT is a member of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST).
Furthermore, operational continuity and recovery procedures for cybersecurity incidents are
planned, deployed and tested in the different technological areas (IT/OT). The necessary
coordination mechanisms at the global level are outlined in the Global Cybersecurity Incident
Response and Crisis Management Framework, which is regularly tested by organising and
participating in cyber exercises and crisis simulations. As a complementary measure, the Iberdrola
Group has a global cyber-insurance programme to mitigate the financial risks of a possible incident
or security breach.
Assurance: As a listed company and operator of an essential service, the Iberdrola Group is subject
to strict security regulations in the various countries in which it operates (GDPR, SOX, NIS, PIC,
NERC, etc.) and undergoes regular external audits, which include the evaluation of cybersecurity
controls on critical systems and assets covered by those regulations. Beside complying with
externally imposed obligations, Iberdrola has deployed an enhanced assurance programme for
critical systems and assets that support essential operational processes of its businesses at the
global level, aimed at identifying potential vulnerabilities and prioritising and focusing protection and
supervision measures in the area of cybersecurity.
Partnerships: Iberdrola actively partners with law enforcement agencies, government agencies,
product and service providers, other companies and industry expert groups to continuously reinforce
and improve its own cybersecurity capabilities and help improve the cyber resilience of the energy
ecosystem as a whole. Iberdrola has co-chaired the World Economic Forum’s working group on
Cyber Resilience in the Electricity Industry since it was established in May 2018.
■ GRI 418
With regard to information privacy, Iberdrola pays special attention to ensuring the privacy of the
personal information of the group’s Stakeholders. For this purpose, the company follows a Personal
Data Protection Policy approved by the Board of Directors and conforming to the European Global
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Its purpose is to ensure the right to the protection of data of all
individuals dealing with companies belonging to the group, ensuring respect for the right to dignity
and privacy in processing of the personal data, and particularly to establish the common principles
and guidelines to govern the group regarding the protection of data, ensuring compliance with
applicable law on this topic in all countries in which the group is present.
Iberdrola has chosen to handle privacy with a holistic focus, the goal of which is to integrate privacy
and data protection within the management system and the culture of the company. Responsibility
for the protection of personal data lies with the businesses and corporate functions, organisations
that process this data, under the coordination and supervision of the Data Protection Officer, with the
support of the Legal Services.
During financial years 2018 and 2019 the Iberdrola group developed and implemented a data
protection management system in order to ensure systematic compliance over time with the GDPR,
the Binding Corporate Rules and the personal data protection laws of each of the EU countries in
which the group is present.68
This management system has been reviewed within the framework of continuous improvement,
through the development of an external evaluation plan. This 3-year plan began in the last quarter of
2019 and ended in December 2021, encompassing all European Union countries in which the retail
business is present, as well as the United Kingdom, the United States and Mexico. The second
cycle of external evaluation began in the first quarter of 2022 and will end in 2024, consolidating the
model and its gradual expansion to new geographical areas. The Iberdrola group deals with a large
volume of personal data in its day-to-day activities, and given its international nature, international
transfers of data among its various companies occur on a daily basis. Recommendations 01/2020
on measures that supplement transfer tools and Recommendations 02/2020 on essential
guarantees issued by the European Data Protection Board in mid-2021 have been taken into
consideration in adapting the procedures and methodologies on international data transfers,
including the new standard contractual clauses, and in developing the methodology for the impact
assessment of international data transfers.
In addition, as regards international transfers between group companies, on 15 December 2020 the
Spanish Data Protection Agency issued a decision approving the Binding Corporate Rules of the
Iberdrola group, one of the mechanisms established in the GDPR to carry out international
transfers of personal data within a group of companies. The approval of these rules has been the
culmination of another of the steps implemented by the group to ensure full respect for the
fundamental rights to privacy of data subjects in all of the countries in which it operates, not limited
to European companies directly subject to the GDPR, but also to all other territories.
The table below shows substantiated complaints regarding breaches of violations of privacy and

III.5. Promotion of socially responsible
practices in the supply chain
• Description of the supply chain
• Sustainable management of the supply chain
Description of the supply chain
■ GRI 2-6
The Iberdrola group’s supply chain is managed through two different processes:
• The procurement of material and equipment and the contracting of works and services,
which is the responsibility of the Group’s Purchasing and Services Division.
• The procurement of fuel, which is handled by the Wholesale and Retail Business.
Both processes are guided by the same principles embodied in the Corporate policies and the
Code of Ethics. However, each of them has specific characteristics in their various phases:
registration and classification of suppliers, bidding process, execution of contracts, monitoring of
contractual terms, and quality control.
Procurement of material and equipment and contracting of works and
services
The mission of the group’s Purchasing and Services Division is to establish the strategy and
procedures for and to supervise the purchasing of equipment and material (other than fuel), as well
as works and services contracts and insurance programmes (other than life and casualty, health and
pension insurance) for the entire Iberdrola group, meeting the strategic goals established by the
Board of Directors and respecting at all times the company’s Governance and Sustainability
System:
The purchasing process is periodically audited both internally and by external entities, with no non-
conformities having been identified during the financial year. Recommendations and opportunities
for improvement that arise during these reviews are analysed and put into place in order to maintain
continuous improvement in the processes.
Iberdrola placed orders with more than 19,000 suppliers during 2022. A breakdown of the economic
and geographic volume is set out in the following table:

Mexico 439 395 507
IEI 1,546 967 360
Total 11,533 9,424 8,494
In 2022, the volume of purchases grew by 22% to €11,533 million as a result of the increase in
volumes invoiced by suppliers related to offshore wind projects in Europe and the United States,
onshore wind in Spain, the United States and Australia, and investments in electricity distribution
networks in Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom and Brazil.
Procurement of fuel
Iberdrola dedicated more than €6,233 million to the procurement of natural gas and uranium in
2022. Uranium is procured in Spain and only through Empresa Nacional del Uranio (Enusa). Natural
gas is procured on the domestic and international market, mainly through long-term commercial
relationships with approximately 27 large suppliers and wholesale market operators. These
purchases are for the production of electricity (mainly in Mexico and Spain).

Sustainable management of the supply chain
■ GRI 2-6 204
Promotion of sustainability and social responsibility
Iberdrola has the responsibility and the ability to motivate its suppliers to improve their
environmental, ethical and social performance through actions that promote excellence in their
management of sustainability.
Highest level commitment to the sustainability of our supply chain
Iberdrola’s commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards and their
expansion to cover its main suppliers is embodied in the ambitious goal of ensuring that at least
70% of the group’s main suppliers are subject to sustainable development policies and standards by
year-end 2022.
The significance of this goal is reflected by its inclusion in the 2020-2022 Strategic Bonus objective
approved by General Shareholders’ Meeting in 2020.
Specifically, the objective measures the number of key suppliers covered by sustainable
development policies and standards, such as having a human rights strategy, a code of conduct for
their suppliers, health and safety standards (SDG 3) and a global environmental sustainability
strategy, including strategies on water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7) and biodiversity (SDGs 14 and 15).
The objective is based on a specific model of evaluation for the supply chain and has been
integrated into the systems implemented by the Purchasing Department, both in the supplier
classification system and in the purchasing management system itself, with supplier sustainability
included in the decision-making process on proposals for awarding contracts.
70 Suppliers registered in the same country as the Iberdrola subsidiary for which it does business are considered to be local based on the
Supplier sustainability evaluation model:
In 2022 the Purchasing Division consolidated the use of the Global Supplier Sustainability
Evaluation Model, which is conformed to the international reality of the Iberdrola group and
organised around three core ESG pillars of sustainability.
The evaluation of a supplier measures the supplier’s performance in highly significant attributes:
identification of objectives linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), management of
climate change risk, circular economy strategy, human rights due diligence, compliance, good
governance and business ethics, etc.
The supplier must provide supporting evidence and documentation for its statements and
performance.
The following information is assessed as part of the three dimensions analysed:
After the analysis, the suppliers are rated at two levels: “adequate” if their score exceeds 51 of 100
points (and at least 30% of the points on each of the ESG pillars), and “inadequate” otherwise.
At year-end 2022, more than 77% of the group's main suppliers awarded contracts in the 2020-2022
period already met the established criteria and followed sustainable development policies and
standards.
Furthermore, in 2022, €17,112 million have been allocated to suppliers evaluated on the basis of this
ESG model. This amount represents 96% of the total amount awarded to the different suppliers
making up the Iberdrola group's supply chain. Of this amount, €16,287 million (91.5% of the total)
was awarded to suppliers surpassing the above mentioned level of sustainability.
It should be noted that in 2022, the objectives relating to the increase in purchases from key
suppliers evaluated as “adequate” were met and that improvement plans were introduced and
monitored for those suppliers that did not achieve the minimum scores established by Iberdrola
when they were awarded the contracts from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2022. Therefore,
improvement plans were sent to 912 suppliers of the group during this period and the result of this
initiative has been that 57% of them have improved their level of sustainability to the level of
“adequate”.
Not only is the supplier motivated by this model to improve its profile by taking actions that promote
excellence in business management, but the Purchasing Division team is also incentivised through
quantifiable objectives to choose those companies showing good performance in sustainability or
making a commitment to improve.
Factors evaluated for supplier classification
Iberdrola verifies that its suppliers’ actions are in line with the policies, principles and responsibilities
of the group.
The requirements for classifying suppliers are:
Fuel purchasing is also subject to the general principles of Iberdrola’s sustainable development
policies, which are intended to encourage suppliers to engage in activities that are socially
responsible, respectful of the environment and preventive of occupational risks.
Iberdrola carries out an internal evaluation of its main fuel suppliers in accordance with economic,
logistical, environmental and social standards. The aspects evaluated include: the existence of an
environmental policy, information regarding CO emissions, emission reduction initiatives, energy
2
efficiency, biodiversity conservation, occupational health and safety, equal opportunity, human rights
and ethical behaviour (anti-bribery and anti-corruption practices).
In 2022 no communication was received through the company’s ethical mailboxes resulting in the
cancellation of any contract or order for reasons related to human rights, corruption, labour practices
or environmental practices.
Supplier environmental assessment
■ GRI 308
Alignment in Purchasing and in supplier management with respect to the environment and
sustainability
■ GRI 308-1
At the end of 2022, the volume billed to the Iberdrola group by suppliers with a documented or
certified environmental management system represented around 72.2% of the total volume billed
(general suppliers).
Fuel purchasing is subject to the general principles of Iberdrola’s social responsibility policies, which
require that suppliers be encouraged to engage in conduct that is socially responsible, respectful of
the environment and preventive of occupational risks. Fuel suppliers with a certified environmental
management system represented 73.91% of those evaluated.
All major suppliers of general goods and equipment (both new and existing) and fuel are assessed
in accordance with environmental and sustainability criteria.
■ GRI 308-2
No supplier with a significant negative environmental impact has been detected. Furthermore,
Supplier social assessment
■ GRI 414 414-1 414-2 407-1 408-1 409-1
The contracting terms of the group for purchasing equipment, material, works and services,
include specific supplier corporate social responsibility clauses based on the UN Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the conventions of the International Labour Organization, the
principles of the Global Compact, and compliance with the Code of Ethics. For fuels, the company
aims to include these clauses as new contracts are signed.
During the term of the contract, the supplier must allow Iberdrola to review the level of compliance
with the principles established in the contracts, and if non-compliance is detected and corrective
plans are not adopted, the company reserves the right to cancel the contracts.
All major suppliers of general goods and equipment and of fuel are assessed under this
management approach and considering their material risks in relation to human rights and negative
social impacts. These risks are mitigated and managed through the quality processes in place and
the regular audits carried out by each business unit. This strategy has been reinforced in 2022 with a
global campaign of social audits of key general goods suppliers to ensure compliance with the
group's ESG criteria and to validate the supplier assessment model. By year-end 2022 a total of 42
social and sustainability audits had been carried out on the Group’s main suppliers at the global
level.
Based on the Iberdrola group’s risk map for 2022 drawn up by BHR (a specialised consulting firm),
and taking into account the suppliers of goods and services from countries identified in 2022 as
being at high risk of human rights violations, the following risks may emerge:
• in connection with the risk to freedom of association and collective bargaining, in 1.5% of the
volume of purchases made in 2022,
• in connection with child labour, in 0% of the total volume of purchases made in 2022, and
• in connection with forced labour, in 1.5% of the total volume of purchases made.
With regard to fuel supplies, no purchases were made in countries where there is a risk of violation
of the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, child labour and forced labour.
There was no identification in 2022 of any contracting with suppliers that has generated incidents
relating to freedom of association, collective bargaining, or the use of child or forced or compulsory
labour, nor is there evidence of receiving complaints on these grounds.
However, in Brazil a labour complaint was filed by a former employee of the supplier EPS RR
Construtora, against this company and Neoenergia Elektro for secondary liability as the contractor.
Among other issues, the former employee claimed that he had suffered degrading conditions in the
housing where he stayed for 2 months, considering that this housing/home did not have the
necessary infrastructure. The contract with the supplier was terminated and the proceedings are
being monitored.
No suppliers with a material negative social impact have been detected, and no incidents were
reported through the channels established for this purpose that resulted in the cancellation of orders
or of contracts with the group’s suppliers due to negative social impacts.
In 2021 a potential risk associated with complaints of forced labour was identified in the Xinjiang
region of China linked to polysilicon producers supplying polysilicon to solar module manufacturers.
Although this risk does not directly affect the group’s direct suppliers, it does affect the value chain
for photovoltaic technology. Since then Iberdrola has promoted scrupulous compliance with the
Iberdrola group’s Suppliers’ Code of Ethics among all suppliers potentially exposed to this risk. To
this end, Iberdrola has successfully required the inclusion of specific clauses to mitigate the risks of
forced labour or modern slavery for all affected suppliers with which it has signed supply contracts.
In addition, the necessary clauses have also been included in contracts for the supply of PV panels
to give the company the right to perform social and sustainability audits, both for module
manufacturers and third party companies in their supply chains, to ensure the quality and traceability
of the components. The Iberdrola group also actively participates, along with the manufacturers
themselves, in the main industry-led initiatives, such as Solar Power Europe and WindEurope, with
the aim of establishing common standards and tools that allow objective evidence to be obtained
that human rights have been respected throughout the process of manufacturing the equipment
used in these projects.
Evaluation of supplier risks
Iberdrola ensures the evaluation of supplier risk during the procurement process, as set forth in the
Purchasing Policy. In particular, the following risks are identified: Credit risk, fraud risk,
cybersecurity risk, sustainability risk, operational risk, risks related to human resources and tax risk.
Review of the provision of general supplies in countries presenting a risk of corruption
In order to analyse the risk of corruption in procurement, the company uses the Transparency
International Corruption Perceptions Index 2021 (TI CPI 2021)71 as a source to classify countries
according to their level of risk.
The volumes of purchasing in countries classified according to said index based on their level of risk
of corruption are set out in the following table:
% of 2022 general supply purchases in
Corruption risk72
countries on the CPI Index 2021
Purchasing in countries classified as low-risk 74.7
Purchasing in countries classified as medium-risk 2.1
Purchasing in countries classified as high-risk 23.2
Brazil and Mexico are the main countries classified by the aforementioned TI CPI 2021 as having a
high risk of corruption and in which there have been purchases from registered suppliers. The
purchasing volume is directly related to Iberdrola’s presence and investment efforts in these
countries, and is consistent with its practice of promoting the local industrial fabric.
Iberdrola has not made any significant purchase of general supplies from suppliers located in tax
havens.

Review of the provision of fuel supplies in countries presenting a risk of corruption
An analysis of the purchases of fuel shows the following ratios in 2022:
% provisions of fuel in 2022 in countries
Corruption risk73
included in the CPI 2021 index
Provisions of fuel in countries classified as low-risk 58.9
Provisions of fuel in countries classified as medium-risk 1.0
Provisions of fuel in countries classified as high-risk 40.1
According to the aforementioned TI CPI 2021, Mexico and Brazil are the main countries with a high
risk of corruption in which fuel has been purchased from registered suppliers. However, the
company believes that the calculation should exclude these two countries because these purchases
are made in strongly regulated environments that require contracting with state-owned companies.
Excluding both countries from the calculation, the percentage of fuel purchasing in at high-risk
countries would decrease to 0%.

• Iberdrola and the Global Compact
Access to energy
The Sustainable Development Policy approved by the company’s Board of Directors embraces
the promotion of universal access to the power supply, with environmentally sustainable,
economically assumable and socially inclusive models, as a basic principle of conduct in the
creation of sustainable value. In addition, it attends to customers who are economically
disadvantaged or in any other situation of vulnerability, establishing specific procedures of protection
and collaborating in providing ongoing access to electric power and gas supply according to the
policies established by the competent government authorities in each case.
Access to energy for off-grid customers
The companies of the Neoenergia group have continued to develop rural electrification programmes,
undertaken jointly with government authorities, as an instrument for the social inclusion and
development of rural homes not served by electric utilities. In 2022, the funds allocated to these
programmes totalled €88 million (478 million Brazilian reais) in consolidated terms for the group.
Globally, Iberdrola has launched the Electricity for All Programme in response to the call of the
international community to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy
services. Iberdrola has set the ambitious goal of providing electricity to 16 million persons who
currently lack it by 2030.
For more information, see the “Electricity for All” Programme section of the corporate website.
Access for vulnerable customers
■ SASB IF-EU-240a.4.
The companies of the group have procedures to protect customers at risk of exclusion or in
vulnerable situations so as to facilitate access for the most disadvantaged groups: Iberdrola’s
measures in this regard include a lengthening of collection periods and making payment terms more
flexible, so as to prevent the suspension of electric and/or gas supply due to non-payment of bills by
users who are economically disadvantaged or who have been declared vulnerable due to reasons of
age, health, disability or other reasons. In some countries such as Spain (with a subsidised
electricity rate, called the Bono Social de Electricidad) and Brazil, there is a special, differentiated
rate for low-income customers, offering them advantageous prices and special terms.

Support to local communities
Development programmes for local communities
■ GRI 413
Iberdrola engages in various activities to avoid, mitigate and offset the potential socio-economic
impacts of its facilities. These are identified in the context of impact assessments and consultation
processes with the affected communities, and are discussed with the various stakeholders and local
authorities.
The activities cover different areas, such as the protection of biodiversity and the recovery of
spaces; use of the ecosytemic services generated at the plants; improved communication, water
supply, and waste management infrastructure; the implementation of public lighting systems; the
creation of direct and indirect jobs; scholarships, training courses for professionals; activities to
support entrepreneurs, etc.
74 In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, service shutdowns for non-payment were suspended before gradually resuming in 2021
and 2022.
75
Moreover, there are supplementary sponsorship and patronage activities to improve the well-being
of the communities in which we have a presence.
Given the size and significance of these local social and economic development programmes, they
are carried out by various organisations, subsidiaries, and institutions within the group, on a
supplementary basis:
• By subsidiaries or investees, within their respective purviews.
• By the group’s foundations in the case of sponsorship and patronage activities (Fundación
Iberdrola España, ScottishPower Foundation in the United Kingdom, AVANGRID Foundation
in the United States, Instituto Neoenergia in Brazil, and Fundación Iberdrola México). More
information can be found in the “Foundations” section of this chapter.
Social impact assessments
■ GRI 413-1 413-2
Environmental Impact Assessment studies prior to the construction of facilities include a Social
Impact Assessment in accordance with current law in each of the countries, and must be approved
by the competent public authorities. In countries with indigenous communities, a Social Impact
Study specific to these communities is always included.
These evaluations include an analysis of potential impacts on human rights, such as the right to a
safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, through an evaluation of the natural environment.
In this evaluation, the environmental impacts of such factors as emissions, leaks, waste, fires,
effects on local biodiversity, changes in land use, changes in the aesthetics and quality of the
landscape, restricted access to water and forest resources, etc. are assessed. Regarding the
fundamental right to enjoy a social order or an adequate standard of living, the analysis includes an
evaluation of the social and economic environment, considering demographic aspects such as
population changes in nearby municipalities; their historical and cultural heritage; increased demand
for jobs in certain sectors; and the deterioration or development of basic infrastructure elements,
such as roads or railroad networks, etc.
Applicable law ensures consultation with and the participation of both the interested parties and the
government administrations during the performance of these impact studies. Moreover, the project
documentation is subject to public review for a period of time that varies according to applicable law
in each country.
In addition to these legal requirements, Iberdrola has implemented the Stakeholders Relations
Model as well as a specific Recommendations Guide for Conducting Public Consultations. All these
mechanisms contribute to ensuring that the viewpoints of the Stakeholders consulted will be taken
into account in defining the future project.
Finally, impact studies specify the preventive and corrective or compensatory measures required to
mitigate the issues identified.
Almost 100% of the company’s main locations of operation are thus subject to these types of
activities, focused on meeting the needs of its Stakeholders, especially in local communities.
Consultation processes with local communities
In order to better manage and mitigate the impact on the communities in which the group has a
presence, Iberdrola has a Guide for the implementation of good practices in relations with local
communities, which ensures that public consultation processes are in line with UNGP
recommendations.
To implement this guide, areas have a digital tool that facilitates the management and
documentation of consultations with communities. Both tools promote better management of the
process, thus making it possible to efficiently monitor the steps set forth in the action, mitigation and
remediation plans with respect to any impact in the vicinity of the facilities.
Energy planning (energy sources, technology and long-term needs) is carried out by governmental
authorities; this is the institutional area in which the various Stakeholders can participate in
accordance with the mechanisms established in each country. Once the most appropriate
infrastructure is selected, the viewpoints of the affected communities are taken into account through
consultation processes, which vary depending on the country and the type of facility.
In addition, during the planning development phase of each project, relations are established with
local communities, authorities, and any other stakeholders that may be relevant to the project, and
dialogue channels are established with them. These channels supplement those available in the
Environmental Management System allowing Stakeholders to send their concerns, complaints,
requests for information or any other kind of request to minimise impacts in the area.
Management of population displacements
During the planning phase for new projects, Iberdrola evaluates the land that will potentially be
occupied, choosing the land that involves the least displacement of people who either reside in the
immediate area or whose economic activities will be affected. In the event of displacement, Iberdrola
and the relevant government authorities review the economic, environmental and social
consequences of the projects, and jointly hold consultations with the local communities to adopt
suitable corrective measures. In addition, in the case of indigenous communities, pathways of
dialogue are established with the participation of the government and of various organisations
representing them, to report on the projects with the required transparency and integrity.
■ GRI EU22
In the construction of the Tâmega hydroelectric complex (Portugal), detailed socio-economic studies
have been conducted for several years on the possible affected dwellings. Studies included a prior
assessment, taking into account the needs of each of them and examining possible relocations to
houses with similar characteristics. A total of 59 dwellings were ultimately identified, of which only
50% were permanent residences. The identification of displacements as necessary and the
respective financial compensation were made in accordance with the law on expropriations in
Portugal and the methodology implemented regarding the management and definition of
displacements and potential economic damages. In addition, in partnership with the Portuguese
government and the municipalities, as approved in the Socio-economic Action Plan, financial
compensation of €1.4 million was determined in addition to the compensation provided in the
expropriation process, making it possible to improve the relocation conditions of the affected families
and maintain their customs and traditions. As of year-end 2022, eight families in the Upper Tâmega
area are awaiting relocation. To date, €0.8 million of the €1.4 million approved in the Economic
Compensation Plan has been paid.
As for the United Kingdom, 23 economic displacements took place as a result of several repair
works associated with the East Anglia One offshore wind farm. In addition, 61 fishermen (70
vessels) were affected by a geophysical survey campaign as part of the East Anglia Three
project.This type of economic displacement has also taken place in France, affecting 55 fishermen
(17 vessels). The affected parties received financial compensation in all cases.
Impact on local communities and the rights of indigenous peoples
■ GRI 411 411-1
In applying the Code of Ethics and the corporate policies (especially the Policy on Respect for
Human Rights), Iberdrola and its employees commit to respect both the rights of ethnic minorities
and the internationally recognised rights of indigenous peoples, in accordance with applicable law
and the obligations set out in Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization (ILO).
Presence of the company in indigenous territory, incidents and projects implemented
The company has a presence in four countries where there are indigenous communities (Brazil,
Mexico, the United States and Australia). As year-end 2022, the company only has facilities in
territories belonging to indigenous communities in two of them (Brazil and Mexico), as shown in the
table below. As for Australia, the entire territory is attributed to aboriginal populations, which are
distributed across the country, including the states in which Iberdrola operates.
In environments with indigenous communities, Iberdrola encourages business activities to be carried
out with respect for different cultural identities, traditions and environmental wealth, as many times
these communities depend on natural resources for their subsistence.
Therefore, it has channels of dialogue with these communities and their representatives, as well as
for the participation of the government, in order to report on the progress of projects with due
transparency and integrity.
Nonetheless, despite the management performed, these communities can at times be directly or
indirectly affected at certain facilities. For this reason, the Company promotes ethical practices to
prevent conflict and generate mutual benefits.
The Company currently has the following facilities in territories with the presence of indigenous
communities:

As regards incidents with these communities, as of the closing date of this report, three lawsuits
were under way with respect to the Brazilian electricity distribution company Coelba relating to
indigenous rights, seeking compensation for the use of the right of way of the electricity grids on
community lands of the Kiriris, Tuxá and Truká communities. So far, only the action regarding the
Kiriris indigenous people community was adjudicated, which is now in the appeal stage. The other
two actions are in the investigatory phase, awaiting judgement.
Iberdrola also carries out various projects with indigenous communities, as described below:
In Mexico, the “Luces de Esperanza” (Lights of Hope) project is being developed with indigenous
communities, offering solar power electrification solutions to rural communities without electricity. In
2022, more than 400 persons benefited, and 115 homes in Oaxaca were electrified. Moreover, the
“Huertos Comunitarios” (Community Gardens) project has been carried out in four towns in the state
of San Luis Potosí as part of the “Energía por el Campo” (Energy for the Countryside) programme.
The project seeks the self-reliance of these communities by growing certain food, equipping families
to care for their gardens, promoting the cultivation of healthy food, and supporting the local
economy.
In the United States, even though there is no asset of the company within the territory of an
indigenous community, the Blue Bird solar project, in Washington state, is in the vicinity of the
Yakama Nation reservation, in an area in which this community has traditionally lived and moved.
For this reason, the company has conducted an exhaustive evaluation of the cultural resources that
might be affected by its activity. Based on this evaluation, which has now been completed, various
activities have commenced to protect the resources in accordance with state requirements. The
implementation of these activities will be completed in 2023. In addition, Iberdrola has conducted
exploration surveys in the states of Arizona and New Mexico to evaluate the wind and solar energy
potential of various locations within tribal reservations. These activities are performed from the very
beginning in coordination with the local communities.
Finally, there were no incidents relating to the violation of the rights of employees from indigenous
communities in the group during 2022.
Citizen insecurity and labour practices in the hiring of security services
■ GRI 410
The Corporate Security Policy approved by Iberdrola’s Board of Directors and the specific
procedures adopted by the Corporate Security Division for each situation and country are
compatible both with international human rights standards and the laws of the countries where the
company is present.
The protocols of conduct are defined and implemented in all activities and services provided by the
Corporate Security Division, with a Quality Management System that has been certified since 2003
under ISO 9001 and externally reviewed each year by AENOR in the countries where it has been
implemented in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of this standard, as well as with
the standards of the management system.
Security and monitoring services providers are hired in accordance with the purchasing policy,
model and procedures in effect. The Corporate Security Division is responsible for setting the
technical specifications and standards to be met by such suppliers in order to be hired, in terms of
physical security, resources, training and cybersecurity, as well as the assessment thereof during the
performance of their contract. This assessment is performed annually in order to identify areas for
improvement.
Both the company’s personnel and that of subcontractors are qualified for their duties and enhance
their knowledge through a rigorous training plan, which is continually assessed and monitored.

Fiscal responsibility
■ GRI 207-1 207-2 207-3
Iberdrola has a Corporate Tax Policy that sets out the Group’s tax strategy, based on ensuring
compliance with applicable tax regulations, excellence and the commitment to applying good tax
practices and transparency, seeking appropriate coordination of the tax practices followed by the
Group’s companies to prevent tax risks and inefficiencies in the implementation of business
decisions.
The Corporate Tax Policy conforms to the corporate and governance structure and applies to all
companies of the Group over which Iberdrola has effective control, within the legal limits, without
prejudice to the autonomy of the listed subholding companies, as provided by the group’s corporate
governance.
The Board of Directors of Iberdrola S.A. is tasked with designing, evaluating, approving and
permanently reviewing the Governance and Sustainability System, and particularly with
approving and updating corporate policies, including the Corporate Tax Policy. The Board of
Directors is also responsible for preparing the tax strategy and approving investments or
transactions that area particularly important for tax purposes due to the size or nature thereof.
The Corporate Tax Policy is publicly available on the Group’s corporate website.
Fiscally responsible behaviour
The Corporate Tax Policy defines the main principles of conduct, including:
• Compliance with tax regulations in each of the countries and territories in which the Group companies operate,
paying the taxes that are due. All tax-related decisions are based on a reasonable interpretation of applicable
law in close connection with the group's activity.
• The prevention and reduction of significant tax risks, ensuring that taxes bear an appropriate relationship to the
structure and location of activities, human and material resources, and the group’s business risks.
• The strengthening of the relationship with tax authorities based on respect for the law, fidelity, reliability,
professionalism, cooperation, reciprocity and good faith.
• The provision of information to the management decision-making bodies on the main tax implications of the
transactions or matters submitted to it for approval, when they are a significant factor in making a decision.
• Envisaging the taxes that the group’s companies pay in the countries and territories in which they operate as the
principal contribution to sustaining public expenditures, and therefore as one of their contributions to society.
By application of these principles, the companies of the Group assume the following good tax practices, among others:
• Not to use artificial structures unrelated to the Group’s business for the sole purpose of reducing its tax burden
nor, in particular, enter into transactions with related entities solely to erode the tax basis or to transfer profits to
low-tax territories.
• Avoid opaque structures for tax purposes, which are understood as structures calculated to prevent knowledge
by the competent tax authorities of the party ultimately responsible for the activities or of the ultimate owner of
the assets or rights involved.
• Not to create or acquire companies resident in countries or territories deemed by Spanish law to be tax havens
or included on the EU blacklist of non-cooperative jurisdictions, with the sole exception of those cases in which it
is obliged to do so in the case of an indirect acquisition in which the company resident in a tax haven is part of a
group of companies being acquired, in which case, the provisions of the Procedure for the Creation or
Acquisition of Equity Interests in Special Purpose Entities Domiciled in Tax Havens, approved by the Board of
Directors, must be taken into account.
• Follow the recommendations of the good tax practices codes implemented in the countries in which the
companies of the Group do business, taking into account the specific needs and circumstances of all the
companies making up the Group.
• Cooperate with the competent tax authorities in the detection of and search for solutions regarding fraudulent
tax practices of which the Company is aware that may be used in the markets in which the Group’s companies
have a presence, as well as provide as quickly as possible any significant tax-related information and
documentation requested by the Tax Authorities in the exercise of their authority and within the appropriate
scope, encouraging agreements and compliance findings during the inspection procedures.
• Make the necessary whistleblower channels available to anyone who wishes to report any conduct that may
involve any wrongdoing or conduct contrary to the law or to the Governance and Sustainability System,
including the rules of conduct set forth in the Code of Ethics that are also applicable to tax-related activities.
The fiscally responsible behaviour of all companies of the Iberdrola group forms part of the General Sustainable
Development Policy, which contemplates basic principles of conduct that must be respected. Iberdrola's tax policy is
guided by the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and the Code of Ethics, and is based on a commitment to
ethical principles, good corporate governance, transparency and institutional loyalty.
The companies of the group share the principles reflected in the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and the Code
of Ethics, and see the social dividend as the contribution of direct, indirect or induced sustainable value that its activities
represent for all Stakeholders.
Tax governance and risk management
Responsibility
The Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A., through its chairman, the chief executive officer and the management team,
fosters the monitoring of tax principles and good tax practices. Likewise, the respective boards of directors of the country
subholding companies are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Corporate Tax Policy at the country level.
Control and monitoring
Taxation is not static and is subject to continuous revision, which requires the Corporate Tax Policy to be constantly
reviewed in order to reflect the best practices in this area, with the last update taking place in December 2022.
To achieve efficient control and correct compliance with tax governance requirements, the applicable tax laws and the
principles of the Corporate Tax Policy are monitored at all levels.
The Company’s Global Tax Division approves and periodically reviews guidelines for the evaluation and management of
tax risk applicable to all companies of the Group. It is also the body responsible for tax compliance within the Company,
in coordination with the Company’s Compliance Unit.
Furthermore, the head of business companies report to the country subholding companies regarding the level of
compliance with the Corporate Tax Policy, and in turn, the Audit and Compliance Committees of the country subholding
companies report to the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of Iberdrola S.A. Finally, the Audit and Risk Supervision
Committee of Iberdrola, S.A. reports its findings to the Board of Directors.
Risk management and compliance
Iberdrola proactively seeks to ensures compliance with tax provisions and to prevent and reduce significant tax risks. To
this end, it has a robust tax risk prevention model in line with best tax governance practices, which is duly monitored,
updated and aligned with applicable legal requirements.
In this regard, in 2019 Iberdrola was the first Spanish company to obtain certification of a tax compliance management
system in accordance with the requirements established in the UNE 19602 standard, issued for a period of three years.
Iberdrola was also the first company to renew its certification for a new three-year period in 2022, having obtained a
satisfactory audit of its tax compliance system for the fourth year in a row.
In addition, among other measures, Iberdrola has objective standards applicable to all the Group’s companies for
classifying transactions based on their tax risk. In this regard, the Group prohibits the creation or acquisition of companies
resident in tax havens, for which reason none of the active companies it controls are resident in tax havens as defined by
applicable law (Royal Decree 1080/1991) or in territories classified by the European Union in its blacklist as non-
cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes.
Stakeholder engagement in tax matters
Iberdrola, S.A. adheres to the Code of Good Tax Practices approved on 20 July 2010 by the full Forum of Large
Businesses (Foro de Grandes Empresas), established on 10 July 2009 at the behest of the National Tax Administration
Agency (Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria). Iberdrola’s commitment to compliance with, further development
and implementation of the Code extends to any other good tax practices that stem from the recommendations of the
Code in effect at any time, even if not expressly set forth in the Corporate Tax Policy. The Group is also committed to
compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises in tax matters.
Within the framework of the Code, since financial year 2015 Iberdrola, S.A. has voluntarily submitted to the Spanish tax
authorities an Annual Tax Transparency Report for companies adhering to the Good Tax Practices Code, which includes
detailed information on the Group’s taxation. This report is currently the most important tool for cooperative relations with
the Tax Authorities.
Furthermore, Iberdrola has voluntarily prepared its annual Report on Tax Transparency of the Iberdrola Group since
2019. Our commitment to society. This report sets out all significant issues from a tax standpoint and will be prepared
again in 2023. The report contains the Country by Country Report for the previous year presented in the same terms as
those submitted to the Spanish Tax Authorities. This report is publicly available on the corporate website.
Finally, Iberdrola makes available to its Stakeholders specific ethics mailboxes, which constitute tools to report conduct
that could involve improper conduct or conduct contrary to law or to the internal rules or procedures, including those
relating to taxes.
The taxes paid are presented in the following table:

Iberdrola consolidated total 7,458 7,836 7,475
Tax contributions in 2022 decreased compared to the previous year. However, it remains at the
average contribution level of recent years.
In this regard, while the amount of own contributions charged to the income statement increases
with respect to the previous years, contributions due to third-party payments decrease.
The increase in own contributions is mainly recorded for Corporate Tax, and is mainly due to the
fiscal effect in Spain of income from judgements favourable to Iberdrola.
The amount of contributions due to third-party payments has decreased mainly due to tax refunds
received from various government administrations corresponding to overpayments of taxes in
previous years due to the tax mechanisms themselves and changes in the tax rates applicable to
indirect taxes, like value added and similar taxes.

Spain: No significant deviations between nominal rate and effective rate were recorded in 2022.
United Kingdom: The spread between the nominal and effective rate is mainly due to the impact of the change in the rate applicable to deferred tax
balances following the change in the tax rate to 25% from April 2023.
United States of America The effective rate is very similar to the nominal rate (federal plus state). The deviation in the nominal rate is due (i) on the
one hand, to tax credits associated with the renewables business (“PTCs”) as well as investment credits (“ITCs”); and (ii) on the other hand, to the
restatement of deferred tax balances to the prior year-end state tax rate (“DT true-up”) as well as the restatement of the valuation according to the
potential future application of tax credits (“valuation allowance”).
Brazil: The effective rate is below the nominal rate mainly due to the (optional) application of the presumptive profit regime in the taxation of some
of the companies, the payment of interest on equity and the existence of the SUDENE tax incentive.
Mexico: Changes in exchange rates, considering that dollarised accounts are presented, and the existence of certain accounting and tax
differences (provisions, deferred income, inflationary effect, valuation of derivatives and recognition differences in fixed assets and the depreciation
rates thereof) justify the difference between the nominal and effective rate.
Other countries: The differential compared to nominal rates is due to accounting standards for capitalisation of tax loss carryforwards and the
subsequent application thereof, considering that the tax consolidation regime does not apply in all cases.
Contributions to society
Iberdrola has selected the Business for Societal Impact B4SI model to measure and
assess business contributions to the community due to its broad international recognition.
It is considered the most highly valued standard for measuring the results and impacts of
social programmes, both for the company and for the community. This standard only
recognises projects that involve voluntary contributions for social or environmental
protection ends, for non-profit purposes, and that are not restricted to groups related to
the company.
Iberdrola has used the model as a basis to report its contributions to society in 2022.

Foundations
ScottishPower Foundation, AVANGRID Foundation, Fundación Iberdrola México, Instituto
Neoenergia and Fundación Iberdrola España represent Iberdrola’s commitment to the
sustainable the development of the countries in which it does business. Pursuant to the Master Plan,
the foundations have updated their mission, vision and values to include the contribution to the
SDGs among their purposes and principles.
Iberdrola uses various indicators to measure the results achieved through its community support
programmes.
Training and Research Area
This work area focuses on young students, supporting their undergraduate, technical or language
studies and providing opportunities for those with fewer resources and/or disabilities. It also includes
calls for assistance for research, most notably including the first year of the Energy for Future
programme, an international programme in collaboration with the European Commission led by
postdoctoral researchers in the energy sector. There are also research grants and scholarships in
restoration and conservation in partnership with prestigious museums, such as the Museo del Prado
and the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum. These initiatives contribute to the attainment of specific objectives
of SDG 4: Quality Education.
The INSPIRA II and REACTIVA Green Economy training programmes ended in December 2022.
These programmes were co-financed by the European Social Fund, the Youth Employment Initiative
and the Castilla-La Mancha Autonomous Community, under the regional section of the Operational
Youth Employment Programme of this community in Castilla-La Mancha, with the aim of helping
young people at risk of exclusion between ages 16 and 30 rejoin the education system and/or obtain
training in various areas of the electricity sector.
In addition, in partnership with various universities, Iberdrola is promoting the representation of
women in STEM careers in all of the countries where it is present. This is the case of the STEM
Women Chair of Fundación Iberdrola España together with the Pontificia de Comillas University and
Empresa Municipal de Transportes de Madrid (EMT), and the Empieza por Educar scholarships,
which seek to help five young graduates in the STEM field to have a positive impact on the
Biodiversity and Climate Change Area: conservation of birds, habitats
and ecosystems
This work area partners with public institutions and entities devoted to the protection of the
environment and birdlife, contributing to the achievement of the specific objectives of SDG 13:
Climate Action, and 15: Life on Land. Among other initiatives, Iberdrola supports habitat
conservation work, such as its Military Shooting Ranges reforestation programme in Spain known as
“Bosque Defensa Iberdrola”, through which more than 90 hectares have already been reforested in
almost four years. In addition, Iberdrola is carrying out multi-annual cooperation efforts with SEO
Birdlife and supporting land and marine habitats through the projects being carried out at the
foundations in Scotland (restoration of seagrass and oysters), Brazil (coral restoration), the United
States (river water conservation) and Mexico (conservation of the Cañón de Fernández state park).
Art and Culture Area: programmes for lighting, restoration and support
to museums
This area partners with cultural entities, prestigious museums, public institutions and religious
entities to promote culture, as well as to restore and preserve the artistic heritage, favouring local
development. These actions directly impact Goals 8: Economic growth, and 11: Sustainable cities
and communities.
There at two very important sections within this area. Through the lighting programme, lighting
interventions are carried out with respect to important historic-artistic heritage sites in order to foster
local development and sustainable tourism. Some of the lighting projects in Spain include the
Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, the Monastery of Guadalupe, the Cathedral of Sigüenza, the
Talavera de la Reina Bridge, the archaeological remains of the mills of Campo de Criptana, and in
Brazil lighting has been provided for the Guarany Theatre, located in the municipality of Triunfo-
Pernambuco in Brazil. In addition, the restoration programme helps conserve and preserve artistic
and cultural heritage. Numerous restorations have been carried out with the Museo Nacional del
Prado and the Museum of Fine Arts of Bilbao.
At all of the foundations, workshops, programmes and free visits are also provided with the aim of
outreach to promote culture, highlight cultural heritage and create new and exciting learning
opportunities.
Social Action Area
This work area partners with non-profit organisations, foundations and development agencies to
promote social and humanitarian projects aimed at the most vulnerable people and that contribute to
achieving the specific objectives of SDGs 1: End poverty; 3: Good health and well-being; 5: Gender
equality; 7: Affordable and clean energy; and 10: Reduced inequalities.
The Social Programme of the Foundations is implemented in five countries with the support of
projects that promote overcoming child poverty, supporting the inclusion of people with disabilities,
improving the quality of life of persons who are seriously ill and supporting women, always
prioritising attention to the most vulnerable groups. The more significant partnerships include: Down
Syndrome Foundation, Proyecto Hombre, Ciudad Joven, Save the Children, Upacesur.
In addition to the social programmes, Fundación Iberdrola México is carrying out a multi-year project
named “Urological Brigades” to contribute to the well-being of low-income women who have
complex urological problems by providing them with surgery.
The AVANGRID Foundation has been partnering for five years with the National Disaster Response
Association and with the American Red Cross with respect to an emergency grant project to support
the impact of the humanitarian crisis.
The ScottishPower Foundation, in addition to its various projects aimed at health and well-being, is
engaging in a project to secure and equip a space dedicated to a community food centre throughout
the year, offering free, healthy food to the local community.

IV. Governance
Iberdrola’s governance model is one of its distinctive traits and the cornerstone of its commitment to
sustainability.
Starting with the composition and structure of its governance bodies, in line with corporate
governance best practices, and continuing with the internal management and control systems for the
risks to which the group is exposed, the entire system is built on the basis of regulatory compliance,
robustness, coordination, and the assumption of responsibilities at all levels.
Along these lines, the company has been selected for the ninth consecutive year as one of the most
ethical companies in the world by the Ethisphere Institute.
This commitment to compliance also extends to its fiscal strategy, based on ensuring compliance
with applicable tax provisions, excellence and a commitment to applying good tax practices,
adjusted to the group’s corporate and governance structure.
As part of its commitment to maintaining a governance model in line with best market practices,
Iberdrola has set itself the following goals:
IV.1. Good governance, transparency and
Stakeholder engagement
• Corporate governance
• Ethics and integrity
• Public policies
Corporate governance
The Governance and Sustainability System constitutes the internal regulation of Iberdrola. The
set of rules on corporate governance is based on best practices and international standards and
positions Iberdrola as a leader in this area. The corporate governance rules of the decision-making
bodies and internal committees establish their rules of operation, ensuring compliance with and
implementation of the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group.
An independent and plural Board of Directors
The Board of Directors focuses its activity on defining and supervising the general guidelines by,
among other things, establishing the group’s policies and strategies and supervising the general
development of the policies, strategies and guidelines by the country subholding companies and by
the head of business companies.
■ GRI 2-16
For more detailed information regarding the composition, operation and activities carried out by the
governance bodies of the Company, see the Activities Report of the Board of Directors and of
the Committees thereof. This Report describes issues of crucial interest dealt with during the year.
A brief description of the composition and activities of the committees of the Board of Directors can
be found in section C.2.1. of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.
Selection and nomination of the members of the highest governance
body
■ GRI 2-10
The appointment, re-election and removal of directors is within the purview of the shareholders at
the General Shareholders’ Meeting.
Vacancies that occur may be filled by the Board of Directors on an interim basis until the next
General Shareholders’ Meeting, whereat the shareholders confirm the appointments or elect the
persons who should replace directors who are not ratified, or the vacant positions are
withdrawn.
To this end, the Board of Directors Diversity and Member Selection Policy ensures that
proposals for the appointment of directors are based on a prior and objective analysis of the needs
of the Board of Directors. The Diversity and Inclusion Policy also contains principles and
guidelines that must be taken into account for these purposes.
The Board of Directors has a diverse and balanced
composition in terms of the genders, nationalities and
professional profiles of its members
The Appointments Committee advises the Board of Directors regarding the most appropriate
configuration of such body and on aspects like the size of and balance among the various classes of
directors existing at any time and the personal and professional requirements that the candidates
must fulfil. For such purpose, the Committee reviews the structure of each body on a regular basis.
Independent directors are appointed on the basis of a proposal of the Appointments Committee,
while the other appointments require a report of such Committee.
In any event, the Board of Directors, and the Appointments Committee within the scope of its
powers, will endeavour to ensure that the candidates submitted to the shareholders at a General
Shareholders’ Meeting for appointment or re-election as directors, as well as the directors appointed
directly to fill vacancies in the exercise of the power of the Board of Directors to make interim
appointments, are respectable and qualified persons, widely recognised for their expertise,
competence, experience, qualifications, training, availability and commitment to their duties.
The members of the Board of Directors must be irreproachable professionals, whose professional
conduct and background are aligned with the principles set forth in the Code of Ethics and with the
corporate values contained in the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group.
If the Board of Directors deviates from the proposals and reports of the Appointments Committee, it
shall give reasons for so acting and shall record such reasons in the minutes.
In addition, the selection of candidates shall endeavour to ensure that the composition of the Board
of Directors is diverse in the broadest sense and balanced as a whole, such that decision-making is
enriched and multiple viewpoints are contributed to the discussion of the matters within its purview.
To this end, the selection process shall promote a search for diverse candidates with knowledge and
experience in the various countries in which the group does or will engage in activities. The directors
must also have sufficient knowledge of the Spanish and English languages to be able to perform
their duties.
In turn, the Board has entrusted to the Appointments Committee the responsibility of ensuring that
when new vacancies are filled or new directors are appointed, the selection procedures are free
from any implied bias entailing any kind of discrimination, particularly due to gender.
Collective knowledge of highest governance body
■ GRI 2-12 2-17
The Company has a programme to provide directors with training and updates in response to the
need for professionalisation, diversification and qualification of the Board of Directors.
In addition to the training materials and sessions for all
directors, the Sustainable Development Committee has a
specific training plan in the area of sustainability, ESG
requirements, and corporate social responsibility.
Firstly, an Orientation Programme covering aspects such as the business and organisational model
of the Company and its group, the corporate governance structure and its ownership, and the
Governance and Sustainability System is made available to new members of the Board of
Directors through the directors’ website.
Directors also receive continuous training regarding significant issues relating to the Iberdrola group
and its businesses, as well as the environment in which they operate, which are supplemented by
reports, articles and other information of interest, all of which are made available to the directors
through the directors’ website, which has a specific section and a blog dedicated to training.
This website also facilities the performance of the directors’ duties, incorporating documents
deemed appropriate to prepare for meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees based on
the agenda, as well as presentations shown during the meetings.
In this regard, a space is used at meetings of the Board of Directors to present financial, legal,
geopolitical, and current issues of interest to the Iberdrola directors.
The Sustainable Development Committee also has a regular training plan that ensures that
knowledge is updated with the latest trends in sustainable development, ESG requirements and
corporate social responsibility, the main compliance risks, as well as best practices in corporate
governance in international markets.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulations of the Appointments Committee, this Committee
coordinates the evaluation of the Board of Directors and of the committees thereof and submits to
the full Board the results of said evaluation together with a proposed plan of action.
Within the framework of the evaluation process for financial year 2022, Iberdrola has decided to
draw on the help of PricewaterhouseCoopers Asesores de Negocios, S.L.
This process is based on the review of a large number of quantifiable and measurable indicators
that are objectively updated every year based on the latest trends. As a result of this process, the
company develops and adopts ongoing improvement plans designed to implement the specific
measures that contribute to continue perfecting corporate governance practices. A summary of this
process can be found in section C.1.17 of the Annual Corporate Governance Report 2022.
Identifying, managing and evaluating economic, environmental and
social impacts
■ GRI 2-12
The Board of Directors of Iberdrola is structured as described in chapter "I.1 About Iberdrola”, and
its consultative committees assist it in its task of supervising the management of the company's
economic, social and environmental performance. This includes both the supervision of the risks
and opportunities generated by the group’s activities and compliance with international principles,
codes and standards applicable to the tasks for which it is responsible. The Board of Directors and
its consultative committees perform periodic evaluations of the aforementioned aspects of the
group’s performance, drawing for such purpose on external information of interest thereto, with the
assistance of external independent advisers, and on information provided to them by the rest of the
organisation itself, primarily through periodic appearances of the group’s officers.
These appearances are reported in the Activities Report of the Board of Directors and of the
Committees thereof.
■ GRI 2-13 2-17
The Sustainable Development Committee has supervised the company’s conduct in the area of
sustainability, corporate reputation, corporate governance and compliance. The general secretary
and secretary of the Board of Directors, the director of Compliance, the director Innovation,
Sustainability, and Climate Change, and the director of ESG have appeared on a recurring basis.
The heads of the various areas have also been invited to make presentations at meetings during
which issues within their purview have been discussed.
Pursuant to the corporate and governance structure specified in the Governance and
Sustainability System, and particularly in the Policy for the Definition and Coordination of the
Iberdrola Group and Foundations of Corporate Organisation, the implementation, monitoring
and supervisions of the group’s sustainable development strategy is the responsibility of its various
companies, and is performed by the various committees handling sustainable development and
reputational duties, while respecting the principles of subsidiary and decentralised management.
Remuneration policies
■ GRI 2-17 2-19 2-20
As provided in the By-Laws and the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Board of
Directors, at the proposal of the Remuneration Committee, is the body with power to set the
remuneration of directors within the overall limit set by the By-Laws and in accordance with law,
except for such remuneration as consists of the delivery of shares or of options thereon or which is
indexed to the price of the shares, which must be submitted to the shareholders for approval at the
General Shareholders’ Meeting. The Remuneration Committee is a consultive committee chaired by
an independent director (the first vice-chair and lead independent director) and made up mostly of
independent directors.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for evaluating the level of achievement of the targets to
which variable annual and multi-annual remuneration is linked and for submitting it to the Board of
Directors for approval.
As a result of the group’s commitment to sustainability, the long-term incentive plan (2020-2022
Strategic Bonus) approved by the shareholders at the 2020 General Shareholders’ Meeting includes
objectives linked to the fight against climate change, notably the acceleration of the emissions
reduction objectives. This commitment is aligned with the goal of reducing overall emissions
intensity, which contributes to SDGs 7 and 13, by 2030. Other objectives linked to the long-term
incentive plan relate to increasing the number of suppliers that adhere to sustainable development
policies and standards and eliminating the wage gap.
Pursuant to the By-Laws, the Company will annually allocate as an expense an amount equal to a
maximum of two percent of the group’s consolidated profit during the preceding financial year for the
following purposes:
a. To remunerate the directors both for their status as such and for any executive duties, based
on the positions held, dedication and attendance at meetings of the corporate decision-
making bodies.
b. To maintain a fund to cover the obligations incurred by the Company with respect to
pensions, the payment of life insurance premiums and the making of severance payments to
former and current directors.
The allocation, with a maximum limit of two percent, can only accrue if the profit from the preceding
financial year is sufficient to cover the requirements of the legal reserve and other mandatory
reserves and if the shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend of at least four per cent of the
share capital with a charge to said financial year.
Regardless of the provisions of the preceding sections, the remuneration of the directors may
consist of the delivery of shares or options thereon, as well as remuneration linked to the value of
the Company’s shares, subject always to the approval of the shareholders acting at a General
Shareholders’ Meeting.
Stakeholders’ engagement in remuneration
■ GRI 2-20
The Annual Director Remuneration Report for financial year 2021 was approved in a consultive
vote by the shareholders at the General Shareholders’ Meeting held on 17 June 2022, which had a
quorum of 72.13%.
The Annual Director Remuneration Report for financial year 2022 will be submitted to a
consultative vote of the shareholders at the General Shareholders’ Meeting to be held in 2023.
Shareholder engagement
Iberdrola is a pioneer in encouraging shareholder engagement as one of the fundamental pillars of
its corporate governance strategy, with the General Shareholders’ Meeting being the
shareholders’ main channel for participation in corporate life.
The 2022 General Shareholders’ Meeting was held physically at the corporate headquarters, with
shareholders and their proxy representatives having the ability to attend remotely, and initiatives to
continue fostering participation include:
1. Proactive delivery of proxy and remote voting cards to shareholder registered with OLA
Shareholders’ Club or who provided their email address for this purpose.
2. Inclusion of a QR code in the proxy and absentee voting cards sent by Iberdrola to facilitate
electronic participation.
3. Expansion of the channels for remote participation for shareholders and proxy holders to
send images of their cards through new instant messaging systems.
4. Prize draw for 10 electric bicycles among shareholders voting or granting proxies through the
corporate website’s participation portal or the telephone channel.
5. Commemorative gifts at shareholder information desks opened by Iberdrola to facilitate
participation before the General Shareholders’ Meeting.
6. New financial incentive: an engagement dividend of €0.005 (gross) per share was paid to all
shareholders who were entitled to participate, conditional upon reaching a quorum of at least
70 % of the share capital and the approval of the corresponding amendment to the By-Laws
to establish this incentive.
As a result of these measures, the General Shareholders’ Meeting held on 17 June 2022 achieved a
quorum of 72.13% of share capital (22.18% present and 49.95% by proxy), compared to 65.83% at
the 2021 General Meeting, with all resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors being approved
by a broad majority.
Since 2016 the Basque Government (through the state-owned company Ihobe) and AENOR certify
that the management of Iberdrola’s General Shareholders’ Meeting meets the standards for the
environmental sustainability of events in the Basque Country (Erronka Garbia) and the ISO 20121
standard on sustainable event management, respectively.
The company has implemented several specific channels of communication to promote accessibility,
the understanding of information, and ultimately the engagement of the shareholders, including the
following:
a. Shareholder’s Office. From the call to the General Shareholders’ Meeting through the end
thereof, the shareholders can rely on the support of the Shareholder’s Office (Oficina del
Accionista), which is in permanent contact with those shareholders who have voluntarily
entered their names in its database, and provides a specific service to minority shareholders
for the organisation of presentations and events prior to the General Shareholders’ Meeting.
b. OLS Shareholders’ Club. An open and permanent channel of participation between the
company and shareholders who are interested in monitoring the company’s evolution on an
ongoing basis.
c. Investor Relations Office. Responds on a regular and personalised basis to the questions
of analysts and qualified institutional investors in equities, fixed-income securities and
socially responsible investments.
d. Relations with shareholder associations and institutional shareholders. Both
shareholder associations and institutional shareholders may request meetings with
representatives of the company through the Investor Relations Division.
e. Last, the Governance and Sustainability System makes provision for the ability of the
Board of Directors or its chairman or the Executive Committee to authorise the first vice-chair
and lead independent director or other directors to engage in dialogue with specific
shareholders on issues relating to corporate governance and sustainable development.
The Shareholder Engagement Policy is one of the main pillars
in the corporate governance strategy
Annual total compensation ratio and annual total compensation

Evaluation of risks
■ GRI 205-1
One of the main elements of the Compliance System is the existence of a process of regular and
continuous identification and evaluation of the compliance-related risks of each of the corporate
functions and in the businesses of the group.
Thus, in terms of risk assessments, two types of evaluations are carried out, which include the risk
of corruption:
1. For the purpose of developing the Crime Prevention Policy, the companies of the group
have implemented a set of measures making up the Crime Prevention Programme, which
has been implemented at each country subholding and head of business company, all within
the framework of the process of review and adjustment to the most recent changes to the
Spanish Criminal Code following the introduction of criminal liability for legal entities, without
prejudice to the legal provisions applicable in any other jurisdiction in which the company does
business.
To implement these Crime Prevention Programmes, there is a regular evaluation of the
risks of committing criminal acts that might ultimately be alleged against the various
companies of the group based on their activities, as well as an identification of existing
controls and the establishment of new controls for the prevention thereof.
2. The Compliance Unit and the compliance divisions regularly update the compliance risk map
following the guidelines established in the Compliance Risk Evaluation Guide established
by the Compliance Unit, as well as an identification of the likelihood of each risk occurring and
the impact that this would have.
These risk maps are drawn up based on an inventory of homogeneous risks for the boundary
of the Group using a common methodology. The risks to be assessed are grouped into the
three categories in which the compliance function has been assigned the following
competences: (i) crime prevention; (ii) separation of activities; and (iii) securities market, as
shown in the table below:
Risks
Crime prevention Separation of activities Securities market
Corruption and fraud Scope Market abuse
Money laundering and terrorist financing Effective separation Inadequate custody of information
Market abuse Brand image Information to the regulator
International sanctions Costs for common services Updating records
Scams Management independence
Permits, licences and authorisations Commercially sensitive information
Fraud against public authorities and
Independent monitoring
social security
Punishable insolvencies Network access
Intellectual and industrial property Price discrimination
Smuggling
Unfair trade practices
Distortion of public information
Data prevention
Cybercrime
Business secrecy
Occupational risk prevention
Workers’ rights
Obstructing external monitoring
Safety at facilities, the environment and
public health
Consumer protection
Each compliance division analyses whether there are signs of these risks in their respective country
subholding companies, head of business companies and in each of the corporate and business
areas. With the information obtained, a compliance risk map is prepared for each entity, which is
updated on a regular basis, identifying the main controls in the scope of the group to mitigate such
risks and, if necessary, proposing improvement actions to strengthen the effectiveness of these
controls.
Although Iberdrola, S.A. and the other Spanish companies are not subject to Law 10/2010 on anti-
money laundering and counter terrorist financing (the “Money Laundering Act”) and, therefore, this
Act and the formal and administrative obligations imposed thereunder on certain groups do not
apply to them, the risk of perpetration of money laundering offences is contemplated as part of the
Crime Prevention Programme of such companies.
However, Iberdrola Inmobiliaria, S.A.U. is subject to the Money Laundering Act due to the nature of it
activities, and therefore, in addition to the aforementioned preventive controls, this company has
implemented additional specific controls primarily aimed at preventing this type of crime. By way of
example, the company has approved rules like the Procedure to Prevent Money-Laundering and
Terrorist Financing, Contract Approval Endorsements, the Leased Assets Billing Procedure and
Payment Order Validation monitoring.
Communication and training related to anti-corruption rules
Training and communication are two fundamental pillars of the Compliance System to ensure that all
of its professionals are aware of and comply with the Code of Ethics.
Within this context, the Compliance Unit and the compliance divisions plan their training and
communication activities on an annual basis in collaboration with the corresponding human
resources and communications divisions.
Corporate policies, including the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud Policy and the Crime
Prevention Policy, as well as the Code of Ethics, are available on the corporate website and on
the employee portal.
The protocols and other procedures approved by the Compliance Unit are available on the
employee portal and are circulated by email to all departments where these procedures may be
applicable.

Monitoring
Grievance mailboxes of the group
■ GRI 2-26
One of the basic elements of the Compliance System are the detection and/or monitoring
mechanisms allowing for verification of the effectiveness of the controls and prevention activities
carried out at the group. These mechanisms include the ethics mailboxes for professionals, which
are tools that can be used to make queries or report conduct that may involve the commission of
any improper conduct or any act contrary to law or the rules.
The group also has suppliers’ ethics mailboxes. These mailboxes are communication channels to
enable the suppliers of the group, as well as any companies that they subcontract, their respective
employees and companies that have participated in a tender, to report conduct that might entail (i)
violation by any group professional of the Governance and Sustainability System, the Code of
Ethics or applicable law, or (ii) the commission by a supplier, its subcontractors or the respective
employees thereof of any act contrary to law or to the provisions of the section of the Code of
Ethics applicable to suppliers within the framework of their business relations with the group. These
mailboxes are available in the purchasing portal of the website.
The group also has a shareholders’ ethics mailbox. This mailbox represents a channel of
communication through which shareholders can report conduct that night involve a breach of the
company’s Governance and Sustainability System or the commission by any professional of the
group of an act contrary to the law or to the rules of conduct of the Code of Ethics. This mailbox is
available on the group’s corporate website, specifically within the interactive system provided for the
shareholders known as “OLS – Shareholder´s Club”.
Response and remediation plans
■ GRI 205-3
A total of 2,938 communications were received through the ethics mailboxes in financial year 2022,
of which 1,551 were queries and 1,387 were complaints. Of the 1,387 complaints received, 885
were accepted for processing. In 5% of the cases of complaints allowed to proceed, some type of
disciplinary measure was taken upon a showing that there had been improper conduct or conduct
contrary to the Code of Ethics. Of the total of 885 complaints that were accepted for processing,
433 were classified as having a potential impact on human rights.
Information regarding the existence of cases of corruption during the financial year
The Company confirmed the existence of one case of corruption reported through the ethical
mailboxes during financial year 2022. After the relevant internal investigation, it was found that a
Neoenergia employee had solicited financial consideration from a customer in exchange for
providing improper preferential treatment in the terms of a contract. The employee was dismissed in
application of the internal disciplinary regime.
In March, the company learned of a complaint filed with the Romanian Organised Crime and
Terrorism Investigation Department (DIICOT) pursuant to which it was confirmed that an
investigation had commenced based on a complaint filed by Eolica Dobrogea SRL, C-Tech SRL,
Corneliu Dica and Ms Ceausescu against Iberdrola, S.A., Iberdrola Renovables Energía, Iberdrola
DIICOT is a division of the Romanian public prosecutor’s office in charge of investigating organised
crime. This decision from DIICOT only confirms that the complaint was filed and that the work of
investigation will commence. It is important to bear in mind that, at this point, no formal accusation
has been made against any company personnel or any of Iberdrola’s companies.
Proceedings from prior years with an impact on the financial year.
The Iberdrola group has been working with the courts to clarify the circumstances relating to the
hiring of the company Cenyt by some group companies in order to enforce any liabilities that may
arise and to defend its good name and reputation.
After a long investigation by Central Investigative Court no. 6 of the National High Court, neither
Iberdrola, any of the companies of its Group, nor any directors or officers thereof have been found
liable in any respect. No Group company is being investigated as part of these proceedings, in
which Iberdrola, S.A appeared as an aggrieved party.
In these proceedings, the chair of the Board of Directors and the other directors and executives,
current and former, of Iberdrola, S.A. who had been investigated at any point during the proceedings
were all acquitted, with the exception of a former head of security at the company who is no longer
associated therewith, and with respect to which an application for dismissal filed with this Court is
currently pending resolution. The action for disclosure of trade secrets filed by the Company against
another former executive, who is no longer associated therewith and who used to work in the
accounting department, is also pending resolution.
After a review and analysis of the internal processes performed with the help of independent experts
and pursuant to the group’s Governance and Sustainability System and Compliance has not
revealed any violation of the internal control systems or of the Code of Ethics or of any other rules
or procedures in the engagement of the company Cenyt by certain companies of the Group, without
prejudice to the reputational impact of these events on Iberdrola, S.A. or on the companies in its
Group.
In the Castile and León Wind Farm matter, arising from the claim filed by the Anti-Corruption Division
of the Public Prosecutor’s office for alleged crimes committed in obtaining approvals for the building
of wind farms in Castile and León between 2004 and 2009, Investigative Court no. 4 of Valladolid
issued an order to commence Oral Proceedings in November 2021, pursuant to which:
1. It orders the commencement of oral proceedings against, among other individuals and as
pertains to Iberdrola, three officers of the group, two of whom are no longer associated
therewith, for alleged commission of the continuing offence of bribery, requiring each to
provide a €130 million bond. Iberdrola Renovables Energía provided three corporate
guarantees, each in the amount of €130 million, as a personal bond payable upon demand,
to cover the monetary penalties that might apply, thus lifting the freeze on the accused
officers’ assets.
2. AIt orders the commencement of oral proceedings against Iberdrola Renovables Castilla y
León (IBERCYL) for subsidiary civil liability, in the amount of €11,257,500, jointly and
severally with the Castile and Leon Government. IBERCYL initially challenged the measure
imposed, which was denied by Order of 18/11/2022. with respect to which IBERCYL filed an
appeal for reconsideration (recurso de reforma), which has not yet been decided. As of
today, no security has yet been provided.
Public policies
Relations with regulatory entities and social institutions
■ GRI 415
Iberdrola has two kinds of relationships with regulatory entities:
• Relationships geared towards contributing to the enactment of efficient regulatory provisions
allowing for the development of a competitive market in activities that are not subject to a
natural monopoly, and sufficient remuneration for regulated businesses. To that end, there is
a continuous and constructive dialogue where information, knowledge and positions are
exchanged. Iberdrola is thus acquainted with the concerns and proposals of regulatory
entities and provides them with its own positions in the legitimate defence of its interests and
those of its shareholders and customers. The company also actively participates in “public
hearings” held by regulatory entities in order to ascertain the opinions of the players involved
in the processes prior to the revision of regulations or the determination of domestic and
European energy policies. It also participates in the official processes of enactment of laws
and regulations and in monitoring the application thereof.
• Provision of all information required by regulatory entities, whether in connection with the
normal conduct of its business or as a result of any transitory issue.
In addition to its direct relationships with regulatory entities, Iberdrola and the companies in its group
participate in the regulatory process through the various domestic and international trade
associations of which they are members.

V. Financial
For Iberdrola, ESG issues are integrated into its strategy and operations and are therefore directly
linked to its financial performance. This approach, which the company calls ESG+F, is reflected in its
activities and business model. Thanks to this consistency between growth and financing strategy,
the company has direct access to the capital market and is a recognised leader as an issuer of
green and sustainable financial instruments.
This commitment is reflected in the inclusion within the group’s ESG objectives of two objectives
relating to the financing strategy that will enable the company to continue to lead the green bond
and sustainable financing market.
V.1. Sustainable economic growth

Economic/financial impact
■ GRI 201
The electricity industry is and will be a significant driver of the economy, to which it contributes by
means of high investments and the creation of both direct and indirect high-quality jobs. An example
of this, Iberdrola’s strategic commitment to a sustainable, safe and competitive energy model that
makes it possible to fight climate change has resulted in more than €140,000 million of investments
over the last 20 years. This activity, measured for financial year 2021, has generated a total annual
employment impact of some 400,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs worldwide, contributing more
than €37,000 million to global GDP annually, and making a total annual tax contribution, including
direct and indirect taxes, of more than €15,300 million.84

In addition to the direct economic impacts that occur as a result of the cash flows that are generated,
the Iberdrola group also induces additional effects or indirect economic impacts such as those
described below:
■ GRI 203-2
From an economic standpoint, the expansion of electricity systems drives the regional economy in
the region where it occurs and creates employment opportunities, contributing to economic and
social enhancement.
The positive effects at the local level include, among others, improvement of the economy and
employment (direct and indirect), revitalisation and repopulation of underpopulated rural areas,
generation of fees, taxes and duties at the different stages of activity and areas of operation, training
of professionals, support of local communities through various sponsorship initiatives, promotion of
economic development, and improvement in the quality of life through electrification, energy
efficiency projects, waste revaluation, etc. For example, the Sikuli programme in Mexico to promote
social entrepreneurship.
Likewise, and at a general level, renewable projects help to reduce the overall CO2 emissions of the
energy mix of the country where they are implemented, contributing to the decarbonisation not only
of the region where they are located, but also of the country and the planet as a whole, thus helping
to curb global warming and supporting each country's decarbonisation targets. In addition, the
Challenge Resilience and Challenge Fires projects have been launched to work with start-ups to find
innovative solutions for distribution infrastructure.
Potentially negative effects, which the company seeks to avoid, can be considered to include the
following:
• Environmental risks, which may give rise to undesirable consequences for the environment,
such as spills and improper emissions, or waste management.
• The impact on terrain of the facilities, especially large ones, and the possible negative effects
(during construction or operation) on traditional activities, particularly in the rural
environment, such as ranching, hunting or fishing.
88 Investment tax credits.
■ GRI 203-1
During the construction and operation of its facilities, Iberdrola also carries out certain infrastructure
activities that are unrelated to its facilities, but rather that are intended to meet the needs of the
social environment, resolving existing shortcomings in the local communities.
A summary of these projects with strong social impact during 2022, is provided below:
• Improvement of paths and walkways, leading to a better quality of life for residents in the
surrounding area.
• In the United Kingdom, there are continuing activities to improve various infrastructure and to
make landscape improvements for the enjoyment of people near the various production
centres. The Networks Business in the United Kingdom has developed the Little Kerse
project, in the total amount of £389,000, thus completing the last project financed by the
Green Economy Fund. A campaign to provide advice and support to vulnerable local
communities in their path towards Net Zero has been launched through the Net Zero
Transport Fund.
• In Brazil, the Quilombola culture programme is of particular note, especially the construction
of the headquarters of the Quilombos de Santa Rosa Community Association, intended to
serve as a direct communication channel to convey information, give support to the
community, and answer questions. Moreover, in 2022 the Energy Museum opened again,
through the restoration of a historic building in Pelourinho, Salvador (BA), in which it is
intended to bring the world of energy closer to society and promote knowledge of this world.
• In Mexico, an annual social contribution is made to the communities surrounding the
projects. It is based on the following criteria: culture, sport, health, education and social
development. In parallel, repairs are made to the roads used for on-site Operation and
Maintenance tasks, and by local residents. The Ricardo Flores primary school in Lalaxo was
also repaired.
• Finally, there is the partnership with Hydrographic Confederations and other entities in Spain,
especially those focused on environmental issues, to enable various activities near
hydroelectric reservoirs by adjusting flows at certain times.

customers to provide them with information regarding the COVID-19 Payment Program.
Note 44 of the 2022 Consolidated Annual Financial Report provides detailed information on the
significant contingent assets and liability of the Iberdrola group relating to those judicial and
extrajudicial disputes in the ordinary conduct of business (which may be disputes with suppliers,
customers, administrative or tax authorities, private citizens, environmental activities, or employees).
The opinion of the Iberdrola group’s legal advisors is that the outcome of these disputes will not
significantly affect its financial situation.
ESG Finances
In keeping with its sustainable business model, Iberdrola is positioned as one of the world's leading
and pioneering business groups in ESG financing. This has the threefold objective of (i) aligning its
financial strategy with its purpose, values and investment strategy, (ii) optimising the cost of its debt,
and (iii) diversifying its sources of financing, transforming sustainability into both an end and a
means to the financial strength it pursues and which characterises it.
Iberdrola demonstrates this commitment to ESG financing in the various regions in which it operates
and through the different instruments and formats it uses to finance itself.
The ESG financing subscribed by the IBERDROLA Group in 2022 amounts to €9,512 million, with
the group’s ESG Financing portfolio totalling €48,473 million. The breakdown by product is as
follows:

Green finance transactions
The group has signed new green finance transactions in 2022 in the total amount of €6,017 million.
This brings the total amount of green finance at the end of 2022 to €26,95690 million.
The differentiating feature of this financing is the commitment to use the funds obtained for projects
with a positive impact on the environment, including renewable energy, expansion and digitalisation
of electricity transmission and distribution grids, researching new, more efficient technologies, and
the smart mobility projects in which Iberdrola invests. The company also commits to provide annual
reports, through various indicators, on the environmental return generated by these projects, so that
investors can be aware of their level of contribution to the environmental improvement achieved.
The funds secured through all of these operations have gone towards financing or refinancing
investments in projects that meet certain environmental and sustainable development criteria, as
described in the relevant Green Financing Frameworks91 of Iberdrola, AVANGRID and Neoenergia.
These Frameworks are aligned with the Green Bond Principles (“GBPs”) established by the
International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and have the Second Party Opinion of a renowned
international expert regarding their alignment with the GBPs in all cases.
Green bonds
In the capital markets, Iberdrola is the world’s leading private group in terms of green bonds issued.
The company issued its first green bond in 2014, and since then has intensified its financing through
this type of instrument, with many more issues and in various areas: both public and private issues,
involving senior and subordinated debt (hybrid bonds) issued by the Corporation or other
subsidiaries (AVANGRID green bonds and Neoenergia green debentures and all other companies
under these sub-groups).
90 Including 100% of green financing with partners, in the amount of €2,416 million.
91 Iberdrola Framework for Green Financing, AVANGRID Framework for Green Financing and Green Finance Framework do Grupo
As a Corporation, Iberdrola engaged in four new green bond issues in 2022, three of them for senior
debt and a fourth one structured as a bond whose yield is linked to the price of Iberdrola’s shares
(equity-linked):
• In March, €1,000 million of 10-year bonds were issued, and which were allocated to the
financing of the St. Brieuc (France) and Baltic Eagle (in Germany) wind farm plants, both
under construction.
• In November, there was an issuance of €1,500 million, structured into two tranches: €750
million for a six-year term and €750 million for a 10-year term. The funds obtained from both
transactions were allocated to the financing of renewable assets (mainly photovoltaic solar
energy) in Spain and other European countries.
• In November there was another issue in the amount of €450 million, which was drawn down
in December. This is a five-year bond linked to the price of Iberdrola’s shares. The funds
obtained were allocated to financing the investment plan for the Networks business in Spain
during the 2021-2023 period.
At AVANGRID, Central Maine Power issued a green mortgage bond in July in the amount of US$125
million (€118 million). The funds obtained were allocated to Networks projects.
At Neoenergia, Neoenergia Distribuição Brasilia, Neoenergia Celpe and Neoenergia Elektro issued
three green debentures in July in the combined total amount of R$950 million (€169 million). The
funds obtained were allocated to Networks projects.
At year-end 2022, Iberdrola has a total of 19 current green bonds issued by the Corporation in the
total amount of €14,197 million. The Green Financing Returns Report contains information and
details on all outstanding financing during 2022.
In addition, Iberdrola, through its subsidiary AVANGRID and several of its subsidiaries, has green
bonds outstanding in the US market in the combined amount of US$2,850 million (€2,678 million)
aimed at financing renewable and distribution projects in the United States. Information and details
on this financing is described in the AVANGRID 2022 Sustainability Report.
Neoenergia and its subsidiaries also have green financings outstanding on the capital markets,
totalling R$4,445 million (€793 million), earmarked for financing renewable and transmission or
distribution projects in Brazil. Information and details on this financing is described in the
Sustainability Report.
Bank loans
In the banking market, Iberdrola received the first green loan obtained by an energy company in
2017, which was followed by other green transactions. In 2018 Iberdrola México, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Iberdrola, executed the first green corporate loan in Latin America for US$400 million,
which was used to refinance the company’s renewables assets in Mexico. In May 2022 Iberdrola
México extended the maturity of this green loan for an additional year, until May 2024.
Multilateral loans
With regard to multilateral green loans, in May 2019, Iberdrola obtained its first green loan from the
European Investment Bank (EIB) and since then has continued with the signing of a number of
corporate green loans. These public institutions have their own standards for evaluating projects and
for allocating green instruments. All of the assets financed by these institutions are also included as
projects capable of green financing within the framework of Iberdrola’s green financing.
In 2022, the Corporation signed four green loans with the EIB totalling €893 million:
• €53 million to partially finance the building of a 20 MW industrial facility for the production of
green hydrogen through water hydrolysis, to manufacture ammonia. This loan also financed
a 100 MW photovoltaic plant, a battery storage system, and a number of supplementary
facilities.
• €550 million, for the development of a portfolio of wind farm and photovoltaic solar projects
located in Spain.
• €220 million, to modernise, automate and adapt distribution networks to the electrification of
consumption.
• €70 million, for the development of a 188 MW portfolio of photovoltaic solar projects located
in Portugal.
In 2022, Coelba, a member of the Neoenergia Group, increased its green financing with a “Super
Green Loan” from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group,
in the amount of R$550 million (€98 million) to finance improvements to and the expansion of
transmission networks and their digitisation.
Further details on these green operations and their sustainability returns can be found in Report on
Green Financing Returns. Further details on these green operations and their sustainability returns
can be found in Neoenergia Sustainability Report (for transactions carried out by Neoenergia and
subsidiaries).
Loans with development banks and ECAs
In April 2022, Iberdrola signed a loan for €35 million with the Spanish Official Credit Institute (ICO) to
partially finance, together with the EIB, the building of 20 MW industrial facilities for the generation of
green hydrogen through water hydrolysis, to manufacture ammonia. These loans also finance a 100
MW photovoltaic plant, a battery storage system, and a number of supplementary facilities.
Iberdrola has continued to diversify its sources of financing, establishing new trade relations with
Export Credit Agencies (ECAs). These Credit Agencies have insurance policies that assure very
high percentages of the financings, thus enabling Iberdrola to diversity its sources of financing and
reduce the consumption of risk with banking institutions.
Iberdrola has thus carried out two operations totalling €1,500 million in 2022.
• In April 2022, Iberdrola signed a green loan for €1,000 million with Banco Santander. This
loan is secured by the Danish Export Credit Agency EKF to finance goods of interest to
Denmark. The funds will go towards onshore and offshore wind farms with Vestas or
Siemens Gamesa turbines. The wind farms are included in various European countries.
• In October 2022, Iberdrola signed a €500 million green loan with:
• Caixabank for €250 million.
• BNP Paribas for €250 million.
The loan is guaranteed by the Spanish Export Credit Agency CESCE, with backing from the Spanish
government, and falls within its green policy, to finance investments to help to mitigate climate
change. The loan will be used for investment in photovoltaic and wind renewables, batteries and
transport networks in Portugal, the United Kingdom and Poland.
All of the assets financed by these institutions are included as projects capable of green financing
within the framework of Iberdrola’s green financing.
More details on these green operations and their sustainability returns can be found in the Report on
Green Financing Returns (for financing by the Corporation).
Structured finance
In 2020 Iberdrola signed its first green Project Financing through its 63.55%-owned subsidiary
Iberdrola Renovables de la Rioja, S.A., provided by BBVA in the amount of €23.3 million, to
refinance 12 wind farms in La Rioja, which was repaid in 2022.
In 2021 Iberdrola signed two green Project Finance agreements through its subsidiaries Parques
Eólicos Alto Layna, S.L.U and Energías Renovables Ibermap, S.L., 20% owned subsidiaries of
Iberdrola, provided by BBVA in the amount of €10692 million, and by BBVA, Banco Santander and
BNP in the amount of €191.893 million, respectively, to refinance wind farms in Spain.
More details on these green loans and their sustainability returns can be found in the Report on
Green Financing Returns.
In 2022 AVANGRID increased its financing under the form of Green Tax Equity Investment by $271
million (€254 million) through two new transactions, Lundhill and the Amendment to the Aeolus VIII
portfolio, with Tax Equity Investment investors. Information and details on these financings is
described in the AVANGRID 2022 Sustainability Report.
Financial transactions linked to the achievement of sustainable
objectives
The group has also formalised other financing agreements with the ESG label. These are
sustainable financings that, rather than earmarking funds, link certain elements of the instrument to
sustainability metrics or the achievement of strategic objectives aligned with the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). These include the group’s loans to manage and optimise its liquidity,
called commercial paper, a very short-term financing instrument.
As in the case of green financing transactions, the financial transactions linked to the achievement
of sustainable objectives are also certified by an independent expert in terms of the established
metrics and their alignment with targets established with the company's sustainable strategy and
with the Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles (SLLP).
92 Outstanding balance of the Alto de Layna loan at 31/12/2022: €86 million. The Parques Eólicos Alto de Layna loan had a Second Party
Opinion from G-Advisory. Parques Eólicos Alto de Layna is a company in which Iberdrola owns a 20% interest.

Credit facilities linked to sustainable objectives
At year-end 2022, Iberdrola, through the Corporation and AVANGRID, has a number of credit
facilities in the aggregate amount of €15,272 million, with the cost linked to achieving sustainable
objectives. The main objectives established in these credit facilities are associated with
environmental and social KPIs:
• €2,500 million sustainable syndicated credit facility and ¥16,000 million bilateral credit facility,
the maturities of which were extended in 2022 by an additional year until 2027:
◦ Environmental KPI: intensity of CO emissions, measured in grams per kilowatt hour
2
produced (g/kWh).
◦ Social KPI: percentage of women in leadership positions.
• €1,500 million sustainable syndicated credit facility:
◦ Environmental KPI: Renewable capacity installed within the group.
◦ Social KPI: number of people in developing countries benefiting from electricity
access.
• €5,300 million sustainable syndicated credit facility:
◦ Environmental KPI: intensity of CO emissions, measured in grams per kilowatt hour
2
produced (g/kWh).
In 2022 a new and innovative facility was signed in the amount of €2,500 million, linked to the
company’s water footprint through two sustainability indicators:
• Environmental KPI: amount of water consumed by the Group in its own or controlled
production facilities and not returned to the environment, measured in cubic metres (m3) per
gigawatt hour (m3/GWh) of energy produced.
• Environmental KPI: rating assigned to Iberdrola by the independent agency CDP Water.
Iberdrola is aware of the importance of water usage in the management of its activities, and wants to
significantly contribute to SDG 6: “Clean water and sanitation”.
Furthermore, in 2021 AVANGRID extended the maturity and limit of the syndicated credit facility
signed in 2018 until 2026 and up to US$3,575 million respectively, maintaining the initial indicator
that requires reducing CO emissions.

Bank loans linked to sustainable objectives
In 2022 Iberdrola signed bank loans in the aggregate amount of €995 million, linked to the following
indicator relating to water management:
• Environmental KPI: amount of water consumed by the Group in its own or controlled
production facilities and not returned to the environment, measured in cubic metres (m3) per
gigawatt hour (m3/GWh) of energy produced.
In addition, in 2021 Iberdrola obtained the first loan in the European energy sector linked to a
reduction in water consumption, in the amount of €250 million. The loan includes an incentive linked
to meeting certain circular economy objectives.
ESG commercial paper
On 15 April 2021 Iberdrola formalised the update of its framework programme for the issuance of
short-term notes in the Euromarket (ECP), increasing the maximum outstanding limit to €5,000
million (from the previous figure of €3,000 million) and incorporating the sustainable label linked to
the achievement of three objectives associated with the areas of the ESG strategy:
a. Environmental: intensity of CO2 emissions, measured in grams per kilowatt hour produced
(gr/kWh) (contribution to SDGs 7, 13).
b. Social: Percentage of women in positions of leadership in the company (contribution to SDG
5).
c. Governance: Implementation of the eleven recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) (contribution to SDG 16).

This section complies with the reporting obligations established by Article 8 of EU Regulation
852/2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investments, supplemented
by Delegated Regulation 2139/2021, which determines eligible activities with respect to climate
change mitigation and adaptation objectives, and in accordance with Delegated Regulation
2178/2021, which develops the reporting methodology.
Under this regulatory framework, companies are required to report their eligibility and alignment
through three economic indicators; as a percentage of turnover, investment and operating
expenditure.
In 2022 the reporting obligations led to the publication of the eligibility percentage (which had
already been reported at year-end 2021), and, for the first time, of the percentage alignment for the
three economic indicators and for all the activities carried out by the company.
Evaluation of eligibility, compliance with substantial contribution criteria, no significant
harm, and existence of social safeguards
The activities carried out by the Iberdrola group companies have been evaluated with respect to the
mitigation objective for purposes of eligibility and alignment. Thus, no amounts have been assigned
to the climate change adjustment goal to avoid double accounting.
The first step is to determine which of the Iberdrola group’s activities are eligible for purposes of the
regulation. Eligible activities are those that could potentially contribute to one or more of the EU’s
environmental goals, and are described in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139.
Analysing the activities carried out by the Iberdrola group, and taking as a reference the descriptions
included in Annexes I and II of the Delegated Regulation, the list of eligible activities of the Iberdrola
group is as follows: 3.1 Manufacture of hydrogen, 4.1 Electricity generation using photovoltaic solar
technology, 4.3 Electricity generation from wind power, 4.5 Electricity generation from hydropower,
4.9 Transmission and distribution of electricity, 4.1 Storage of electricity, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6
Energy Efficiency, Installation, maintenance and repair of: charging stations for electric vehicles in
buildings, instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of
buildings, and renewable energy technologies94.
The second step is to analyse how each activity does or does not meet the substantial contribution
requirements.
For an activity to be considered aligned it must satisfy the technical criteria of substantial
contribution to an environmental objective. For these purposes, Iberdrola has assessed compliance
with these criteria for each head of business company, which has been documented in the
company's records.
The third step is to assess how each activity meets, or does not meet, the criteria of no harm to
other environmental objectives. The design of these criteria established by the delegated regulation
is generally based on compliance with European regulations and/or standards for different
environmental aspects. In order to assess and document compliance with these criteria at each
head of business company, many of which operate in non-EU countries, the group has developed a
methodology based on transferring requirements to surveys, which has enabled the work to be
carried out in a homogeneous manner throughout the group. Each head of business company has
assessed its compliance and has documented and evidenced its findings.
The fourth and final step is the assessment of the existence of sufficient social safeguards in the
context of performing the activities. A similar approach to the no harm assessment has been
followed and, based on an analysis using surveys and the group's existing human rights due
diligence mechanisms, the existence of social safeguards has been satisfactorily documented. In
this regard, worthy of note is the publication in 2022 of the group’s first report on Human Rights,
which provides extensive explanations on this issue.
Finally, in order to ensure consistency between the assessment of criteria and actual performance,
an analysis of the disclosure of the following indicators has been carried out: GRI 2-27 Compliance
with laws and regulations; GRI 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken; GRI
406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken; GRI 418-1 Substantiated complaints
concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data; GRI 416-2 Incidents of non-
compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and service; GRI 417-2 non-
compliance cases related to product and service information and labelling (fines or penalties); GRI
417-3 Incidents of non-compliance concerning marketing communications (fines or penalties).
The conclusion is that no inconsistencies can be deduced between the content of these indicators
and the assessment of the no injury or de minimis safeguards criteria.
The criteria applied to calculate the eligibility and alignment percentages are described below.
94 This heading includes the following products sold:
Smart Home: control of the energy consumption of each household appliance, changes in consumption and advice on how to save on
bills.
Smart Mobility: solution for charging electric vehicles with 100% renewable energy. Installation of a charging point, electric contract with
zero CO2 emissions and control from mobile phone with the Smart Mobility Home App.
Smart Solar: complete solar solution, with installation and maintenance of solar panels so that customers can generate their own
Calculation of percentage alignment
To calculate the percentages of alignment with the climate change mitigation objective,
rigorous work was carried out in 2022 at the activity and country level to analyse wheter that the
eligible activities
• Substantially contribute to achieving one or more of the six environmental objectives, in
accordance with articles 10 to 16;
• To do no significant harm to the achievement of the other five environmental objectives
(principle of do no significant harm), in accordance with article 17;
• Meet the requirements on minimum workplace safety and human rights at the company level
(social protections), in accordance with article 18.
The basis to calculate alignment percentages is the eligibility calculation, taking the same
denominator, but including in the numerator only the applicable revenues, investments or expenses
corresponding to the eligible activities that meet the alignment criteria established by the regulations.
It is important to note that vertically integrated companies in the electricity sector carry out various
activities, all of which are necessary for the operation of the electricity value chain.
Some of these activities, like the generation of electricity through wind or photovoltaic technology, or
electricity transmission and distribution, are considered eligible in application of Delegated
Regulation 2039/2021. However, the sale of electricity to end customers is not considered eligible.
Frequently, when a company both generates electricity and sells it to final customers, there is an
inter-company transaction by which the retail activity purchases the electricity from the generation
activity.
In accordance with accounting rules, revenues from the sale of electricity to end customers are part
of the consolidated turnover, and the effect of the intra-group transaction is removed in the
consolidation process.
Iberdrola believes that, in order to most accurately reflect the alignment of its operations with the EU
sustainable activities Taxonomy, the numerator in the income ratio should include sales from the
renewable production business. Otherwise, the ratios would describe a company that, despite
demonstrating an extremely high percentage of its investments and operational expenses in line
with the taxonomy, would have an extremely low percentage of income alignment on a permanent
basis.
Revenues from Generation of electricity from renewable sources is considered in the numerator, and
corresponds to that indicated in Note 37-Revenue, included in the Annual Financial Information of
Iberdrola S.A. and its subsidiaries.
Considering all the above, to ensure the consistency between the reality described by the income
ratio and that described by the investment ratio and the operating expenses ratio, the information
given in this section has been provided as follows:
Calculation of the percentage of eligible turnover
The proportion of eligible Turnover referred to in Article 8(2a) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is
calculated as the share of net turnover resulting from products or services, including intangibles,
associated with economic activities that are eligible according to the taxonomy (numerator), divided
by the net turnover (denominator) as defined in Article 2(5) of Directive 2013/34/EU.
Turnover includes revenue recognised in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS)
1, paragraph 82(a), as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008.
Therefore, for the calculation of the eligibility percentages corresponding to the consolidated
Iberdrola group, and included in the table above:
• The numerator includes the sum of the Turnover (group 70 ledger accounts of the Spanish
General Accounting Plan) of the activities of the companies/subgroups that are eligible and,
• The denominator corresponds to the Iberdrola group's total amount of turnover.
In this turnover ratio, the company includes all the income associated with the main activity,
considering that it contributes to the turnover.
Calculation of the percentage of eligible CapEx
The eligible CapEx ratio referred to in Article 8(2b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is calculated as the
numerator divided by the denominator; the denominator being the additions to tangible and
intangible assets during the relevant financial year before depreciation, amortisation and any new
valuations, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for the relevant financial
year, excluding changes in fair value. The denominator also includes additions to tangible and
intangible assets resulting from business combinations.
For non-financial companies applying International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted by Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008, CapEx should cover costs that are recognised according
to:
a. IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment, paragraph 73(e)(i) and (iii);
b. IAS 38 Intangible Assets, paragraph 118(e)(i);
c. IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 79(d)(i) and (ii) (for the cost model);
d. IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53(h)
Leases that do not give rise to the recognition of a right to use the asset are not accounted for as
CapEx.
The numerator, on the other hand, includes the part of the fixed asset investments included in the
denominator that:
a. Relates to assets or processes that are associated with eligible economic activities;
b. Forms part of a plan to expand the economic activities aligned with the taxonomy or to
enable economic activities eligible under the taxonomy to be brought into line with the
taxonomy in the future (“CapEx plan”) under the conditions specified in the second
paragraph of this point 1.1.2.2 (relating to the “CapEx plan”);
c. Relates to the purchase of production from economic activities aligned with the taxonomy
and individual measures that enable the targeted activities to become low-carbon or
achieve greenhouse gas reductions, in particular the activities listed in points 7.3 to 7.6 of
Annex I of the Annexes to the Delegated Act, as well as other economic activities listed in
the Delegated Acts adopted pursuant to Articles 10(3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) and 15(2)
of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that those measures are implemented and
operational within 18 months.
Therefore, for the calculation of the eligibility percentages corresponding to the consolidated
Iberdrola group, and included in the table above:
• The numerator includes only the CapEx aggregation of the activities of the companies/
subgroups considered eligible and,
• The denominator corresponds to the Iberdrola group's total CapEx, which includes
investments (on an accrual basis with current or future disbursement) in intangible assets,
investments in property, plant and equipment, investments in rights-of-use assets, and
investments. CapEx includes the work carried out by the company for its fixed assets and
capitalised financial expenses.
For the purpose of reporting the CapEx and OpEx ratio, purchases of assets necessary to carry out
a particular eligible aligned, eligible and non-eligible activity have been included.
Calculation of the percentage of eligible OpEx
The eligible OpEx ratio referred to in Article 8(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is calculated as the
numerator divided by the denominator; the latter including non-capitalised direct costs associated
with research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and
repairs, as well as other direct costs related to the day-to-day maintenance of tangible fixed assets,
by the company or a third party to whom activities are outsourced, and which are necessary to
ensure the continuous and efficient operation of those assets.
In addition, non-financial companies that apply national GAAP and do not capitalise right-of-use
assets are required to include leasing costs in OpEx.
The numerator, on the other hand, includes the part of the operating expenses included in the
denominator that:
a. Relates to assets or processes associated with eligible economic activities including
training and other human resource adaptation needs, and non-capitalised direct costs
representing research and development;
b. Forms part of the CapEx plan to expand the economic activities that are eligible in
accordance with the taxonomy or to enable economic activities eligible under the taxonomy
to be aligned with the taxonomy within a pre-defined timeframe, as set out in the second
paragraph of this point 1.1.3.2 (relating to the “CapEx plan”);
c. Relates to the purchase of production from economic activities aligned with the taxonomy
and individual measures that enable the targeted activities to become low-carbon or
achieve greenhouse gas reductions, as well as individual building renovations, as identified
in the Delegated Acts adopted pursuant to Articles 10(3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2)
of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that those measures are implemented and
operational within 18 months.
Therefore, for the calculation of the eligibility percentages corresponding to the consolidated
Iberdrola group, and included in the table above, for the OpEx indicator the denominator includes
the OpEx accounts that meet the criteria specified by the regulations.
• The numerator includes only the CapEx aggregation of the activities of the companies/
subgroups considered eligible and,
• The denominator corresponds to the Iberdrola group's total CapEx, which includes
investments (on an accrual basis with current or future disbursement) in intangible assets,
investments in property, plant and equipment, investments in rights-of-use assets, and
investments. CapEx includes the work carried out by the company for its fixed assets and
capitalised financial expenses.
For the purpose of reporting the CapEx and OpEx ratio, purchases of assets necessary to carry out
a particular eligible aligned, eligible and non-eligible activity have been included.
Finally, the controls that ensure the homogeneity of currencies, accounting criteria and the
avoidance of duplicate amounts or intercompany balances are the controls carried out during the
process of preparing the audited consolidated financial statements of the Iberdrola group. In
addition, Registration and Presentation controls have been included in the files prepared to obtain
the data referring to the Taxonomy.

VI.1. Scope of information
Introduction on the scope of information
Iberdrola has followed the GRI recommendations for defining the boundary of this report, taking into
account the entities over which it has control, those over which it has significant influence, and those
activities that are significant for the group from the economic, environmental and social standpoint.
For purposes of this report, the following terms have the meanings set forth below:
• “Iberdrola” or the “company”: the Spanish company Iberdrola, S.A., parent company of the
Iberdrola group.
• “Iberdrola Group” or the “group”: Iberdrola (as parent company) and the group of subsidiaries
over which Iberdrola has the power of control or joint control.
• “Minority-owned companies” (or “investees”): the group of companies in which Iberdrola has
a percentage interest but not the power to exercise control. At these minority-owned
companies Iberdrola promotes the policies approved within the group through the
governance bodies of such companies and includes information on those considered
significant in terms of sustainability.
The document Consolidated Financial Statements, Consolidated Management Report, and
Audit Report for financial year 2022 lists all of the companies in which Iberdrola has direct or
indirect ownership interests.
Information boundaries of this report
Time scope
■ GRI 2-3
2022. The report is published on an annual basis and covers a 12-month calendar year for the
financial year from 1/01/2022 to 31/12/2022. This document is published on 24/02/2023 following the
preparation hereof by the Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A. on 21/02/2023.
Organisational scope
■ GRI 2-2 2-6
The preparation of this report considers the following frames of reference, which determine its
structure, scope and contents:
• The financial information published in this report must be consistent with the financial
statements and, therefore, comply with the relevant Spanish and European legal provisions.
• Sustainability, or ESG, information is prepared by applying a reporting standard or framework
pursuant to Spanish legislation. Iberdrola has opted to use the GRI Standards, in its “in
accordance GRI” option, taking into account the scope of this standard, its recognition and
universality, and over a decade of experience in its application.
To reconcile these frames of reference, Iberdrola has established two quantitative reporting
boundaries for the report: global boundary and report boundary:
Global boundary (Iberdrola consolidated total)
Relates to all group companies, their subsidiaries and investees.
The financial information included in this Statement of Non-Financial Information. Sustainability
Report 2022 is based on the Annual Financial Report for financial year 2022. It therefore
corresponds to the global boundary defined above.
Report boundary (Iberdrola total)
Comprising Iberdrola, S.A. and the consolidated subsidiaries under its control96, which operate in the

consolidate environmental performance data: Vandellós (28%); Almaraz (52.69%); Trillo (49%) and
Ascó (15%). For social information, on the other hand, because of the structure of the available
information systems, nuclear plants are consolidated according to the percentage interest held by
Iberdrola in the economic interest grouping created for that purpose; such interest is 51.44% in the
case of Trillo-Almaraz and 14.59% in the case of Ascó-Vandellós. A 50% share of the environmental
and social data corresponding to the activities of Nuclenor, S.A. is applied according to the
participation method.

of this report.
Limitations on the scope of information
Iberdrola believes that this report reflects the economic, environmental and social performance of
the company in a reasonable and balanced manner, on the understanding that the exceptions to the
scope of the report described in the table "“Significant countries and activities for the Iberdrola
group in terms of sustainability and included in the 2022 reporting boundary” do not
significantly alter the consolidated indicators and therefore do not affect the reader's assessment of
the company's performance.
Explanatory footnotes are added in case a particular indicator could not be compiled in accordance
with the reporting boundary.
Significant changes to the organisation and its supply chain
■ GRI 2-3 2-6
Changes in activities and/or in operations
In the course of their business, the various subsidiaries and affiliates of Iberdrola have engaged in
transactions that change the composition of their assets in 2022, including the following:
• In the Retail Business, the largest complex in Europe for green hydrogen for industrial use
has been built. The plant has a capacity of 20 MW of electrolysers and is fed from a 100 MW
photovoltaic solar plant with 20 MWh of battery storage capacity. The complex will supply
green hydrogen to produce green fertilisers at the Fertiberia plant.
• In the Renewables Business, the following notable corporate transactions were carried out
during the year.
• In the United States, AVANGRID Renewables restructured Vineyard Wind, LLC in a
joint venture with Copenhagen Infrastructure (CIP). After the operation, AVANGRID
Renewables owns 100% of lease area 534, housing the Park City Wind (804 MW)
and Commonwealth Wind (1,200 MW) projects, and CIP owns 100% of lease area
522.
• In Australia, Iberdrola Renovables Australia acquired the rights to the Mount James
wind farm (1,000 MW) in Queensland, a region which the company believes will play
a significant role in achieving the objective of decarbonising the country’s economy.
• In the United Kingdom, an agreement has been reached for the purchase of
seventeen photovoltaic solar energy projects, with an aggregate capacity of more
than 800 MW. Contracts have been concluded, separately, with the companies Elgin
Energy, the owner of 12 projects, and Lightsource BP, which controlled the rest.
• In Poland, Iberdrola has concluded a preliminary agreement for the acquisition of two
wind farms and six photovoltaic plants, a total of 98 MW, with the company Augusta
Energy sp. z o.o., a joint venture of Greenvolt’s subsidiary V-ridium Power Group and
the asset manager KGAL.
• In Brazil, Neoenergia has reached an agreement for the exchange of assets with
Eletrobras. In the exchange, the company will receive 49% of the Dardanelos
hydroelectric plant, and will come to hold 100% of the share capital, consolidating the
plant as a major asset. It will also include 0.04% of Coelba, Cosern, and Afluente
distributors. Eletrobras will receive 51% of the shares in the Teles Pires hydroelectric
plant and 51% of the shares in Baguari. The exchange will occur in 2023.
• In Germany, Iberdrola has signed an agreement with Energy Infrastructure Partners
(EIP) for the sale of 49% of the Wikinger offshore wind farm, in which Iberdrola will
retain a 51% majority share.
In addition, in January 2023 Iberdrola Renovables Energía, S.A. and its subsidiary Iberenova
Promociones, S.A. have signed a framework agreement to co-invest in renewable assets in Spain,
contributing to accelerating the country’s decarbonisation. The agreement includes the acquisition
by NBIM Iberian Reinfra AS (NBIM Iberian), a member of the group headed by Norges Bank, of a
49% share in the capital of several Iberdrola Group companies that own onshore wind and
photovoltaic solar projects in Spain. The total project portfolio of these companies totals 1,265 MW
(137 MW of which are already operating and 1,128 MW of which are under development). Once
NBIM Iberian acquires these shares, Iberenova Promociones and NBIM Iberian will contribute their
respective shares in the project owners to a holding in which each company will also hold
respectively a 51% and 49% capital share.
Iberdrola Renovables Energía will continue to retain indirect control over the project owners and
manage the development of non-operational projects until they commence commercial operation
and, and the Iberdrola Group will continue to provide the operation and maintenance services
required for the operation thereof. The agreement provides that the parties can expand it to other
renewable assets in addition to those making up its initial boundary perimeter in Spain or in other
countries.
Changes in capital structure
The shareholders acting at the General Shareholders’ Meeting of Iberdrola held on 17 June 2022
approved two increases in capital by means of a scrip issue in order to once again implement the
Iberdrola Retribución Flexible, optional dividend system, implementing the first increase in capital
in July 2022 and the second in February 2023. To offset the dilutive effect of the capital increases
and to maintain earnings per share, a capital reduction was implemented in July 2022 under the
terms approved at the aforementioned Shareholders' Meeting.
Changes in supply chain
New market conditions, mainly affected by the war in Ukraine, have driven the raw materials market
upwards. This has particular impact on the gas chain due to the high prices of this raw material in
Europe, as well as the increase in the purchase prices of new equipment, materials and works.
VI.2. Defining report content.
Materiality Analysis
■ GRI 3-1
Iberdrola directly identifies material aspects for its Stakeholders and for the company itself, by
preparing its own materiality study, with the advice of an independent outside firm, based on in-
house and outside sources.
Iberdrola has evolved in the methodology of this study this year, taking into account the
recommendations of the GRI standards and considering the contents of the latest draft standards
published by EFRAG. This methodological evolution maintains the dual materiality approach applied
in the past, and thus considers both the impacts that the company might have on the economy, the
environment and people, including human rights, and the (positive and negative) impacts that a
material issue might have on Iberdrola.
The methodology applied, which is described below, considers the nature of the industry in which
the company operates, the activities it performs, the policies that it applies in the field of sustainable
development, long-term objectives, particularly ESG objectives, and its engagement with its
Stakeholders. It is described in three phases: identification of material issues, evaluation of external
impacts, and evaluation of internal impacts.
1. Identification of material issues
During this phase, different sources of information were analysed to obtain a list of potential issues,
e.g. issues that might pose a risk to the company (negative impact) or constitute an opportunity
(positive impact), both for stakeholders (external impact) and for the Company (internal impact) over
a time period of one to three years. The sources of information used included:
i. Internal sources of information including documents like the Statement of Non-Financial
Information - Sustainability Report 2021, the Integrated Report, the Iberdrola’s
Corporate Policies, the corporate website...
ii. External sources of information included the latest public reports from major influencers,
including the European Commission, the World Economic Forum, and the International
Energy Agency.
The issues identified as significant in the Iberdrola global stakeholder engagement model were later
analysed, cross-comparing these issues with the sustainability aspects already identified.
These sources have led to a list that brings together the results of the sources of information used
(internal, external, and Global Stakeholder Engagement Model).
2. Evaluation of external potential impacts (non-financial materiality)
To evaluate external potential impact, external and internal sources were used, as in the
identification phase, and the following steps were taken:
i. The potential impacts and opportunities for each of the previously identified material issues
were identified, considering at this point the main Stakeholders affected.
ii. An impact assessment scale was defined, based on EFRAG recommendations as well as on
the GRI standards, considering the potential severity and associated likelihood.
iii. To calculate severity and likelihood, preferentially qualitative judgments based on the
sources used were applied.
3. Evaluation of internal potential impacts (financial materiality)
To evaluate internal potential impact, preferential internal sources were used, and the following
steps were taken:
i. The potential impacts (risks and opportunities) for each of the previously identified material
issues were identified.
ii. An impact assessment scale was defined, based on EFRAG recommendations as well as on
the GRI standards. The same negative impact and opportunities scale was used as in the
analysis of external impact.
iii. The organisations in charge of managing the risks and opportunities identified analysed
them, documenting their conclusions by means of structured surveys.
iv. Finally, the results of all the above were consolidated and standardised. This consolidation
included, as additional information, the evaluation in the Global Stakeholder Engagement
Model, which is widely deployed in the group and is informed by areas and businesses.
As a result of all the above, it is concluded that the material issues continue to be those identified in
previous years, namely the following 18 issues:
■ GRI 3-2
All material issues identified are listed in the "GRI Content Index " section of this chapter, and the
information presented on each material issue can be found in the corresponding chapter of this
report.
■ GRI 2-12
The Board’s Sustainable Development Committee oversees the process and results of the
materiality study of which this report is part, and informs the Board of Directors, which prepares this
Statement of Non-Financial Information, containing the list of material issues shown in the figure
above, on 22 December 2022.
More detailed information on the most relevant issues for the company's stakeholders can be found
in the "Stakeholder Engagement" section.
