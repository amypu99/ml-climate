This roadmap is certified by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and includes specific targets for reducing GHG emissions from various segments of the company's operations.\n\nHowever, the report does not explicitly mention how future capital expenditures are aligned with the long-term decarbonization goals. The report provides information on the company's decarbonization roadmap and the targets set for reducing GHG emissions but lacks specific details on how future capital expenditures are planned and aligned with these goals.\n\nTo determine whether Enel aligns future capital expenditures with its long-term decarbonization goals, we need to look at the specific targets and initiatives mentioned in the report. For example, the report mentions the company's ambition to achieve zero emissions by 2040 and lists specific targets for reducing GHG emissions from direct and indirect sources. These targets are aligned with the SBTi criteria for a 1.", "23": "To answer the question, \"Does the company ensure consistency between its climate change policy and the positions taken by trade associations of which it is a member?\" we must evaluate the alignment between Enel's climate change policy and the positions of the trade associations it belongs to.\n\nBased on the provided report, Enel holds active memberships in several trade associations, including the United Nations Global Compact, American Clean Power Association, and others. Their involvement in these associations often includes participation in working groups, committees, and advocacy activities.
