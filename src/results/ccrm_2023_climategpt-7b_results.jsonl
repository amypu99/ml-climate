By installing solar and reducing electricity consumption, we will reduce our Scope 2 emissions. Our plan is to install 50 MW of solar by 2025, which will cover 80% of our electricity needs, and purchase the remaining electricity from renewable energy providers. Installing solar will reduce our annual Scope 2 emissions by 5,679 tCO2e. We will reduce Scope 1 and 3 emissions by transitioning to hybrid and electric vehicles, reducing air travel, encouraging use"}
