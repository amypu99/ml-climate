While the report provides detailed information about the company's sustainability practices and initiatives, it lacks sufficient evidence of concrete actions taken to address identified sustainability risks and breaches.

The reasoning for this score is as follows:\n\n- Saint-Gobain does not disclose any information about their internal carbon price, which is a critical aspect of high-quality emissions reporting. Without this information, it is difficult to assess their commitment to reducing their carbon footprint.\n- The company does not provide any details about their offsetting claims, making it unclear whether they are additional, permanent, and not misleading. This lack of information makes it impossible to determine the integrity of their offsetting claims.\n- Saint-Gobain does not have a residual-emissions plan that meets the criteria for high-quality reporting.

It does mention that 65% of Enel's electricity generation is from renewable sources, but it does not break this down into Scope 2 electricity specifically.\n\n### Analysis:\nThe report states that Enel has a commitment to reducing Scope 2 emissions and mentions that 65% of the electricity generation is from renewable sources. However, it does not provide specific data on the percentage of Scope 2 electricity that comes from renewable sources. Given the lack of specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact percentage of Scope 2 electricity from renewable sources.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe report provides information about Enel's total renewable energy generation but does not specify the percentage of Scope 2 electricity from renewable sources.
