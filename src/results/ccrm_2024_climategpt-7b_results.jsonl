Our science-based targets are based on an emissions intensity reduction of 15% by 2020 and 50% by 2030. These targets will be met by increasing the proportion of sales from low-carbon products and reducing carbon intensity across all business areas. The medium-term targets will be achieved through a combination of emission reduction actions and efficiency improvements. We will also work with our suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint. We will reduce our emissions through energy efficiency improvements, renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, and other measures.
