Our team of researchers and scientists has combined cutting-edge life cycle assessment (LCA) science and AWS technology to develop a robust software solution that processes billions of operational and financial records from Amazon's operations across the world to calculate our carbon footprint. The software estimates carbon emissions for all activities within our system boundary using a dollar-based environmental assessment model, then enhances the accuracy of carbon-intensive activities with detailed, process-based LCA models. We have a comprehensive understanding of the carbon emissions across our business and have done extensive analysis to develop science-based targets, strategies, and metrics to reduce them.\" \n assistant\nupstream_scope_3_targets: [\"<metric by year>\",...] or \"none\", reasoning: \"Amazon's carbon footprint, including Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope ", "25": "{\n  \"scope_3_emissions\": \"34.71\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Emissions from Indirect Sources (Scope 3)   | 45.75\"\n} \n assistant\nEmissions from Indirect Sources (Scope 3)   | 45.75 \n assistant\nCorporate purchases and Amazon-branded product emissions (e.g., operating expenses, business travel, and Amazon-branded product manufacturing, use phase, and end-of-life) | 16.70 \n assistant\nCapital Goods (e.g., building construction, servers and other hardware, equipment, vehicles) | 10.52 \n assistant\nOther indirect emissions (e.g., third-party transportation, packaging, upstream energy related) | 15.77 \n assistant\nLifecycle emissions from customer trips to Amazon\u2019s physical stores | 2.77 \n assistant\nAmazon\u2019s Total Footprint                    | 60.64 \n assistant\n", "26": "{\"scope_3_targets\": [\"<metric by year>\",...] or \"none\", \"reasoning\": \"<1-3 sentences citing concrete evidence (page/section refs if possible)>\"} \n assistant\nscope_3_targets: [\"<metric by year>\",...] or \"none\",\nreasoning: \"<1-3 sentences citing concrete evidence (page/section refs if possible)>\" \n assistant\nscope_3_targets: [\"<metric by year>\",...] or \"none\",\nreasoning: \"<1-3 sentences citing concrete evidence (page/section refs if possible)>\" \n assistant\nscope_3_targets: [\"<metric by year>\",...] or \"none\",\nreasoning: \"<1-3 sentences citing concrete evidence (page/section refs if possible)>\" \n assistant\nscope_3_targets: [\"<metric by year>\",...] or \"none\",\nreasoning: \"<1-3 sentences citing concrete evidence (page/section refs if possible)>\" \n assistant\nscope_3_targets: [\"<metric by year>\",...] or \"none\",\n", "27": "{\n  \"climate_contributions\": [\"$100 million to reforestation projects in 2022\",...],\n  \"reasoning\": \"Amazon uses nature-based solutions to mitigate carbon emissions outside of our value chain, supplementing the carbon-reduction efforts we are driving across our business operations.

\\\"In 2020, our post-merger network grew in size and scale\u2014and so did our total energy consumption. As a combined company, we got to work finding new energy efficiencies to complement our renewable energy efforts. In total, we\u2019ve signed contracts worth 3.5 million megawatt hours (MWh), and in 2020 alone, the renewable energy supplied by our wind and solar projects increased by 95% year-over-year. We also saw three of our investments coming online: Otter Creek Wind Farm in LaSalle County, IL; Greensville Solar Farm in Greensville County, VA; and Myrtle Solar Farm in Suffolk, VA. This brings our total to nine Power Purchasing Agreements, one community choice aggregation, and several retail renewable agreements across the country, with commitments spanning from 12 to 20 years.

In addition, our TCFD reporting is supported by additional", "31": "reduction_measures: [\"install solar: 50 MW by 2025\", \"install wind: 150 MW by 2025\", \"install hydrogen: 10 MW by 2025\", \"install energy storage: 50 MW by 2025\", \"install heat pump: 50,000 by 2025\", \"install electric vehicle charging: 30,000 by 2025\", \"install natural refrigerants: 100% by 2025\", \"install energy management system: 100% by 2025\", \"install LED lighting: 100% by 2025\", \"install heat recovery: 100% by 2025\", \"install smart metering: 100% by 2025\", \"install electric vehicle: 100% by 2025\", \"install hydrogen: 10 MW by 2025\", \"install energy storage: 50 MW by 2025\","}

Walmart leads special initiatives with NGO expert support to scale improvements across our supplier base. For example, through Project Gigaton, more than 2,300 suppliers have formally signed on, and of those, more than 1,000 reported avoiding more than 136 MMT of CO2e in 2019, bringing the cumulative total to more than 230 MMT since we began measuring progress in 2017. This past year, we released the Sustainable Packaging", "28": "            \u00a0\u00a0    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 nobody    \t    \t    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \t    \t    \t    \t                                                                                                                                                                                            \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                \t            \t    \t    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \t    \t    \t    \t    \t    \t    \t    \t    \t   \t   \t   \t   \t        \t                                                                                                                        \u00a0    \u00a0    \u00a0    \u00a0    \u00a0   \u00a0   \t   \t   \t    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "29": "{\n  \"targets_info\": [\n    {\n      \"detail_bullet\": \"Our emissions-reduction strategy is built around three pillars: science-based targets, renewable energy and energy efficiency.
