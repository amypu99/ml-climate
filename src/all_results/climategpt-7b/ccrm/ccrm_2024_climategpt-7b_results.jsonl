It has not made any credible investments in BVCM, and its \"climate contributions\" seem to consist entirely of purchasing carbon offsets without any regard for additionality or permanence standards. The offsets it has purchased do not even cover all of its scope 1 and 2 emissions, and the ones that do are of such low quality that they are unlikely to have any real-world impact on carbon levels. Furthermore, Vodafone's residual-emissions plan is nonexistent; it makes no attempt to offset any of its residual emissions. Vodafone also makes deceptive claims about its carbon-neutral status and offsets. Overall, Vodafone gets a very poor score for its climate initiatives. \n assistant\n\u2014\u2014 END OF ANSWER \u2014\u2014", "10": "total revenue for the fiscal year was 'USD 12.3 billion' \n assistant\n{\n  \"revenue\": \"USD 12.3 billion\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The information is found on page 18.
