This roadmap is certified by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and includes specific targets for reducing GHG emissions from various segments of the company's operations.\n\nHowever, the report does not explicitly mention how future capital expenditures are aligned with the long-term decarbonization goals. The report provides information on the company's decarbonization roadmap and the targets set for reducing GHG emissions but lacks specific details on how future capital expenditures are planned and aligned with these goals.\n\nTo determine whether Enel aligns future capital expenditures with its long-term decarbonization goals, we need to look at the specific targets and initiatives mentioned in the report. For example, the report mentions the company's ambition to achieve zero emissions by 2040 and lists specific targets for reducing GHG emissions from direct and indirect sources.
