The company's commitment to aligning with the 1.5\u00b0C pathways and the SBTi targets further demonstrates its dedication to a sustainable future.\n\n### Concrete Evidence\n1. **Implementation of Energy-Saving Technologies:** The company has implemented various energy-saving projects and technologies, resulting in significant carbon reductions and energy savings. For example, the company has achieved an energy-saving rate of 5.56% in 2021, surpassing its target of 5%.\n2. **Renewable Energy Procurement:** The company has actively invested in renewable energy procurement, including the installation of solar power stations and the purchase of renewable energy certificates.

This includes installing over 1,587 energy-saving projects with total carbon reductions of 320,925 tCO2e and energy-saving benefits equivalent to 1.3 billion NTD.\n\n2. **Mainstreamed:** The measures are mainstreamed across the entire company, with over 90% of their energy-saving measures impacting most of the company's operations. This is evident from the 5.56% energy-saving rate achieved in 2021, which is higher than their target of 5%.\n\n3. **Depth of implementation:** The company has adopted a 3-stage energy and carbon reduction strategy, which is likely aligned with", "9": "Based on the provided sustainability report, the company's emissions tracking and reporting are assessed as follows:\n\n### 1.
