A process that has changed and is changing not only countries\u2019 economies and production structure, but also the whole society and the forms in which it expresses itself. The year 2021 witnessed the continuation of the Covid-19 pandemic, although mitigated by the progress of vaccination campaigns. The year also saw a sharp increase in raw material and energy prices. The scenario was complicated even further by the arrival of the dreadful events of the recent conflict in Ukraine, which we are monitoring carefully. The 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow succeeded in further engaging the international community in the action taken to contain global warming and its corollaries.\n\nThe world faces a major challenge that requires an immediate and concrete commitment. Electricity is the most efficient, safe and competitive form of energy, and, thanks to renewable sources and storage, is the key to totally decarbonize our planet, in line with the Paris Agreement goals. The energy system is becoming less dependent on fossil fuels and their volatility and is therefore contributing to building a more sustainable future.\n\nAt Enel, 94% of the investments planned for the three-year period 2022-2024 are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and over 85% are aligned with the European taxonomy.\n\nWe have brought forward the \u201cNet-Zero\u201d commitment both for direct and indirect emissions by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040. We will do so by gradually phasing out coal-fired generation by 2027 and stopping the generation and sales of gas by 2040. For the second year in a row, 2021 set a record in terms of energy produced from renewable sources, 51% of the total generation\\(^{(1)}\\). Specific CO\\(_2\\) emissions decreased by 45% compared to the 2017 value, confirming the journey towards the SBTi-certified target of 82 gCO\\(_2\\)eq/kWh by 2030. As part of the journey towards electrification, the grid plays a crucial role because it enables the integration into the system of distributed renewable plants. On a smaller scale, generation and flexible resources (such as photovoltaic panels on roofs and household batteries) can also be integrated. Moreover, the grid enables us to reach people who still do not have full access to energy.\n\nA commitment that leaves no one behind, that takes into account the needs of all our stakeholders, with particular reference to the most vulnerable. The aim is also to promote sustainable use of resources, to thwart loss of biodiversity.\n\nWe wish to promote a transition that is transparent and orderly, avoiding the creation of inequalities, based on active listening, openness and creative solutions: a transition that is capable of unleashing talents and passions, of leveraging uniqueness, of strengthening the bond with communities, of engaging customers and suppliers. People are the true competitive factor, and we share, in the spirit of cohesion, internally and externally, the values that guide our daily commitment: trust, responsibility, innovation, proactivity.\n\nWe have made our business model sustainable throughout the entire value chain and we have ensured that sustainability covers varying geographical, economic and social contexts. We are working tirelessly, in line with recent international developments, on new metrics and new measurement concepts to represent the creation of value and the quality of relations with different stakeholders, in a more and more complete and transparent way. We continue to integrate sustainability objectives into our financial instruments and management remuneration plan, and our leadership has once again been acknowledged on a global level in the main ratings, rankings and sustainability indices.\n\nWe continue to look ahead into the future, and we work together with our stakeholders to ensure that society makes sustainable progress.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) The figures include managed generation. Generation from the consolidated perimeter is 109 TWh produced from renewable energy and 114 TWh produced at thermoelectric plants, a total of 223 TWh.\nWe are a leading energy group with a sustainable business model that creates long-term value for all stakeholders.\n\nWe set the priorities that underpin our strategy, commitment and reporting through a single and double materiality analysis process and the continuous and direct involvement of all our stakeholders.\n\nOur strategy makes sustainability and innovation the focus, contributing to the achievement of all 17 of the UN\u2019s 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nSustainable finance plays a crucial role in supporting the growth of the Group and we are committed to reporting on the implementation of the EU taxonomy regulation.\nOur sustainable progress\n\n2021 saw a continuously evolving scenario characterized by a focus on fighting climate change and its social impacts, the continuing Covid-19 pandemic and a sharp increase in the prices of raw materials and energy. The outlook for the world economy nevertheless improved during 2021, thanks to the progress achieved in vaccinations and support measures from various countries, although the pandemic continues to weigh on the world economy and there is uncertainty about it being definitively overcome.\n\nThe world scenario was then deeply shaken in February 2022 by the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. A dramatic conflict due to the consequences on the civilian population, which redefines the world\u2019s geopolitical, economic and energy balances in a way that is as yet unpredictable, with significant repercussions in particular on the energy security of the countries of the European Union.\n\nAt Enel, we carefully monitor the international context, promptly assessing its developments and interacting openly and constructively with all our stakeholders, in order to create value together, even in a constantly changing context, questioning traditional business models to support a just transition that leaves no one behind.\nWho we are and the main results for 2021\n\nWe are a leading group in the energy sector, with a presence in over 40 countries on five continents, vertically integrated along the entire value chain. Trends, risks and opportunities are the context in which the organization operates. The purpose, mission, vision and values concern the entire organization and define the aim of the Company in clear and concise terms. The governance principles are intended to create a solid guidance and supervision structure.\n\nOur strategy combines economic, financial, environmental and social sustainability and contributes to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs), taking into consideration the needs and expectations of all our stakeholders.\n\nStakeholder involvement that leverages the Open Power approach, explained both in our Code of Ethics and in the Human Rights Policy, and which translates into the numerous concrete initiatives reported in this Sustainability Report.\n\nIn particular, every year we carry out a materiality analysis, which allows us to identify the priorities of our stakeholders and their relationship with those of the company and with the SDGs. A constant dialogue with individual stakeholders and with the organizations that represent them.\n\nWith customers: we analyse their needs to ensure reliable responses and establish lasting relationships, committing ourselves to offering sustainable solutions and services that are convenient, innovative, flexible and attentive to the most vulnerable to ensure equal access to energy (see \u201cThe decade of electrification and customer centricity\u201d chapter).\n\nWith people in the Company: we are committed to having a close relationship with them, particularly by paying greater attention to caring activities and active listening, while promoting internally a culture of inclusion, enhancement of diversity, innovation and business entrepreneurship to face the challenges posed by a constantly changing context (see the \u201cEnel people\u201d chapter).\n\nWith communities: we work together to draw up specific action plans and projects intended to promote access to energy, fighting energy poverty, supporting quality education and socio-economic development, starting from a proactive analysis of their needs through a shared value creation model (see the \u201cLocal and global communities\u201d chapter).\n\nWith suppliers: we face the challenges of transition and support their path of change and growth, sharing ideas and innovations (see the \u201cSuppliers\u201d chapter).\n\nWith the financial community: we maintain a constant and open relationship, based on principles of integrity and transparency, in compliance with the rules and best practices, in order to increase the level of understanding of the activities carried out by the Group (see the \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter).\n\nThrough openinnovability.com, a crowdsourcing platform, the different areas of the Group can interact with start-ups, industrial partners, small and medium-sized enterprises (\u201cSMEs\u201d), research centers, universities and entrepreneurs, to deal jointly with the challenges of the future and guarantee sustainable progress for all.\n\nThe growth engine is our business model, which leverages the various input resources, divided into three macro categories (people, planet and prosperity) and, through the various company activities and exploiting synergies, converts them into outputs to create value in the short, medium and long term for the various stakeholders. We operate all along the value chain through Business Lines with a specific focus (Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation, Global Infrastructure and Networks, Enel X Global Retail, Global Energy & Commodity Management and Global E-Mobility), assisted by Global Service Functions (Procurement, Digital Solutions and Global Customer Operations) and Staff Functions (Administration, Finance and Control, Innovation and Sustainability, People and Organization, Communication, Legal and Corporate Affairs, Audit) with every country combining the business models with specific local requirements.\nValue creation and the business model\n\nOur resources\n\n**Planet**\n- 55.6 million m\u00b3 Total water withdrawals\n- 27.4% Water withdrawals in water-stressed areas\n- 26.3% Total direct consumption of fuel in Mtoe\n\n**People**\n- 66,279 Enel employees\n- 22.5% Women as proportion of total employees\n- 4,163 Women in management positions\n- 170,421 Contractor personnel (FTE)\n\n**Prosperity**\n- \u20ac51,952 million Net financial debt\n- \u20ac42,342 million Equity\n- \u20ac12,997 million Capital expenditure\n- \u20ac18,070 million Intangible assets\n- \u20ac11,636 million Concessions\n- \u20ac84,572 million Property, plant and equipment\n- 87.1 GW Total net efficient installed capacity\n- 50.1 GW Net efficient installed renewables capacity\n- 2.2 mln km Electricity distribution grid\n- 45.0 mln End users with active smart meters\n- 75.2 mln End users\n- 69.3 mln Retail customers\n- 157.2 thousand Total charging points\n\n**Principles of Governance**\n- 44% Women on Board of Directors\n- 153 Reported Code of Ethics incidents (of which 41 found to be violations)\n\n---\n\n(1) The data does not include 111 million euros with reference to the scope classified as \u201cheld for sale\u201d in 2021.\nValue created for Enel and our stakeholders\n\nOutcomes\n\n**Planet**\n- 227 gCO\u2082eq/kWh Direct greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 Scope 1\n- 125 million tCO\u2082eq Scopes 1, 2, 3\n- 26.3 million m\u00b3 Total water consumption\n- 33.8% Water consumption in water-stressed areas\n- 9,092 Hectares of habitat recovered\n\n**People**\n- 44.6 hours of training (average hours per employee)\n- 8.8% Turnover\n- 1.264 i.

The financial results confirm how we carried on growing by continuing to generate value. Specifically, ordinary EBITDA in 2021 is 19.2 billion euros, with an increase of 6.7% compared to 2020. The ordinary net profit, on which the dividend is calculated, reached 5.6 billion euros, up 8% compared to the previous year. The dividend for 2021 amounts to 38 euro cents per share, up 6.1% on 2020. The net debt is 52.0 billion euros, lower than the forecasts previously issued to the market. The ratio of sustainable funding sources to the Group\u2019s total gross debt was approximately 55% at the end of 2021. 46.6% of Enel\u2019s capital was held by investors who were signatories of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI). Finally, also in 2021, Enel confirmed its position as the first European utility by market capitalization and the second in the world.\n\nWe are the largest private operator in the renewable energy sector worldwide with 53.4 GW of managed capacity. For the second year running, to confirm our constant attention to the planet, we have achieved a record in terms of energy generated from renewable sources with approximately 118 TWh, equivalent to 51% of the total generation in the perimeter we manage. With regard to the consolidated perimeter, specific CO\u2082 emissions amounted to 227 gCO\u2082eq/kWh, 45% down on the 2017 value, confirming the path towards the SBTi (Science Based Target initiative)-certified target of 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2030. By reducing our consumption of materials and energy and paying increasing attention to the circularity of resources, we are reducing our overall footprint in environmental terms. The fuel and materials consumption of our power plants over their entire life cycle fell by 62% compared to 2015 and in the last year more than 9,000 hectares of habitat were recovered.\n\nWe are the largest private electricity distribution company in the world, with more than 75 million end users connected to our networks, including 45 million with active smart meters. The SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) indicator is constantly improving, and in 2021 we connected approximately 390,000 beneficiaries in rural areas. We also manage the largest customer base of any private company, with more than 69 million customers. In order to increasingly promote usage electrification, the spread of new services and products continued, including recharging points for electric mobility, of which there are now over 300,000, including more than 52,000 for public and private charging installed in 2021.\n\nThe fundamental lever for achieving these important results is of course the 66,279 people who work at the Company, who benefit from many development and training programs focused on upskilling and reskilling, in order to better manage and support the transition to a decarbonized economy (further information regarding Enel for the Just Transition is available in \u201cThe path to Net-Zero\u201d chapter). Women in the company represent 22.5% of the total, a considerable increase on the 21.5% recorded in the previous year. Thanks to the specific attention paid to the issue of diversity, which aims to enhance resources even before they enter the Company and throughout all people management processes, the percentage of women managers rose to 23.6% in 2021 (vs 21.6% in 2020). As a confirmation of Enel\u2019s constant commitment to safety, in 2021, the combined Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate for Enel and contractor companies fell by 11.7% compared to 2020. 99% of our suppliers have been assessed based on their commitment to health and safety, environment and human rights, and 59% of contracts are covered by Carbon Footprint certification. In the last year, a training course has also been launched in Italy to support suppliers in managing the energy transition. As regards projects with local communities, the activity focused on providing access to energy (SDG 7.1), quality education (SDG 4) and socio-economic development (SDG 8) has continued, reaching approximately 20 million beneficiaries since 2015. To accelerate sustainable progress, we work on innovation and promote open collaboration with start-ups, SMEs, large companies, academia, internal and external experts, and investors. In 2021, 10 innovation hubs were in place; since 2015 we have activated 465 collaborations with start-ups, and since 2017 we have launched over 170 challenges on the openinnovability.com website.\n\nOur leadership in sustainability is therefore recognized worldwide, partly thanks to our presence in various prestigious ratings, indices, and sustainability rankings.\n\n---\n\n(1) Data as at December 31, 2021. Source: Bloomberg.\n(2) 50.1 GW of consolidated capacity.\n(3) In the consolidated perimeter: 109 TWh produced from renewable energy and 114 TWh produced at thermoelectric and nuclear plants, a total of 223 TWh.\n(4) Specific emissions taking into account the managed perimeter are equal to 237 gCO\u2082eq/kWh.\n(5) Public and private. Includes interoperability points. There are 157 thousand charging points installed.\nOur governance of sustainability\n\nOur governance structure is inspired by international best practices and permeates the various business, decision-making and operational processes along the entire value chain, in order to create long-term sustainable value for the Company and for all our stakeholders.\n\nIntegrating ESG factors in the Company\u2019s operation\n\nThe integration of environmental, social and governance factors is guaranteed by structured processes throughout the Group which include: analysis of the sustainability context, identification of priorities for the Company and stakeholders, sustainability planning, implementation of specific actions in support of sustainability objectives, reporting and management of ESG ratings and sustainability indices. Every stage of the process relies on respect for human rights as a fundamental element for pursuing sustainable success.\nA key element of the approach described is the adoption of the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) indicators throughout the entire value chain, not only to report the results achieved, but above all to anticipate decisions and guide our actions. We are constantly committed to managing and measuring our performance on all relevant aspects, considering economic, business and ESG issues in reporting on activities and defining the objectives underlying the strategy. This model is fully in line with the requirements of the United Nations\u2019 Global Compact, of which Enel has been an active member since 2004, which stress the importance of ever-increasing integration of sustainability throughout all corporate strategies. Since 2020, Enel has been part of the Global Sustainability Standards Board, the independent body that has the exclusive responsibility for developing and issuing the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. Furthermore, Enel has been a member of several European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) task forces on sustainability issues, and in 2021 it participated in the \u201cProject Task Force on European Sustainability Reporting Standards\u201d. The task force responds to an official request for technical advice from the European Commission for the development of future reporting standards for sustainability reporting, as part of the review of the European directive on sustainability reporting (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive \u2013 CSRD).\n\nThe Enel organizational and corporate governance model for sustainability\n\nThe organizational and corporate governance model ensures that sustainability issues are appropriately taken into consideration in all relevant corporate decision-making processes, by defining specific tasks and responsibilities for the main corporate governance bodies. The Board of Directors plays a central role in corporate governance as the body vested with powers related to the strategic, organizational and control policies of the Company and Group. In this context, the Board of Directors takes into account the need to pursue sustainable success particularly when: (i) establishing the strategies of the Company and the Group; (ii) determining the remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and Key Management Personnel; as well as (iii) the Company\u2019s Internal Control and Risk Management System (SCIGR). The Board of Directors has also established internal board committees with the power to investigate, propose and advise, in order to ensure an adequate internal division of its functions, as well as a related parties committee. The following committees have been established in particular:\n\n- Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, which among other things assists the Board of Directors on sustainability issues, including issues relating to climate change and the dynamics of the Company\u2019s inter-\naction with all stakeholders;\n\n- **Control and Risks Committee**, which is tasked, among other things, with supporting the assessments and decisions of the Board of Directors relating to the SCIGR and to the approval of periodic financial and non-financial reports;\n\n- **Nomination and Compensation Committee**, which is tasked, among other things, with supporting the Board of Directors in its assessments and decisions relating to the size and optimal composition of the Board itself and its Committees, as well as the remuneration of Directors and Key management personnel;\n\n- **Related Parties Committee**, which performs the tasks required by the relevant Consob regulations and by the specific Enel procedure governing transactions with related parties.\n\nFurthermore, in line with the power structure currently in force within the Company:\n\n- the **Chairman** of the Board of Directors acts as a link between the executive and non-executive directors and is responsible for ensuring the effective operation of the board;\n\n- the **Chief Executive Officer** is the main person responsible for the management of the Company and is the director in charge of establishing and maintaining the SCIGR;\n\n- the **Innovability\u00ae Function** (Innovation and Sustainability), which reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, manages all activities relating to sustainability and innovation. The Holding units responsible for Enel SpA\u2019s operations, particularly the sustainability, circular economy, and community relations processes, play a guidance and coordination role for the Sustainability and Innovation units located in the various countries and Business Lines. In particular, the Holding\u2019s Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights unit, responsible for the management of sustainability planning, monitoring and reporting processes, including compliance with the European taxonomy, as well as the management of ESG ratings, sustainability indices and the Human Rights Policy, also reports to the Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO), in order to ensure the ever-greater integration of these issues into corporate strategies and corporate reporting;\n\n- the **Global Business Lines, Countries, Global Service Functions and Holding Functions** integrate ESG factors into their decision-making and operating processes, to create long-term sustainable value, thanks to the presence of dedicated Sustainability structures in all countries, Business Lines and Global Service Functions. At the local level, the expectations of the various stakeholders are identified, and specific sustainability plans defined, in line with the Group strategy.\n\nWith specific reference to **governance for the management of climate change**, please refer to the \u201cNet-Zero ambition\u201d chapter of this document.\n\nFurthermore, the Group CEO chairs the **Cyber Security Committee**, which consists of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), the Cyber Security Risk Managers and the Group\u2019s front line and which aims to approve the IT security strategy and periodically check the progress of its implementation.\n\nFurther information on the activities carried out by the corporate bodies and the related information and training activities can be found in the corporate governance report available on the www.enel.com website.\nEnel\u2019s presence in the main energy and sustainability associations\n\nUnited Nations Global Compact (UN Global Compact)\nEnel has been a \u201cParticipant\u201d member of the UN Global Compact since 2004 and, in 2021, it was reconfirmed as a LEAD company, thanks to its commitment to organization and adherence to its ten founding principles relating to human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. In 2021, in the context of Sustainable Finance, Enel was involved in the \u201cCFO Taskforce for the SDGs\u201d, which it co-chairs, and the \u201cClimate Ambition\u201d and \u201cPeace, Justice & Strong Institution\u201d platforms, also confirming its advanced level in the annual Communication on Progress (CoP) reporting. The Group is also a member of the Expert Network, while Enel\u2019s CEO completed his second term as member of the organization\u2019s Board in May 2021.\n\nSustainable Energy for All (SEforALL)\nSince 2011, Enel has been a partner of Sustainable Energy for All, an international organization that collaborates with the United Nations and global leaders in the public and private sector for the advancement of SDG 7. Since 2020, the Group CEO has been Chairman of the Administrative Board of the organization, a position he will hold until 2023. During 2021, Enel was involved in preparations for the High-Level Dialogue on Energy (HLDE), the first global energy summit, held on the occasion of the 76th General Assembly of the United Nations, which was co-chaired by SEforALL. During the HLDE, the Company presented the Enel Energy Compact, with renewed commitments to speed up actions to achieve SDG 7 and reduce emissions to zero, and the Multistakeholder Energy Compact on electrification for Sardinia, developed in collaboration with Roma Tre University. On that occasion, the CEO of Enel was among the speakers at the opening session of the Summit with the UN Secretary General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Also in 2021, Enel supported the BeBold Campaign created with the aim of strengthening the global movement for SDG 7, and participated in the SEforALL Youth Summit.\n\nCSR Europe\nSince 2005 Enel has been a member of CSR Europe and from 2016 to 2020 it held the vice-chairmanship of the Board, of which it is currently a member. In 2021, Enel promoted the \u201cInclusion Think Tank\u201d project, a multi-stakeholder group that involved companies, NGOs and institutions, and which led to the launch of the \u201cCompanies and the Inclusive Society\u201d Blueprint on the main challenges for the future of work. The Group also participated in the \u201cUp-skill4Future\u201d initiative, focused on upskilling and reskilling workers in Italy and Spain, and joined the Biodiversity & Industry platform. Enel was also among the protagonists of the European SDG Summit, during which the CEO and the Chairman of Enel spoke and were involved in organizing four roundtables on: Taxonomy, Sustainable Tax, Decarbonization of the supply chain and Biodiversity.\n\nWorld Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)\nSince 2016, Enel has been a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and is represented both on the Board, of which the CEO is a member, and at Liaison Delegate level. In 2021, the Group maintained its commitment to numerous programs and projects, including SOS 1.5 and Energy Solutions, in which it is also a member of the Steering Committee, and in the context of these two programs, it contributed to developing the \u201cSDG Roadmap for Electric Utilities\u201d report, a guide to maximizing the electricity sector\u2019s contribution to the SDGs. Enel was also actively involved in the following projects: \u201cTransforming Urban Mobility\u201d, \u201cMobility Decarbonization\u201d, \u201cCities Business Collaboration\u201d, \u201cClimate Policy\u201d e \u201cBusiness & Human Rights\u201d.\n\nSustainability Report 2021\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI)\nAs a member since 2006, since 2016 the Enel Group has been part of the Global Reporting Initiative Community. In 2021, Enel maintained its commitment to the Global Sustainability Standards Board and to the Corporate Leadership Group on Digital Reporting. Enel was also involved in the \u201cBusiness Leadership Forum on the SDGs\u201d confirming its commitment to achieving the SDGs and at the same time demonstrating commitment, responsibility and transparency through corporate reporting.\n\nValue Reporting Foundation\nSince its creation, Enel has been involved in the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and in 2021, as a member of the <IR> Business Network, it again took part in several working groups, including the Special Interest Group Integrated Thinking: A Virtuous Loop. Following the merger between the IIRC and SASB into the Value Reporting Foundation, Enel also maintained its commitment to the new organization.\n\nSustainable Business Roundtable (SBRT)\nIn 2016, Enel signed up to the Sustainable Business Roundtable and in 2021, it took part in two annual meetings focused on \u201cSustainable Finance & Investment\u201d and the \u201cJust Energy Transition\u201d.\n\nGlobal Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance\nIn 2021, Enel continued its commitment to the Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance, an integral part of the UN Strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, of which the Group CEO is a member. Enel actively contributed to the Alliance debates on mobilizing investments to support sustainable development. In particular, for the definition of specific sector metrics relating to the SDGs and their integration into existing reporting frameworks.\n\nTaskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nEnel has supported the Taskforce since the publication of the first recommendations in June 2017, promoting transparent and reliable information on the climate. In 2020, Enel was also a member of the TCFD Advisory Group which puts together recommendations on scenario analyses.\n\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum\nIn 2021, Enel became a member of the TNFD Forum, a multidisciplinary advisory group supporting the new Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD), which, by 2023, aims to provide a global framework for companies and financial institutions for the assessment and reporting of risks and opportunities related to the impact of their operations on nature and biodiversity.\n\nScience Based Target initiative (SBTi)\nEnel has certified its Scope 1 emission reduction target by 2030 through SBTi as in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C target. The Group undertakes to define its short, medium and long term targets in line with the criteria and recommendations of SBTi and related standards.\n\nScience Based Target Network (SBTN) for Nature\nSince 2021, Enel is an SBTN Corporate Engagement Program participant, pledging alignment with SBTN\u2019s goals and vision and contributing advice and end-user insights to the development of SBTN methods and tools. SBTN \u2013 a unique collaboration of leading global non profits and mission driven organizations \u2013 is equipping companies with the guidance to set science-based targets for nature including freshwater, ocean, land and biodiversity.\nWhat is material for us?\n\nSustainability context\n\nAs part of the broader materiality analysis process, we have identified and analyzed the main current and future ESG megatrends, to identify their risks, limit their impacts and take full advantage of their opportunities.\n\nThe digital revolution, definition of new governance models, climate and demographic change, resources preservation are the main megatrends that are currently influencing and will continue to influence the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.\n\nThese identified megatrends were brought to the attention of a group of national and international stakeholders that are strategic for Enel, through a specific questionnaire. The analysis confirmed that the main ESG megatrends are climate change, the digital revolution and resources preservation, and highlighted increasing inequalities as a further priority area to be taken into consideration.\n\nThese phenomena often influence each other and act in combination with each other, reinforcing their individual impact. The technological revolution and digitalization have in several cases accentuated income inequality and the consequent increase in inequalities. Climate change is contributing to displacement from rural to urban areas, and therefore to demographic changes in countries. Resources preservation entails the need to use and adopt technologies with a lower environmental impact.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has made this scenario more complex, accentuating the existing inequalities between and within Countries, with a greater impact on the most fragile social groups that are less able to protect themselves.\n\nAddressing these challenges required global coordination and joint efforts, underlining the vital importance of multilateral consensus and collaboration.\nMain types of risk\n\nDue to the nature of its business and its geographical distribution, the Enel Group is exposed to various types of ESG risk, identified within the reference framework relating to the risk categories adopted by Enel, which provides for six categories: strategic, financial, operational, governance & culture, digital technology, and compliance. The main ESG risks identified are listed below:\n\nThe identified risks are in line with the context described by the ESG megatrends analysis and consistent with what is reported by the World Economic Forum (Global Risks Report 2022), according to which the risk of climate and extreme events and the loss of biodiversity are considered as the 3 most significant risks for the next decade, followed by the social risks associated with the loss of social cohesion, the depletion of livelihoods and the risk of infectious diseases.\n\nFor further details and a description of the actions intended to mitigate their effects and ensure their correct management, please refer to \u201cThe path to Net-zero\u201d chapter of this document, and for the risks associated with climate change to the \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter of this document. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the additional strategic and financial risks is contained in the Annual Report for 2021, which is available to the public at the registered office and on the Company\u2019s website (www.enel.com).\nThe materiality analysis process and the results for 2021\n\nThe materiality analysis identifies aspects of the sustainable business model that are most relevant to the Company and its stakeholders, highlighting the interconnections with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda.\n\nContinuous monitoring of stakeholder expectations (\u201cdynamic materiality\u201d) allows the evolution of material issues to be tracked over time, identifying ESG objectives aimed at creating long-term sustainable value and defining the contents to be included in Corporate Reporting documents.\n\nWithin this dynamic framework, the materiality process is conducted according to:\n\n- a \u201csingle materiality\u201d view, which allows you to identify and evaluate the priority issues for the Company (Y axis) and its main stakeholders (X axis), leading to the representation of the Group\u2019s materiality matrix (see the \u201cPriorities\u2019 Matrix (single materiality)\u201d paragraph in this chapter);\n- a \u201cdouble materiality\u201d view, i.e. the union of two perspectives of equal importance:\n  - potential and actual impacts suffered by the Company (financial materiality). The material issues are those that generate risks or opportunities for the Company, influencing its future cash flows and therefore the enterprise value in the short, medium or long term;\n  - potential and actual impacts generated by the Company (impact materiality). The material issues are those for which the Company generates significant actual or potential impacts on society and the surrounding environment in the short, medium or long term (see the \u201cAssessment of impacts generated and suffered\u201d paragraph in this chapter).\n\nThe Holding\u2019s Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights unit, as part of the Innovability\u00ae Function, is responsible for analyzing materiality at Group level and plays a guidance and coordination role, providing guidelines and methodological support for the country, company and site level analysis conducted by local managers, with the involvement of stakeholders and the main key figures at company level.\n\nThe materiality analysis is subject to specific examination by the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, set up within the Board of Directors, when examining the guidelines of the Sustainability Plan. Furthermore, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Control and Risks Committee issue prior opinions on the Sustainability Report, which includes the materiality analysis, and submit them to the Board of Directors\u2019 meeting called to approve the Report.\n\nThe materiality analysis has been developed in accordance with the guidelines of the most recent publications issued by international standards, including the GRI, EFRAG, and the AccountAbility AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard (AA1000SES), regarding the principles of inclusiveness, materiality, responsiveness and impact. The Value Reporting Foundation \u2013 SASB and Compass SDG, which supports companies in adapting their strategies to\n\n---\n\n(6) The concept of dynamic materiality, announced in 2020 by the World Economic Forum in the document entitled \u201cEmbracing the new age of materiality\u201d \u2013 represents materiality as a dynamic process according to which what may be financially immaterial today can become material tomorrow.\n\n(7) As part of the AccountAbility AA1000AP (2018) standard, according to the AA1000SES standard, the principle of:\n- inclusiveness means that people should have a say in the decisions that affect them;\n- materiality means that decision makers should identify and be clear about the main sustainability issues;\n- responsiveness means that organizations must act transparently with regard to the relevant sustainability areas and their impact;\n- impact means that organizations must monitor, measure and take responsibility for their actions that affect wider ecosystems.\nthe United Nations SDGs, were also considered as a reference for the analysis. In particular, eight main stages are envisaged, summarized in the diagram below and described in the following paragraphs of this chapter.\n\nThe collection, aggregation and processing of data and information are managed through a dedicated computer system (\u201cE-mia: Engagement \u2013 materiality & impact analysis\u201d), which also allows the best practices of engagement to be shared within the Group and stakeholders to be monitored in line with the corporate organizational model. The results, which are updated annually, are presented at both Group and individual company, Business Line/Corporate Function and site (intended as potential or actual operating site) level, as well as for the different categories of stakeholders.\n\nEvery two years, an analysis is carried out aimed at potentially reviewing the issues and categories of stakeholders, in order to take into account any significant changes in the internal and external context of the Company. In 2021, the scope of the materiality analysis included 21 countries, covering all continents where the Group is present. In particular, over the past year, 3 new countries (India, Panama and Costa Rica) were added along with sites in Iberia, India and Chile, with an ever-greater integration of the results deriving from the application of the Creating Shared Value (CSV) tools on the Group\u2019s assets.\n1. Identification of the issues\n\nThe issues subject to the 2021 analysis are classified into three categories: business and governance issues, social issues and environmental issues, divided into three levels to cover all the different cases (see the Methodological note \u201cList of 1st and 2nd Level issues\u201d in the annex). The identification of the issues took into consideration company policies and principles of conduct, stakeholder engagement initiatives, the issues of greatest interest to sustainability rating agencies, sector benchmarking studies, the strategic direction of the Company, as well as the indications of experts both internal and external to the organization.\n\nIn accordance with the methodology, in 2021 the issues were reviewed and updated to take into consideration the reference context; in particular, the reviews carried out on the first level are shown below.\n\n| 2020 Materiality analysis | 2021 Materiality analysis | Objective of the update |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n| \u201cEcosystems and platforms\u201d | \u201cProducts and services for electrification and digitalization\u201d | Emphasize the presence of new technologies within electrification services |\n| \u201cInnovation and digital transformation\u201d | \u201cInnovation, circular economy and digital transformation\u201d | Highlight the key role of the circular economy in the business model |\n| \u201cEnergy distribution\u201d | \u201cInfrastructure and Networks\u201d | Attribute appropriate visibility to the topic of network management |\n| \u201cEnvironmental management\u201d | \u201cConservation of ecosystems and environmental management\u201d | Highlight the importance of ecosystem conservation and biodiversity |\n| \u201cEngaging local communities\u201d | \u201cEngaging local and global communities\u201d | Highlight the importance of ecosystem conservation and biodiversity |\n\n2. Identification of the stakeholders\n\nThe stakeholders involved in the 2021 materiality analysis process are grouped into categories, classified on three levels, in line with the structure of the issues analyzed. The first level stakeholder categories are the following:\n\n- Businesses and trade associations\n- Customers\n- Financial community\n- Institutions\n- Civil society and local and global communities\n- Media\n- Employees\n- Suppliers and contractors\n\n(see the table in the \u201cAssessment of priorities and satisfaction assigned by the stakeholders to the issues\u201d paragraph, which shows the first level stakeholder categories with their respective degree of relevance)\n\n| 2020 Materiality analysis | 2021 Materiality analysis | Objective of the update |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Civil society and local communities | Civil society and local and global communities | Include the global view in which the communities of the local context operate |\n3. Assignment of relevance to stakeholders\n\nThe process provides for the continuous and direct involvement of the stakeholders, both external and internal to the Company, by the different company units, whose methods of involvement (interviews, questionnaires, etc.) and frequency (daily, monthly, weekly, etc.) are defined based on their individual relevance, as required by the reference standards. In 2021, activities at Group level saw the involvement of the Top Management of all the Business Lines, who assessed, through a specific questionnaire, the relevance of the categories based on the following parameters.\n\n| Dependence | Importance of the relationship for the stakeholder, indicating groups or individuals who directly or indirectly depend on the activities, products or services and associated services, or on which the organization depends in order to operate |\n| Influence | Importance of the relationship for the Company, indicating groups or individuals that may have an impact on the organization or on a stakeholder for strategic or operational decision-making |\n| Tension | Temporal dimension of the relationship, indicating groups or individuals who require the immediate attention of the organization on broader financial, economic, social or environmental issues |\n\n(see the table in the \u201cAssessment of priorities and satisfaction assigned by the stakeholders to the issues\u201d paragraph, which shows the stakeholder categories with their respective degree of significance)\n\nIn particular, the analysis carried out at Group level, shows that the relevance of the \u201cCustomers\u201d stakeholder has grown over the last year, particularly given the awareness of their key role in managing the \u201celectrification decade\u201d. However, the importance of the \u201cEmployees\u201d stakeholder remains constant, particularly given the persistence of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n4. Assessment of priorities and satisfaction assigned by the stakeholders to the issues\n\nOnce the issues and stakeholder categories have been identified, weighted according to their respective relevance, the materiality analysis process proceeds with an assessment of the priorities assigned to the issues by stakeholders, i.e. the relative relevance of each issue for the stakeholders (horizontal axis of the materiality and expectations matrix) (see the \u201c2021 Priorities\u2019 Matrix\u201d and \u201cExpectations Matrix 2021\u201d graphs).\n\nIn 2021, the priorities attributed to the issues were identified thanks to the implementation of approximately 480 engagement initiatives with stakeholders relevant to the Group. Only 2% of the assessments were carried out indirectly, through interviews with the business units responsible for the relationship with the reference stakeholder (\u201cself-assessment\u201d), demonstrating the ever-greater objectivity of the analyses carried out. The engagement initiatives are part of the various listening initiatives carried out during the year by the various units of the Group, including customer satisfaction surveys, the \u201cOpen Listening - Future Way of Working\u201d survey, intended to gather the perceptions and expectations of Enel people regarding the future post-Covid working model, questionnaires from sustainability rating agencies, customer complaints, relations with analysts and investors, representative and trade associations, institutional relations at national and local level, as well as with trade unions, media monitoring and opinion polls. In some cases, where necessary, ad hoc materiality analysis initiatives were implemented, including an online questionnaire for suppliers or focus groups aimed at specific categories of stakeholders.\nThe following table shows, for each first-level stakeholder category identified, the respective degree of relevance, the channels of involvement used, the material topics and the Company\u2019s response methods.\n\n| Channels and type of communication and engagement | Average frequency of engagement per channel/type | Main high/very high priority issues for stakeholders | Our

Enel has combined the assessment of priorities by stakeholders with an analysis of their satisfaction with the identified issues (vertical axis of the expectations matrix), in order to identify more precisely the issues on which the Company needs to focus. The 2021 results, as represented in the \u201cExpectations Matrix\u201d, show a substantial alignment between the priority assigned by the stakeholders and their level of satisfaction (\u201cMaintain\u201d quadrant). It is worth noting, however, that there has been an increase in satisfaction regarding the \u201cCustomer engagement\u201d issue compared to 2020, in line with the actions taken by the Company.\n\n### 2021 Expectations Matrix\n\nFor more details about categories and first and second level issues, please refer to the Methodological note \u201cList of 1st and 2nd Level issues\u201d\n\n#### Business and governance issues\n- A Infrastructure and Networks\n- B Decarbonization of the energy mix\n- C Customer engagement\n- D Products and services for electrification and digitalization\n- E Sound governance and fair corporate conduct\n- F Economic and financial value creation\n- G Innovation, circular economy and digital transformation\n\n#### Social issues\n- G Engaging the local and global communities\n- H Employees management, development & motivation\n- I Occupational health and safety\n- L Sustainable supply chain\n\n#### Environmental issues\n- B Decarbonization of the energy mix\n- M Ecosystems preservation and environmental management\n5. **Assessment of priorities in corporate strategies to the issues**\n\nFor the purposes of drawing up the 2021 materiality matrix, Enel evaluates the priority of the issues in its strategies (vertical axis of the Priorities\u2019 Matrix), taking into account the guidelines set by the Strategic Plan, the objectives of the Departments/Business Lines and the commitments made by the Group through its own policies and conduct criteria. This analysis involves the Company\u2019s various departments and top management (Chief Executive Officer and Chairman) through ad hoc interviews and specific questionnaires.\n\n6. **Priorities\u2019 Matrix (single materiality)**\n\nThe dimensions investigated in the previous paragraphs, i.e. the priority of issues for stakeholders and in corporate strategies, contribute to the developing the matrix of priorities (\u201csingle materiality\u201d).\n\nThe priorities\u2019 matrix, which gives a comprehensive view of all the Company\u2019s stakeholders, provides a complete sustainability disclosure, as well as an integrated representation of the Company\u2019s contribution to sustainable development. Furthermore, applying the so-called \u201cprimary user\u201d filter to the overall materiality analysis, corresponding to the \u201cfinancial community\u201d\\(^{(8)}\\), highlights the issues that have a greater direct impact on the value of the company.\n\nThe result of the analysis therefore supports the identification and definition of the objectives to be included in the Strategic Plan and the Sustainability Plan, to the achievement of which the various Departments and Business Lines of the Group contribute, and of the issues covered by the Sustainability Report and other Corporate Reporting documents.\n\nIn 2021, the analysis covered 21 countries, 67 companies and 31 sites and considered 479 engagement initiatives involving stakeholders relevant to the Group. Shown below are:\n\n- the 2021 priorities\u2019 matrix of the Enel Group, which considers the contributions of the main companies involved in the process, weighted according to their relevance in relation to the type of business in which they operate;\n- the main 2021 priorities of some of the main companies participating in the materiality analysis process.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(8)}\\) It includes: financial institutions and related governance bodies; investors and shareholders; rating agencies and analysts in the fields of finance and sustainability.\n2021 Priorities\u2019 Matrix\n\nFor more details about categories and first and second level issues, please refer to the Methodological note \u201cList of 1st and 2nd Level issues\u201d\n\nBusiness and governance issues\n- A Infrastructure and Networks\n- B Decarbonization of the energy mix\n- C Customer engagement\n- D Products and services for electrification and digitalization\n- E Sound governance and fair corporate conduct\n- F Economic and financial value creation\n- N Innovation, circular economy and digital transformation\n\nSocial issues\n- G Engaging the local and global communities\n- H Employees management, development & motivation\n- I Occupational health and safety\n- L Sustainable supply chain\n\nEnvironmental issues\n- B Decarbonization of the energy mix\n- M Ecosystems preservation and environmental management\n\n2021 Top priorities for the Countries\n\n(1) The 2021 materiality analysis covered 21 Countries. This graphic shows data for only some of the main companies that participated in the process. Regarding Enel Am\u00e9ricas, Uruguay did not participate in the materiality analysis process in 2021.\nThe material issues and the related management methods concern the following areas.\n\n- **Occupational health and safety** \u2013 Enel considers the health, safety, mental and physical integrity of people to be among the Group\u2019s main priorities. Optimal management of this issue helps to generate trust and boost the commitment of people in relation to the work they perform, also helping to improve performance and raise productivity and efficiency. As a confirmation of Enel\u2019s constant commitment to safety in 2021, the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRI FR) for Enel and contractor companies combined was down by 11.7% compared to 2020.\n\n- **Decarbonization of the energy mix** \u2013 Abating climate change is one of the main challenges for companies. In the utilities sector in particular, this has led to the development of regulations and public policies aimed at promoting a global zero emissions economy, in which electrification of the energy demand plays a key role. Institutional investors are devoting ever-greater attention to the management and results of companies in relation to climate change. In this context, Enel has set specific objectives for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, focusing on the growth of renewable capacity and the gradual closure of coal plants (see the paragraph on the \u201cSustainability Plan 2022-2024\u201d and the \u201cThe path to Net zero\u201d chapter of this document).\n\n- **Infrastructure and Networks** \u2013 Enel works constantly to develop and improve the efficiency of the distribution network, carrying out maintenance and modernization work on existing infrastructure in all countries. This network management and development activity allows it to reduce the number and duration of service interruptions, guaranteeing its customers an adequate and constantly reliable service. Considering the key role of intelligent infrastructure in the energy transition, the Group has included achieving 48.4 million end users with active smart meters by 2024 and approximately 81 million by 2030 as one of the objectives of its 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan.\n\n- **Sound governance and fair corporate conduct** \u2013 Enel has established a system of rules, models and control mechanisms inspired by the highest standards of transparency and fairness in the management of the business, both internally and externally. This model generates trust in its stakeholders, which is also reflected in the financial results achieved and in the excellent position in the main ESG ratings and sustainability indices confirmed for 2021.\n\n- **Economic and financial value creation** \u2013 Creating economic value is a fundamental objective to guarantee sustainable long-term economic growth. The Group\u2019s financial performance is among the material topics for both stakeholders and the Company. In 2021, Enel achieved an ordinary EBITDA of 19.2 billion euros and a fixed dividend per share (\u201cDPS\u201d) of 0.38 euros, up by 6.1% compared with 2020.\n\n- **Innovation, circular economy and digital transformation** \u2013 Digitalization and the dissemination of new technologies are accelerating the transformation of many sectors. This offers new opportunities based on the development of energy solutions that promote sustainability and the circular economy, and allow diversification of the range of products and services offered by the Group to its customers, both by influencing traditional business and by encouraging the creation of new models. Innovation of products, services or processes is a strategic priority that guarantees the Company\u2019s long-term success against the background of an increasingly competitive and demanding market. In this respect, the Group has included in its Sustainability Plan 2022-2024 clear and precise objectives intended to create an innovative ecosystem that can offer and develop cutting-edge technological solutions for business and all the main stakeholders. In particular, the Group is pursuing the goal of adopting 137 innovative business solutions through collaboration with start-ups, technology communities and strategic partners, in order to promote solutions that fulfil the internal and external needs of the Company.\nIn the materiality analysis process, Enel combines \u201csingle materiality\u201d with \u201cdouble materiality\u201d, where the impacts suffered (financial materiality) and the impacts generated (impact materiality) each represent a materiality perspective of equal importance.\n\nIn order to provide a holistic view of the impacts, risks and opportunities related to the company\u2019s activities and guarantee that they are all covered, the analysis was conducted taking into consideration the most recent publications by the main international standards, including GRI, EFRAG and Value Reporting Foundation \u2013 SASB, and attributing specific materiality levels to each ESG dimension and issue according to a high, medium, low scale.\n\nWith regard to financial materiality:\nEnel conducted an analysis intended to identify the impacts suffered by the Company, considering the financial relevance of ESG issues according to the SASB Standard for the Electric Utilities sector and the ESG issues included in the Group\u2019s financial reporting, evaluating the priority attributed to ESG issues by the financial community, as well as analyzing the risk suffered associated with company activities. The significant aspects giving rise to the risks and opportunities that contribute negatively or positively to the creation/maintenance of enterprise value, in the short, medium and long term, were thus analyzed.\nWith regard to impact materiality:\nIn 2021, Enel strengthened the methodology for analyzing the impacts generated by the Company to bring it into line with the main international standards (GRI, EFRAG). Following the \u201cImpact Evaluation\u201d pilot project launched in 2019 and its completion in 2020, with the involvement of all the Countries participating in the process, this year the Group conducted the analysis on impact materiality, identifying the impacts generated by the Company on the economy, on the environment and on people, considering any violations of human rights among the negative impacts, and the contribution to sustainable development among the positive impacts. The project, extended to all 21 Countries that carry out the materiality analysis, was implemented by each local Sustainability unit, which, considering the internal company context, including organizational activities, the main stakeholders, as well as the best practices dictated by the due diligence process, assessed the (current and potential) positive and negative impacts generated by the Company. The main impacts identified, both negative and positive, were considered respectively according to their degree of severity or magnitude and probability, in the case of potential impacts. Additionally, each positive impact was analyzed according to its direct and indirect contribution to the SDGs, in line with the commitment made by the Group, and with respect to the management instruments put in place to monitor the objectives set.\n\nOnce the main impacts were identified according to the financial and impact materiality criteria, the relative level of double materiality was attributed to each issue as a holistic combination of the two views. The table on pages 38\u201339 shows the results of the double relevance analysis, representing for each ESG issue:\n- the main negative and positive impacts generated directly and indirectly by the Company on the external context;\n- the relative impact materiality;\n- the reference SDGs for the impacts that create added value to the community and/or the environment;\n- the relative level of financial materiality;\n- the resulting level of double materiality;\n- the strategies and performances adopted by the Company, in line with the due diligence process aimed at mitigating and preventing negative impacts.\n\n8. Double materiality\n\nBased on the double materiality, once the significant impacts for each ESG issue were identified, Enel then ordered the material issues according to the value attributed in terms of double materiality. According to this criterion, the most material issues are therefore:\n- Decarbonization of the energy mix;\n- Products and services for electrification and digitalization;\n- Conservation of ecosystems and environmental management;\n- Occupational health and safety;\n- Sound governance and fair corporate conduct.\n\nThis result shows a substantial alignment between the priority issues defined according to the \u201csingle materiality\u201d approach and those identified as material from the point of view of double materiality.\n## Materiality analysis: Table of impacts\n\n| Material issues | Impact materiality | Financial materiality | Double materiality | Strategy and performance |\n|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|\n| **PLANET**      |                    |                       |                    |                          |\n| Decarbonization of the energy mix | Reduction of emissions through improvement of the national energy mix by increasing the installed renewable capacity | Positive | Low | THE PATH TO NET ZERO |\n| Conservation of ecosystems and environmental management | Failure to reduce emissions due to the ongoing process of shutting down thermoelectric power plants | Negative | Medium |                          |\n| Occupational health and safety | Promotion of energy efficiency to reduce energy consumption | Positive | Medium | TOWARDS A \u2018NATURE-BASED\u2019 MODEL |\n| Engaging local and global communities | Increased noise pollution which contributes to loss of biodiversity in the surrounding area | Negative | Medium | ESG BACKBONES \u2013 Occupational health and safety |\n| Sustainable supply chain | Increased attention to health and safety issues within the company thanks to preventive actions | Positive | Low | PROGRESS STARTS WITH PEOPLE \u2013 Local and global communities |\n| **PEOPLE**      |                    |                       |                    |                          |\n| People management, development and motivation | Increase in the rate of accidents due to a failure to disseminate a health and safety culture in the community in which the Company operates | Negative | Low | PROGRESS STARTS WITH PEOPLE \u2013 Enel people |\n| Engaging local and global communities | Social and economic development of the communities in which the Company operates by actively listening to them | Positive | Medium | PROGRESS STARTS WITH PEOPLE \u2013 Local and global communities |\n| Sustainable supply chain | Insufficient attention paid to preventing social conflicts within local communities | Negative | Low | PROGRESS STARTS WITH PEOPLE \u2013 Suppliers |\n| **Value chain** | Guarantee of stable and decent work for our people | Positive | Low | PROGRESS STARTS WITH PEOPLE \u2013 Local and global communities |\n| People management, development and motivation | Reduction of job opportunities offered due to inadequate institutional support | Negative | Low | PROGRESS STARTS WITH PEOPLE \u2013 Enel people |\n| Engaging local and global communities | Promotion of Circular Economy principles among small and medium-sized suppliers | Positive | Medium | PROGRESS STARTS WITH PEOPLE \u2013 Local and global communities |\n| Sustainable supply chain | Increase in environmental impacts due to a failure to adopt environmental management policies by the suppliers with whom the Company operates | Negative | Medium | PROGRESS STARTS WITH PEOPLE \u2013 Suppliers |\n\n**Type of impact:** Positive, Negative  \n**Materiality level:** Low, Medium, High\n| Material Issues | Impact materiality | Financial materiality | Double materiality | Strategy and performance |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| I Level Issues |                   |                      |                   |                          |\n| Products and services for electrification and digitalization | | | | |\n| Infrastructure and Networks | | | | |\n| Economic and financial value creation | | | | |\n| PROSPERITY | | | | |\n| Innovation, circular economy and digital transformation | | | | |\n| Customer engagement | | | | |\n| Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | | | | |\n| Main impact generated (potential/actual) | Type of impact | Impact materiality level (Severity/Magnitude) | Main reference SDG for positive impacts | Financial materiality level (impact suffered) | Double materiality level | Strategy and performance (Ref.

Proactive, able to intercept news and look beyond, but always with concrete awareness and effective action plans.\n\nOur strategy is articulated around the core concept of contributing to building a fairer and more inclusive society throughout the entire value chain, protecting the environment in which we live and creating opportunities for the future for the Company and for our stakeholders, without leaving anyone behind.\n\nA sustainable strategy and an integrated business model that enable us to contribute to achieving all 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, 4 of the 17 goals guide our creation of value: SDG 13, \u201cClimate Action\u201d; SDG 7, \u201cAffordable and Clean Energy\u201d; SDG 9, \u201cIndustry, Innovation and Infrastructure\u201d; SDG 11, \u201cSustainable Cities and Communities\u201d.\n\nTaking into account the results of the materiality analysis and in synergy with the Strategic Plan, we are therefore setting out our Sustainability Plan, divided into specific objectives in the short, medium and long term, to make our journey towards sustainable progress more transparent and verifiable. Every year, these objectives are updated and new targets are set to ensure continuous alignment with the business strategies and the results achieved, in order to increasingly integrate sustainability along the entire value chain, taking into account the potential impacts on the economy, on the environment and on people.\n\nThe 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan is divided into 6 macro-areas, closely linked to each other and representing the strategic lines of action:\n\n1. **Net-Zero Ambition:**\n   To bring forward the Net-Zero objectives to 2040\n\n2. **Electrification:**\n   To enable the electrification of customer energy demand, offering a reliable and sustainable service\n\n3. **People:**\n   To create long-term value with and for all our stakeholders, helping them to grow and meet challenges\n\n4. **Nature:**\n   To promote the protection of natural capital and biodiversity\n\n5. **Growth accelerators:**\n   To accelerate sustainable progress through innovation, digitalization and the circular economy\n\n6. **Backbones:**\n   To support sound governance, respect and promotion of human rights, continuous improvement in health and safety objectives\nSustainable development along the entire value chain\n\nSustainable Value Creation in the long term\n\nOur strategy for sustainable progress\nNet-Zero Ambition\n\nWe have made a commitment to bring forward our Net-Zero trajectory by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040, for both direct and indirect emissions. We are committed to achieving a value of zero emissions, with no use of any carbon removal technology or nature-based solutions, in relation to the generation of energy and the sales of electricity and natural gas to end customers. An ambitious goal that is based on the implementation of certain fundamental strategic stages:\n\ni) to accelerate the process of decarbonization of generation activities, gradually replacing the thermoelectric portfolio with new renewable capacity, as well as making use of the hybridization of renewables with storage solutions. The plan to 2030 provides for the development of about 100 GW of additional renewable capacity and the gradual reduction of thermal capacity to less than 20% of the total;\n\nii) to sell electricity produced 100% from renewable sources by 2040 and to exit the gas sales business by the same year.\n\nWe have confirmed our 2030 targets for an 80% reduction in Scope 1 emissions compared to 2017, in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C scenario, as certified by SBTi, and those relating to indirect emissions related to the sales of electricity and natural gas to end customers.\n\nElectrification\n\nWe have increased and extended our commitment to the electrification of uses, where people and their everyday decisions play an active role in change. Supported by a unified platform capable of managing the world\u2019s largest customer base of any private operator, our strategic actions will result in the creation of value for customers by 2030, through a reduction in energy expenditure and their carbon footprint. A commitment that translates into a significant and tangible improvement in quality of life for all.\n\nThe main lines of action will concern:\n\n\u2022 the strengthening of networks and infrastructure, due to be called on to support greater electricity flows and to offer a higher quality, more efficient and reliable service;\n\n\u2022 customer support in the process of transforming their energy habits in everyday life, based on the provision of new services and products.\n\nThe main goals in this regard include the strengthening of the commitment to reduce the average frequency and duration of interruptions of electricity supply (SAIFI and SAIDI), knowing that service reliability is one of the levers to incentivize electrification. It is also the major factor on which many aspects of our customers\u2019 quality of life depend, both in everyday life and in terms of specific issues related to health, safety and development. We are committed to further extending access to electricity in rural and suburban areas in the countries in which we operate, to communities with no electricity supply, aiming at reaching 6.9 million beneficiaries by 2030. With regard to new technologies to support more responsible and decarbonized consumption, our main goals by 2024 include reaching 476 MW of storage and 13 GW of demand response, a digital platform service open to commercial and industrial customers that increases network flexibility and stability and improves efficiency in the use of infrastructure and energy resources by optimizing their consumption. We also intend to continue supporting the dissemination of the electric vehicles, and we expect to reach a total of 1.1 million public and private charging points, as well as to serve over 12,000 electric buses.\n\nWe want to provide our customers with innovative and inclusive services, increasing the digital content available and committing to respecting confidentiality and the right to privacy through proper use of the data and information we receive. We pay particular attention to vulnerable customers, including people with disabilities, the target audience for products developed according to the \u201cdesign for all\u201d technique. This approach takes into account everybody\u2019s needs, to broaden their user base and satisfaction; it also includes specific programs and initiatives such as the promotion of \u201cslow shopping\u201d, with dedicated areas and times for those who find shopping stressful or challenging, where the staff are trained to welcome them appropriately.\nPeople\n\nThe sustainable quality of the relationships we establish with stakeholders lies at the center of our commitment, whether they are our colleagues, suppliers, members of the communities in which we operate or our customers. Meeting their needs also translates into attention to those who are most exposed to the transition towards a decarbonized economy, by supporting them on their journey, leveraging and enhancing their capabilities (further information on Enel for the Just Transition is available in \u201cThe path to Net-Zero\u201d chapter). Specifically, in the most heavily involved contexts, we promote the retraining and enhancing the professional skills of Company\u2019s people, via specific resettlement programs supported by upskilling and reskilling activities. We are committed to dedicating 40% of the total training to these programs by 2024, and to also support our suppliers on this new journey to repurpose their resources and skills. We are also promoting projects and activities at a local level with the communities involved in the transition process, for example if specific plants are closed, supporting the most vulnerable groups and the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nFor the people who work for the Company, we are also committed to building an inclusive working environment on a daily basis, one that can enhance diversity and uniqueness, and foster individual development, including by extending the training offer. Our Succession Plans state that by 2024, 45% of managers should be women, an essential target to achieve the objectives of increasing the representation of women in senior positions in the Company. Compared to the previous year, we have therefore increased the goals for the percentages of female managers and middle managers by 2024, to 26.8% and 33.4% respectively.\n\nResponsible relations with the communities in which we operate and promoting economic and social development constitute a pillar of our strategy. As such, we have confirmed our commitment for the period 2015-2030 to developing specific projects to:\n\n- ensure inclusive, equitable and quality education (SDG 4), to benefit up to 5 million people;\n- provide access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy (SDG 7), due to affect 20 million people;\n- promote sustained, lasting, inclusive and sustainable economic growth (SDG 8) with 8 million beneficiaries.\n\nWithin the supply chain, we have increased our suppliers\u2019 level of engagement in the focus on sustainability, with gradual conversion of sustainability factors in the context of tenders from reward factors to mandatory requirements, with the aim of achieving 35% coverage of the latter by 2024.\n\nNature\n\nEnvironmental sustainability translates into an everyday commitment to the conservation and preservation of nature and biodiversity, by reducing and mitigating the potential negative effects on the planet that may result from various Group activities, to protect present and future generations. In this context, we are committed to achieving No Net Loss in terms of biodiversity in the expected development of new infrastructure by 2030, by embarking on the adoption of selected projects in areas of major importance for biodiversity, beginning in 2025. We have also set specific goals related to reducing emissions and consumption.\nGrowth accelerators\n\nGrowth accelerators, innovation, circular economy and digitalization embrace and leverage all the themes in Enel\u2019s sustainability strategy, speeding up the journey towards sustainable progress. A culture of widespread Innovability\u00ae (innovation and sustainability) means that the whole Company aims to renew itself continually, thereby ensuring its survival in the long term. We are constantly committed to finding innovative solutions to safeguard the environment, that create conditions of equality and inclusion for those who otherwise would have fewer possibilities, including from a work-related perspective. We have set specific objectives related to the development of Proof of Concept and the adoption of innovative solutions within the business, evaluated in the perspective of the potential that can be generated, with the aim of continuously improving what we and others have done in the past.\n\nAdopting a fully sustainable business model requires a complete rethink, including in terms of circularity, with the aim of reducing the consumption of materials throughout the value chain and developing business models and new solutions such as sharing platforms. For example, suffice to look at the increasing attention to raw materials, the basis for the production of solar panels and batteries, a major focus for us in considering the topic of their scarcity compared to demand. At the same time, we must monitor all the issues related to the supply of these materials and to the safety that must always be guaranteed every step of the way.\n\nFinally, the energy transition cannot disregard elements such as digitalization and cyber security, for which the Group is committed to disseminating the most advanced solutions and to strengthening verification actions in order to prevent possible cyber attacks (Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Assessment and Cyber Exercise involving industrial plants and sites).\n\nBackbones\n\nAt the heart of our strategy to contribute to sustainable progress lies our commitment to respect for human rights throughout the value chain in which we operate, also guaranteed by our human rights due diligence management process(9). We measure our success by ensuring that the people who work with us do so under fair and favorable conditions, and that their health, safety and well-being are the keystone of value creation. As a framework for the entire sustainability strategy is sound governance, supporting the interests of all relevant stakeholders, who can trust us, knowing that the principles of transparency, fairness and integrity guide our actions.\n\nA summary table of the main targets is provided below, indicating the macro-areas of the Sustainability Plan, as well as whether they are included in the short- and long-term remuneration plan for Top Management and/or in sustainability-linked financial instruments.\n\n(9) More details are available in the \u201cHuman Rights\u201d section.\nIn the 2021 Sustainability Report, an overview of all the objectives in the 2022-2024 Sustainability Plan is provided at the beginning of each chapter, in the dashboards. For example, the dashboard header represents the link between the topics of materiality, the issues in the Sustainability Plan and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, to which the objectives related to the specific issue contribute directly. Each dashboard then presents the objectives in detail, with an indication of the target relating to the 2021-2023 Plan, the 2021 result, the consequent progress, and finally the targets in the new 2022-2024 Plan, which may be redefined or added to from the previous Plan.\n\n### Net-Zero Ambition\n\n| Priorities | Plan | SDG |\n|------------|------|-----|\n| Decarbonization of the energy mix | NET-ZERO AMBITION | 45 |\n| Economic and financial value creation | | |\n\n#### Activities\n\n| 2021-2023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022-2024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n\n(10) The circularity improvement index measures lower material and fuel consumption of the Group\u2019s plants throughout their life cycle compared to 2015.\n\n(11) This index is calculated by establishing the ratio between the number of injuries (all injuries, also those with 3 days of absence or less) and hours worked/1,000,000.\n\n(12) In line with GRI, the target reported here takes into account calculation methods that are slightly different from what has been included in Chief Executive Officer\u2019s short-term variable compensation, reported in the Report on Remuneration Policy.\nWe are committed to maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the services we offer, leveraging automation and data to ensure a simple and personalized experience, fueling the day-to-day relationship of trust with our customers.\n\n\u201cWe universally adopt a culture that puts customers at the center not only of the Enel Group strategy, but also of all our everyday work: only by anticipating our customers\u2019 needs and by offering sustainable solutions can we go hand in hand with them towards the opportunities of the energy transition.\u201d\n\nNicola Melchiotti\nGlobal Customer Operations\n\n\u201cDigital is one of Enel\u2019s strategic pillars, and is closely linked to sustainability.

A large number of investors already integrate ESG issues into their investment portfolios in order to minimize financial risk and ensure higher returns. At the same time, the change in Enel\u2019s business model towards sustainable practices has contributed to creating value by driving the energy transition. Since 2014, ESG investment funds (active and passive) have more than doubled their share of Enel\u2019s share capital, reaching 14.6% at the end of 2021, essentially unchanged compared to December 31, 2020. Their share of total institutional investors is increasing, reaching 24.6% at the end of 2021, compared to 23.4% last year. In absolute terms, 252 (vs 244 at the end of 2020) investors with investment funds consider not only the Group\u2019s financial performance but also the environmental, social and governance practices that Enel is integrating into its business strategy and all activities along the entire value chain. Furthermore, again at the end of 2021, 46.6% of Enel\u2019s capital was held by investors who were signatories of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI).\n\nDevelopments in ESG investors\n\n| ESG investors | no. | Floating capital | % | Share capital | % |\n|---------------|-----|------------------|---|---------------|---|\n| 2014          | 134 | 8.6              |   | 5.9           |   |\n| 2015          | 132 | 10.3             |   | 7.7           |   |\n| 2016          | 150 | 10.5             |   | 8.0           |   |\n| 2017          | 160 | 11.3             |   | 8.6           |   |\n| 2018          | 169 | 10.5             |   | 10.5          |   |\n| 2019          | 182 | 10.8             |   | 10.8          |   |\n| 2020          | 19.1| 14.6             |   | 14.6          |   |\n| 2021          | 244 | 19.1             |   | 19.1          |   |\n| 2021          | 252 | 19.1             |   | 19.1          |   |\nSustainability-linked finance according to Enel\n\nAt Enel, sustainable finance plays a crucial role in supporting the growth of the Group, accounting for more than half of the gross debt at the end of 2021 and contributing to a gradual reduction in the cost of debt, through the recognition of the value of sustainability.\n\nSustainable finance means synergy between private and public finance. Private finance conveys private capital towards sustainable investments, i.e. for the benefit of companies whose strategic action is intended to achieve certain sustainability objectives, reflecting the economic and financial value of sustainability in a lower cost of debt. Public finance, on the other hand, stimulates the creation of sustainable investments, through grants and loans at subsidized interest rates.\n\nIn 2021, Enel was the first company in the world to set up a \u201cSustainability-Linked Financing Framework\u201d, an all-encompassing document that extends the sustainability-linked approach to all financial debt instruments. Indicators, targets and principles have been defined that govern the development of sustainable finance throughout the Group with ambition and transparency, linking the financial strategy to the sustainability objectives. The \u201cSustainability-Linked Financing Framework\u201d was updated in January 2022, following the presentation of the new Strategic Plan and includes, in particular, the ambitious goal of eliminating direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1), brought forward from 2050 to 2040.\n\nThe Group\u2019s financial instruments and financial transactions may therefore have an interest rate or other financial or structural terms linked to the achievement of objectives regarding the reduction of direct greenhouse gas emissions (SDG 13 \u201cClimate action\u201d) and in terms of growth in installed capacity powered from renewable sources (SDG 7 \u201cAffordable and clean energy\u201d). Below are the targets of the financial instruments issued by the Group.\n\n| Actual values | Target |\n|---------------|--------|\n|               | 2021   | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2030 | 2040 |\n| Amount of direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1) gCO\u2082eq/kWh | 227 | 148 | 140 | 82 | 0 |\n| Percentage of installed renewable capacity(1) | 57.5% | 55% | 60% | 65% | 66% | 80% | 100% |\n\n(1) The KPI calculation excludes 3.9 MW of purchased capacity, deriving from power plants acquired by the Group, according to the terms of the contractual documentation for the individual instruments.\n\nHaving achieved 57.5% of renewable installed capacity as of 2021, Enel has reached the target set in all those financial instruments in which the interest rate, or other financial or structural terms of the transaction, are linked to the achievement of a renewable installed capacity of 55% or more. Particularly noteworthy is the achievement of the targets set by the first sustainability-linked bonds issued by Enel Finance International NV (EFI) in 2019 on the US and European market.\n\n2021 was an extremely positive year for the Group and its sustainable finance strategy, with structured transactions amounting to more than 30 billion euros equivalent. Enel has signed agreements with several financial counterparties for both derivatives and sustainable guarantees, both of which are linked to the Group\u2019s ability to achieve its sustainability objectives in subsequent years. In March 2021, Enel signed a Sustainability-Linked Revolving Credit Facility for 10 billion euros, the world\u2019s biggest sustainable credit facility in the world at the time of signing, linked to SDG 13. In May 2021, Enel Finance America LLC structured a 5 billion dollar commercial paper program, also with reference to the same sustainable goal. Between June and September 2021, sustainability-linked bonds in euros and dollars were issued by the subsidiary EFI for a total amount equivalent to approximately 10 billion euros. These issues are linked to the achievement of Enel\u2019s sustainability goal relating to the reduction of direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1), in line with the Group\u2019s Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework. At the same time, EFI carried out repurchase operations of conventional bond loans in circulation, not linked to the pursuit of the SDGs, for a total amount of approximately 8 billion euros, through voluntary takeover bids and by exercising specific repurchase options.\n\nThis bond repurchase program, together with the new sustainability-linked bond issues, made it possible to achieve a ratio between sustainable funding sources and the...\nGroup\u2019s total gross debt of approximately 55% at the end of 2021, also allowing for a simultaneous reduction in the cost of the Group\u2019s debt and providing an important tool to protect against potential rises in interest rates due to the less expansive monetary policies of the Central Banks in response to increasing inflation.\n\nIn the field of public finance, the Group supports the economic recovery plan and aims to become a strategic partner for the adoption of the Green Deal and the Recovery Plan at both European and national level. The objective is to drive a sustainable, rapid and effective recovery, through a wide pipeline of construction projects focused on decarbonization, electricity grids and electrification, allowing the green and digital transition of the European economy to be accelerated, with a significant impact in terms of GDP, employment and reduction of CO\u2082 emissions and in full alignment with the European taxonomy. To this end, the Group has identified potential investments of approximately 5.4 billion euros for the period 2022-2027, with a direct impact on the Group and in line with the national Recovery Plans in Italy, Spain and Romania. These initiatives are focused on green hydrogen, renewables and storage, revitalization of the photovoltaic manufacturing industry, smart grids, network resilience and charging infrastructure for electric mobility. The estimated additional impact of these investments on GDP is around 13.2 billion euros, creating over 18,000 new jobs. The Group has also devised further project with an indirect impact in terms of benefits, and intended to promote partnerships with both public and private entities, with a view to achieving the decarbonization and electrification of consumption through the spread of electric bus fleets, the transition towards green ports and the promotion of energy efficiency in public buildings.\n\nFurthermore, in the context of subsidized loans from international and national financial institutions, the Group is leading an innovation process intended to accelerate the mobilization of capital to support sustainable growth, through the use of sustainability-linked financial instruments.\n\nMore specifically, in 2021 the Group signed subsidized loans for a total of 1.3 billion euros, which, as in the case of private financing, provide for the inclusion of sustainability-linked mechanisms linked to SDG 13. Among the main transactions, the sustainability-linked loan of 600 million euros in total between e-distribuzione, a Group company, and the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EIB\u2019s first sustainability-linked loan agreement, deserves special mention.\n\nIn the coming years, Enel will continue to make use of sustainable finance tools, with the aim of achieving a sustainable debt share of the Group\u2019s total debt of approximately 65% by 2024 and over 70% by 2030.\n\nParticipation in international round tables to promote sustainable finance\n\nThe focus on sustainable finance is growing and Enel\u2019s commitment to key global stakeholders is being strengthened through its co-chairmanship of the UN\u2019s Global Compact \u201cCFO Taskforce for the SDGs\u201d and its involvement in the UN\u2019s GISD Alliance. An important initial result was the launch of the \u201cPrinciples on Integrated SDG Investments and Finance\u201d, a set of principles to support companies in the transition towards sustainable development. In this context, companies are encouraged to set their own indicators and targets to monitor performance on the most relevant SDGs for their business. CFOs involved in the task force have pledged to invest more than 500 billion dollars over the next five years and to work jointly within their organizations to promote greater integration of the SDGs into corporate finance. They have also pledged to link 50% of all corporate loans to sustainability performance.\n\nEqually significant are the results of the work done by the GISD Alliance, including: the definition of Sustainable Development Investing (SDI); the launch of the Call to Action for COVID-19 Bond Issuance; the creation of the SDG Investor Platform digital portal for identifying investment opportunities.\n\nAlso see the paragraph \u201cEnel\u2019s presence in the main energy and sustainability associations\u201d in this chapter.\nThe European Taxonomy Regulation\n\nEnel welcomes the development of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, as it provides a standardized classification system based on objective parameters to identify environmentally sustainable economic activities. The EU Taxonomy Regulation acts as an important enabler to promote sustainable investments and accelerate the decarbonization of the European economy, while at the same time creating security and transparency for investors and supporting companies in planning the Net-Zero transition.\n\nWe are fully committed to reporting on the implementation of Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated act that further specifies the content, methodology and presentation of information to be disclosed by both financial and non-financial undertakings. Despite the fact that the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires companies to declare compliance with the taxonomy itself as of January 2022, Enel has taken a leading role by deciding to provide evidence of its adoption thereof in previous publications \u2013 the Sustainability Report 2020 and the Consolidated Annual Report 2020, as well as during Capital Markets Day 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe also welcome the different thresholds defined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the basis of climate and environmental sciences, such as the specific emission limit of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh (taking the whole life cycle into consideration) to measure the substantial contribution to achieving the climate change mitigation targets established for most energy generation technologies, in that it stems from a solid process based on a robust scientific foundation. However, there are some activities that, although not covered under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, are critical to promoting the well-being of European citizens, especially in the short and medium term, while contributing to the sustainable development of Europe in the long term. As regards the energy industry, there are some important sustainability-related issues that the European Commission did not consider when developing the technical screening criteria, as they were outside the main scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. These included energy security, grid reliability and the energy transition, all of which are critical to Europe\u2019s well-being but which are appropriately addressed by other policies, funds and regulations at EU and Member State level.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation is still in a developmental stage, and a number of important Delegated Acts are still being finalized at the time of publication of this Sustainability Report. These include Acts that will detail the criteria for the remaining four objectives (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy, also with reference to the reduction and recycling of waste; pollution prevention and control; protection of biodiversity and the health of ecosystems) as well as those that will identify economic activities that do not have a significant or harmful impact on environmental sustainability and those that do. Completion of the entire regulatory process should ensure that all globally recognized economic activities are taken into account, thereby reducing current uncertainties regarding implementation of the process itself.\n\nBy means of a process overseen by the CEO and Top Management, involving the relevant Functions at corporate and Country level, as well as all Business Lines, we initiated a five-step process to analyze the applicability of the EU Taxonomy Regulation throughout the entire value chain and in all countries where we operate.\n\nOur implementation process\n\n1. Identification of eligible economic activities\n2. Analysis of substantial contribution\n3. Assessment of the principle of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to other environmental objectives\n4. Verification of minimum social safeguards\n5. Calculation of financial metrics\n\nA detailed description of the 5 phases is given in the chapter \u201cDisclosure of the proportion of activities considered environmentally sustainable (Article 8, EU Regulation 2020/852)\u201d, in the appendix to the Sustainability Report considered as an independent document.\nPursuant to Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, in 2021 we updated our analysis regarding the level of taxonomy eligibility of our economic activities due to their substantial contribution to achieving climate change mitigation targets, in compliance with the principle of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) and the need to ensure minimum social safeguards, the results of which are given in the table below.\n\n**Taxonomy eligibility of Enel activities**\n\n**2021 mapping of Enel\u2019s business according to the European taxonomy (Article 8 of EU Reg. 2020/852)**\n\n| Activity | Eligible | Non-eligible |\n|----------|----------|--------------|\n| Solar & Wind | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2717 |\n| Hydroelectric | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2717 |\n| Geothermal | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2717 |\n| RES Storage | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2717 |\n| Transmission and distribution of electricity | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2717 |\n| Smart-lighting, E-bus, Energy Efficiency, Home, Vivi meglio unifamiliare, Condominium, Customer insight, Distributed energy, E-Mobility, Battery Energy Storage | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2717 |\n| Trading | \u2717 | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Sales of energy and gas to end customers | \u2717 | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Financial services, hardware and software, insurance and other general services | \u2717 | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Coal and liquid fossil fuels | \u2717 | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Nuclear | \u2717 | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Gas | \u2717 | \u2714\ufe0f |\n\nThe shares\\(^{(13)}\\) of taxonomy eligible and non-eligible activities with respect to turnover, capital expenditure (Capex) and operating expenditure (Opex) are as follows:\n\n- **turnover**: 33.5% eligible, 66.5% non-eligible;\n- **capital expenditure (Capex)**: 85% eligible, 15% non-eligible;\n- **operating expenditure (Opex)**: 66% eligible, 34% non-eligible.\n\nThe financial information was gathered from the digital accounting system used by the Enel Group or from the management systems in use by the Company\u2019s Business Lines. However, some proxies were also made to provide a more complete representation.\n\nWith reference to the detail of the activities considered environmentally sustainable, a specific and independent document has also been prepared, on a voluntary basis, which is published separately from this consolidated non-financial statement.\n\n\\(^{(13)}\\) The shares are expressed in terms of shares of turnover, capital expenditure (Capex) and operating expenses (Opex) as required by Article 8 (2) (a) (b) of EU Regulation 2020/852.\nESG ratings and indices\n\nESG analysts and rating agencies continuously monitor Enel\u2019s sustainability performance, by different methods, in relation to environmental, social and governance issues. ESG ratings are a strategic tool to support investors in assessing sustainable business models and identifying risks and opportunities linked to the sustainability in their investment portfolio, aiding the development of active and passive sustainable investment strategies.\n\nEnel is constantly committed to managing and reporting all ESG aspects, considering the assessments of the rating agencies as an important opportunity to improve its performance in terms of sustainability and devising specific action plans with the involvement of the various company units and Business Lines.\n\nIn 2021, Enel maintained its positioning, reaching leadership positions in most cases.\n\nKey milestones 2021:\n\n- Inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the second year in a row\n- Inclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders indices for the second year in a row\n- Among the leaders in the DJSI World and DJSI Europe\n- Inclusion in the Climate \u201cA\u201d List for the third year in a row\n- Industry leader in the Equileap TOP 100 ranking\n- Industry Leader in the FTSE4Good Index\n- Confirmation in the Euronext Vigeo Eiris 120\n\nMain ESG Indices & Rankings\n### Main ESG ratings\n\n| Rating | Ranking | Sector average | Scale (low | high) |\n|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|--------|\n| AAA    | Top 10 / 147 utilities | BBB | CCC | AAA |\n| 23.5 (Medium risk) | 83 / 629 electric utilities | 34.9 | 100 | 0 |\n| 88     | 5 / 103 electric utilities | 38 | 0 | 100 |\n| A (climate) | \u2013 | B | B | D- | A |\n| A- (water) | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| 91     | 1 / 248 electric utilities | \u2013 | 0 | 100 |\n| 4.7    | 2 / 41 electric utilities | 2.6 | 0 | 5 |\n| 74     | 2 / +4,000 all sectors | 51 | 0 | 100 |\n| B      | \u2013 | C | D- | A+ |\n| 39     | \u2013 | 47 | 100 | 0 |\n\n### An opportunity to grow: our advisory panel\n\nFrom this year we have involved a group of external experts (advisory panel) to strengthen our sustainability reporting. The panel helps to assess and improve the quality and credibility of our Sustainability Report and to increase our level of ambition. In particular, for the 2021 Sustainability Report, three sustainability and reporting experts were involved, with particular reference to issues related to the environment, human rights and the capital market: Alexander Bassen, Farooq Ullah, Pietro Bertazzi.\n\nThe group of experts provided input on our process of determining the structure of the document and the contents relating to the chapter \u201cOur sustainable progress\u201d, which gives an overall view of the management of sustainability in the Enel Group. Panel members are unpaid.\n\u201cThe quantification of ESG information enables the integration in investment decisions.\u201d\n\nAlexander Bassen is a full professor of capital markets and management at the University of Hamburg. Alex is a member of the German Council for Sustainable Development - the advisory body of the German Federal Government, the German Advisory Council on Global Change of the German Federal Government. He is also a member of the EFRAG Project Task Force EU Sustainability Reporting Standard (PTF ESRS) and the G7 Impact Task Force. He is an Honorary Associate Researcher at the University of Oxford (Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment) and a Visiting Professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and the University of Reading. He is also a member of several advisory committees for sustainable finance.\n\n\u201cEnel has produced an impressive Sustainability Report which demonstrates both meaningful results and ambitious leadership. This report represents a best practice standard amongst corporate sustainability reporting.\u201d\n\nFarooq Ullah is a strategist on The B Team\u2019s campaign on climate, nature and equality. He helps both companies and governments demonstrate their leadership in sustainability. He has over 18 years of experience in sustainable development and public policy at international, national and local level, as well as three years of experience in the private sector, both in industry and as a consultant.\n\n\u201cThis sustainability report demonstrates Enel\u2019s commitment to sustainability and transparency, as well as its leadership in capturing and adapting to the constantly changing ESG ecosystem: it brings into reality the latest developments and anticipates regulatory and standard setting evolution. I am convinced the conceptual efforts and thorough study of the application of frameworks, concepts, principles and metrics will be useful for companies as well as standards setters and regulators.\u201d\n\nPietro Bertazzi has contributed to the creation of policy & regulation policies on responsible business, focusing on the role of the private sector in human rights, climate change and sustainable development. Currently, he leads the institutional affairs of the CDP, promoting the ambition and acceleration of action by governments and companies on climate and the environment. Prior to the CDP, Pietro worked at GRI, promoting corporate sustainability and transparency in national policies in various jurisdictions globally. He is a proud architect of the role of the private sector in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDGs), he co-authored the SDG Compass and shaped and led the Business Reporting on SDGs Action Platform of the UN Global Compact and the GRI.\n3.

Specifically, with regard to power generation and the sale of electricity and natural gas to end customers, we have committed to achieving zero emissions, without resorting to CO\u2082 removal measures or nature-based solutions such as reforestation. We have also confirmed our target to reduce our direct GHG emissions per kWh\u2091\u2091\u2091 by 80% by 2030, compared to the 2017 base year, in line with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C, as verified by SBTi. This commitment requires the Group\u2019s direct emissions to be 82 gCO\u2082\u2091\u2091\u2091/kWh by 2030. In addition, we have disclosed two new reduction targets, one integrated for emissions related to the generation and sale of electricity, with an 80% reduction by 2030 compared to 2017 levels, and the other for emissions related to gas sales, with a 55% reduction by 2030 compared to 2017 levels.\n\nThe objective of achieving total decarbonization by 2040 requires a strong acceleration on renewables and energy efficiency, as well as a complete rethinking of investment planning and the economic model, including in terms of circularity. In this regard, we are acting on the main lever of direct emissions and at the same time broadly rethinking our business model to work on all other dimensions. We have increased the degree of reporting accuracy, as well as transparency regarding the various categories of indirect emissions. Although these are voluntarily tracked in relation to their significance, we have increasingly mapped emissions from fuel extraction and transport, grid losses, self-consumption and relations with suppliers. A particular focus is placed on the climate change adaptation policies in order to increase the resilience of the assets along the entire value chain, thereby limiting potentially negative impacts and guaranteeing a safe and sustainable energy service in all the countries in which the Group operates.\n\nIn order to guarantee increased transparency in its communications and relationships with its stakeholders, we periodically report on our related activities around climate change in line with the international standards of the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and are publicly committed to adopting the recommendations of the Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board, which in June 2017 published specific recommendations for the voluntary reporting of the financial impact of climate risks. We have also integrated the \u201cGuidelines on reporting climate-related information\u201d published by the European Commission in June 2019. Furthermore, we have taken into account guidance from the \u201cEnhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures\u201d of the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the first draft standards issued on the EFRAG website, and the ISSB\u2019s recently published exposure draft. The TCFD Advisory Council also worked on scenarios in 2020 and since then we have been involved in a number of initiatives around scenario analysis, sharing our expertise to support the widespread and transparent adoption of these practices across a growing number of companies.\nEngaging stakeholders in combating climate change\n\nEnel promotes the engagement of its main external and internal stakeholders in order to increase their awareness and develop a constructive dialog that can provide a valuable contribution toward the creation of solutions that mitigate climate change and create value for the Group. The most relevant actions carried out in 2021 include:\n\n- **materiality analysis**: climate change, in terms of priority for stakeholders and Company performance in the various countries in which it operates, was one of the topics discussed during identification of the main stakeholder priorities in sustainability planning;\n- **Enel Focus On**: over the last year, twenty virtual meetings, known as #AsktheProfessor, were uploaded online, aimed at involving lecturers and experts so as to initiate an open dialog with Group management on the main challenges of the energy transition. A variety of climate-related topics was covered, such as renewable energy, the sustainable future, the customer as energy generator, utilities for a sustainable planet, incorporating sustainability into business, energy transition goals, and the most effective policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;\n- **social media**: Enel has continued using social media to raise public awareness about topics related to climate change, including decarbonization, renewable energies, electrification, electric mobility and responsible energy consumption;\n- **Twenergy**: a digital ecosystem launched by Endesa, the Group\u2019s subsidiary in Spain, with the purpose of raising awareness and informing on issues related to energy efficiency, electrification, sustainable development, the circular economy and equitable transition, opening the debate to professionals and specialists from different sectors to build a platform for information and training which is as diverse as possible. In 2021, there were about 820 thousand visits to the platform, while in the main social networks the total impressions were about 500 thousand. Within Twenergy, the \u201cSustainable Spirits\u201d project was also created, an initiative to give visibility to all people who are aware of sustainability and respect the environment;\n- **raising the awareness of local communities**: with the Creating Shared Value (CSV) model, Enel is involving local communities, making them aware of issues related to climate change and explaining how renewables are an extremely effective solution, with benefits not only for the environment but also for the creation of new jobs and for social-economic development;\n- **raising the awareness of our people**: Enel involves all the people that work for the Company in awareness activities in order to increase their engagement in climate change aspects and promote a culture of innovation and business entrepreneurship on a global level to overcome the energy challenges. Enel Digital Days 2021, which are annual company events, promoted discussions and exchanges about topics such as electrification, decarbonization, digitalization and urbanisation. The main priorities of the Strategic Plan for the next three years were presented, in line with what was communicated to the financial community during the Capital Markets Day.\n\nEnel\u2019s advocacy activities for the climate\n\nWithin the framework of its commitment to climate change, the Enel Group is firmly committed to promoting and defining:\n\n- **ambitious climate and decarbonization targets** consistent with the objectives set by the Paris Agreement, for example by being among the first signatories in 2019 of the Business Ambition for 1.5 \u00b0C campaign promoted by a global coalition of UN agencies, including the UN Global Compact, and business leaders, which reached over 1,000 signatures in 2021;\n- **effective and efficient implementation mechanisms** capable of exploiting market dynamics and, in this sense, fully supporting the presence of a carbon price;\n- **ongoing negotiations on climate issues within multi-stakeholder initiatives**, actively contributing to groups and coalitions such as the UN Global Compact\u2019s Action Platform on Climate Ambition and the World Bank\u2019s Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition;\n- **private sector leadership on decarbonization** through its continued participation in initiatives such as the CEO Alliance, WEF CEO Climate Leaders Alliance, IETA (International Emissions Trading Association), WBCSD (World Business Council on Sustainable Development), and regional and national trade associations.\nEnel is committed to ensuring that its direct advocacy activities are conducted in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. In particular, Enel\u2019s advocacy policy aims to promote the Group\u2019s decarbonization strategy and pursuit of climate goals, involving institutional stakeholders, trade associations, non-governmental organizations and academia, in order to promote the Group\u2019s vision on climate and low-carbon policies. Stakeholder engagement contributes to the evolution of the regulatory framework towards ambitious climate goals and promotes an economy in which carbon pricing drives long-term investments. To do this, Enel interacts directly with policy makers, contributes to the positioning of trade associations, and interacts with a broader set of stakeholders to build consensus and support for specific policy proposals. As a strong supporter of carbon pricing, Enel supports its integration into the decision-making process in all countries where it operates. In doing so, Enel emphasizes the importance of well-functioning carbon taxation and trading mechanisms that can provide short- and medium-term predictability to support market efficiency, as well as strong long-term price signals to support investment and innovation.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group represented its interests at the European level and promoted its position vis-\u00e0-vis the European Institutions (Commission, Parliament, Council) with the aim of influencing proposals and decisions that could have affected the EU\u2019s Climate and Energy Framework, and also the Group\u2019s activities. When carrying out its advocacy in Europe, Enel is committed to behaving in a transparent and responsible manner. We are listed on the European Transparency Register(1), the specific activities of which are linked to the main EU legislative and policy proposals (including European Green Deal, Fit for 55, Climate Law, ETS reform, Air Quality Directives, Sustainable Finance, State Aid and Competition, Hydrogen, Taxonomy). The dedicated website contains a public list of meetings Enel has held with Commissioners, Members of their Cabinet and EC Directors General between December 2014 and January 2022. Specifically, for 2021, topics discussed included: European Green Deal, Energy Taxation Directive (ETD), Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and RES & ETS. In addition, Enel\u2019s positions and responses to EU consultations are made public, together with a list of the main professional associations and think-tanks in which Enel is active.\n\nThe worldwide coordination of Enel\u2019s global public policy positioning on climate is ensured by the European Affairs unit. This unit is responsible for developing global scenarios and position papers on climate policies. Its objective is to guide Enel\u2019s national and local advocacy activities, thanks to a continuous dialog with institutions and the widest possible range of stakeholders active in the climate debate. In this sense, Enel is also committed to working to ensure continuous and full alignment with the objectives of the Paris Agreement of any association of which it is a member.\n\nNationally, Enel\u2019s pursues its advocacy efforts through specific activities and broader stakeholder engagement on decarbonization and energy transition issues. The approach is similar to that adopted at global level. Advocacy objectives include promoting greater climate ambition, carbon pricing, accelerating the penetration of renewable technologies, developing and upgrading infrastructure through smart grid technologies to support the energy transition, and electrification as a means for decarbonizing energy end-uses. In addition, through \u201cEnergy Transition Roadmap\u201d, engagement platforms Enel engages with a wide range of stakeholders on the actions needed at national level to pursue the Paris Agreement goals. These platforms take decarbonization by 2050 as a starting point in line with the Paris Agreement, then proceed to identify the technology mix needed to achieve this long-term goal in 2050, as well as the medium-term goal of 2030, and to develop specific policy recommendations aimed at achieving this transformation. All of these activities are supported by ongoing engagement with a wide range of stakeholders.\n\n---\n\n(1) https://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=6256831207-27.\n\nBy registering, Enel signed the Transparency Register Code of Conduct, and also declared that it is bound by its own Code of Ethics.\nEnel\u2019s positioning on key climate policies and frameworks\n\nSeveral regulatory and legislative events that occurred in 2021, not only climate-specific regulations but also energy and environmental regulations that have a strong impact on the climate itself, are relevant to Enel\u2019s business and advocacy actions. In light of the increased streamlining of the climate challenge within broader policy and regulation at the global, national, regional and local levels, the number of dossiers on which Enel focuses its advocacy increases annually. Enel\u2019s positioning on the main dossiers is outlined below.\n\n- **In all the countries where it operates, the Enel Group strongly promotes greater climate ambition in line with the Paris Agreement.** Believing in the urgency in combating climate change, and having adopted, as a company, SBTi objectives aligned with the Paris Agreement, Enel supports public the framework of a just transition. Enel\u2019s advocacy in this area is implemented through ad hoc engagement on specific legislative proposals (e.g. the European Climate Law), but also through broader stakeholder engagement at national level through our Energy Transition Roadmap platform (see above). Through such platforms, Enel promotes NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) that fully reflect the highest possible climate ambition and are fully in line with the requirements of the Paris Agreement.\n\n- **In the context of the debate on international cooperation regarding the Paris Agreement, Enel supports a rapid finalization of the implementing provisions of Article 6 on climate change cooperation.** This position is in line with the fact that Enel supports the adoption of carbon pricing mechanisms worldwide. The implementation of these mechanisms based on Cap and Trade systems should be preferred in industrialized economies and industrial sectors where operators can effectively manage and internalize the price signals recorded on the market in their decision-making processes. Conversely, carbon-pricing mechanisms should tend to take the form of carbon taxes in countries with weaker institutions and in sectors characterized by distributed emission sources, and where non-economic barriers are significant. The Enel Group strongly supports carbon pricing as a means to decarbonize economic systems efficiently and effectively around the world. Enel\u2019s positions on the adoption of carbon pricing have been conveyed directly and through participation in the activities of IETA, CPLC, Eurelectric and WBCSD. In 2021, specific activities were dedicated aimed at analyzing and promoting carbon pricing, at global, regional (EU and Latin America) and national (EU member states, Chile, Colombia and Peru) levels.\n\n- **Within the EU, the European Green Deal represents a unique opportunity to accelerate the EU\u2019s path to a fully decarbonized and sustainable economy, especially when aligned with the mobilization of significant resources to ensure a rapid recovery from the ongoing crises.** Achieving the EU\u2019s climate and environmental goals requires a new industrial strategy to reach climate neutrality, and an action plan for the circular economy, pursuing the decarbonization of each sector. The energy sector must aim to be fully decarbonized and ensure the decarbonization of other sectors of the economy through direct and indirect electrification. The study \u201cSustainable paths for EU increased climate and energy ambition\u201d, sponsored Fondazione Enel and other partners, highlights the fact that end-use electrification is necessary for full decarbonization.\n\n- **Enel supports the EU Climate Law, which places environmental and other challenges at the heart of the EU\u2019s vision and strategy for inclusive and sustainable growth.** The long-term goal of carbon neutrality in 2050 and the intermediate 2030 target of at least a 55% reduction in greenhouse gases, compared to 1990 levels, was set as a guide for all other EU policies. The law also establishes a guiding vision and governance to ensure that all EU policies, actions, and strategies are aligned with the climate goal, including education, financing, R&D, innovation, tax policies, labor and social policies. In doing so, the law establishes a principle that all policies should be designed and evaluated based on a careful assessment of their full impact. This assessment includes the full range of different benefits in terms of air quality, circular economy and energy efficiency. In addition, the EU Climate Law includes a pathway to establish an intermediate climate target at 2040, taking into account the principles of \u201cjust transition\u201d, recognition of the need to strengthen the EU\u2019s carbon resources through a more ambitious LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry) regulation, for which the Commission submitted a proposal in July 2021, a commitment to negative emissions after 2050, and the establishment of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change, which will provide independent scientific advice.\n\u2022 Enel supports the EU\u2019s proposed ETS reform, which must be strengthened to pursue the EU\u2019s higher climate ambition and supported by a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The linear reduction factor should be increased to achieve the additional emission reductions required of EU ETS sectors and to provide a clear price signal to the market. The market stability reserve should be revised to increase price stability and balance the market surplus. The introduction of the road transport and buildings sectors into the ETS should be approached with caution, as it could compromise the reliability of the carbon price signal in the short to medium term and have significant negative impacts in terms of a just transition. Finally, Enel supports the adoption of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to provide greater climate ambition while reducing the risks of carbon leakage. Implementation of the mechanism should go hand in hand with intensified discussions on increasing climate ambition with the EU\u2019s key global trading partners.\n\n\u2022 Enel supports a revision of the Effort Sharing regulation that fully exploits the decarbonization potential of energy end-uses in the EU\u2019s increased climate ambition. The review must aim to update the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) targets of individual member states in an upwards direction, in line with the higher ambition of 2030. The ambition must also be aligned with 2050 climate neutrality, to avoid lock-in of emitting technologies and infrastructure. However, the impact on prices and energy bills must be carefully managed. The multiple environmental benefits associated with a higher ambition allow for a deviation from cost-efficiency criteria, as the decarbonization of transport and buildings brings environmental benefits that are not accounted for in GHG costs.\n\n\u2022 Enel welcomes the publication of the hydrogen and gas market decarbonization package by the European Commission. The package also includes the proposed regulation on reducing methane emissions throughout the energy value chain and introduces new requirements for measuring, reporting and verifying emissions, as well as emission abatement measures. In addition, the regulation also proposes rules to increase transparency on methane emissions associated with fossil fuel imports.\n\n\u2022 Enel supports the European Commission\u2019s proposal on an upward revision of the EU\u2019s 2030 energy efficiency target of at least 36% for final energy consumption and 39% for primary energy consumption to achieve the ambition of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Significant energy efficiency improvements are needed to achieve the Net-Zero emissions target by 2050. As such, the proposed revision of the Directive, as part of the \u201cDelivering on the European Green Deal\u201d package, raises the level of ambition of the EU\u2019s energy efficiency target and makes it binding.\n\n\u2022 Enel welcomes the Commission\u2019s initiative to review the Renewable Energy Directive. It believes that the main contributions to efficient decarbonization of the energy sector, as well as buildings, heating and cooling, transportation and industry, will come from further end-use electrification (direct electrification and indirect electrification for sectors that are difficult to abate emissions by means of renewable hydrogen). In this regard, low carbon fuels should be excluded from the scope of this Directive. Enel believes that the EU regulatory framework should provide long-term predictability for investors, as well as simplified and standardized authorization procedures. Finally, Enel supports a technology-neutral approach that at the same time creates the necessary conditions for the penetration of fully sustainable technologies.\n\n\u2022 As part of the European Commission\u2019s hydrogen strategy, the Enel Group actively promotes renewable hydrogen (e.g. generated by electrolysis powered by 100% renewable energy). Enel believes that this is the only truly sustainable generation pathway for hydrogen, powered by renewable sources with zero greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen is best used as a complement to electrification, not as a competitor. It has an efficient role in decarbonizing those parts of the economy that cannot be electrified easily or economically, for example, hard-to-abate sectors, such as heavy industry, aviation and shipping.\n\n\u2022 As part of its smart and sustainable mobility strategy, the Enel Group is actively promoting e-mobility as a key factor in reducing road transport emissions and contributing to the achievement of EU energy efficiency targets. Since 2011, the EU has been involved in the process of updating its transport policy framework to reduce emissions in the sector, particularly road transport. Mobility is a critical aspect of social inclusion and an important factor in human well-being, especially for disadvantaged groups. Recognized as an essential service in the European pillar of social rights, transport meets a fundamental need in enabling citizens to integrate into society and the labor market. By far the most serious challenge facing the transport sector is to reduce its emissions significantly and become more sustainable. The European Green Deal calls for a 90% reduction in GHG emissions from transport so that the EU can become a climate neutral economy by 2050, including working towards a zero pollution ambition. In addition, in 2021 the European Commission unveiled...\nthe \u201cEU Urban Mobility Framework\u201d, complementing the proposed revised guidelines for the Trans-European Network. The new EU Urban Mobility Framework outlines a common list of measures and initiatives for with which EU cities can address the challenge of making their mobility more sustainable.\n\n- **Enel fully supports the European building renovation strategy and actively participates in discussions on the proposed review of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.** The building sector is one of the most lagging industries as regards decarbonization due to criticalities in the value chain, building efficiency and choice of energy source. Enel believes it can contribute substantially to the decarbonization of the building sector by installing efficient electrical technologies such as heat pumps, improving building efficiency through digitalization, making buildings dynamic elements of the energy system through storage, remodeling of demand, and electric vehicle charging.\n\n- **Enel has involved various stakeholders in the European Commission\u2019s New Circular Economy Action Plan, stressing the importance of ensuring the circularity of the main supply chains, particularly in relation to electric vehicles, batteries and renewable energy technologies.** Furthermore, Enel\u2019s advocacy has highlighted the need to develop appropriate circular economy metrics and to focus on the high potential of urban environments through the implementation of a clear vision of circular smart cities.\n\n- **Within the framework of the Zero Pollution dossier and other environmental dossiers, the Enel Group is actively promoting the maximization of synergies between decarbonization and other environmental policies.** In this context, synergies of climate and air quality policies are perhaps the most critical, and electricity technologies can play a key role in combating climate change, improving local air quality and increasing the circularity of the EU\u2019s economic system. Soil management is vital for a circular economy that aims to develop sustainable models capable of encouraging the coexistence of different activities and creating synergies and mutual benefits, such as agri-voltaics. The new soil strategy published in November is a step in the right direction. However, its scope should also be extended to the redevelopment of brownfield sites and the reuse of brownfields to avoid further land acquisition and soil pollution.\n\nIn addition to the position outlined above on specific issues, the Enel Group is actively contributing to the debate on how best to address the challenge of climate change. Specifically:\n\n- **Enel played an active role in the different preparatory events of COP 26 in Glasgow,** dealing with several issues related to climate change, such as climate ambition, the Net-Zero challenge, carbon pricing schemes and international carbon markets, but also the mobilization of sustainable finance for combating climate change. Enel is fully committed to contributing to the efficient acceleration of the energy transition and to bringing the world economies onto the Net-Zero path, as mentioned in the latest IPCC Report.\n\n- **Enel has actively contributed to GSEP (Global Sustainable Energy Partnership) climate change activities.** In 2021, GSEP launched its annual report, focused on beneficial electrification, at the 2021 Virtual GSEP Global Summit, with Enel X Global Retail CEO Francesco Venturini Co-Chairing. GSEP also hosted a virtual dialog on electrification at Climate Week in New York, with Enel on the panel. Other GSEP activities carried out in 2021 include Enel\u2019s participation in the Young Ambassadors for Global Electrification program, global advocacy on sustainable electrification, the launch of new research on tracking the deployment and pace of electrification globally, webinars and capacity building activities.\n\n- **Enel supported IETA (International Emission Trading Association) in its 2021 action plan focused on analyzing how emission trading can facilitate increased ambition in both the private and public sectors.** IETA promotes maximum transparency of accounting rules under Articles 5 and 6 of the Paris Agreement, the international aviation carbon offset and reduction system, and the rules developed under voluntary markets. IETA contributed substantially to the success of the COP 26 negotiations on collaborative approaches. At the regional level, the association collaborated on the European Commission\u2019s proposal to strengthen the EU ETS and increase climate ambition. It also supports the emergence of carbon pricing schemes in the Americas and Asia. It does so based on the firm belief that emission trading can enhance the ambition of climate policies while ensuring a high level of environmental integrity.\n\n- **In 2021, Enel launched the new Energy Transition Roadmap platforms for Italy and Romania, bringing the number of active platforms in the Group to more**\nIn early 2021, the Energy Transition Roadmaps (ETRs) for Peru and Morocco, both launched in 2020, were completed. The ETRs take an open approach, sharing technical knowledge and policy views with national and international stakeholders. The ETRs aim to exploit fully three of the main levers available to decarbonize national economies: zero-emission electricity, digitalization and smart grids and end-use electrification. They do this by developing a robust, transparent and stable political and regulatory framework, which in turn is able to catalyze effectively private sector action under the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe Energy Compact on Enel\u2019s sustainable strategy\n\nIn 2021 Enel took part in the High-Level Dialog on Energy (HLDE) of the United Nations, which led to the launch of a global roadmap to set specific targets in accelerating the transition and promoting energy access by 2030, and the announcement of the Energy Compacts, a set of voluntary commitments aimed at accelerating the achievement of SDG 7 \u2013 Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all \u2013 and zeroing out net emissions. In fact, Enel was among the first companies in the world to present its Energy Compact, with the following ambitious global commitments: accelerating coal phase-out from 2030 to 2027; tripling renewable capacity to 145 GW by 2030, from around 49 GW in 2020; increasing battery energy storage to 20 TWh and demand response to 20 GW by 2030; reducing GHG Scope 1 emissions to 82 g/kWh in 2030, in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C scenario (verified by SBTi); installation of more than 4 million electric vehicle charging points and operation of 10 thousand electric buses by 2030; target of reaching 5.6 million beneficiaries with new connections in rural and suburban areas in the period 2020-2030 (target later increased to 6.9 million in the same period). The commitments in the Energy Compact were subsequently updated in the Strategic Plan and the Sustainability Plan 2022-2024, for which the dashboards at the beginning of the chapters in this document should be consulted.\nEnel\u2019s commitment to combat climate change through associations and organizations\n\nThe Group plays an active role in various industry and multistakeholder associations and organizations with the aim of promoting issues concerning energy transition and the commitment to fight climate change at national and global level. Enel is committed to ensuring that the various industry associations, business networks and think tanks of which it is a member operate in full compliance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the decarbonization roadmap established by the Group. Enel therefore systematically verifies the consistency of the associations\u2019 positions with the climate policies shared at the Group level. This verification process is carried out in two stages: (i) before joining the association, through an in-depth analysis of the body\u2019s by-laws, in line with the Climate Policy issued in September 2021; (ii) after joining the association, by actively contributing to its work and/or taking positions of responsibility within it or promoting the Enel Group\u2019s position within working groups. Finally, a review of the level of alignment of the associations with Enel\u2019s strategy is conducted annually. Where an association is found not to be in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and Enel\u2019s climate risk mitigation strategy, the Company assesses whether the misalignment could compromise the effectiveness of Enel\u2019s advocacy and participation, and may eventually decide to withdraw from the association. By way of example, in recent years we have withdrawn our participation from some associations whose views on climate policies and how to achieve the energy transition were persistently different from Enel\u2019s in terms of fighting climate change and pursuing the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement. On the other hand, it may happen that in some associations, despite the existence of a misalignment, Enel decides to continue to be a member with the aim of influencing and aligning association decisions with its own vision of achieving the targets set by the Paris Agreement.\n\nDuring 2020, an initial selection of the main industrial associations and organizations was carried out to identify alignment with Enel\u2019s climate position. During 2021, the list of all associations most committed to climate policy advocacy and with which Enel collaborates worldwide was published (Sustainability | Enel Group) and the list of associations on which an in-depth assessment was carried out was significantly expanded.

Technological development, in particular in the area of renewable energies, has however completely transformed this scenario by making electricity one of the main solutions for reducing the carbon footprint world-wide. Enel is aware of these impacts and implements specific actions to minimise them, promoting the decarbonization of the energy system and the electrification of the energy demand. As a result this reduces the greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain.\n\nEnel\u2019s generation from fossil fuels (mainly gas and coal) traditionally represents the main source of greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, in 2021 the direct emissions (Scope 1) related to generation from fossil fuels were about 51.2 mil t eq CO\u2082, whereas indirect emissions (Scope 3) related to the extraction and transport of fuels were 11.2 mil t eq of CO\u2082 (also considering those related to the transport of raw materials). Enel is reducing this impact by accelerating the decommissioning of coal-fired plants, with a reduction of capacity in 2021 of around 2 GW compared to 2020. In parallel, the Group is increasing the development of renewable capacity that, together with the contribution of nuclear generation, has avoided 72.8 mil t eq of CO\u2082 emissions. Furthermore, Enel is actively committed to the development of electricity storage systems that support the integration of renewable capacity, with a total installed capacity of 217 MW in 2021. The decarbonization of the energy mix also has a positive impact on the reduction of indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2) associated with the acquisition of electricity to cover the requirements of business activities.\n\nThe management of the electricity grid involves the generation of indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2) associated with technical energy losses on the grid of 3.0 mil t eq of CO\u2082 in 2021 (according to the \u201clocation based\u201d calculation methodology). Enel is actively investing in the digitalization and automation of the electricity grid to reduce these losses and increase reliability, while promoting the diffusion of renewables in the energy system.\n\nIn the framework of the end customer, the use of the products sold by Enel\u2019s customers generates GHG emissions that are accounted for as indirect (Scope 3). In particular, the emissions connected to the use of electricity sold to customers equalled approximately 24.0 mil t eq of CO\u2082, whereas those related to gas sold equalled 22.2 mil t eq of CO\u2082. Enel regularly monitors these emissions and adopts measures aimed at minimising them. Furthermore, Enel offers its customers technical solutions to reduce carbon emissions related to their energy consumption in a wide range of sectors, including transport, property management as well as industrial processes and services. For example, through Enel X Global Retail the Group is promoting the spread of charging infrastructures for electric vehicles (0.3 million charging points installed by 2021(3)), the development of energy efficiency solutions, distributed generation, advisory services, smart public lighting and circular cities.\n\n(3) Public and private charging points installed. Includes interoperability points, net of which there are 157 thousand charging points installed at the end of 2021.\n## Enel\u2019s impact on climate change\n\n### Positive impacts\n\n| CO\u2082 free generation | Digitalization of the grid | Electrification of the energy demand and promotion of energy efficiency |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 72.8 million t<sub>eq</sub> of avoided CO\u2082 | \u2022 Avoided CO\u2082 emissions from electricity generation  \n\u2022 Contribution to CO\u2082 emission reduction in other sectors through a zero-emission energy mix | 45.0 million end users with active smart meters  \n\u2022 By providing data in quasi real time, smart meters permit an efficient management of the energy supply and demand, promoting informed and sustainable consumption |\n| 217 MW | \u2022 Increase in storage capacity  \n\u2022 A reliable and resilient grid helps reduce the CO\u2082 emissions associated with grid losses | 319 thousand charging points for electric mobility  \n\u2022 Contribution to CO\u2082 emission reduction in other sectors through the electrification of consumption, including transport by promoting e-mobility |\n| 2.77 number of service interruptions per client (SAIFI) | 2.8 million smart public lighting points | |\n\n### Negative impacts\n\n| Value chain | Generation | Networks | Retail |\n|-------------|------------|----------|--------|\n| 51.2 million t<sub>eq</sub> CO\u2082 | \u2022 Direct greenhouse gas emissions for electricity generation (Scope 1)  \n\u2022 Indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with technical losses from the grid (Scope 2) | 3.0 million t<sub>eq</sub> CO\u2082 | 24.0 million t CO\u2082  \n\u2022 CO\u2082 emissions associated with the use of electricity sold on the retail market (Scope 3) |\n| 11.2 million t<sub>eq</sub> CO\u2082 | \u2022 Indirect greenhouse gas emissions deriving from the extraction and transport of fuels, raw materials and waste (Scope 3) | 22.2 million t<sub>eq</sub> CO\u2082 | |\n\n### Value chain\n\n- **Generation**: 51.2 million t<sub>eq</sub> CO\u2082  \n- **Networks**: 3.0 million t<sub>eq</sub> CO\u2082  \n- **Retail**: 24.0 million t CO\u2082  \n- **Thermal production**: 11.2 million t<sub>eq</sub> CO\u2082  \n- **Technical losses from the grid**: 22.2 million t<sub>eq</sub> CO\u2082  \n- **Sale of retail electricity and gas**: 24.0 million t CO\u2082\n\n---\n\n1.

Analysis and benchmarking of external energy transition scenarios was also carried out which, together with the analysis of relevant reports on macroeconomic, commodity and climate trends, fed internal modeling for definition of the assumptions of long-term scenarios.\n\nGlobal energy scenarios are typically classified by scenario families based on the level of climate ambition:\n\n- **Business as usual/Stated policies**: energy scenarios based on business as usual/current policies. They provide a fairly conservative benchmark for the future, representing the evolution of the energy system in the absence of additional climate and energy policies. These scenarios do not achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\n- **Paris Aligned**: energy scenarios aligned with the Paris Agreement, i.e., that include a goal of limiting global average temperature increase to \u201cwell below 2 \u00b0C\u201d compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this goal, scenarios in this category consider new and more ambitious policies for end-use electrification and the development of renewables.\n\n- **Paris Ambitious**: global energy scenarios that chart a path toward Net-Zero GHG emissions by 2050, consistent with the Paris Agreement\u2019s most ambitious goal of stabilizing the average increase in global temperatures within 1.5 \u00b0C. All scenarios in this group agree that the main drivers of the energy transition to Net-Zero by 2050 are the process of end-use electrification and the increase in electricity generation from renewables in both the medium and long term. They differ, however, on the additional solutions needed in the long term to close the gap to the Net-Zero emissions target, assigning different levels of importance to the contributions of various technologies and changes in consumer behavior.\n\nThe issues of industrial and economic transition towards solutions that can reduce CO\u2082 concentrations in the atmosphere are the characteristic elements of the \u201cenergy transition scenario\u201d, while the issues related to future trends of climate variables (in terms of acute and chronic phenomena) define the so-called \u201cphysical scenario\u201d, which takes acute phenomena (heat waves, floods, hurricanes, etc.) into account. This includes their potential impact on industrial assets, as well as chronic phenomena related to structural changes in the climate, such as the trend of temperature increase, sea level rises, etc., which may result, for example, in a steady change in plant output and a change in electricity consumption profiles in the residential and commercial sectors.\n\nThe scenarios are construed with an overall framework in mind to ensure consistency between transition assumptions and climate projections.\n\nThe adoption of these scenarios and their integration into corporate processes takes account of the guidelines of the TCFD and enables the assessment of the risks and opportunities connected with climate change. For this reason, the Group has created a channel of constant dialog and collaboration with experts on climate change, for example the Department of Geosciences of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste. Furthermore, it is structured for managing high-resolution post downscaling climatic scenarios and has started projects for developing the skills needed to translate the complexity of climate models into information that is useful for understanding the effects, at a local level, on business and support strategic decisions.\n\nThe acquisition and processing of substantial amounts of information and data required for the definition of scenarios, as well as the identification of the methodologies and metrics needed for interpreting complex very high-resolution phenomena and, in the case of climate scenarios, requires a continuous dialog with both external as well as internal references. For this purpose, the Group operates with a platform approach, equipping itself with tools that guarantee solid and accessible information. The process that translates the scenario phenomena into information...\nthat is useful for industrial and strategic decisions can be summarized in five steps:\n\n1. **Identification of trends and factors** relevant to the business (e.g., electrification of consumption, heat waves, etc.)\n2. Development of **link** functions connecting climate/transition scenarios and operating variables\n3. **Identification of risks and opportunities**\n4. **Calculation of impacts** on business (e.g., change in performance, losses, Capex)\n5. **Strategic actions**: definition and implementation (e.g., capital allocation, resilience plans)\n\n### The transition scenario\n\nThe transition scenario describes how the generation and consumption of energy evolves in various sectors in an economic, social, policy and regulatory context consistent with different trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, therefore, correlated with the RCP climate scenarios. The scenarios used by the Group on a global level are the result of a benchmark analysis of external scenarios and currently known policy objectives. For the main countries where the Group is present, it processes coherent transition scenarios, using energy system models; if internal models are not available, risks and opportunities are evaluated by analyzing scenarios produced by third parties, as described previously.\n\n**The main assumptions** considered when defining the transition scenarios concern:\n\n- **the local policies and regulatory measures to fight climate change**, such as measures for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption, to increase energy efficiency and the decarbonization of the electricity sector;\n- **the global macroeconomic and energy context** (for example, in terms of gross domestic product, population and commodity prices), considering international benchmarks such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)(4), and others;\n- **the evolution of technologies for generation**, conversion and energy consumption, in terms of both technical operating parameters and costs.\n\nIn 2021, Enel revised its medium- to long-term energy transition scenario framework, defining three alternative scenario narratives.\n\n- **Paris scenario** - envisions the achievement of the Paris Agreement targets, thus a significantly higher level of climate ambition than business as usual. The increased ambition is supported by greater electrification of consumption and increasing development of renewables.\n- **Slow Transition scenario** - a scenario characterized by a slower energy transition, which means the Paris Agreement targets will not be met. This scenario involves a smaller increase in renewables and a less sustained electrification process than the Paris scenario, especially in the short term (delayed implementation of the transition).\n- **Best Place scenario** - is constructed to evaluate as-\n\n---\n\n(4) As regards IIASA, for example, consideration was given to the fundamentals driving the commodity demand underlying the \u201cShared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)\u201d, in which different scenarios are projected that describe socioeconomic and policy evolution in line with the climate scenarios. The information deriving from the \u201cSSPs\u201d is used, together with internal models, to support the long-term forecasts, such as, for example, those for commodity prices and electric demand.\nsumptions for improvement over the Paris scenario. The objectives of the Paris Agreement are also achieved in this scenario, but a wider range of technological options is considered, i.e. a greater penetration of green hydrogen generated through renewable electricity, used more widely in hard-to-abate sectors, and facilitating the process of decarbonization towards Net-Zero emissions.\n\nEnel has chosen the Paris scenario as a benchmark for long-term planning, which envisages the achievement of the objectives of the Paris Agreement, unlike last year, when the reference scenario was current policies. This is with the conviction that, globally speaking, governments, businesses, organizations and citizens will effectively participate in the collective effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The increase in the Net-Zero commitments of States during 2021, which currently cover 88% of global emissions\\(^{(5)}\\), and the outcome of COP 26, support the choice of choosing a scenario that achieves the Paris objectives as a long-term benchmark for Enel. With respect to the possibility of assuming the achievement of the most challenging objective of the Paris Agreement as a benchmark scenario for long-term planning, i.e. to stabilize the average global temperature within +1.5 \u00b0C, there remains the uncertainty that some countries could maintain inertial trajectories, delaying the process of decarbonization towards Net-Zero emissions by 2050.\n\nHaving said this with respect to the external context, the Enel Group operates a business model in line with the maximum ambition of Paris Agreement objectives, namely, one that is consistent with a global average temperature increase of 1.5 \u00b0C by 2100. Enel has set a long-term goal to achieve zero direct emissions (Scope 1), with fully renewable electricity generation, and zero emissions related to retail sales of power (Scope 3).\n\nAssumptions concerning commodity price trends as inputs to the Paris scenario are consistent with external scenarios that achieve Paris Agreement targets. In particular, a sustained growth in the price of CO\\(_2\\), caused by the gradual reduction of permit supply in the face of increasing demand, and a stabilization of coal prices, due to decreasing demand, are considered in 2030. With regard to gas, it is believed that price tensions will ease in the coming years in light of a realignment between supply and demand at a global level. Finally, oil prices are expected to stabilize gradually, for which we estimate peak demand around 2030.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Source: IEA \u2013 Sustainable Development Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, BNEF, IHS Green Case Scenario, Enerdata Green Scenario.

The Group uses this scenario for the assessment of physical phenomena and for the analyses that consider an energy transition coherent with ambitious objects in terms of mitigation. In analyses that consider both physical and transition variables, the Group associates the SSP1-RCP 2.6 scenario with the Paris and Best Place scenarios. |\n| RCP 4.5  | +2.7 \u00b0C by 2100. Enel has identified this scenario as the one that is best suited for representing the current global climatic and political context and is coherent with the overall estimates of temperature increase that current policies consider and as announced on a global level. In analyses that consider both physical and transition variables, the Group associates the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario with the Slow Transition scenario. |\n| RCP 8.5  | +4.4 \u00b0C by 2100. Compatible with a worst case scenario where no particular measures are taken to combat climate change (\u201cBusiness as usual\u201d). |\n\nThe climate scenarios are global in nature. Accordingly, in order to determine the effects in the areas of relevance for the Group, as previously described, a collaborative initiative has been started with the Department of Geosciences of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste. As part of this collaboration, the ICTP provides projections for the main climate variables with a grid resolution that varies from approximately 12 km\u00b2 to approximately 100 km\u00b2 and a forecast horizon of 2020-2050. The main variables are temperature, rainfall and snowfall and solar radiation. With respect to previous analysis carried, the current studies are based on the use of multiple regional climate models: the one developed by ITP combined with five other simulations, selected as representative of the ensemble of climate models currently available in the literature. This technique is usually adopted in the scientific community to obtain a more robust, bias-free analysis mediated by the various assumptions that could characterize the single model.\n\nIn this phase of the study, the future projections were analyzed for Italy, Spain and all countries of interest to the Group in Latin America, obtaining, also due to the use of the ensemble of models, a more definite representation of the physical scenario. In addition, and in a similar manner, the Group is also analyzing climate projection data for North America.\n\nThe analyses performed on the physical scenarios considered both chronic phenomena and acute phenomena. Some of these phenomena require an additional level of complexity, as they do not only depend on climatic trends but also on the specific characteristics of the territory, and require an additional modelling activity for their high-resolution representation. For this reason, in addition to the climate scenarios provided by ICTP, the Group also uses Natural Hazard maps, which make it possible to obtain, with a high spatial resolution, the return times of a series of events, such as storms, hurricanes and floods. The use of these maps, as described in the section \u201cRisks and strategic opportunities related to climate change\u201d, is widely consolidated in the Group, which already uses this data based on a historical perspective to optimize the insurance strategies. Furthermore, work is under way in order to be able to use this information also when processed in compliance with the projections of the climate scenarios.\n\nItaly\n\nAcute phenomena: for Italy, the acute rainfall phenomenon was analyzed first, studying the variation of daily rainfall above the 95th percentile, calculated as average annual millimeters in the periods of reference. As shown in the figure below on the left, comparison of the period 2030-2050 with the historical period 1990-2020, in the RCP 2.6 scenario, suggests heavy rainfall will increase primarily in the north-east and along the Tyrrhenian coast significantly. Interestingly, again in RCP 2.6, this general increase in extreme rainfall is accompanied by a slight decrease in the annual sum of daily precipitation excluding acute rainfall (figure on the right). The same dichotomy between intense and average rainfall can also be observed in the other scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5).\n\n---\n\n(6) IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Working Group 1, \u201cLong-term Climate Change: Projections, Commitments and Irreversibility\u201d.\n(7) Climate Action Tracker Thermometer, global warming estimates for 2100 considering the current \u201cPolicies & Action\u201d and \u201c2030 Targets Only\u201d (updated as of November 2021).\nAcute rainfall and average rainfall (i.e., total rainfall net of acute rainfall): difference between RCP 2.6 (2030\u20132050) and historical values (2000\u20132020)\n\nAs already shown in the analyses previously published by the Group, heat waves and fire risk will also undergo important variations, both of which increase in the various climate scenarios considered. In particular, fire risk is described through the Fire Weather Index (FWI), a widely used indicator at international level that takes into account temperature, humidity, rain and wind in order to estimate a fire risk index. The data provided by the FWI can be useful in characterizing fire risk trends to support the business in managing it properly. The studies conducted, which examine the change in projections to 2030\u20132050 compared to 1990\u20132010, show that in all scenarios there is an increase in the number of high-risk days (index value > 45) in the summer season. This change mainly affects the islands and the southern regions of the country, where the increase in extreme risk days ranges from about +6 to +8 days compared to the historical period.\n\nChronic phenomena: chronic changes in temperature can be analyzed to obtain information on the potential effects on cooling and heating demand in local energy systems. Similar to what was done in 2020, Heating Degree Days (HDD) were used to measure heating requirements. This is the sum, extended to all days of the year with $T_{\\text{average}} \\leq 15 \\, ^\\circ\\text{C}$, of the differences between the indoor temperature ($T_{\\text{indoor}}$ assumed as 18 \u00b0C) and the average temperature, and the Cooling Degree Days (CDD), which is the sum, extended to all days of the year with $T_{\\text{average}} \\geq 24 \\, ^\\circ\\text{C}$, of the differences between the $T_{\\text{average}}$ and $T_{\\text{indoor}}$ (assumed as 21 \u00b0C), respectively for heating and cooling requirements. The analysis for Italy was refined both by increasing the number of models considered from 3 to 6, and by increasing the resolution of the data from about 50 km x 50 km to about 12 km x 12 km. Average country data were averaged over the nation, weighting each geographic node by population through the use of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) associated with each RCP scenario. A reduction in heating demand is predicted over the 2030\u20132050 period from 7 to 15% compared to the 2000\u20132020 period in the different scenarios, while CDDs are consistently higher than over the historical period, with an increasing trend from the RCP 2.6 (+~50%) to the RCP 8.5 (+~100%) scenario.\n\nWith regard to rainfall, variations in the basins of interest for the Group\u2019s hydroelectric generation were analyzed. From a preliminary analysis, no significant changes should emerge, with a general trend of slight decrease in Southern Italy and slight increase in Northern Italy in the RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5 scenarios.\nSpain\n\nAcute phenomena: as far as fire risk is concerned, the number of days at extreme risk (i.e. with Fire Weather Index > 45) is higher in the RCP 8.5 scenario than in the RCP 2.6 scenario, and always increasing compared to the historical average. In particular, the area of Spain that will see the greatest increase in the average number of days per year in the summer season characterized by high fire risk is the centre-south, in all future scenarios.\n\nIncrease in average number of days of high fire risk per year in summer under the various RCP scenarios compared with historical values (2000\u20132020)\n\nHeat waves, as already highlighted in the analyses published previously by the Group, will be more geographically widespread and more frequent in the period 2030\u20132050, especially in the southern part of the country.\n\nFinally, extreme precipitation will undergo variations in frequency in most of Spain. Taking into consideration the annual average millimeters related to rainy days with intensity greater than the ninety-fifth percentile, a preliminary analysis shows a reduction in some areas in the south of the country already in the RCP 2.6 scenario.\n\nChronic phenomena: analysis of potential cooling and heating demand has been refined and updated in a similar way to that for Italy. In terms of Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD), compared to the period 1990\u20132020, HDDs are estimated to decrease in all scenarios in the period 2030\u20132050, from -8% in RCP 2.6 to -17% in RCP 8.5. The data also confirm an increase in CDDs (+35%) in the RCP 2.6 scenario and a change of +58% and +81% in the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively.\n\nWith regard to rainfall, variations in the basins of interest for the Group\u2019s hydroelectric generation were analyzed. Comparing the period 2030\u20132050 with the period 1990\u20132009, data from a preliminary analysis do not show appreciable variations, with a general trend of slight decrease in southern Spain in all scenarios.\nLatin America\n\nAcute phenomena: in exceptionally large countries such as Brazil, acute phenomena can show significantly different trends in the various areas. In order to have an overview of the entire continent and identify the areas of greatest interest for further study, some acute phenomena have been analyzed using standard metrics. Analyses were conducted by processing data from an ensemble of 6 climate models with a spatial resolution of 25 km x 25 km.\n\nIn order to study the phenomenon of extreme temperatures, the \u201cWarm Spell Duration Index\u201d (WSDI) was used, which considers heat waves characterized by at least 6 consecutive days with a maximum daily temperature above the 90th percentile. Comparing the period 2030-2050 with the period 1990-2020, the data show a significant increase in days characterized by heat waves already in the RCP 2.6 scenario, especially in some areas of Brazil, Colombia, Peru and northern Chile. This increase in extreme temperatures will be even more pronounced in the other scenarios, especially RCP 8.5.\n\nFor extreme precipitation, daily rainfall above the 95th percentile was considered, similar to what was done for Italy and Spain. Future changes for this phenomenon are less homogeneous. In the RCP 2.6 scenario, in some areas, such as northern Brazil and northern Argentina, reductions are projected, while in other areas, such as western Colombia and some areas of Brazil and Peru, increases in extreme rainfall are expected.\n\nWarm Spell Duration Index (heat stress): difference between RCP (2030\u20132050) and historical values (2000\u20132020)\n\nChronic phenomena: for the main countries where Enel is present, a study was carried out on potential changes in heating and cooling demand related to chronic changes in temperature. Again, changes in Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) over the period 2030-2050, compared to the period 1990-2020, were calculated from data from 6 models, with a resolution of 25 km x 25 km. Average country data were averaged over the nation, weighting each geographic node by population through the use of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) associated with each RCP scenario. In each country studied, CDDs increase progressively in all scenarios: in the RCP 2.6 scenario they increase by 42% in Chile, while the increase is between 14% and 19% in the other countries examined. In the RCP 4.5 scenario, this increase becomes 108% for Chile and slightly more than 25% for Argentina, Brazil and Peru, while it stands at 20% for Colombia. The increase in CDDs with respect to the historical period is even more marked in the RCP 8.5 scenario. With regard to HDDs, in the RCP 2.6 scenario considerable reductions are estimated in Colombia (-51%), Brazil (-21%) and Peru (-15%). This trend intensifies in the RCP 4.5 scenario: ~-61% in Colombia, ~-28% in Brazil, and ~-20% in Peru.\nCDDs and HDDs in the countries of interest to the Group: difference between RCP 2.6 and historical values (2000-2020)\n\nWith regard to rainfall, variations in the basins of interest for the Group\u2019s hydroelectric generation were analyzed. Initial analyses comparing 2030-2050 projections in the three scenarios to the historical period 1990-2009 show a predominant trend of chronic rainfall reductions. The most significant average decreases are projected in Chile and Colombia, with values just below 10%. A closer look at the average data in Chile shows that in the basins considered, the expected rainfall in the period 2030-2050 is in line with that already experienced in the last decade (2010-2019). These data highlight how climate change is already being experienced in these basins compared to the historical period taken as a benchmark.\nThe strategy to tackle climate change\n\nThe sustainable strategy developed in recent years and the integrated business model have allowed the Group to create value for all stakeholders, benefiting from the opportunities that emerge from the energy transition and from climate action. In this context, capital employment is centered on decarbonization through the development of assets for generation from renewable sources, on enabling infrastructure linked to the development of networks, and on the adoption of platform models, fully exploiting technological and digital evolution which will favor consumption electrification and the development of new services for end customers. The aim is to accelerate the decarbonization and electrification processes to allow the global warming containment goals to be achieved in accordance with the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn the last decade, thanks to cost reductions renewables have become the dominant trend in power generation, allowing decarbonization to proceed at a faster pace. It has been a decade of profound changes in the power generation mix, destined to continue at an ever increasing speed. The next decade will be crucial to achieving the goals set in 2015 by the Paris Agreement. At the same time, this period will also be characterized by increasing support for electrification, through which customers gradually convert their energy consumption to the electricity carrier, with ensuing improvements in spending, efficiency, emissions and price stability.\n\nIn order to benefit fully from all the opportunities emerging from the market in which it operates, the Group has identified two different business models, Ownership and Stewardship, on which it can rely to achieve the defined ambitions. The most appropriate and effective business model is identified according to the countries and regions of interest and the context of operations:\n\n- the Ownership business model, in which the Group makes direct investments in renewables, networks and customers. This model is used when operating in countries where it can already leverage the entire value chain, from generation to integration with end customers. These countries are defined as \u201cTier 1\u201d, and include Italy, Spain and Romania in Europe and the USA, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru in the Americas;\n- the Stewardship business model, in which the Group invests capital in existing or newly established joint ventures or by acquiring minority shareholdings, in order to maximize the value of the know-how developed in the various businesses where it is present. This is done through the activation of specific contractual services.\ntowards the partners or also through the subsequent valuation of these shares of the assets on the market. This model focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on \u201cnon Tier 1\u201d countries, where the Group\u2019s presence is not integrated, and attempts are made to build partnerships with third parties to explore new countries and regions or to enhance the Group\u2019s operating experience in alternative contexts.\n\nThe strategy defined and the Group\u2019s positioning make it possible to affirm the commitment to anticipate the \u201cNet-Zero\u201d path by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040, for both direct and indirect emissions. Enel is committed to achieving a value of zero emissions, with no use of any carbon removal technology or nature-based solutions, in relation to the generation of energy and the sales of electricity and natural gas to end customers.\n\nA pathway based on the implementation of certain fundamental strategic stages:\n\n- accelerate the process of decarbonization of generation activities, gradually replacing the thermoelectric portfolio with new renewable capacity, as well as making use of the hybridization of renewables with storage solutions;\n- by 2040, generate 100% of the electricity sold by the Group from renewable sources and by the same year to exit the gas retail business.\n\n2030 vision\n\nEnel plans to put together 210 billion euros between 2021 and 2030. Of this amount, the Group plans to invest around 170 billion euros directly (up 6% on the previous Plan) through the Ownership (160 billion euros, primarily in Tier 1 countries) and Stewardship (10 billion euros) business models, with a further 40 billion euros catalyzed by the latter through third parties.\n\nThe approximately 160 billion euros through the Ownership business model, primarily in Tier 1 countries, will be dedicated:\n\n- to Renewables, almost half (around 70 billion euros), for which an increase of around 84 GW of capacity is expected, compared to 2020, of which 9 GW of storage, bringing the installed renewable capacity at consolidated level to 129 GW by 2030 and thus reaching 80% of the total installed capacity. This should be achieved by leveraging a growing pipeline of approximately 370 GW and more than doubling the one presented last year, together with three global platforms for Business Development, Engineering and Construction and Operation and Maintenance activities. These investments will make it possible to reach 80% of electricity generation from renewable sources in 2030;\n- a further investment of around 70 billion euros in the Infrastructure and Networks business, up by 10 billion euros compared to the previous Plan and concentrated in Europe, with the aim of strengthening the Group\u2019s position as a global operator in terms of size, quality, efficiency and resilience. This investment is expected to lead to a RAB (\u201cRegulatory Asset Base\u201d) of 65 billion euros in 2030, along with the complete digitalization of the entire network customer base through smart meters. The development of the Group\u2019s activities in this area will benefit from the adoption of \u201cGrid Blue Sky\u201d, a digital platform for managing grid portfolio assets as part of a unified global model that places the customer at the center of the value chain.\n\nThis capital allocation is expected to accelerate achieve-\nment of the Group\u2019s electrification and decarbonization goals. By 2030, the Enel Group expects to achieve a total managed renewable capacity of around 154 GW, tripling its portfolio at 2020, as well as to increase the network customer base by 12 million and promote the electrification of energy consumption, increasing the volumes of electricity sold by almost 30% while focusing on the development of \u201cbeyond commodity\u201d services, such as the enhancement of the charging network for electric mobility or those related to behind-the-meter storage and electric buses, in collaboration with a number of partners.\n\n2022-2024 Strategic Plan\n\nDuring 2022-2024, Enel plans to invest directly approximately 45 billion euros, of which 43 billion euros through the Ownership business model, mainly in the growth of grids and renewables, and approximately 2 billion euros under the Stewardship model, through capital injections acquisitions of minority interests, while at the same time putting together 8 billion euros from third parties. Of the Group\u2019s total investments planned under the Ownership and Stewardship models for 2022-2024, it is expected that:\n\n- **approximately 19 billion euros will be destined for Renewables**, particularly in countries where the Group benefits from an integrated business with end customers. The Group\u2019s total renewable capacity is expected to increase to 77 GW from the 53 GW installed at the end of 2021. As a result, zero-emission generation is estimated to reach 77% in 2024 and CO\u2082 emissions per kWh are expected to fall by more than 35% over the same period compared to 2021, positioning the Group towards achieving its \u201cNet-Zero\u201d targets on schedule;\n\n- **around 18 billion euros will be destined for the Infrastructure and Networks business**, up 12% on the previous Plan, as a result of increased investments in Europe, which are also expected to leverage the opportunities created by the National Recovery and Resilience Plans launched in the EU. As a result of these investments, which aim to improve network quality and resilience levels even further, the Group\u2019s RAB is estimated to reach 49 billion euros, up nearly 14% from 2021.\n\nAt Group level, ordinary EBITDA is expected to grow by 11% from 19.2 billion euros in 2021 to a figure of between 21.0 billion euros and 21.6 billion euros in 2024. The following factors are expected to contribute to the growth of the Group\u2019s ordinary EBITDA:\n\n- growth in Renewables is the main driver for the period, with an expected contribution of approximately 2.0 billion euros, out of a total contribution from the generation business of 2.9 billion euros. The evolution of the generation portfolio is expected to result in a 45% growth in Enel Green Power\u2019s EBITDA\u00ae over the Plan period, specifically from 6.0 billion euros in 2021 to 8.7 billion euros in 2024;\n\n- EBITDA for the Customers business is expected to grow by approximately 40% over the Plan period, reaching 4.9 billion euros in 2024 from 3.4 billion euros in 2021. This growth is driven by the Group\u2019s initiatives for an integrated strategy at commercial and generation capacity level, the contribution of electricity volumes in the free market and incremental needs for additional services;\n\n- EBITDA in the Infrastructure and Networks business is expected to increase by 16% from 7.7 billion euros in 2021 to 8.7 billion euros in 2024. The main growth drivers are the increase in RAB, driven by higher investments, efficiency programs, tariff increases due to indexing to inflation, especially in Latin America, and the increase in distributed energy volumes.\n\nThe investments connected to the decarbonization of the generation mix, together with those connected to digitalization and increasing the efficiency of the distribution grid, as well as the offer of new services for promoting the electrification of consumption (such as electric mobility services or demand response), will contribute toward combating climate change (SDG 13). Enel expects in fact that approximately 94% of the consolidated investments during 2022-24 will directly contribute toward this goal. Furthermore, it is estimated that these investments will be aligned with the criteria of EU Taxonomy, with a percentage in excess of 85%, considering the substantial contribution toward the mitigation of climate change.\n\n---\n\n(8) Including conventional generation business activities.\nMain risks and opportunities connected with climate change\n\nThe process of defining the Group\u2019s strategy is accompanied by a careful analysis of the risks and opportunities connected to it, also including the aspects related to climate change. Every year, before the Board of Directors examines the Strategic Plan, the Control and Risk Committee is presented with a quantitative analysis of the risks and opportunities related to the Group\u2019s strategic positioning, which includes aspects related to the climate, such as regulatory factors and weather and climate phenomena.\n\nIn order to identify the main types of risk and opportunity and their impact on the business associated with them in a structured manner consistent with the TCFD, we have adopted a framework that explicitly represents the main relationships between scenario variables and types of risk and opportunity, specifying the strategic and operational approaches to managing them, comprising mitigation and adaptation measures. Two main macro-categories of risks/opportunities are identified:\n\n- those connected with developments in physical variables;\n- those connected to the evolution of the transition scenarios.\n\nThe framework described is achieved in a perspective of overall consistent, which makes it possible to analyze and evaluate the impact of the physical and transition phenomena according to solid, alternative scenarios that were created using a quantitative and model-based approach in combination with continuous dialog both with internal stakeholders and with authoritative external references.\n\nThe framework also highlights the relationships that link the physical and transition scenarios with the potential impact on the Group\u2019s business. These effects can be assessed over three time horizons: the short-medium term (1-3 years), in which sensitivity analyses based on the Strategic Plan presented to investors in 2021 can be performed; medium-term (until 2029), in which it is possible to assess the effects of the energy transition; and long-term (2030-2050), in which chronic structural changes in the climate should begin to emerge.\n\n### Framework of main risks and opportunities\n\n| Scenario phenomena | Time horizon | Risk & opportunity category | Description | Impact | Management approach |\n|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|\n| Acute physical     | Starting with short term (1-3 years) | Extreme events | Risk: especially extreme weather/climate events. | Extreme events can damage assets and interrupt operations. | The Group adopts best practices to manage the restoration of service as quickly as possible. We also work to implement investments in resilience (e.g., the Italian case). With regard to risk assessment in insurance, the Group has a loss prevention program for property risk that also assesses the main exposures to natural events, supported by preventive maintenance activities and internal risk management policies. Looking forward, the assessments will also include the potential impacts of long-term trends in the most significant climate variables. |\n| Chronic physical   | Starting with long term (2030-2050) | Market | Risk/opportunity: increase or decrease in electricity demand; increase or decrease in output. | Electricity demand is also affected by temperature, whose fluctuation can impact our business. Renewables generation can also be impacted by structural changes in resource availability. | The Group\u2019s geographical and technological diversification means that the impact of changes (positive and negative) in a single variable is mitigated at the global level. In order to ensure that operations always take account of weather and climate phenomena, the Group adopts a range of practices such as, for example, weather forecasting, real-time monitoring of plants and long-term climate scenarios to identify any chronic changes in renewable source availability. |\nIn order to facilitate the proper identification and management of risks and opportunities related to climate change, a Group policy was published in 2021 that describes common guidelines for assessing these risks and opportunities. The \u201cClimate change risks and opportunities\u201d policy defines a shared approach for the integration of climate change and energy transition issues into the Group\u2019s processes and activities, thus informing industrial and strategic choices to improve business resilience and long-term sustainable value creation, consistent with the adaptation and mitigation strategy. The main steps considered in the policy are as follows:\n\n- **Prioritizing of phenomena and scenario analysis.** These activities include the identification of physical and transition phenomena relevant to the Group and the consequent development of scenarios to be considered and developed through analysis and processing of data from internal and external sources. Functions can be developed for the phenomena identified that link the scenarios (e.g. data on the change in renewable resources) to business operations (e.g. the change in potential output);\n\n- **Impact assessment.** Includes all analyses and activities necessary to quantify the effects at the operational, economic and financial levels, depending on the processes into which these are integrated (e.g. design of new constructions, evaluation of operational performances, etc.);\n\n- **Operational and strategic actions.** Information from previous activities is integrated into processes, informing Group decisions and business activities. Examples of activities and processes that benefit are capital allocation, e.g. for evaluating investments on existing assets or new projects; defining resilience plans, risk management and financing activities and Engineering and Business Development activities.\n\nThe following will describe the main sources of risks and opportunities identified, operational best practices for managing weather and climate phenomena, and qualitative and quantitative impact assessments conducted to\n\n| Scenario phenomena | Time horizon | Risk & opportunity category | Description | Impact | Management approach |\n|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|\n| Transition         | Starting with short term (1-3 years) | Policy & Regulation | Risk/opportunity: policies on CO2, prices and emissions, energy transition incentives, greater scope for investment in renewables and resilience. | Policies concerning the energy transition and resilience can impact the volume of and returns on investments. | The Group is minimizing its exposure to risks through the progressive decarbonization of its generation fleet. The Group\u2019s strategic actions, which are focused on investment in renewables, grids and customers, enable us to mitigate potential threats and exploit the opportunities connected with the energy transition. The Group is also actively contributing to the formation of public policies through its advocacy efforts. These activities are conducted within platforms for dialogue with stakeholders called \u201cEnergy Transition Roadmaps\u201d that explore national decarbonization scenarios in the various countries in which Enel operates in environmental, economic and social terms. |\n| Transition         | Starting with medium term (2025-2029) | Market | Risk/opportunity: changes in the prices of commodities and energy, evolution of energy mix, changes in retail consumption, changes in competitive environment. | Considering two alternative transition scenarios, the Group assesses the impact of rising trends in the proportion of renewable sources in the energy mix and the electrification of final energy consumption. | The Group is maximizing opportunities by adopting a strategy founded on the energy transition, the electrification of energy consumption and rapid growth in renewables output. |\n| Transition         | Starting with medium term (2025-2029) | Product & Services | Opportunity: increase in margins and greater scope for investment as a consequence of the transition in terms of greater penetration of electrical transport and new technologies for the electrification and energy efficiency of final consumption. | Considering two alternative transition scenarios, the Group assesses the impact of different trends in the electrification of energy consumption. | The Group is maximizing opportunities thanks to its strong positioning in new businesses and \u201cbeyond commodity\u201d services. |\n| Transition         | Starting with medium term (2025-2029) | Technology | With the current trend in the penetration of electrification efficiency technologies, the Group considers two alternative transition scenarios to assess opportunities to scale up current businesses. | The Group is maximizing opportunities thanks to its strong positioning in global networks. |\ndate. All of the above activities are performed throughout the year through an ongoing effort to analyze, evaluate and manage the information processed. As TCFD states, the process of disclosing risks and opportunities related to climate change will be gradual and incremental from year to year.\n\n**Identification, assessment and management of risks and opportunities related to physical phenomena**\n\nChronic physical risks: the main impacts of chronic physical changes can produce similar effects on the following variables:\n\n- **electricity demand**: variation in the average temperature level with a potential increase or reduction in electricity demand;\n- **thermal generation**: variation in the level and average temperatures of the oceans and rivers, with effects on thermal generation;\n- **hydroelectric generation**: variation in the average level of rainfall and snowfall and temperatures with a potential increase and/or reduction in hydroelectric generation;\n- **solar generation**: variation in the average level of solar radiation, temperature and rainfall with a potential increase or reduction in solar generation;\n- **wind generation**: variation in the average wind level with a potential increase or reduction in wind generation.\n\nThe Group will work to estimate the relationships between changes in physical variables and the change in the potential output of individual plants in the different categories of generation technology. As part of the assessment of the effects of long-term climate change, chronic events relevant to each technology were identified and analyses of their impacts on manufacturability were initiated.\n\n| Event | Rain/snow | Wind | Sunshine | Sea level | Air temperature | River/sea temperature |\n|-------|-----------|------|----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Thermal | ![Thermal](image) | ![Thermal](image) | ![Thermal](image) | ![Thermal](image) | ![Thermal](image) | ![Thermal](image) |\n| Solar | ![Solar](image) | ![Solar](image) | ![Solar](image) | ![Solar](image) | ![Solar](image) | ![Solar](image) |\n| Wind | ![Wind](image) | ![Wind](image) | ![Wind](image) | ![Wind](image) | ![Wind](image) | ![Wind](image) |\n| Hydro | ![Hydro](image) | ![Hydro](image) | ![Hydro](image) | ![Hydro](image) | ![Hydro](image) | ![Hydro](image) |\n| Storage | ![Storage](image) | ![Storage](image) | ![Storage](image) | ![Storage](image) | ![Storage](image) | ![Storage](image) |\n| Geothermal | ![Geothermal](image) | ![Geothermal](image) | ![Geothermal](image) | ![Geothermal](image) | ![Geothermal](image) | ![Geothermal](image) |\n| Infrastructure and Networks | ![Infrastructure and Networks](image) | ![Infrastructure and Networks](image) | ![Infrastructure and Networks](image) | ![Infrastructure and Networks](image) | ![Infrastructure and Networks](image) | ![Infrastructure and Networks](image) |\n| Enel X | ![Enel X](image) | ![Enel X](image) | ![Enel X](image) | ![Enel X](image) | ![Enel X](image) | ![Enel X](image) |\n\n*Priority: High, Low, Not material*\nThe initial scenario analysis has shown that chronic structural changes in the recent trends of physical variables will begin to occur in a considerable manner starting from 2030. However, in order to obtain an indicative estimate of the potential impacts, and include the possibility of the early onset of chronic effects, it is possible to test sensitivity of the Industrial Plan to the factors potentially influenced by the physical scenario, regardless of any direct relationship with climate variables. Of course, such stress testing has an extremely low probability of occurrence based on historical events and geographical diversification. The variables examined were: electricity demand (+/- 1% per year), whose variations can potentially impact the generation and retail businesses. It was stress tested for all countries in which the Group operates; the output potential of renewables plants was also stressed (+/- 10% over a single year). Variations in this variable can potentially impact the generation business. It was stressed separately at the individual technology level around the globe. The data reported show the effect on a single year for a single generation technology and include both the volume and price effects.\n\n| Scenario phenomena | Risk & opportunity category | Description | Time horizon | Impact | GBL affected | Scope | Quantification - Type of impact | Upside/Downside | Quantification - range |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------|--------------|-------|--------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Chronic physical   | Market                      | Increased or decreased power demand. | Short       | Electricity demand is also influenced by temperature, the fluctuations of which can have an impact on the business. Although structural changes should not occur in the short-medium term, to assess the sensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to potential temperature changes, sensitivity analyses are conducted with respect to changes in electricity demand of +/- 1% of the Group total. | Group | EBITDA/year | +1% | Upside scenario current policies | \u20ac100 mn - \u20ac300 mn |\n| Chronic physical   | Market                      | Increased or decreased renewables output | Short       | Renewables output is also influenced by the availability of resources whose fluctuations can have an impact on the business. Although structural changes should not occur in the short-medium term, to assess the sensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to potential temperature changes, sensitivity analyses are conducted with respect to changes in potential output of +/- 10% per year by individual technology. | Group | EBITDA/year | +10% | Upside scenario current policies | \u20ac100 mn - \u20ac300 mn |\n\nThe path to Net-Zero\nPreliminary analysis of the impact of chronic climate change on renewable generation\n\nPreliminary analyses were carried out to translate chronic climate change into impacts on manufacturability for the Group\u2019s main RES technologies: wind, solar and hydroelectric.\n\nTwo pilot sites were selected for each technology, based on country and region and availability of historical site data, for which a link function was calculated from the observed data to translate trends in climate variables into information on generation. This function was then applied to climate projection data to estimate the difference in potential output in 2030-2050 compared to the historical period.\n\nWe report below the results obtained from these initial analyses on the pilot sites.\n\n| Pilot sites | Input parameters | Results |\n|-------------|------------------|---------|\n| Site 1      | Climate variables used to calculate link function: wind speed, air density | Site 1: output in line with historical trend in RCP 2.6 scenario and down slightly in RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios |\n|             | Time step: monthly | Site 2: output stable in RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5 scenarios and up slightly in RCP 8.5 scenario |\n|             | Time horizon: 2030-2050 vs. historical | |\n| Site 2      | Climate variables used to calculate link function: Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), temperature | No material changes for the business at either of the plants examined |\n|             | Time step: daily | |\n|             | Time horizon: 2030-2050 vs. historical | |\n| Watershed 1 | Climate variables used to calculate link function: precipitation, temperature | For both areas, average output is unchanged in RCP 2.6 scenario but declines slightly in RCP 8.5 scenario |\n| Watershed 2 | Time step: monthly | |\n|             | Time horizon: 2030-2050 vs. historical | |\n\nSlight increase or slight decrease means a change that does not exceed +/- 5%.\n\nAcute physical risks\n\nWith regard to acute physical phenomena (extreme events), their intensity and frequency can cause significant and unexpected physical damage to assets and generate negative externalities associated with the interruption of service.\n\nWithin the scope of scenarios regarding climate change, the acute physical component continues playing an extremely important role when defining the risks to which the Group is exposed, both due to the wide geographical diversification of its asset portfolio and due to the primary importance of the renewable natural resources for the generation of electricity.\n\nIn the various cases, the acute physical phenomena such as wind storms, floods, heat waves, severe cold, etc., demonstrate a high level of intensity yet do not have a very high occurrence frequency in the short term, but, considering the medium and long-term climatic scenarios, this will increase considerably in the future.\n\nHence, for the reasons described above, the Group is currently managing the risk deriving from extreme events in the short term. At the same time, it is extending its methodology also to longer time periods (until 2050) according to the identified climate change scenarios (RCP 8.5, 4.5 and 2.6).\nMethodology for evaluating the risk of extreme events\n\nIn order to quantify the risk deriving from extreme events, the Group refers to a consolidated methodology for analyzing the catastrophic risk used in the insurance sector and in IPCC reports\\(^9\\). Through its own insurance business units and the captive insurance company Enel Insurance NV, the Group is managing the various phases connected to risks deriving from natural catastrophes: from the assessment and quantification to the corresponding coverage to minimize the impacts. The methodology applies to all extreme events that can be analyzed, such as wind storms, heat waves, tropical cyclones, floods, etc. In all of these types of natural catastrophes, however, three independent factors can be identified that are summarized below.\n\n- **The probability of the event** (\"Hazard\"), that is, its theoretical frequency over a specific period of time: the \"return time\". In other words, a catastrophic event that has a return time of 250 years, for example, implies that it can be associated with a probability of 0.4% that it will occur in a year. This information, which is necessary for assessing the frequency of the event, is then associated with its geographical distribution with respect to the various areas where portfolio assets are located. For this purpose, the Group uses \"hazard maps\" which associate, for the various types of natural catastrophes, each geographical points on the global map with the corresponding estimate of the frequency associated with the extreme event. This information, which is organized in geo-referenced databases, can be provided by global reinsurance companies, meteorological consultancy companies or academic institutions.\n\n- **The vulnerability**, that, in percentage terms, indicates how much value is lost and/or damaged upon occurrence of the catastrophic event. In more specific terms, therefore, it is possible to refer to the damage to the material assets the impact on the continuity of generation and/or distribution of electricity, and also the provision of the electric services offered to the end customer.\n\nThe Group creates and promotes specific vulnerability analyses, especially in the case of damage to its assets, related to every technology in its portfolio: solar, wind, hydroelectric power plants, transmission and distribution grids, primary and secondary substations, etc. These analyses are then, of course, focused on the extreme events that have greater impact on the various types of technology; as a result, this defines a matrix that associates the individual natural catastrophic events with the corresponding type of asset that is impacted in a considerable manner.\n\n- **The exposure**, which is the set of economic values in the Group portfolio that can be considerably impacted by the occurrence of natural catastrophic events. Also in this case, the scopes of the analyses are specific to the various generation technologies, for the generation assets and for the services to the end customer.\n\nThe combination of the three factors described above (hazard, vulnerability and exposure) provide the fundamental element for assessing the risk deriving from extreme events. From this point of view, the Group differentiates the risk analysis with respect to the climate change scenarios, depending on the specific nature of the various associated time periods. The following table summarizes the scheme adopted for the evaluation of impacts deriving from acute physical phenomena.\n\n| Time horizon | Hazards | Vulnerability | Exposure |\n|--------------|---------|---------------|----------|\n| Short term (1-3 years) | Hazard maps based on historical data and meteorological models | Vulnerability, being related to the type of extreme event, to the specifics of the damage type and to the technical requirements of the technology under consideration, Vulnerability is essentially independent of time horizons | Group values in the short term |\n| Long term (at 2050 and/or 2100) | Hazard maps and specific studies for different IPCC RCP climate scenarios | | Long-term evolution of Group values |\n\n\\(^9\\) Wilson, L. \"Industrial Safety and Risk Management\".

It is possible to distinguish two main types of actions: defining an effective insurance coverage and the various activities related to preventing damage that could result from extreme events.\n\nThe main components of these actions are described below and, in the case of activities related to preventing and mitigating the damage, specific reference is made to the Group\u2019s Generation and Infrastructure and Networks Global Business Lines.\n\n**Impacts of acute physical events on the Group**\n\nThe Enel Group has a well-diversified portfolio in terms of technologies, country and regional distribution and asset size. Consequently, the exposure of the portfolio to natural risks is also diversified. The Group implements various risk mitigation measures which, as will be described below, include both insurance coverage and other managerial and operational actions aimed at further reducing the Company\u2019s risk profile.\n\nIndeed, empirical evidence shows negligible repercussions of such risks, as demonstrated by data for the last 5 years. Considering the most relevant events, defined as those with a gross impact >10 million euros, the cumulative value of the gross impact amounts to ~270 million euros, which represents less than 0.14% of the Group\u2019s insured values as of 2022, or ~202 billion euros, most of which are recovered through insurance pay-outs.\n\n**Enel Group insurance**\n\nEvery year, the Group defines global insurance programs for its business in the various countries where it operates. The two main programs, in terms of scope of coverage and volumes, are as follows:\n\n- **the Property Program** for material damage that can be caused to the assets and the resulting interruption in business. Therefore, in addition to the cost for the new reconstruction of the asset (or its parts), also the economic losses due to their shutdown in terms of generation and/or distribution of electricity are also remunerated according to the limits and conditions defined in the policies;\nthe Liability Program, which covers third party damage following the impacts that extreme events can have on the assets and on the Group\u2019s business.\n\nStarting from an effective assessment of the risk, suitable limits and insurance conditions can be defined in the insurance policies and this also applies in the case of natural extreme events related to climate change. In fact, in this latter case, the impacts on business can be considerable but, as shown in cases that occurred in the past and in various areas around the world, the Group has shown absolute resilience thanks to the wide insurance coverage limits, which are also the result of a solid reinsurance structure, as regards the Group\u2019s captive company Enel Insurance NV.\n\nClimate change adaptation activities in the Enel Group\n\nThe Group adopts solutions for adaptation to weather and climate events in order to manage effectively chronic and acute phenomena of interest for each activity and Business Line. Adaptation solutions may concern both actions implemented in short-term and long-term decision making, such as the planning of investments in response to climate phenomena. Adaptation activities also include procedures, policies and best practices.\n\nFor new investments, action can also be taken early in the design and construction phase to reduce the impact of climate risks by through risk and vulnerability assessments at the design stage, and to take any chronic effects into account (e.g. the inclusion of climate scenarios in long-term renewable resource estimates).\n\nOnce the weather and climate phenomena of interest have been identified, activities carried out to maximize adaptive capacity can be classified as follows:\n\n- prevention and management of adverse events: procedures to prepare in advance for extreme events (e.g. the acquisition of short-term weather forecast data and training) and procedures to restore normal activities in the shortest possible period of time (e.g. the establishment of operational and organizational procedures to be implemented in case of critical events);\n- enhancement of asset resilience: activities and interventions aimed at increasing the resilience of assets, such as the quantitative assessment of potential acute and chronic risks to define better both requirements in the design phase and actions to be taken on existing assets.\n\nThe following table shows a high-level summary that represents the type of actions that Enel implements for proper management of adverse events and to increase resilience to weather phenomena and their evolution due to climate change. Several activities are described in greater detail below.\n\n| Business Lines | A. Prevention and management of adverse events | B. Enhancement of asset resilience |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation | Existing assets | Existing assets |\n| | 1 - Incident and critical event management | 1 - Guidelines for risk assessment and design of hydraulic technology |\n| | 2 - Site-specific emergency management plans and procedures | 2 - \u2018Lessons learned feedback\u2019 processes from O&M towards E&C and BD |\n| | 3 - Specific tools for predicting imminent extreme events | New constructions |\n| | | In addition to what has been done for existing assets: |\n| | | 1 - Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) included in environmental impact documents (pilot) |\n| Global Infrastructure and Networks | Existing assets | Existing assets and new constructions |\n| | 1 - Strategies and guidelines on Risk Prevention, Readiness, Response, Recovery actions on distribution network | 1 - Guidelines for defining network resilience enhancement plans (e.g. the e-distribuzione \u201cNetwork Resilience Enhancement Plan\u201d) |\n| | 2 - Global Infrastructure and Networks guidelines for emergency and critical event management | |\n| | 3 - Risk prevention and preparedness measures in the event of fire on electrical installations (lines, transformers, etc.) | |\n| Enel X | Existing assets | Existing assets |\n| | 1 - Enel X Critical Event Management | 1 - e-Mobility: Continuous Improvement program |\n| | 2 - e-Mobility: guidelines for maintenance and monitoring of assets (repair or replacement of charging infrastructure) | |\nAdaptation activities \u2013 generation\nWith regard to generation, over time the Group has carried out targeted actions on specific sites and established ad hoc management activities and processes.\nActions on specific sites in recent years include, for example:\n\u2022 improving cooling water management systems for certain plants in order to counter the problems caused by the decline in water levels in rivers, such as the Po in Italy;\n\u2022 installing fogging systems to improve the flow of inlet air and offset the reduction in power output caused by the increase in ambient temperature in CCGTs;\n\u2022 installing drainage pumps, raising embankments, periodic cleaning of canals and interventions to consolidate land adjacent to plants to prevent landslides in order to mitigate flood risks;\n\u2022 periodic site-specific reassessment for the hydroelectric plants for flood scenarios using numeric simulations. The processed scenarios are managed with mitigation actions and through interventions on the civil works, dams and intake systems.\n\nThe Group performs various control activities to manage the impact of weather events on electricity generation, such as:\n\u2022 weather forecasting both to monitor renewable resource availability and detect extreme events, with warning systems to ensure the protection of people and assets;\n\u2022 hydrological simulations, territory surveys (also using drones), monitoring of possible vulnerabilities using digital GIS systems (Geographic Information System) and satellite measurements;\n\u2022 advanced monitoring of more than 100 thousand parameters (with more than 160 million historical measurements) detected on dams and hydroelectric civil works;\n\u2022 real-time remote monitoring power plants;\n\u2022 safe rooms in areas exposed to tornadoes and hurricanes;\n\u2022 adoption of specific guidelines for carrying out hydrological and hydraulic studies that are targeted, from the first development phases, toward assessing risks inside the plant and toward areas external of the plant, with the application of the principle of hydraulic invariance during the design of the draining and mitigation works;\n\u2022 check of potential climatic trends for the main project parameters in order to keep the dimensioning of the systems into account for relevant projects (for example, assessments of the temperature of a cold source to guarantee greater flexibility for cooling the new CCGT) and specific civil works (e.g. rainfall assessments for the design of drainage systems in solar plants);\n\u2022 estimate of extreme wind speed using updated databases containing the registers and historical trajectories of hurricanes and tropical storms, with the resulting selection of the wind turbine technology that is best suited to the conditions that were found.\n\nAdaptation activities \u2013 Infrastructure & Networks\nIn order to deal with extreme climatic events, in the Infrastructure & Networks Business Line, the Enel Group has adopted an approach called \u201c4R\u201d which, in a dedicated policy that aims to ensure an innovative strategy for the resilience of distribution networks, defines the measures to be adopted in the phase of preparation for an emergency on the network and to ensure swift restoration of services ex post, i.e. once the climatic events have caused damage to assets and/or disconnections. The 4R strategy is divided into four phases:\n1. Risk Prevention: includes actions that make it possible to reduce the probability of losing grid elements due to an event and/or to minimize its effects, such as interventions able to increase the robustness of the infrastructure and maintenance operations;\n2. Readiness: comprises all measures that aim to improve the timeliness with which potentially critical events are identified, ensuring coordination with the Civil Protection Department and local officials, as well as to prepare the necessary resources once a grid disconnection has occurred;\n3. Response: represents the phase for assessing the operating capacity for facing an emergency when an extreme event occurs, which is directly correlated to the ability to mobilize operating resources in the field and the possibility to perform remote controlled operations to restore service via resilient backup connections;\n4. Recovery: the final phase which has the goal of reconnecting the grid as soon as possible with ordinary operating conditions, in the cases in which an extreme weather event cause interruptions in service in spite of the previously adopted measures for increasing resilience.\n\nFollowing this approach, the Business Line has prepared various policies on specific actions aimed at dealing with the various aspects and risks inherent in climate change, in particular:\n\u2022 Policy for preparation and recovery during emergencies: a policy related to the last three steps of the 4R approach which indicates the guidelines and measures targeted toward improving the preparation strategies, mitigating the impact of total interruptions and, finally, restoring service to the largest number of customers possible as quickly as possible.\n\u2022 **Guidelines on the Electricity Grid Resilience Plan**: a dedicated policy has the objective of identifying the extraordinary climatic events with the greatest impact on the grid, assessing specific KPIs of the \u201cas-is\u201d grid and improving them on the basis of proposed actions in order to finally assess their order of priority. This makes it possible to select the actions that, when implemented, minimize the impact on the grid of particularly critical extreme events in a certain area/region. The policy is therefore set in the first two phases of the 4R approach, suggesting measures regarding Risk Prevention and Readiness. In Italy, this policy translates into the Resilience Plan that e-distribuzione has prepared every year since 2017, and which represents and addendum to the Development Plan that includes ad hoc investments over a 3 year period that aim to reduce the impact of extreme events belonging to a certain critical cluster: heat waves, ice loads and wind storms (falling of tall trees). Around 520 million euros were invested in the period 2017-2020 and a further 345 million euros will also be used in the following three years, as explained in the addendum to the 2021-2023 Plan. In the face of these risks, investments have been planned such as the targeted replacement of bare conductors with insulated cable, in some cases the burying of cables, or solutions that provide re-powering routes that are not vulnerable to the above-mentioned phenomena. As in Italy, in other countries, too, both in Europe and in Latin America, similar topics are being analyzed so as to prepare a process for planning ad hoc investments;\n\n\u2022 **Policy on prevention and preparation of fire risk on electrical installations**: a policy dedicated to fire risk defines an integrated approach to emergency management applied to forest fires, both in cases in which they are started by events exogenous to the networks and in cases, albeit very minor, in which they are caused by the networks themselves and, in any case, are potentially dangerous for Enel plants.\n\n\u2022 **Adoption of systems for weather forecasting, grid monitoring** and assessing the impact of critical climate phenomena on the grid, preparation of operational plans and organization of special exercises. During 2021, we further investigated heat waves in other countries where Enel is present, and these already provided the first results for the Italy perimeter in 2020. This critical event is characterized by the persistence for several days of high temperatures along with the absence of precipitation and, by hindering heat dissipation of underground cable lines, it causes an abnormal increase in the risk of multiple failures on the networks, especially in urban areas and in the centers of summer tourism. In Spain, in particular, despite the increase in the frequency and intensity of the climate phenomenon, especially where the presence of buried cables is relatively low, the analyses conducted to date have not found any significant historical correlation between heat waves and failures. Finally, beginning 2022, evaluations are planned to conduct similar analyses in other countries and regions.\n\n### Inclusion of climate change effects in the evaluation of new projects\n\nMany activities related to the evaluation and implementation of new projects can benefit from climate analyses, both general and site-specific, which the Group is beginning to integrate with those already considered in the evaluation of new projects. For example:\n\n\u2022 **Preliminary studies**: in this stage, climate data can offer preliminary screening, through the analysis of specific climate phenomena, such as those shown above in the analysis of physical scenarios, and summary indicators such as the Climate Risk Index, integrated into the Open Country Risk. These data provide a preliminary measure of the most relevant phenomena in the area, among those identified as being of interest for each technology.\n\n\u2022 **Estimation of potential output**: climate scenarios will be progressively integrated to allow for an assessment of how climate change will modify the availability of the renewable resource at the specific site. In the preliminary analysis of the impact of chronic climate change on renewable power generation, the approach applied for the moment on a few pilot sites and then scaled to the entire generation portfolio is described.\n\n\u2022 **Environmental impact analysis**: the Group has begun to integrate the Climate Change Risk Assessment into the set of documentation produced, which contains a representation of the main physical phenomena and their expected change in the area.\n\n\u2022 **Resilient design**: as described above, among the climate change adaptation activities, those aimed at devising resilient assets by design take on great importance. The Group is working to consider progressively analyses based on climate data, for example the increase in frequency and intensity of acute events. These will complement existing analyses based on historical data already in use, in order to increase the resilience of future assets, including any adaptation actions that may be required over the life of the project.\nIdentification, assessment and management of risks and opportunities related to transition phenomena\n\nAs regards the risks and opportunities associated with transition variables, we consider the different reference scenarios in combination with the elements that make up the risk identification process (e.g. competitive context, long-term vision of the industry, materiality analysis, technological evolution etc.) to identify the drivers of potential risks and opportunities, with priority on events with greater relevancy. The key risks and opportunities identified are:\n\n**Policy and regulation**\n\n- **Emissions caps and carbon pricing**: the enactment of laws and regulations that introduce more stringent emissions limits for both non-market driven and market-based mechanisms, such as a carbon tax in non-ETS (Emissions Trading System) sectors or an expansion of the ETS into other sectors.\n  - **Opportunities**: Command&Control regulations and market-based mechanisms strengthening CO\u2082 price signals to foster investment in carbon-free technologies.\n  - **Risks**: lack of a coordinated approach among the various actors and policy-makers involved and limited effectiveness of the policy instruments deployed, with an impact on the speed of the trend toward electrification and decarbonization in the various sectors, compared with a decisive group strategy focused on the energy transition.\n\n- **Incentives for the energy transition**: development incentives and opportunities with a view to the energy transition, consequently guiding the energy system toward the use of low-emission energy resources as the mainstream approach in the energy mixes of countries, greater electrification of energy consumption, energy efficiency, flexibility of the electrical system and upgrading of infrastructure, with a positive impact on the return on investment and new business opportunities.\n  - **Opportunities**: additional volumes and greater margins due to additional investment in the electricity industry, in line with the electrification strategy, decarbonization and the upgrading/digitalization of enabling infrastructure.\n  - **Risks**: obstacles to achieving energy transition targets due to regulatory systems that do not effectively support the energy transition, delays in permitting processes, no upgrading of the electricity grid, etc.\n\n- **Resilience regulation**: improvement of standards or introduction of ad hoc mechanisms to regulate investments in resilience in the context of the evolution of climate change.\n  - **Opportunities**: benefits from investments that reduce service quality and continuity risks for the community.\n  - **Risks**: in the case of especially severe extreme events with a greater-than-expected impact, there is a risk of failure to recover within an adequate timeframe and consequently a risk to Enel\u2019s reputation.\n\n- **Financial measures for the energy transition**: incentives for the energy transition through appropriate policy measures and financial instruments, which should be capable of supporting an investment framework and a long-term, credible and stable positioning of policy-makers. Introduction of rules and/or public and private financial instruments (e.g. funds, mechanisms, taxonomies, benchmarks) aimed at integrating sustainability into financial markets and public finance instruments.\n  - **Opportunities**: the creation of new markets and sustainable finance products consistent with the investment framework, activating greater public resources for decarbonization and access to financial resources in line with energy transition objectives and the related impact on costs and on finance charges; introduction of subsidised support tools (funds and calls) for the transition.\n  - **Risks**: actions and instruments not sufficient to provide incentives consistent with an overall positioning tailored to the energy transition, uncertainty or slowdown in the introduction of new instruments and rules due to the deterioration in the public finances or differences in application in the geographic areas in which the Group operates.\n\n**Market**\n\n- **Market dynamics**: the market dynamics such as those connected with the variability of commodity prices, the increase in electricity consumption due to the energy transition and the penetration of renewables, have an impact on business drivers, with effects on margins and on generation and sales volumes.\n  - **Opportunities**: positive effects associated with the growth in electricity demand and the greater room for renewables and all sources of flexibility.\nTechnology\n\n- **Technology penetration to support the transition**: gradual penetration of new technologies such as storage, demand response and green hydrogen; digital lever for transforming operating models and \u201cplatform\u201d business models.\n- **Opportunities**: investments in the development of technology solutions, as well as positive impacts from increased electricity demand and increased room for renewables from green hydrogen generation.\n- **Risks**: slowdowns and interruptions to the raw materials supply chain, including metals for batteries (such as lithium, nickel and cobalt) and semiconductors, could lead to delays in procurement and/or increased costs, such as to slow down the penetration of renewables, storage and electric vehicles.\n\nProducts and services\n\n- **Electrification of residential consumption**: with the gradual electrification of end uses, the penetration of products with lower costs and a smaller impact in terms of residential emissions will expand (for example, the use of heat pumps for heating and cooling).\n- **Opportunities**: increase in electrical consumption in the context of reducing energy consumption, thanks to the improved efficiency of the electric carrier.\n- **Risks**: additional competition in this market segment.\n\n- **Electric mobility**: use of more efficient and effective modes of transportation from the point of view of climate change, with a special focus on the development of electric mobility and charging infrastructure; electrification of large-scale industrial consumers.\n- **Opportunities**: positive effects of the increase in electricity demand and greater margins connected with the penetration of electric transportation and the relative beyond commodity services.\n- **Risks**: additional competition in this market segment.\n\nUnlike chronic climate impacts, developments in the transition scenario could have impacts in the short and medium-long term (by 2030) as well.\n\nTo quantify the risks and opportunities deriving from the energy transition in the long term, two transition scenarios, described in the paragraph \u201cClimate scenarios\u201d. The effects of Slow Transition and Best Place scenarios have therefore been identified on the variables that can have the greatest impact on the business, in particular electricity demand, influenced by the dynamics of electrification of consumption, and therefore of penetration of electrical technologies and the electricity generation mix.\n\nEnel\u2019s reference scenario \u2013 the Paris scenario \u2013 entails a growing ambition in terms of decarbonization and energy efficiency, supported by greater electrification of final energy consumption and the development of renewable capacity. The dynamics related to the energy transition will bring increasing opportunities to the Group. In particular, in the retail electricity market, the progressive electrification of final consumption \u2013 especially for transport and the residential sector \u2013 will lead to a considerable increase in electrical consumption to the detriment of other, more high-emissions energy carriers. Similarly, the gradual increase in the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix is expected to lead to a reduction in the wholesale price of electricity in the medium to long term. However, this impact is limited, given that the market design based on the system marginal price is unchanged in the medium term. Possible alternative market structures could induce different effects.\n\nIn reference to the economic impacts that may result from the change in the transition scenarios, the Group has performed some analyses regarding impacts in terms of EBIT-DA that the Slow Transition and Best Place scenarios would bring to the 2030 results compared to the baseline Paris scenario.\n\nWith reference to the electrification of consumption, the Slow Transition scenario encompasses lower penetration rates of the most efficient electric technologies, in particular electric cars and heat pumps, causing a decrease in electricity demand compared to the Paris scenario, which is estimated to cause limited impacts on the retail commodity business & beyond. At the same time, lower electricity demand results in less development space for renewable capacity, with impacts on the generation business.\n\nWith reference to the Best Place scenario, a more rapid reduction in the cost of green hydrogen generation technologies is assumed. This results in a higher penetration of this energy carrier, at the expense of blue and gray hydrogen, with a consequent additional effect on domestic electricity demand and renewable capacity installations compared to the Paris scenario.\n\nFor the different countries and regions, all scenarios, but to a greater extent the Paris and Best Place scenarios, will involve a considerable increase in the complexities that will have to be managed by the grids. A significant increase is expected in fact in distributed generation and in other resources, such as storage systems, greater penetration of electric mobility with the relative charging infrastructures, as well as the increasing rate of electrification of consumption and the introduction of new actors with new methods of consumption. This context will involve a decentralization of the extraction/feed-in points, an increase in electric de-\nmand and the average requested power, a considerable variation in energy flows, which will require dynamic and flexible grid management. The Group therefore expects that in this scenario incremental investments will be necessary to guarantee the connections and suitable levels of quality and resilience, by promoting the adoption of inno-\n\n| Risk & opportunity category | Time horizon | Scope of analysis | GBL affected | Geographic scope | Description of impact | Quantification - range | Quantification - Type of impact |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Policy & Regulation         | Short/ Medium| For any given Paris scenario, the Group has assessed the impact on performance of actions to modify the price of CO\u2082. | Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation | Italy and Iberia | Considering the potential impact of regulatory measures to incentivize energy transition, the Group assesses the exposure to changes of +/- 10% in the price of CO\u2082 using sensitivity analysis. | \u20ac100 mn - \u20ac300 mn | EBITDA/year |\n| Market                      | Medium       | Considering two alternative transition scenarios, the Group assessed the impact of an increase in the penetration of renewables on the benchmark power price and on additional capacity at 2030. | Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation | Global | Greater room for investment in new renewables capacity associated with a decrease in power prices due to increased penetration of renewables. | \u20ac100 mn - \u20ac300 mn | EDITDA 2030 Best Place vs. Paris |\n| Market/Products & Services  | Medium       | Considering two alternative transition scenarios, the Group assessed the impact of trends in efficiency, the adoption of electric devices and the penetration of EVs to estimate the potential effect on commodity consumption, including the impact on gas customers due to the increase in electrification and on the demand for beyond-commodity services. | Customer | Global | Increase in margins due to impact of transition in terms of the electrification of energy consumption, mainly linked to forecast increases in green hydrogen. | \u20ac100 mn - \u20ac300 mn | EDITDA 2030 Best Place vs. Paris |\n\nNote: the estimated transition impacts take account of current coverage levels.\nEnel\u2019s performance in combating climate change\n\nThe Net-Zero Project\n\nIn 2021, Enel internally launched the Net-Zero Project, with two main objectives: to improve further the mapping of all its direct and indirect emissions, increasing the degree of accuracy and transparency of reporting, and to define the pathway for reducing its carbon footprint until 2040, through the definition of intermediate targets for each source of emissions, in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C pathway.\n\nAs part of the Net-Zero Project, a specific working group has been activated on the corporate fleet and buildings, with the ultimate aim of achieving the highest possible degree of electrification and of supplying all the Group\u2019s offices and buildings with renewable electricity. Enel\u2019s fleet consists of more than 20,000 vehicles worldwide and the process will include a first phase of electrification of cars, and then involve other vehicles, including heavy vans, excavators and cranes. To support the electrification of the fleet, Enel plans to develop a charging infrastructure composed of 20 thousand charging points, which will be added to the development plan of public charging infrastructure in the country. As regards buildings, Enel has about 1,500 buildings including offices, stores, warehouses and operations centers, which will be electrified mainly through the replacement of boilers and water heating with heat pumps. Efficiency improvement works are also planned to reduce electricity consumption. Finally, Enel plans to support the electrification plan of the fleet and buildings with the exclusive use of renewable energy, so as to ensure associated zero emissions.\n\nEnel\u2019s carbon footprint\n\nIn 2021, Enel\u2019s carbon footprint was 125.0 MtCO\u2082eq (up 9% compared to 2020), mainly due to the increased generation of electricity from fossil fuels, divided as follows:\n\n- **Scope 1**: 51.6 Mt CO\u2082eq (up 13% compared to 2020) representing 41% of total GHG emissions (99% of which are from power generation activity. In addition, ETS-related emissions are 63% of total Scope 1 emissions (compared to 53% in 2020).\n- **Scope 2**: 4.3 Mt CO\u2082eq (up 6% compared to 2020) which represents 4% of total GHG emissions. Furthermore, 69% of the Scope 2 emissions are related to total technical grid losses in the grid;\n- **Scope 3**: 69.1 Mt CO\u2082eq (up 7% compared to 2020) which represents 55% of total GHG emissions. This year, Enel has also calculated and introduced in the Scope 3 perimeter the values related to gas extraction and transport emissions for both its thermoelectric generation plants and for the market and the share of emissions related to the supply chain, disclosing it in this Sustainability Report for the three-year period 2019-2021.\n\nThe GHG inventory statements were audited by DNV GL, one of the main certification bodies world-wide, with a reasonable level of certainty for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, as limited to the sale of natural gas, and with a limited level of certainty for the other Scope 3 emissions included within the scope of application of the inventory. The audit was conducted according to Standard ISO 4064-3 for the compliance of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories with the WBCSD/WRI Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol).\n\nFor more details concerning Enel\u2019s carbon footprint, please refer to the 2021 GHG inventory (accessible via the following link: https://www.enel.com/content/dam/enel-com/documenti/investitori/sostenibilita/ghg-inventory-2021.pdf).\nOur carbon footprint\n\nTotal direct emissions\nGHG Scope 1 (MtCO\u2082eq)\n\nTotal indirect emissions\nGHG Scope 2 (MtCO\u2082eq)\n\nTotal indirect emissions\nGHG Scope 3 (MtCO\u2082eq)\n\nTotal GHG emissions\n(MtCO\u2082eq)\n\n| Value chain | Electricity generation | Electricity distribution | End customer | Other |\n|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|-------|\n| Global Business Line | | | | |\n| GHG Scope 1 direct emissions (MtCO\u2082eq) | | | | |\n| 1 Generation from thermal sources | 2 Other (from energy generation) | 3 Energy distribution activities | 4 Other (from distribution activities) | |\n| 44.79 | 50.70 | 0.46 | 0.46 | |\n| GHG Scope 2 indirect emissions (MtCO\u2082eq) | | | | |\n| 7 Electricity purchased from the grid | 8 Technical losses from the grid | 9 Electricity purchased from the grid | Included in source \u201c5\u201d | |\n| 1.12 | 1.17 | 2.77 | 2.97 | 0.14 | 0.14 | 0.014 | 0.008 | 0.08 | 0.07 |\n| GHG Scope 3 indirect emissions (mil tCO\u2082eq) | | | | |\n| 11 Coal (upstream) | 12 Gas (upstream) | 13 Diesel & fuel oil (upstream) | 14 Transportation of other raw materials and waste | 15 Supply chain emissions | 16 Sale of electricity | 17 Sale of gas |\n| 1.11 | 1.24 | 9.13 | 10.00 | 0.007 | 0.005 | 0.004 | 0.004 | 9.53 | 11.69 | 23.19 | 23.96 | 21.95 | 22.25 |\n| Source | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| 1 | Generation from thermal sources |\n| | Combustion of fossil fuels in generation activities (CCGT, Oil&Gas and coal thermal plants).

New targets have been set for emissions from electricity and gas sales, and the target of reducing Scope 1 emissions by 2030 compared to 2017 has been confirmed. All of these targets meet the 1.5 \u00b0C pathway established by the SBTi for the electric utilities sector.\n\nThe Net-Zero Commitment\n\nEnel is committed to fixing a long-term objective for reaching Net-Zero emissions along the value chain by 2040 (bringing forward the previous 2050 target), including both direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2 and 3), together with scientific goals in all pertinent areas and in line with the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\n| GHG goal | Area | Climatic scenario | Main drivers and actions for reaching the goal |\n|----------|------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 140 gCO\u2082eq/kWh in 2024 | 100% of Scope 1 GHG emissions | 1.5 \u00b0C | \u2022 Gradually phase-out coal-fired capacity during 2022-2024 (percentage weight of coal-fired capacity on consolidated capacity from 7% in 2021 to approximately 4% in 2024)  \n\u2022 Invest 173 billion euros to accelerate the development of renewable energy by installing 17 GW of new renewable capacity during 2022-2024 to reach 67 GW of renewable capacity by 2024 |\n| 21.3 MtCO\u2082eq in 2024 | 100% of Scope 3 emissions from the sale of natural gas in the end-user market | 1.5 \u00b0C | \u2022 Promote the customer passage from gas to electricity (especially residential customers)  \n\u2022 Optimize the customer\u2019s gas portfolio (especially industrial customers) |\n| \u2264 130 gCO\u2082eq/kWh in 2024 | 100% of Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions from electricity generation and end-market electricity sales | 1.5 \u00b0C | \u2022 Increase the share of renewable energy sold to customers by increasing the Group\u2019s renewable generation |\n| GHG goal | Area | Climatic scenario | Main drivers and actions for reaching the goal |\n|----------|------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh in 2030 (80% reduction compared to baseline year 2017) | Medium-long term (2030) | 1.5 \u00b0C, verified by SBTi | \u2022 Exit from coal-fired generation  \n\u2022 Invest 65 billion euros to accelerate the development of renewable energy by installing 75 GW of renewable capacity during 2021-2030 to reach 120 GW of consolidated renewable capacity by 2030 (3 times the installed renewable capacity in baseline year 2017). |\n| 11.4 MtCO\u2082eq to 2030 (55% reduction compared to baseline year 2017) | | 1.5 \u00b0C | \u2022 Update previous target, corresponding to a 46% reduction from previous 2030 goal  \n\u2022 Promote the customer\u2019s passage from gas to electricity (especially residential customers)  \n\u2022 Optimize the customer\u2019s gas portfolio (especially industrial customers) |\n| \u2264 73 gCO\u2082eq/kWh in 2030 (80% reduction compared to baseline year 2017) | | 1.5 \u00b0C | \u2022 Increase the share of renewable energy sold to customers by increasing the Group\u2019s renewable generation |\n| 0 gCO\u2082eq/kWh in 2040 | Long term (2040) | 1.5 \u00b0C | \u2022 Exit gradually from the thermal capacity and achieve a 100% renewable energy mix  \n\u2022 No use of carbon removal technologies |\n| 0 MtCO\u2082eq by 2040 | | 1.5 \u00b0C | \u2022 Exit from the business of gas sales to end customers, through the promotion of electrification of consumption  \n\u2022 No use of carbon removal technologies |\n| 0 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2040 | | 1.5 \u00b0C | \u2022 Aim to achieve 100% renewable electricity sales to end customers by 2040  \n\u2022 No use of carbon removal technologies |\n| Net-Zero emissions by 2040 | All remaining emissions (Scope 1+2+3) | 1.5 \u00b0C | \u2022 Possible use of carbon removal technologies |\n\n(1) Even if Enel constantly monitors Scope 2 emissions and is actively committed to their reduction, the Company has not set a specific reduction target, as they represent less than 4% of total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2017 (baseline year of the target certified by SBTi). Therefore, they are considered marginal and fall within the criteria of exclusion according to the SBTi methodology, which fixes a margin of 5% of total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n\n(2) The target could not be officially validated by SBTi because \u201cthe targets must cover at least 5 years and maximum 15 years from the date in which the target is presented to SBTi for official validation\u201d.

Specifically, the increase was due to higher generation from thermoelectric sources (+12.4 TWh), primarily from natural gas (+8.4 TWh), and higher generation from renewable sources (+3.5 TWh).\n\nThe electricity generated by Enel in 2021 from zero-emission sources amounted to over 60% of total consolidated generation (in 2020 it was over 63%), while it was 62% when including generation from capacity managed according to the Stewardship model (9.6 TWh in 2021).\nIn order to contribute to the decarbonization of its energy mix, in 2021 Enel increased its installed renewable capacity by 5.2 GW, while reducing its coal-fired capacity by 2.0 GW. As a result, consolidated installed capacity from zero emissions sources was approximately 61% (58% considering only renewable sources) of Enel\u2019s total consolidated installed capacity in 2021, whereas it was greater than 63% (59% considering only renewable sources) when including capacity managed according to the Stewardship model (3.3 GW in 2021).\nIn 2021, Enel maintained a key role in the development of new solutions to accelerate the energy transition process through the development of 252 MW of storage capacity, corresponding to a growth of about 205% compared to 2020, and increasing the current 7.7 GW of demand response by 27.7% compared to 2020. The digitalization of the electricity grid, which has been identified as a key enabler able to positively influence climate change through levers such as the integration of more renewable energy or an increase in energy efficiency, continued being a priority for Enel also in 2021. In particular, in 2021 the total number of end users with active smart meters grew 1.5% as compared to the previous year, reaching 45 million in 2021.\n\nEnel has also continued defining solutions for promoting the decarbonization of other sectors, such as transport. The Company is in fact committed to developing electrical mobility initiatives and promoting sustainable transport, reaching more than 157 thousand installed charging points at the end of 2021, an approximately 50% increase in comparison to 2020.\n\nEnvironmental metrics\n\nThe following table presents the environmental metrics related to climate change, in addition to the greenhouse gas emissions previously described in the dedicated paragraph of this chapter.\n\n| Environmental metric                                      | UM | 2021 | 2020 | 2021-2020 | %  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----|------|------|-----------|----|\n| Specific water withdrawal for total generation(1)         | l/kWh<sub>eq</sub> | 0.21 | 0.20 | 0.01      | 5  |\n| Withdrawal of water in water stressed areas(1)(2)         | %  | 27   | 23   | 4         | -  |\n| Generation with water withdrawal in water stressed areas(2)| %  | 14   | 14   | -         | -  |\n\n(1) Based on the classification provided by the WRI \u201cAqueduct Water Risk Atlas\u201d, the water stressed areas are those where the ratio between the total annual withdrawal of surface water or groundwater for different uses (civil, industrial, agricultural and livestock) and the total annual renewable water supply available (\u201cbase water stress\u201d, understood, therefore, as the level of competition between all users) is high (40\u201380%) or extremely high (>80%). By way of greater environmental protection, we have also considered as located in water stressed areas those plants falling in zones classified by the WRI as \u201carid\u201d.\n\n(2) Values for 2020 data have been recalculated following an expansion of the scope of facilities in water stressed areas.\n## Targets\n\nThe table below shows the main operational objectives included in the 2022-2024 Strategic Plan and the 2030 vision, which reflect Enel\u2019s role in combating climate change along the entire electricity value chain, in addition to the GHG emission reduction targets described in the previous section.\n\n| Segment of the electricity value chain | Description of the goal | UM | 2024 | 2030 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|----|------|------|\n| **GENERATION**                         |                          |    |      |      |\n| Net installed maximum capacity\\(^{(1)}\\) | GW                       |    | 102  | ~160 |\n| - of which renewables                  | %                        |    | 67   | >80  |\n| - of which thermoelectric              | %                        |    | 30   | -    |\n| - of which nuclear                     | %                        |    | 3    | -    |\n| Net generation\\(^{(2)}\\)               | TWh                      |    | 257  | ~340\\(^{(3)}\\) |\n| - of which renewables                  | %                        |    | 65   | >85  |\n| - of which thermoelectric              | %                        |    | 25   | -    |\n| - of which nuclear                     | %                        |    | 10   | -    |\n| **DISTRIBUTION**                       |                          |    |      |      |\n| Digitalization                         |                          |    |      |      |\n| Smart meter                            | mil                      |    | 48.4 | ~81  |\n| Smart meters (coverage)                | %                        |    | 63   | 100  |\n| **RETAIL**                             |                          |    |      |      |\n| Electrification, energy efficiency and digitalization | | | | |\n| Charging points for electric mobility  | mil                      |    | 1.1  | >5   |\n| Electric buses                         | .000                     |    | 12.6 | 100  |\n| Smart public lighting                  | mil                      |    | 3.6  | -    |\n| New services                           |                          |    |      |      |\n| Demand response capacity               | GW                       |    | 13   | >20  |\n| Storage capacity                       | MW                       |    | 476  | >600 |\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Does not include managed capacity of 7.6 GW in 2024.

For further details on Enel\u2019s environmental performance, please refer to the chapter \u201cTowards a nature-based model\u201d in this document.\nEnel\u2019s commitment to a just and inclusive transition and the action plan\n\nThe achievement of the goals set by the 2015 Paris Agreement has led governments around the world to intensify their efforts to fight climate change and adopt strategies to transform energy consumption and power generation patterns. The entire world is committed to an ambitious path of decarbonizing the economy, and all of the most recently published scenarios are unanimous in saying that achieving ambitious climate goals requires accelerating the electrification of energy consumption, along with massive use of energy generated from zero-emission sources. The change in customer consumption habits, in terms of greater awareness and efficiency in energy use and in terms of adopting technologies powered by electricity will be a key element along this path. In order to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by this transformation and find the balance between the right to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment and respect for the rights of the stakeholders involved, forward-looking policies will be required that take into account the fact that the transition to a decarbonized economy can be an important accelerator of growth and technological advancement in the energy sector, with positive environmental, social and economic impacts. If, on the one hand, the transition entails a reduction of jobs in some generation sectors, on the other it will open up new opportunities for employment and retraining of people and local communities. This will only be possible by taking into account the needs and priorities of all stakeholders involved, so that the transition is just and inclusive and pays particular attention to the most exposed social groups, of which communities that have based their economy on coal mining are an example.\n\nIn this context, Enel fully supports the principles of a just transition, so that no one is left behind even in the short term, and recognizes the relevance for its business of the social impacts arising from its climate strategy, aimed at the progressive reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Paris Agreement. Therefore, Enel\u2019s action in this sense is not only related to the energy transition but reflects a broader commitment, which is part of the Group\u2019s approach to respect human rights along the entire value chain, as also defined by the Human Rights Policy.\n\nIn 2019, Enel signed the UNSG Summit Pledge Letter in which the United Nations asked companies around the world to commit to a just transition and the creation of decent green jobs. The commitments in the letter define the conditions necessary for the transformation: the transition must be just, jobs must be sustainable and decent, greenhouse gas emissions must be zeroed out, poverty must be eliminated, and communities must thrive and be resilient. In fact, companies committed to the decarbonisation process will be the first to combine good growth in economic results with better social inclusion and will be the first to seize the opportunities offered by the new economic model aimed at a zero-emission world through the creation of new jobs and employee training. By signing this letter, the Group has committed in particular to:\n\n- promoting negotiations with workers and union representatives, in compliance with workers\u2019 rights, encouraging social protection (including pensions and healthcare) and salary guarantees, as established by the International Labour Organization (ILO);\n- collaborating with suppliers who respect these standards, at the same time contributing toward the social-economic development of the local communities most exposed to the passage from fossil fuels to renewables.\n\nIn addition, Enel plays an active role in the Sectoral Social Dialog Committees, in which\nit participates as a representative of the Italian employers\u2019 association (Elettricit\u00e0 Futura) and of which it held the chair in 2020, which will also hold for 2022. In this context, in November 2021, the European social partners\u2014Eurelectric, IndustriALL and EPSU\u2014officially signed a joint statement on just energy transition, which includes concrete demands, including adequate funding and better authorization procedures for coal phase-out programs and to meet the growing demand for electricity, as well as consistent social policies that ensure that no one is left behind, in line with the principles of the ILO\u2019s Just Transition Guidelines. Enel also maintains a high-profile social dialog through the European Works Council, a worker representation body introduced by European Directive 94/45/EC and implemented in Enel most recently with the union agreement of July 13, 2016 for the purpose of transnational \u201cinformation and consultation\u201d of workers in European-sized companies and groups.\n\nIn this regard, a plenary meeting was held on March 15 and 16, 2022, attended by several representatives of Enel\u2019s management, sharing the Group\u2019s positioning on the issue and the various initiatives under way in the Company to ensure a just energy transition and a workforce increasingly prepared for change.\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\nEnel promotes a broad engagement of stakeholders, internal and external, with a fully Open Power approach, in order to increase their awareness and develop a constructive dialog that can provide a valuable contribution to the fair transition. The most relevant actions carried out in 2021 include:\n\n- **materiality analysis**: among the topics addressed during the identification of the main priorities for stakeholders in sustainability planning there are: climate change, engaging local communities, management, development and motivation of people and a sustainable supply chain, in terms of priorities for stakeholders and performance of the Company in the different countries where it operates;\n- **social media**: Enel continued to raise awareness of climate change and just transition issues through social media;\n- **raising the awareness of local communities**: with the Creating Shared Value (CSV) model, Enel is involving local communities, making them aware of issues related to climate change and explaining how renewables are an extremely effective solution, with benefits not only for the environment but also for the creation of new jobs and for social-economic development;\n- **raising the awareness of our people**: Enel aims to achieve an ever-increasing engagement of the people who work in the Company through awareness campaigns on the topic. The Company\u2019s annual events, debates and discussions on topics related to a just transition were promoted during the Enel Digital Days 2021.\nEnel\u2019s advocacy activities\n\nThe Group acts at different institutional levels to support a green, digital and just transition. Public policies can have positive impacts on workers, industries and end customers. There are four areas that Enel actively promotes, also through advocacy activities:\n\n\u2022 **safeguard industrial competitiveness**, taking into account the possible risk of \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d, i.e. the risk of relocation outside national borders of generation activities, to countries that do not apply a price to emissions (so-called \u201ccarbon pricing mechanisms\u201d) or that apply a low price to emissions. The transition will create new jobs and industries while gradually eliminating others;\n\n\u2022 **safeguard employment** by focusing on upskilling and reskilling. Social security measures should be in place for workers who cannot be reintegrated into the labor market;\n\n\u2022 **manage impacts on utility bills**: policies, laws and regulations should avoid inequitable redistribution of costs and safeguard customers, with particular attention to low-income customers;\n\n\u2022 **empower customers**: customers should be aware of both the costs and opportunities associated with the energy transition and can be guided to identify and implement consumption policies that aim at energy efficiency and cost optimization through a process of progressive electrification.\n\nFor climate change advocacy activities, please refer to the section of the chapter \u201cEnel\u2019s advocacy activities for the climate\u201d.\n\nParticipation in just and inclusive transition initiatives\n\nIn the last two years, Enel has been a promoter, together with CSR Europe, of multi-stakeholder initiatives and negotiation on a just and inclusive transition and the future of work, which has seen a wide engagement of key stakeholders such as: the European Commission, environmental organizations and labor institutions, European think tanks, private sector and youth associations.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group also contributed to various debates of the European Round Table on Climate Change and Sustainable Transition on the need for a just transition and the evolution and prospects of international climate change negotiations, and participated in the working group on just transition of the WBCSD\u2019s \u201cBusiness Commission to Tackle Inequality\u201d platform, which brings together business leaders and key stakeholders with the overall objective of building a new common narrative on the role of business in tackling inequality.\n\nFor further discussion, see the chapters \u201cOur Strategy for Sustainable Progress\u201d, \u201cEnel People,\u201d and \u201cThe Path to Net-Zero\u201d.\n\nThe strategy towards Net-Zero and the approach and action plan for a just transition\n\nThe strategy developed in recent years has enabled the Group to set out a vision of the future and progress centered on sustainability, as a key and essential element to face the global challenges of the transition to a decarbonized economy. The Group\u2019s strategy is articulated around the core concept of contributing to building a fairer and more inclusive society throughout the entire value chain, protecting the environment in which we live and creating opportunities for the future for the Company and for stakeholders, without leaving anyone behind.\n\nTaking into account the results of the materiality analysis and in synergy with the Strategic Plan, our Sustainability Plan was set out, divided into specific objectives in the short, medium and long term, to make our journey towards sustainable progress more transparent and verifiable (see the Sustainability Plan 2022-2024).\n\nJust Transition plans are, therefore, developed consistently with the principles of the ILO\u2019s Just Transition Guidelines and with the Group\u2019s strategy aimed at the decarbonization of its power generation capacity, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, involving, where necessary, the various stakeholders, such as employees, trade unions, local communities, suppliers, institutional stakeholders, trade associations, non-governmental organizations and investors.\n\nThe Group is also committed to managing the transition at an individual country level by activating solid periodic\nnegotiations with trade unions in order to put into practice the principles of a just transition with all the players most directly involved in the process, particularly in the conversion of sites and coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe Group follows the \u201cthink globally, act locally\u201d approach, based on which the Futur-e initiative has been developed, which promotes an inclusive transition in the areas surrounding the power plants that are undergoing this energy transition. Futur-e is the first example in the world of requalification on a large scale of an industrial area that uses an approach based on the circular economy; a vast and unique program designed to find new uses for obsolete power plants. New, innovative and sustainable uses that reuse existing structures, infrastructures and connections, with the engagement of local stakeholders to create value for local communities through sustainable economic growth and the creation of jobs.\n\nA strategy is being prepared for the in line regeneration of over 40 sites to be reconverted, in compliance with the following fundamental principles:\n\n- **integrating site personnel** through a process of re-assignment within the Group in order to avoid redundancies and any loss of know-how, also involving trade unions to make sure that the various expectations of employees are satisfied;\n- **promote requalification projects** to write new stories of energy conversion, sustainable growth and development of innovative ideas that improve creative thought and promote business initiatives;\n- **collaborate with local communities** through a multi-stakeholder approach for favoring the creation of shared value along the entire project, from the preliminary interviews with the stakeholders, up to the decision regarding which requalification projects to follow;\n- **guarantee the protection of the environment** soil remediation must be carried out according to the highest standards possible;\n- **maximize the reuse of divested structures**, such as roads, infrastructures, connections to the high-voltage network, buildings, etc. in line with the principles of the circular economy;\n- **contribute to the objectives of the Enel Group** collaborating with the other Business Lines for the completion of projects such as BESS (Battery Energy Storage System), electric mobility, digitalization or stability of the electricity grid.\n\nThe Futur-e initiative was launched in 2015 in Italy and subsequently extended to the Group\u2019s other countries, with the aim of giving new life to thermoelectric power plants that are no longer competitive on the market, totalling 13 GW. Since 2019, the project has evolved by combining the requalification of third parties in non-energy areas with the development of opportunities to replace thermoelectric plants with new hybrid and/or renewable generation, in line with the Enel Group\u2019s objective.\n\nIn a perspective of circular economy and sustainability, the development of new generation capacity has therefore started with the reuse of existing plant spaces, infrastructures and connections, as well as investing in the areas hosting plants undergoing decommissioning, actively involving the local areas and stakeholders and creating value for local communities through sustainable economic growth and job creation.\n\nGiven the new energy-industry context, and Enel\u2019s decarbonization strategy \u2013 in line with the national, European and global strategies that orient energy development toward sustainable technologies \u2013 the Group has expanded the requalification opportunities thanks to the possibility of replacing the thermal power generation plants mainly with new renewable or hybrid power plants, integrating new business projects with complementary sustainable investments that satisfy the needs of the communities where the facilities are located. These projects are located, in particular:\n\n- **in Italy**, with energy requalification in line with the transition objectives and the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (INECP). With a view to circular economy and sustainability, the development of new generation capacity is achieved through the reuse of plant spaces, infrastructure and connections already in place, as well as by investing in the areas hosting the decommissioned plants, actively involving the local areas and stakeholders and creating value for local communities through sustainable economic growth and job creation;\n- **on the Iberian Peninsula** with the progressive transition of coal-fired plants located on the peninsula, for example, Andorra in Teruel and Compostilla in Le\u00f3n (closed in June 2020), and Carboneras in Almer\u00eda (closed in December 2021);\n- **in Latin America**, for example, with the power plants of Tarapac\u00e1 and Bocamina in Chile, where Enel is proceeding with the progressive closure of coal-fired generation (Tarapac\u00e1 and Bocamina I already closed, and Bocamina II scheduled for closure in May 2022), with employees, contractors, suppliers and communities integrated into the transition process. In the case of employees, a plan has been agreed to transfer people from coal-fired plants to other areas of the Company. Specifically, for the Tarapac\u00e1 power plant out of a total of 50 employees it has been possible to relocate 26 people internally in thermal generation, 9 people in renewable energy (of which 2 in wind, 2 in solar, 2 in geothermal, 1 in Engineering and Construction, 1 in Business Development and 1 in technical support), 2 people in sales, 1 person in Infrastructure and Networks.\nand, finally, 12 people have opted for a voluntary resignation by taking advantage of the economic, training and health insurance package offered by the Group. For the Bocamina I Plant, out of a total of 28 employees, 17 were relocated internally to various areas including Engineering and Construction, Renewable Energy, Health and Safety, Environment and Quality (HSEQ); 9 people took advantage of retirement plans and the remaining 2 people decided to leave the Company.\n\nRegarding the Bocamina II Plant, in 2021 the negotiations with unions and workers continued in order to elaborate the options for people working at this plant, which will be presented during 2022, the date on which the Company has committed to providing an internal relocation plan for employees.\n\nThe Futur-e project for the coal-fired plant in Andorra, Teruel (Spain)\n\nIn line with the commitment made for a just and inclusive transition, Enel is promoting the Futur-e initiative at the coal-fired power plant in Andorra, Teruel (1,101 MW). The project represents an investment of more than 1,487 million euros and has the final objective of installing 1,725 MW of renewable energy, of which 1,585 MW from solar power, constructing the largest plant for this technology in Europe, and 140 MW from wind power. The project also includes a large-scale energy storage system of up to 160 MW.\n\nThe Futur-e project for Andorra includes:\n\n\u2022 **creation of new jobs**: by the end of 2021, 449 jobs had been created, 153 of which local (34%), specifically in the municipalities of Alca\u00f1iz, Alcorisa, Alloza, Andorra, Calanda, Utrillas, Albalate del Arzobispo, Ari\u00f1o and Mas de las Matas. Since the beginning, the Company has involved trade unions to guarantee that the expectations of personnel are satisfied; therefore together with the trade unions, a decision was reached that those who are interested can be transferred to other company functions, based on existing open positions and their professional category. These agreements also include economic incentives and requalification opportunities;\n\n\u2022 **the hiring of new recruits from existing auxiliary companies** for employment in the closing and decommissioning of the plant, as a top priority. In the following phase, the renewable plants will create approximately 4,000 jobs during construction, and 138 positions for 25 years in operational and maintenance areas;\n\n\u2022 **the development of training programs targeted toward local communities in the area**, with more than 900 beneficiaries, in order to promote new work opportunities. Specifically, 4 health and safety courses already finalized for 200 beneficiaries and 18 technical courses for over 700 beneficiaries are to be conducted in 2022;\n\n\u2022 **the planning of actions for promoting energy efficiency and sustainability of consumption** in the towns surrounding the plant.\n\nThe project for Andorra will also include an investment of 294 million euros for the installation of a 60 MW electrolyzer that generates renewable hydrogen. This project is included in the 23 initiatives presented to the Ministry of Ecological Transition for the development of this technology in Spain. A part of the renewable capacity that will be placed in operation in Teruel could therefore be dedicated to the generation of hydrogen, which would involve the creation of 144 jobs during the construction of the electrolyzer and 65 permanent positions for operation and maintenance.\n\nFor more information and updates on the project see: Futur-e in Teruel-Endesa (endesa.com).\nRespect for labor rights\n(for further information see the chapter \u201cProgress starts with people - Enel people\u201d)\n\nAs stated in the Group\u2019s Human Rights Policy, everyone who works with Enel is entitled to conditions that respect health, safety, welfare and dignity, a cap on working hours, rest periods during the day and week, and paid vacations. The remuneration of the Group\u2019s employees takes into consideration the principle of fair pay for work and equal pay between male and female labor for work of equal value, based on an objective assessment of the work to be performed. The minimum payment made to Group employees cannot be lower than the level established by the collective bargaining agreements and legislative and regulatory texts in force in the various countries, in line with the provisions of the ILO Conventions.\n\nThe transition to a Net-Zero economy will bring about a shift in sectors and jobs, and thus in the skills and competencies of the workforce. In addition to the creation of new types of jobs, e.g. climate change experts, Big Data, digital transformation and artificial intelligence specialists, the transition to a Net-Zero economy will likely result in the gradual disappearance of some types of jobs (such as technical skills in the thermoelectric sector) and changes in the content of most others. It is therefore necessary to have company programs aimed both at developing existing professional skills to improve the performance of one\u2019s current role (upskilling) and at learning new ones (reskilling).\n\nEnel believes that professional guidance and training are important for the development of people and their skills, particularly in situations affected by the energy transition, and is committed to implementing requalification programs for workers affected by the ongoing decarbonization process. Both for plants closed during 2021 and in previous years, and for those that will be progressively affected by the path towards decarbonization in the coming years, Enel\u2019s commitment with all its employees affected, without distinction of job title, level of responsibility or gender, is to support them, including with the initial engagement of the unions, in the development of new skills and/or retraining of technical competencies, through:\n\n- redeployment and upskilling/reskilling processes of people working in coal-fired power generation plants;\n- voluntary early retirement plans;\n- upskilling/reskilling programs to acquire new skills and support generational mixing and knowledge sharing.\n\nUpskilling/reskilling programs are developed based on the timeline of the plant closure plan and redeployment plan and are broken down into several phases:\n\n1. identification of training needs and mapping of resources;\n2. design of a training plan to reduce the skills gap compared to the required job profile;\n3. execution of the training plan and monitoring of activities;\n4. rotation in the new position.\n\nThe programs are generically structured by a portion of \u201ctraditional technical training\u201d (classroom and online) and a portion of \u201con-the-job training\u201d, more targeted to the specific nature of the role. In cases in which the persons concerned already possess advanced technical knowledge on topics that are part of the programs (educational qualifications, training plans after joining Enel and/or previous experience), the courses are not assigned, since no skill gap is detected.\n\nIn the last two years, the pandemic has put a strain on programs already started and to be started, although online training has not negatively impacted the achievement of goals.\n\n2021\n\n- ~55% of people who left coal-fired plants in 2021 have been redeployed and have attended upskilling and reskilling programs (110 hours per capita)\n- Coal employees redeployed:\n  - ~90% within the Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation perimeter\n  - ~10% in other Enel business areas\n\n2022-2024\n\n- 50% of people leaving coal-fired plants will be redeployed, participating in upskilling and reskilling programs. The remaining 50% will be offered early retirement plans\n- Overall training dedicated to the total employees up to 40% reskilling and upskilling\n- Reinforcement of the \u201cinternal training\u201d approach\nIn December 2020 in Italy, Enel signed an agreement with trade unions to implement an upskilling and reskilling training plan, involving more than 20 thousand people. Initiatives range from digital transformation of operational and commercial staff to retraining activities involving technical-professional and cultural skills.\n\nCustomer centricity\n(for further details see the chapter \u201cThe decade of electrification and customer centricity\u201d)\n\nThe next decade will be characterized by increasing interventions in favor of electrification, through which customers will gradually convert their energy consumption to electricity, with improvements in spending, efficiency, emissions and price stability: already by 2024 it is expected that in Tier 1 countries the electricity from renewable sources sold to Enel customers will grow as a result of: i) the increase in the percentage of generation from renewables on the total and ii) the increase in the share of electricity generated directly by the Group on total sales to end customers.\n\nThe aim of the Group is to be close to customers, improving and maintaining access to electricity in the most disadvantaged areas and among people on lower incomes. Indeed, to facilitate equal access to energy, in all countries in which the Group operates forms of support are available for certain segments of the population to assist them in the payment of utility bills, as well as a wide range of products with high energy performance to ensure savings in terms of both consumption and emissions. In addition, with the aim of promoting social inclusion, in Colombia Enel has developed a financial product aimed at the most vulnerable categories of the population who do not have access to credit through traditional banking channels: hence the Codensa Easy Credit credit card, aimed at Enel customers in the city of Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Cundinamarca. At the end of 2021, the beneficiaries of this option exceeded 75,000, over 50% of whom were women.\nEngaging local communities\n(for more detailed analysis see the chapter \u201cProgress starts with people \u2013 Local and global communities\u201d)\n\nEnel promotes the engagement of local communities in order to gather their needs related to the transition from thermal generation to generation from renewable sources, as well as to raise their awareness on issues related to climate change, explaining to them how the development of renewables provides benefits not only for the environment but also for the creation of new jobs and for the socio-economic development of the communities involved.\n\nThe Group contributes to the achievement of various types of intervention, ranging from the expansion of infrastructure to education and training programs, from initiatives targeting social inclusion initiatives to projects supporting local cultural life. For example, several projects have been implemented, such as \u201cAccess to electricity\u201d, as well as specific initiatives dedicated to communities close to the power plants. In 2021, the overall contribution of Enel to the communities in which the Group operates was 91 million euros, of which about 5 million euros for in-kind giving activities.\n\nThe model includes the development and use of quantitative KPIs, such as the number of beneficiaries, which in the period 2015\u20132030 is estimated to be:\n\n- 5 million beneficiaries of quality education (SDG 4);\n- 20 million beneficiaries of clean and affordable energy (SDG 7.1);\n- 8 million beneficiaries of decent work and sustained, long-lasting, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth (SDG 8).\n\nEngaging suppliers\n(for more details see the chapter \u201cProgress starts with people \u2013 Suppliers\u201d)\n\nIn order to make the supply chain increasingly resilient, Enel has launched several initiatives. Specifically, in Italy the process of supplier growth is assisted by the Supplier Development Program. Through signing agreements with the main players, Enel guarantees favourable conditions compared to those of the market and a contribution to cover partially the services offered within the framework of the program, including financial instruments that can facilitate access to liquidity and managerial and technical training programs to encourage business reconversion. Particular attention is paid to initiatives to support the reconversion and diversification of business such as the \u201cSportello imprese\u201d (business desk), which consists of periodic meetings with individual traditional power generation companies aimed at accompanying them in processes of growth and requalification towards areas in expansion, such as renewables or new services related to energy efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, in 2021 Enel applied in Italy the social clause beyond the limits of the law (extra legem), allowing more than 1,900 workers to keep their jobs despite the change of contract.\n\nWith the aim of contributing to the reskilling and/or upskilling of workers with professional skills that risk becoming obsolete, to the creation of entrepreneurship and to the strengthening of Italy\u2019s productive and economic fabric, Enel has also created the following professionalizing courses, involving its supply chain:\n\n- for photovoltaic panel installers, designed with the Sostenibile CNA of Viterbo, local employers\u2019 associations and the Municipality, with the aim of reskilling workers in the Civitavecchia and Montalto di Castro supply chain by training 120 technicians to be employed on worksites for the construction of solar photovoltaic plants. This is a concrete contribution to companies that, as part of the path of energy transition taking place in northern Lazio, have decided to convert to the renewables business. In 2022, the course will be repeated in Brindisi.\n- for welders, designed with colleagues from the Civitavecchia plant and in partnership with the employment agency Umana Forma, Unindustria and a local company that has provided the workshop and teaching staff;\n- for fiber technicians, a project aimed at 150 unemployed Abruzzo residents, identified in collaboration with the Abruzzo Regional Authority, to enable them to find employment thanks to what is now a highly sought after professional training.\n\nIn the early months of 2022, \u201cEnergie per Crescere\u201d (Energy for Growth) was launched, a program devised in conjunction with the ELIS training body, to include about 5,500 young people onto the labour market within the next two years and create, in the various local communities, a pool of professionals available for Enel\u2019s network of supplier companies.\n## Electrification\n\n### Priorities\n- Infrastructure and Networks\n- Customer engagement\n- Products and services for electrification and digitalization\n- Economic and financial value creation\n\n### Plan\n\n#### ELECTRIFICATION\n\n### SDG\n\n| Activities | 2021-2023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022-2024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| SAIDI (min) | 228 in 2023 | 243 | | 216 in 2024(1) | I | 7 |\n| SAIFI (no.) | 2.5 in 2023 | 2.77 | | 2.5 in 2024(2) | I | 7 |\n| Innovation and digitization of the distribution networks | 49 mil end users with active smart meter by 2023 | 45 mil end users with active smart meter | | 48.4 mil end users with active smart meter(3) | I | 9 |\n| Cabling ratio (km of cable lines/km of lines in total) | 63.0% by 2023 | 60.6% | | 61.6% by 2024 | I | 7 |\n| Network losses (Italy)(4) | 4.7% in 2023 | 4.7% | | 4.7% in 2024 | I | 7 |\n\n### Find out more\n\nSmart meters replace conventional meters and allow real time information of consumption level and its optimization.\n\n---\n\n(1) The 2030 target is ~100 min.\n(2) The 2030 target is ~2.\n(3) The 2030 target is ~81 mil.\n(4) Includes the technical losses (Joule effect) and non-technical losses (energy theft) of e-distribuzione (Italy).\n| Activities | 2021\u20132023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022\u20132024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| New producer connections (Italy and Spain) | 283 thousand new connections in the period 2021-2023 | 79 thousand new connections | | 309 thousand new connections in the period 2022-2024 | I | 7 |\n| New producer connections \u2013 power (Italy and Spain) | 9.0 GW in the period 2021-2023 | 1.64 GW | | 8.5 GW in the period 2022-2024 | I | 7 |\n| Rural and suburban electrification: grid extension and microgrid solutions - Connections | 231 thousand connections in the period 2021-2023 | 104 thousand connections in rural areas | | 570 thousand connections in rural and suburban areas in the period 2022-2024 | I | 7 |\n| Rural and suburban electrification: grid extension and microgrid solutions - Beneficiaries | | | | 2.2 mil beneficiaries in rural and suburban areas in the period 2022-2024 | I | 7 |\n| Charging points | ~780 thousand | 319 thousand | | 1.1 mil by 2024 | I | 9 |\n| Real-time demand response | 10.6 GW | 7.7 GW | | 13.0 GW by 2024 | I | 7 |\n| Storage | 527 MW | 80 MW | | 476 MW by 2024 | I | 9 |\n| Light points | | | | 3.6 mil by 2024 | I | 7 |\n| Electric buses | | | | 12,600 by 2024 | I | 9 |\n\n(5) The target was redefined following a regulatory change in Spain pursuant to the Real Decreto of 29 December 2020 (1183/2020), which provides that the connection request is no longer necessary for installations of less than 15 kW.\n(6) The scope includes Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Romania.\n(7) The 2030 target is 1.8 mil connections (2021-2030).\n(8) The 2030 target is 6.9 mil beneficiaries (2021-2030).\n(9) Public and private charging points installed.

Electrification is the common strategic horizon towards the progressive decarbonization of the economy and represents the lever through which customers can personally participate in the change under way, choosing and experiencing the benefits of sustainable solutions that are convenient, innovative, flexible and digital.\n\nThe emergency situation, which has lasted this year too, has highlighted how essential and indispensable the services of generation, networks and sale of power are. Reliability, safety and continuity of distribution, innovation, customized digitalization, together with quality, effectiveness and transparency in the sale of energy and services have characterized and characterize each stage of our relationship with customers in all the countries where we operate.\n\nOur customers ask us to undertake a path of growth together: they are in fact aware of the importance of their role in the ongoing energy transition process, but do not always know how to participate. We undertake to guarantee a high level of service quality and to maximize customer satisfaction, anticipating market needs in order to ensure reliable responses and establish lasting relations, based on dialog, collaboration and trust: aspects that refer not only to the supply of electricity and/or natural gas, but also and above all to the intangible aspects of the service perceived by the customer. Our goal is to be a reliable partner, capable of offering simple and innovative solutions and anticipating our customers\u2019 needs. We are at the forefront of providing innovative and inclusive services dedicated to senior citizens, the disadvantaged, the indigent, the marginalized, vulnerable families or the disabled to ensure a just energy transition. We strive constantly to improve the channels and methods by which contacts are made, our back office processes, and the monitoring of complaints and requests for information, in order to reduce response times and ensure proper management. We dedicate great attention to the analysis of customer reports, in order to understand customer perception and any critical issues in progress, so that the appropriate corrective actions can be implemented immediately without compromising overall customer satisfaction.\n\nIn 2021, Global Customer Operations was created, a new Staff Function dedicated to increasing the value and satisfaction of our customers. \u201cMaking life easier for our customers around the world, and putting them at the center\u201d: A phrase that declares a very concrete business prospect, linked to the rapid evolution of technology and customer consumption habits. Putting the customer at the center means developing new relationship models that promote listening and engagement to ensure the continuous improvement of our services. We also strive to enhance the contribution that each individual customer can make to decreasing their impact on the planet, adopting consumption styles geared towards the use of renewable energy, recycling and reuse, sharing and reducing waste, starting with paper contracts and bills. All of our customers share one common request: simplification.\nTo be able to simplify and offer immediate solutions to our customers\u2019 problems, we must first simplify ourselves, by adopting an understandable jargon-free language and by trying to maintain a high level of quality, provided and perceived from the first contact. In this sense, technology can come to our aid: digital transformation is in fact opening up new frontiers for customers, who nowadays expect excellent service, in real time and at a reasonable cost.\n\nFurthermore, in the last year, the experience of technological innovation and digitalization of solutions that characterizes Enel X, with its beyond commodity offer, has combined with the retail dimension. Indeed, Enel X Global Retail was founded, amplifying and strengthening our ability to respond to new scenarios and design increasingly personalized offers to meet customer needs. Enel X Global Retail is therefore positioned with a dual role:\n\n- **enabler**: by assisting and educating its customers and partners in the electrification of end uses and, thanks to the support of digitalization, more efficient power management, with the aim of building a sustainable development model;\n- **enhancer**: through enhancement of assets, seizing the opportunities arising from the processes of digitalization and electrification.\n\nEnel X offers an ecosystem of closely interconnected solutions that transform energy into new opportunities in different sectors: electric mobility, public and private power efficiency, artificial intelligence and data analysis services, power consultancy and financial services. The goal is to create an integrated ecosystem of beyond commodity electrification services, leveraging the commodity customer base and putting our users\u2019 needs at the heart of solutions. This is why, within the process of global energy transformation, Enel X Global Retail has decided to seize the opportunities generated by electrification, beginning from our deep knowledge of the various targets and their respective needs.\n\nFinally, in 2021 the new Global e-Mobility Business Line was also created, to respond to the global expansion of the e-mobility market and of charging solutions and related platforms for the power supply of zero-emission vehicles. Indeed, the Group\u2019s new organizational set-up stems from the desire to accelerate technological evolution and growth across the entire value chain linked to the e-mobility sector, responding to the needs of current and future users with a structured portfolio of charging solutions and software for the government-owned and private sectors, promoting the growth of electric mobility through partnerships and strategic alliances, and continuing the path of innovation linked to charging technology in which Enel is today recognized as a major and trustworthy international player.\n\nFor further information about customer management in the various countries, in addition to the following paragraphs, please refer to the individual Sustainability Reports of Enel Group\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\n---\n\n**Enel, vision 2030 for access to energy and electrification, and the UN High-Level Dialogue on Energy**\n\nEnel is one of the companies that participated in the UN High-Level Dialogue on Energy, the first summit-level UN meeting in over 40 years exclusively dedicated to the topic of energy. The event virtually brought together heads of state and other political, business and civil society leaders, who unveiled \u201cEnergy Compact\u201d, a set of voluntary commitments aimed at accelerating the achievement of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 \u2013 ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy systems for all \u2013 and zeroing out net emissions.\n\nEnel Global Infrastructure & Networks contributes to the \u201cEnergy Compact\u201d commitment made by the Enel Group to reach 5.6 million beneficiaries (commitment later increased to 6.9 million) with new connections in rural and suburban areas in Latin America and Europe in the period 2020-2030 (for further details, see the box \u201cThe Energy Compact on Enel\u2019s sustainable strategy\u201d in the chapter \u201cThe path to Net-Zero\u201d). In line with the Shared Value Creation (CSV) approach, for this strategic activity proactive knowledge of the context and the different customer needs, and in general an ongoing\ndialogue with stakeholders, are an integral part of the electrification process. Reaching and connecting vast rural and remote areas of the world means integrating technological innovation with social and economic development. Numerous electrification projects are carried out by Enel Global Infrastructure & Networks, in which, depending on the specific context, grid extension solutions are adopted, such as the Department of Cundinamarca in Colombia (rural electrification), or microgrid solutions such as those developed in remote areas of Brazil in the State of Goi\u00e1s. Parallel to this, we work for the process of normalizing connections in large megacities in Latin America (suburban electrification), where we support the resolution of commercial losses related to irregular connections and where we work for regulated access to electricity that ensures the necessary security conditions for everyone. Finally, numerous activities are carried out in Italy, Spain and Romania to combat fuel poverty.\n\nEnel X Global Retail is also actively involved in the management of three flagship projects in Sardinia, Zaragoza and Santiago de Chile, with the aim of testing different business models targeted at electrifying end-use consumption that can be launched quickly and possible scaled up nationwide. Through this process, it is possible to understand along with customers what the barriers to adoption are, quickly find a solution and then commercialize it. In Sardinia, in particular, it was decided to pursue the commitment to achieve a green island, not only in the electrification of end-use consumption but starting from generation.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, in Cagliari, Enel, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi Roma Tre and Centro Ricerche Economiche e Sociali Manlio Rossi-Doria presented the project \u201cGreen Electrification of Sardinia\u201d, included among the United Nations Multi-Stakeholders Energy Compact, and considered a landmark in the process of energy transition at global level. The project plans to achieve a number of goals by 2030, including:\n\n- increased electrification of final demand by at least 1.8 TWh compared to 8.5 TWh in 2019;\n- reduced carbon intensity of electricity generation from 0.5 tCO\u2082eq/MWh to 0.1 tCO\u2082eq/MWh, for a total reduction in emissions of about 80% (2019 baseline);\n- increase in renewable generation from 4 TWh in 2019 to 10.9 TWh.\n\nOvercoming reliance on the generation of power from fossil sources will take place through replacement with renewable plants, mainly photovoltaic and wind, and widespread diffusion of batteries and, at the same time, through the dissemination of technologies for the electrification of end uses (SDG 7 targets 7.1 and 7.2), such as electric mobility, systems for space heating and cooling, energy efficiency and induction plates, as well as the electrification of industrial processes of the main manufacturers in the area.\n\nAlthough they have very different characteristics from the Italian island (the first is in fact an industrial city, while the second is a metropolis) Zaragoza and Santiago de Chile will follow the goal of electrification of final consumption, modulating and adapting it to their own needs, through local targets and offers, to make the benefits of electrification applicable, tangible and demonstrable.\n\nFor further details, see the chapter \u201cThe Path to Net-Zero\u201d in this document.\nThe grid of the future for a just transition\n\nIn 2021, 510.3 TWh were transported on the Group\u2019s distribution grid (485.2 TWh in 2020).\n\nElectricity distribution network by geographical area\n\n|                | High voltage | Medium voltage | Low voltage |\n|----------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|\n| Romania        | 132,334      | 5%             | 27%         | 68%         |\n| Iberia         | 316,506      | 6%             | 36%         | 58%         |\n| Italy          | 1,151,482    | 30%            | 70%         |             |\n| Latin America  | 633,047      | 3%             | 62%         | 35%         |\n| Total (%)      |              | 2%             | 40%         | 58%         |\n| Total (km)     | 2,233,368    | 46,860         | 891,221     | 1,295,287   |\n\n(1) In Italy there is also 20 km of high-voltage network.\n\nOur mission is to ensure an affordable and reliable quality service through an efficient and digitalized electricity grid, enabling a more sustainable lifestyle through the use of electricity for all our customers. As a Distribution System Operator (DSO), our Group has embraced the challenges of the energy transition to develop the grid of the future: \u2018smart\u2019, modern, flexible and digital. An evolution that needs the grid to transform profoundly into flexible and open systems in which customers, retailers, aggregators, energy generators and new players can operate and collaborate to accelerate the energy transition. Thanks to new digitalized infrastructure, we can open up our networks to active stakeholder participation, providing a platform where everyone can operate equally, encouraging the use of electricity to generate shared value over the long term. Similarly, we have moved from a customer-supplier relationship to a new collaboration model based on partnerships with the supply chain, the innovation ecosystem (start-ups, universities, industrial partners, crowdsourcing), but also with customers and energy generators for co-design and joint development of new solutions.\n\nTo support this ambitious transformation, Grid Futurability\u00ae, the new long-term strategy that defines the grid which we aim to achieve by 2030, has been launched, identifying the actions to be put in place globally, from an industry and stakeholder integration perspective. A strategy which, going beyond more traditional technological investments, takes into consideration the different needs of customers in both rural and urban contexts to identify priorities and proceed to the renewal, upgrading and expansion of grids in the coming years through circular economy solutions and processes, but above all to rethink the integration of grids in the local areas and with communities, thus ensuring a fair and inclusive transition. A new industrial approach that, by focusing on the needs of customers and associating to each investment the relative value created in ESG terms, transforms grid innovation into a tool to improve people\u2019s lives concretely, building new ecosystems that make it possible to create shared value in the long term.\n\nGrid Futurability\u00ae also aims to ensure the best service quality for all end customers, with particular attention to people with disabilities, to ensure that the infrastructure is resilient to extreme weather conditions, able to accommodate more renewable connections and electric cars, and achieve a safer infrastructure while minimizing environmental impact. Outdated grid assets will be replaced with new sustainable technologies and with a new design to encourage integration into the landscape. From a technology perspective, sustainable, innovative, and cutting-edge technologies are expected to be widely deployed to transform grids into smart grids. The combination of robust infrastructure with advanced digital solutions will make grids increasingly resilient, participatory and sustainable, and capable of meeting the diverse needs of customers in both emerging and mature markets.\nThis ambitious project currently involves an investment of 18 billion euros, with a target of around 70 billion by 2030. In the next three years, 200 new primary substations will be activated, more than 15 thousand km of medium-voltage lines will be installed and 38 thousand new inspections will be carried out on the existing grid. These investments will allow us to increase the hosting capacity by about 60 GW and to activate charging infrastructure for more than 12 million electric cars. For further details, see the \u201cInnovability\u00ae\u201d and \u201cCircular economy\u201d chapters in this document.\n\nOne of the priority objectives of Grid Futurability\u00ae is to ensure the environmental sustainability of our grids by leveraging circular economy models, starting from construction phase, with the commitment to achieve full sustainability of our sites by 2030. Through an approach called \u201cgrid mining\u201d we are analyzing the entire value chain of grid assets in order to recover valuable materials and devices from obsolete grid infrastructure, with the goal of minimizing environmental impact and resource consumption, while maximizing positive social aspects and long-term value creation. The first \u201cgrid mining\u201d project was the \u201cCircular Smart Meter\u201d, launched in Italy and Brazil with the aim of reducing the environmental footprint of smart meters through the end-of-life regeneration of the materials that make them up, with 100% of the plastic recovered from old, decommissioned meters. Further details on circular economy initiatives in Infrastructure and Networks can be found in the dedicated chapter of this report.\n\nIn addition, 2021 saw the launch of Gridspertise, a new industrial and commercial entity that offers innovative, flexible, sustainable and integrated solutions to electricity and distribution operators (DSOs), presenting itself to the market as a reliable partner to boost the digital transformation of power grids across the industry ecosystem as part of the energy transition. The offering is structured around three priority areas of DSO digitalization needs across the entire value chain:\n\n- **meter and grid edge digitalization**, focused on increasing customer engagement and stakeholder participation through smart meters and grid edge technologies that also enable engagement in electricity prosumer markets;\n- **digitalization of grid infrastructure**, aimed at increasing the intelligence and flexibility of power grids to accelerate full-scale digitalization, increasing efficiency, reliability and service quality and supporting DSOs to manage the challenges facing network operations;\n- **digitalization of field operations**, to increase operational efficiency thanks to innovative solutions for planning and operational processes and, at the same time, to increase the safety of internal and external operators in the field.\n\nGridspertise\u2019s solutions and services provide benefits to the entire electricity ecosystem. DSOs can improve service quality, reduce operating costs, optimize investments in new infrastructure, and enhance field operational safety, productivity and sustainability. Finally, as part of the Net-Zero project, standards and trends for each country were mapped in 2021 to optimize the estimation of direct and indirect GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions. These include \u201ctechnical losses\u201d, energy consumption of DSOs for services, emissions of sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086) contained in some assets and, finally, emissions from emergency generators. For further details, see the chapter \u201cThe Path to Net-Zero\u201d.\n\n134\nCustomer centricity\n\n| 103-2 | 103-3 | EU3 | DMA EU (former EU23) |\n\n| Electricity market customers | Gas market customers |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Romania no. 3,044,844 | 119,415 |\n| Iberia no. 10,250,657 | 1,684,369 |\n| Italy no. 21,824,404 | 4,165,317 |\n| Latin America no. 28,253,787 | 25 |\n| Total no. 63,373,692 | 5,969,126 |\n\n| 2021 | 2020 | Change 2021-2020 |\n|------|------|------------------|\n| Demand response (MW) | 7,713 | 6,038 | 1,675 | 27.7% |\n| Lighting points (thousands of units) | 2,821 | 2,794 | 27 | 1.0% |\n| Storage (MW) | 375 | 123 | 252 | - |\n| Public and private charging points(1) | 157,209 | 105,079 | 52,130 | 49.6% |\n\n(1) The value does not include interoperability points.

Energy sales amounted to 309.4 TWh in 2021 (298.2 TWh in 2020). Enel also operates demand response capacity of around 8 GW, up by almost 2 GW compared to 2020.\n\nCustomer satisfaction\n\n| 102-43 | 102-44 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 417-1 |\n\nDespite the constant attention paid to issues linked to service quality, this year the customer satisfaction surveys carried out in the countries where we are present showed results that were substantially in line with previous years and in some cases slightly worse. The results of these surveys are subject to detailed analysis in order to understand the trends and implement any corrective actions promptly.\n\nIn Italy, the customer satisfaction index (CSI)(1) for 2021 was 91.0 for the regulated market (93.8 in 2020) and 90.0 for the free market (91.9 in 2020), slightly down in both markets. Monthly satisfaction surveys are carried out among customers who have received an answer to a written or verbal complaint. The survey is conducted by telephone interview after a response has been sent or the customer has been contacted by telephone.\n\nIn Iberia, through the subsidiary Endesa, efficient customer service is the main value pursued in the relationship with the customer and we strive for maximum efficiency in the operation of commercial channels, tools and platforms through a process of constant innovation and improvement. The main methodology used to ascertain the degree of customer satisfaction is seen in the interviews carried out through digital channels, especially social media, reflecting the fact that the digital transformation is permeating the Company as a whole. The ICS in 2021 stood at 7.16(2) for the free market (7.3 in 2020) and 7.39(2) in the regulated market (7.7 in 2020).\n\nIn Romania, customers can voice their opinions via the contact center, e-mail and website. Information is gathered once a month and the results are used to improve the service quality and business processes. The general satisfaction index was 8.4(3) for the free market (8.2 in 2020) and 8.3(3) for the regulated market (8.4 in 2020).\n\n(1) Value is calculated on a scale of 1 to 100. The values for 2021 have been estimated on the basis of established trends.\n(2) The value is calculated on a scale of 1 to 10. The cumulative value is 7.46 and takes into account B2C and B2B customers.\n(3) Calculation of the value has changed from a 100-point scale to a 10-point scale. The cumulative value is 8.3.\nIn Latin America, customer satisfaction indicators are a fundamental element for the definition of strategies and new products. In Brazil, customer satisfaction is measured every year using several specific indices. The principal index is calculated by the Brazilian association of electricity distributors (ABRADEE - Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Distribuidores de Energia El\u00e9trica). This index is determined after conducting a sample survey among customers on such aspects as: energy supply, information and communication, utility bills, customer support and image. No less important, the IASC index (customer satisfaction indicator) is calculated by the Brazilian regulator, Aneel (Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Energia El\u00e9trica), after conducting a sample survey of residential customers on such aspects as customer care, reliability, information and price. Lastly, the NPS (Net Promoter Score), adopted globally, determines the percentages of satisfied and dissatisfied customers based on responses to the question: \u201cHow likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?\u201d.\n\nIn order to know the opinion of clients in relation to their level of satisfaction, their perception and their future expectations, interviews are also carried out in Peru with those who have used the services of the contact points, through structured and standardized questionnaires. Finally, in Colombia, there is a customer satisfaction form designed to measure market perception of the supply of products and services in order to direct initiatives and the respective resources more efficiently. The quality satisfaction index (ISCAL), the key elements of which include the commercial relationship and billing, has remained at excellent levels in recent years, thanks to the development of the customer relationship plan.\n\nIn Chile, numerous surveys are conducted to determine user satisfaction and to obtain feedback on the experience derived from the service offered. Specifically, during 2021, more than 270 thousand surveys were initiated directly from call centers, through the use of automated outbound calls capable of interpreting and understanding natural language. In addition, we are implementing an important strategy for the improvement of digital channels (web, WhatsApp, social networks) with a view to increasing the experience of customers and offering them an increasingly punctual and efficient service.\n\nComplaints management\n\nIn all the countries where we operate, customers have various channels available through which to make a complaint or request information (post, website, toll-free number). Our Group constantly monitors the feedback received, in order to understand the customer\u2019s perception and any ongoing critical issues and to implement the appropriate corrective actions using a data-driven approach. In Italy, for example, through Enel Energia, the Enel Group monitors the commercial quality of all its contact channels, systematically monitoring the sales and management processes. The goal is to ensure the fulfillment of requirements in compliance with current legislation, privacy and rules protecting the freedom and dignity of workers. Customer reports are managed through dedicated channels and analyzed by a specific working group so that the most suitable actions are taken, both at the complaint management stage and, above all, in preventing the underlying causes. In Italy, ARERA (Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment) establishes the minimum performance levels to be met for the customer service and waiting times. Again in 2021 the expected result is above the standards required by the Authority.\n\nIn Iberia, complaints are managed both centrally by the \u201cAtenci\u00f3n de Reclamaciones\u201d (complaint management unit) and locally through six neighboring units, in order to prevent any disruptions and determine the appropriate tools needed to resolve them when they do arise, thus improving the efficiency of the process. In 2021, the complaints management model, implemented in 2019, was consolidated through an end-to-end approach to the process. 69% of complaints received involved the billing process.\n\nIn Romania, customers can send reports using different channels: dedicated e-mail address for complaints and requests, website, direct call center helpline or even visit a Punto Enel.\n\nIn Colombia and Peru, a digital transformation of the process has started and an automated procedure (RPA - Robot Process Automation) has been adopted for the management of complaints about energy usage, in order to speed up the process of responding to customers.\n\nIn Brazil, a customer experience team analyses the causes of complaints through analytical tools (e.g. country and regional analysis of complaints), surveys and forums with the customers themselves, in order to develop improvement actions; in order to reduce the number of complaints, major actions have been implemented in Chile to improve customer experience using different communication channels. A new management system was\nlaunched during 2021 with the aim of responding more promptly to customer information needs and of provid-\ning greater control in the billing process and in data col-\nlection and analysis.\n\nFocus on vulnerable groups\n\nWe want to remain attentive to the needs of citizens, im-\nproving and maintaining access to electricity in the most\ndisadvantaged areas and among the poorest populations.\nAll the countries in which the Group operates in fact pro-\nvide forms of support, often linked to state initiatives, which make it easier for certain sections of the population\nto pay electricity and gas bills, thus allowing equal access\nto energy.\n\nIn Italy, since 2008 for the electricity sector and 2009 for\nthe gas sector, a discount has been provided for domestic\ncustomers experiencing financial hardship and \u2013 for the\nelectricity sector only \u2013 for customers who use life-saving\nelectro-medical equipment (known as the \u201csocial bonus\u201d).\nThe bonus is funded with state resources and specific tar-\niff components determined by the Authority.\n\nApplications for the bonus can be made through the mu-\nnicipality, the social security office (INPS) or the tax assis-\ntance center (CAF) and, if approved, customers receive a\ncredit on their bill that varies according to their income\nand the number of people in the household. In 2021, the\nnumber of recognized requests for relief more than dou-\nbled compared to 2020, involving approximately 1 million\ncustomers. In general, protection is provided in the event\nof disconnection of the power supply: in the event of\nnon-payment, customers who have an electronic meter\nare not cut off completely but have their available power\nreduced and are cut off completely only if the non-pay-\nment persists.\n\nEnel Energia has also activated a chat function on its web-\nsite, which makes it possible to meet the needs of cus-\ntomers with hearing difficulties. Assistance for those with a\nhearing disability is also guaranteed through the telephone\nchannel via Pedius.\n\nIn Iberia, 2021 was a year of significant regulatory changes\nin terms of electricity and gas billing, which required the\nsubsidiary Endesa to make a great effort in providing in-\nformation on the new developments and their impact on\nend consumers, social services and consumer associa-\ntions. The \u201csocial bonus\u201d (with discounts on the electricity\nbill from 25% to 60% for vulnerable customers and from\n40% to 70% for severely vulnerable customers), as well as\nthe prohibition to suspend the power supply to vulnera-\nble customers, also remained active for 2021. In addition,\nurgent measures were introduced to mitigate the impact\nof the escalation of natural gas prices in the retail gas and\nelectricity markets, which established the minimum vital\nsupply for vulnerable customers (recipients of the social\nelectricity bonus) in a situation of failure to pay, which ex-\ntends by 6 months (in addition to the existing 4) the use-\nful period for settlement of the balance, during which the\nsupply cannot be cut off and power is reduced to 3.5 kW\nonly for customers with power above this value.\n\nFurthermore, since 2014 Endesa has maintained many\nagreements signed with local/regional authorities and\nservice sector organizations, in order to avoid cuts in sup-\nplies to customers recognized as vulnerable by the social\nservices. This year, collaboration agreements with munic-\nipal authorities were renewed and reorganized (from 273\nagreements currently in place 10 centralized agreements\nwere concluded with autonomous communities and urban\nassociations).\n\nThese agreements have enabled Endesa to handle 149,681\nrequests and 17,054 queries, amounting to an accumu-\nlated debt of 20.8 million euros, in relation to vulnerable\ncustomers who have difficulty in meeting their bills. In\ncollaboration with the Catalan regional government, the\ncompany has agreed to settle the debt of more than 35\nthousand households, with a total value of 38.8 million eu-\nros in unpaid bills dating back to 2015. The company will\ntake on approximately 78% of the debt. To prevent future\nnon-payments, an agreement has been reached to create\na solidarity fund aimed at preventing the accumulation of\nnew back payments, in which Endesa and government au-\nthorities will participate in equal measure.\n\nIn addition, since 2018 Endesa has offered customers in\nvulnerable groups the opportunity to pay their bills in in-\nterest-free instalments and has opened specific support\nchannels.\n\nIn Romania, tailor-made solutions are constantly being\nsought to meet the needs of the most vulnerable custom-\ner groups. In 2021 we were also present in Ferentari, one of\nthe most disadvantaged neighborhoods in Bucharest. By\nappointing a trusted person from that community, called\nan \u201cenergy mediator\u201d, we have been able to gain a better\nunderstanding of local needs to ensure a more appropri-\nate offer of services. The energy mediator also helps the\npopulation of the neighborhood to perform seemingly\nsimple tasks such as reading meters, signing contracts or\naccompanying local people to the Enel shop when neces-\nsary. A partnership with the association FDP \u2013 \u201cProtago-\nnists in Education\u201d was also launched in 2021, with the aim of identifying and understanding the causes that force almost 80 families in the area of Faur-Republica (Bucharest) to live in energy poverty.\n\nIn Brazil, customers who rely on life-preserving electro-medical equipment have priority over other customers on the telephone channel and their requests are monitored and promptly supported. In addition, Enel appropriately manages customers with special subsidies offered by the government, such as the Social Electricity Tariff (TSEE) subsidy provided for low-income people.\n\nIn Chile, action plans have been developed to minimize the impact on customers of the economic crisis associated with the effects of the pandemic. In particular, as a precautionary measure, meters were not read on site in certain months of the year and web and social network campaigns were promoted to encourage self-reading by customers. Easy payment options were introduced (ability to agree a specific payment date without interest and up to 12 instalments) and specific projects were developed in order to enhance the customer experience via the use of digital channels.\n\nPriority support remained in place during 2021 for electricity-dependent customers, i.e. those who need to be connected to a medical device that runs on electricity.\n\nIn Peru, Enel X launched the Dr. 360 project, health insurance associated with the energy contract made available at competitive prices and therefore aimed at the most vulnerable segments of the population. Activation entitles the beneficiary to telemedicine, discounts on medicines and, possibly, ambulance transport (depending on the type of tariff plan).\n\nIn Colombia, social promotion initiatives include Codensa Easy Credit, a financial product on offer to the most vulnerable categories of the population who do not have access to credit through traditional banking channels: Codensa Easy Credit. This is a credit card aimed at promoting the financial inclusion of Enel customers in the city of Bogot\u00e1 and in the department of Cundinamarca. Among the services available is the possibility to purchase goods and services in over 7,000 Enel points of sale and to pay by instalments charged directly in the bill. At the end of 2021, the beneficiaries of this option exceeded 75,000, over 50% of whom are women.\n\nLastly, in the context of the Value for Disability project (see the \u201cProgress starts with people \u2013 Local and global communities\u201d chapter of this document), actions were identified at Group level that will be implemented in the coming years. These include: the start of slow shopping, meaning the creation of shops with areas and times dedicated to those who find shopping stressful or challenging, in which staff are trained to welcome persons with disabilities (e.g. accessible shops, priority service, sign language interpretation, chairs and in-store areas reserved for breaks), targeted offers, annual analysis of the customer experience of persons with disabilities and related qualitative score, as well as the launch of products designed using the \u201cdesign for all\u201d technique, which takes account of the needs of everybody, thereby broadening their user base and overall satisfaction.\n\nA transparent relationship with customers\n\nOver the last few years, customers have changed their lifestyles and buying habits as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. The resulting social distancing accelerated the use of e-commerce, attracting new customer segments to digital channels. This unstoppable acceleration towards the digital transition is accompanied by increasing demands for a more customized experience. Our Group has launched new digital channels and expanded the payment methods available to customers, in order to mitigate the difficulties generated by the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic. Consistent with the official efforts made to mitigate the effects of climate change, we have intensified our commitment to the energy transition, focusing on the digitalization of customer relations by means of digital payments and instalment plans, listening to customers as part of the continuous improvement process, the circular economy and bill discounts, inclusive offers for disadvantaged, low-income, socially excluded and vulnerable customers, online sales, digitalization of documents and filing, digital bills, interactive bills, innovative and inclusive digital services, responsible consumption, and flexible offers thanks to open meter.\n\nIn the various Group companies, in accordance with the Code of Ethics, all contracts, communications addressed to customers and all advertising messages must be:\n\n\u2022 clear and simple, written in language that is as close as possible to that normally used by the people to whom they are addressed;\n\n\u2022 compliant with current regulations, without resorting to elusive or incorrect practices;\n\n\u2022 complete, without neglecting any information needed by the customer to make a decision;\n\n\u2022 accessible to the customer.\nIn all the countries where the Group operates, specific customer service channels have been set up: physical, telephone and online to ensure constant information flows concerning the features of the products and services offered. Access to information has also been strengthened through the use of social media channels, such as Facebook and Twitter, and specific apps. In order to guarantee that communication with customers is truly transparent, correct and effective, we undertake to ensure that any cultural, linguistic, illiteracy or disability barriers do not affect equal access to information for customers. Services dedicated to deaf people have been developed in Spain and Peru, thanks to the collaboration with the Italian start-up Pedius, which has been operating in Italy since 2018.\n\nIn Italy, in addition to the www.enel.it website, which allows customer relationships to be set up and maintained for commercial and management purposes, there is a specific Enel Energia app designed to manage utilities quickly and easily, providing access to all the data relating to bills, usage, payment status, etc. It also allows the services associated with the various supplies to be activated or changed, information to be received about new offers and promotions, while also providing access to the dedicated loyalty program. The Enel Energia website (www.enel.it) also contains a guide with audio-visual content explaining the bill and a chat function is available for deaf customers; the chat also offers an English-language service via a dedicated call-back option. In addition, staff in Enel shops are able to assist foreign customers, and the contact centers in the province of Bolzano offer a service dedicated to German-speaking customers. As part of the \u201cEnel Social Services\u201d programme, created in collaboration with the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the National Electricity Service sends the bill in Braille to blind customers.\n\nIn Iberia, the www.endesa.com website provides various functions and payment methods, a section dedicated to privacy management, a chat function available on the app and innovative ways of viewing usage and invoices. Over the past two years the pandemic has accelerated the digitalization process, thus boosting online services. By the end of 2021, the www.endesa.com website has accumulated 2.8 million registered customers (11% more than in 2020). All commercial communications, invoices and information sent by Endesa to its customers can be received in two languages: Spanish and Catalan. The www.endesa.com website is available in Spanish, Catalan and English. The company has also implemented a channel for persons with hearing or language disabilities using the Pedius app, which allows customers to ask questions about their bills or contract and receive personalized information. Endesa is also committed to overcoming any physical barriers by placing customer contact points on the ground floor to ensure access for people with disabilities. Finally, Endesa has a special unit to manage relations with consumer associations and public bodies, which holds regular meetings and participates in various industry forums with a view to adopting increasingly appropriate measures for the continuous improvement of customer relations. In this regard, in 2021 the program to automate management of the most used channels (mainly chat and WhatsApp) through the use of Artificial Intelligence in the main support processes continued. Indeed, the goal is to provide a faster response to the most frequent needs of our customers and to adapt to the higher volume of traffic that online assistance has faced as a result of the pandemic.\n\nIn Romania, the www.enel.ro website provides a series of online services to customers in Romanian and English, such as payments, support and even the ability to activate electronic invoicing via text message or e-mail, directly from the website.\n\nFaced with the challenges arising from the pandemic context and the digitalization process already launched in 2020, in Chile, the company adapted its communication channels in 2021 to work remotely, ensuring fluidity and effectiveness in customer relations, with a view to improving the customer experience and adjusting communication to new needs.\n\nSince 2020, an app has been available that gives customers immediate access to various services \u2013 such as reporting emergencies and paying bills \u2013 and which this year has been revamped in terms of design and functionality.\n\nEnelbot was enabled on the www.enel.cl website to offer customers a new, easily accessible contact channel that provides automated responses on balance requests, payments and bill reading. In 2021, Enel accumulated more than 76 thousand visits to the website thanks to this communication channel. In addition, the use of social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, has allowed us to keep customers up to date on any power outages or emergencies, and this has increased the degree of customer satisfaction thanks to the transparency, instantaneousness and timeliness of information. The WhatsApp channel is confirmed as one of the preferred contact tools for customers, and in fact there were 30 thousand visits during 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Enel sought to bring people closer to issues related to electricity consumption through the dissemination of explanatory videos conducted by the \u201cProfessor Solomon\u201d, a comic character who addresses energy efficiency issues with humor and straightforwardness.\n\nIn Brazil, we offer a wide range of customer communication channels. By means of the website (www.enel.com.br), text messaging and the app, customers can access information and services while maintaining a transparent relationship with Enel. They can also communicate through the main social media (Facebook, Twitter or Instagram), using specific applications for each, or contact\nan assistant via chat (WhatsApp, Messenger, DM-Direct Message or e-mail). Virtual assistant Elena, a WhatsApp chatbot, is also available to interact with customers and show them the easiest way to fulfil their requirements. Enel complies with current customer privacy regulations in all the countries where it operates. We also strive to monitor all third-party companies that may be in a position to use the personal data of customers. To this end, dedicated clauses are included in contracts with partners who use personal data to carry out specific activities, for example sales services or customer satisfaction surveys. Customer data is an expression of the individual\u2019s personality and identity, and must therefore be treated with due caution and guarantees. Enel considers personal data to be a shared and corporate asset at the same time. For this reason, we have appointed a Data Protection Officer to guarantee full respect for the privacy of all the individuals with whom we interact. For further details, see the \u201cESG backbones \u2013 Sound governance\u201d chapter of this document.\n\nEnergy-saving commercial offers, products and services\n\nIn all the countries where we operate, a wide range of high energy performance products has been launched to guarantee savings in terms of both consumption and emissions. Endesa has become established as one of the main players in the solar self-consumption market in Spain. Thanks to the experience gained and its technical knowledge, the company supports customers in enhancing the technology needed to accelerate the efficient consumption of energy, contributing to the generation of clean and renewable power. Through its subsidiary Endesa X, in 2021 Endesa carried out the simultaneous construction and commissioning of two photovoltaic self-consumption facilities in two Kronospan plants in Spain (Burgos and Salas), with a total of 74 MWp of power. The project involved the installation of 18 thousand photovoltaic panels, over an area of 36 thousand m\u00b2 \u2013 equivalent to five soccer pitches \u2013 allowing the generation of 9 GWh and providing 5% of the energy required for production processes. In environmental terms, a reduction of approximately 3,200 tons of CO\u2082 per year is estimated, with a benefit of 282 thousand trees planted each year. Finally, as part of the development of e-mobility solutions and in order to promote their deployment, Endesa X will actively participate in the electrification of Zaragoza\u2019s urban bus fleet, to make the city climate neutral by 2030. In terms of size and speed of fleet transformation, this is in fact one of the most important public transport electrification projects carried out to date in Spain. No fewer than 68 electric buses will be introduced and 75 charging stations installed.\n\nIn Italy, Enel X offers a wide range of integrated products to ensure energy savings for the benefit of our customers. Among the solutions proposed are Homix, the smart home integrated with Alexa, JuiceBox, the home charging station, Enel X Sun Plug&Play, the innovative photovoltaic balcony system the installation of which does not require structural work and which makes it possible to contribute to domestic power needs using solar energy, reducing the energy component by up to 20%. For more details, see the box \u201cEnel X Store in Rome\u201d of this chapter.\n\nIn Chile, two major projects related to \u201cCarbon footprint\u201d and \u201cEnergy management platform\u201d were implemented. In collaboration with For The Planet, a local company, during 2021 Enel adopted a new tool for quantifying and checking the carbon footprint of customers who, via the platform, will be able to monitor their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, alter their habits and behave in a more sustainable manner. At a small additional cost, this program also includes carbon footprint training and support throughout the contract period. With regard to the second project, Enel Distribuci\u00f3n Chile, in collaboration with Enel X, has provided energy management tools to customers so that their facilities can achieve established energy efficiency objectives. This is made possible by using two systems:\n\n- Utility Bill Management (UBM), a web platform that improves operational efficiency via the automated management of account services and the display of consumption;\n- Energy Management System (EMS), an online system for monitoring energy and power consumption that can manage the energy efficiency of various installations/items of equipment.\nElectrification that can only be achieved with customers\n\nThe energy sector is changing and so is the energy used, which is why we are committed to creating and offering individuals, companies and government bodies products and services to make everyday life, from mobility to home automation, easier and more efficient.\n\nBusinesses: B2B (Business to Business)\n\nThe B2B sector is constantly looking for partners that can offer innovative and technological solutions to increase competitiveness, accelerate decarbonization and reduce costs and energy consumption. The partnership with Enel X provides access to customized processes, where technologies and services come together to offer the most effective solution tailored to the specific needs of the customer and the sector. Among the solutions offered are the self-production of electricity through photovoltaic plants, or the installation of trigeneration plants, as well as products and services for the energy efficiency of consumption, based both on the use of software and energy management systems, and on storage systems, related to solutions for the management of energy demand. During 2021, Enel X confirmed its leadership in demand response, with 7.7 GW of capacity under management globally, and helped its customers close Renewable PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements) for 3.5 GW of extra renewable energy compared to 2020 (500 MW) worldwide, with a particular focus in North America.\n\nTransparency and energy efficiency: the partnership with CDP \u2013 Carbon Disclosure Project\n\nIn 2021, Enel X joined the non-profit organization CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) as a Gold Accredited Solutions Provider, with the goal of supporting companies in reducing their carbon footprint to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and help make the planet a more liveable place. The goal is to provide businesses with an alternative model that respects the environment, in order to build a more sustainable and efficient world. Together, Enel X and CDP will promote the transparency of corporate data on environmental performance and the adoption of measures that can encourage a more sustainable use of energy throughout the industrial chain.\nGovernment authorities: B2G (Business to Government)\n\nConversely, the offers in the B2G sector have the objective of accompanying cities along a pathway towards electrification and sustainability by exploiting digital platforms for the management and monitoring of the products offered, through the integration of solutions aimed at efficiency and improvement of services for citizens. The Enel X 2.0 city transforms to create an electrified, circular and interconnected smart city, through innovative solutions for public and architectural lighting, smart street decor and electrification of transport, and is enriched by the public charging infrastructure of the Juice family, and efficiency-enhancing technologies for public buildings (photovoltaics, efficient lighting and the digital energy management suite). The Enel X YoUrban platform makes it possible to digitalize and interconnect Enel X and enables real-time monitoring of the status of infrastructure and performance and sustainability indicators through a Digital Control Room.\n\nIn the last year, more than 186 thousand new lighting points have been acquired, there are 3,046 e-buses operated mainly in Colombia and Chile, the United States and Spain, and about 2,500 government authorities in Italy have registered on the YoUrban portal.\n\nUrban transport: Enel X\u2019s experience in Latin America\n\n\u201cElectric public transport plays a key role in the transformation towards sustainable and interconnected cities. With our integrated solutions, we are leading the market in creating and promoting an ecosystem that generates synergies and integrates joint work with the government and the different stakeholders at the LATAM level.\u201d (Nhiura Coaquina, Head of Business Development eBuses eCity LATAM)\n\nLatin America is at the center of the energy transition and electrification process, especially with regard to electric mobility, particularly in the area of transportation. In fact, cities are under increasing pressure to electrify and decarbonize their transportation systems due to the growing urban population and pollution levels.\n\nEnel X Colombia has been awarded two contracts to supply six electric terminals and 412 electric buses to the TransMilenio public transport system in Bogot\u00e1. Together, the six electric terminals will have a total of 473 smart charging points with the capacity to recharge 878 electric buses.\nIn Chile, Enel X is providing smart charging infrastructure for 435 electric buses in Santiago, for a total of 11 electric terminals, 40 smart bus stops and 245 chargers.\n\nIn Lima, the first electric bus, equipped to collect real-time data, was launched in partnership with the Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership (GSEP) and Canadian public utility Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. The information will be used to create the basis for a nationwide electric transport system in Peru.\n\nIn Uruguay, a smart charging monitoring system has been installed for 20 electric buses run by the private operator Cutcsa.\n\nEnel X is also developing business relationships to achieve 100% electric transportation in Argentina, Brazil and Peru.\n\nInnovative offerings in the region include **Ebus-as-a-Service (EaaS)**, an end-to-end model in which we provide a combination of solutions ranging from electric bus fleet financing and smart city services to smart charging solutions for electric buses and electric terminals.\n\n**Nhiura Coquina**\nHead of Business Development eBuses\neCity LATAM\nThe consumer: B2C (Business to Customer)\n\nThe road to electrification traced by Enel X combines technological innovation with the simplicity of daily use and the reliability of the service, thus making end customers aware that they have made a personal choice with a positive impact on their spending, and not only symbolic, in the fight against climate change.\n\nAmong the various services offered are Homix, the smart home solution with integrated Alexa, which allows for optimal management of home heating, lighting and home security, Enel X Sun Plug&Play photovoltaics, and JuiceBox private charging infrastructure.\n\nIn 2021, Enel X installed about 64 thousand energy-efficient e-Home products, including boilers, air conditioners, heat pumps and more than 5 thousand photovoltaic plants (partly with storage system), between Europe and Latin America, avoiding the emission into the atmosphere of about 17 kt of CO\u2082 globally.\n\nThe \u201cPrograma de recambio\u201d in Chile\n\nThe program to replace wood stoves with electric air conditioning systems is an initiative implemented to offset emissions by companies in the manufacturing sector and was implemented based on the methodology approved by the Ministry of Environment for the submission of Emissions Compensation Plans - ECPs. The initiative, which is highly appreciated by the Chilean Ministry of Environment, allows companies to meet their offset targets by financing the replacement of wood stoves with efficient air conditioning systems in the residential segment.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2021 the \u201cPrograma de recambio\u201d has allowed the removal of more than 10 thousand wood stoves that have been replaced free of charge with air conditioning systems, helping to prevent the estimated emission of 221 tons of PM 2.5 and 35,849 tons of CO\u2082.\n\nIn addition, this plan follows a circular economy logic, as the stoves that are removed are recycled and smelted to produce steel bars that are reused in the construction industry.\n\n---\n\n(4) Estimated figure.\n(5) The ECP is a compulsory legal instrument that affects each project in its different phases and requires offsetting to be implemented when the established norm for PM (Particulate Matter) and Gas emission is exceeded. Each Plan is designed according to the specifics of the project or operation.\n(6) Airborne particulate matter is defined as all solid and liquid atmospheric particles suspended in the air. The term PM 2.5 identifies particles with an aerodynamic diameter that is less than or equal to 2.5 \u00b5m.\nEnel X Store in Rome\n\nEnel X, in collaboration with Volkswagen Group Italia, has opened the Enel X Store in Rome, the first city area for ultrafast charging of electric vehicles and the first HPC (High Power Charging) site of the European project CEUC (Central European Ultra Charging) co-funded by the European Commission. The Enel X Store in Corso Francia offers technologies for energy efficiency, financial services and solutions for electric mobility, and continues Enel X\u2019s goal of making our cities smarter and more sustainable through electric mobility and our homes more energy efficient, encouraging the electrification of uses. Each charging point has a power of up to 350 kW and makes it possible for electric cars compatible with high power charging to fill up with energy in about 20 minutes. In addition to the ultrafast chargers, there is also a JuicePole, the 22 kW + 22 kW public charging station, and a JuiceMedia, the integrated digital screen with two charging stations, reserved for test drives of Volkswagen Group Italia brands.\n\nResidential products include: Homix, the smart home solution with integrated Alexa, which makes possible the easy management, including via voice control and remotely, of the temperature, security, lighting and other devices of the home ecosystem. Enel X Sun Plug&Play, the innovative photovoltaic balcony system that is easy to install without the need for structural work, allows solar energy to contribute to domestic energy needs even in the city, providing power to appliances and other devices, and leading to a saving in the energy bill of up to 25%. JuiceBox is a home charging station designed to ensure intelligent, safe and flexible charging. The Enel X Store in Corso Francia also has products for energy efficiency, such as heating and air conditioning systems and Enel Energia\u2019s solutions for the management of electricity consumption. To these can be added specific solutions such as JuiceAbility, which makes it possible to use the public infrastructure to recharge electric wheelchairs. The store also offers the opportunity to pay bills, make recharges, which will soon be available for the JuicePass app for filling up electric cars, make shipments and obtain information for the activation of Enel X Pay, the app and online account that facilitates all types of transactions in a simple and user-friendly. Space will be available in the store, on a rotational basis, for 100% electric models of the Volkswagen Group Italia brands, and specific activities are planned for users interested in discovering zero-emission mobility, from workshops to dedicated consultancy, up to the possibility of taking test drives.\n### Priorities\n\n- Economic and financial value creation\n- Employees management, development & motivation\n- Occupational health and safety\n\n### Plan\n\n#### SDG\n\n#### Targets\n\n| Activities | 2021-2023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022-2024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Gender - % of women in selection processes\\(^{(1)}\\) | 50.0% | 52.1% | | 50.0% | S | 5 |\n| Gender \u2013 Female managers\\(^{(2)}\\) and middle managers (%) | 22.6% managers | 23.6% managers | | 26.8% managers\\(^{(3)}\\) | S | 5 |\n| | 30.6% middle managers | 31.4% middle managers | | 33.4% middle managers\\(^{(4)}\\) | S | 5 |\n| | 29.7% managers and middle managers | 30.6% managers and middle managers | | 32.7% managers and middle managers\\(^{(5)}\\) | S | 5 |\n| Gender \u2013 % of women in managerial succession plans | | 42.7% | | 45.0% | S | 5 |\n| Gender \u2013 % of women in Top Manager succession plans | | | | 45.0% | S | 5 |\n| Female students involved in STEM career guidance initiatives | | | | 12,800 female students involved in the period 2022-2024 | S | 8 |\n| Climate survey (%) | 100% people\\(^{(6)}\\) involved | 100% people\\(^{(6)}\\) involved | | 100% people\\(^{(6)}\\) involved | S | 8 |\n| | 87% participants | 70% participants\\(^{(7)}\\) | | 80% participants | | |\n| Open Feedback Evaluation - Performance appraisal (%) | 100% people\\(^{(6)}\\) involved | 100% people\\(^{(6)}\\) involved | | 100% people\\(^{(6)}\\) involved | S | 8 |\n| | 99% appraised | 99% appraised | | 99% appraised | | |\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Excluding selection processes for blue collar workers or comparable technical roles as well as data concerning USA and Canada where local legislation prevents gender tracking in the recruiting phase.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) Including female Top Managers.\n\n\\(^{(3)}\\) 2030 target is 32.1%.\n\n\\(^{(4)}\\) 2030 target is 38.1%.\n\n\\(^{(5)}\\) 2030 target is 37.4%.\n\n\\(^{(6)}\\) Eligible and reachable persons: those who have a permanent contract and have been in place and active for at least 3 months during the year.\n\n\\(^{(7)}\\) Climate surveys are carried out every two years. 2021 data refers to 2020 survey.

Sharing, passion, involvement, listening are the keywords in the way we work and live in our company, which is moving from \u2018I\u2019 to \u2018We\u2019, putting people at the center. The future of work will promote new hybrid methods, including smart working and innovative organizational models, to create an ecosystem that ensures that everyone is comfortable in the new working environment. This is why we continue to carefully develop and strengthen our people empowerment processes, aimed at supporting the evolution of the organizational culture to enable people to become more effective in upcoming challenges. Trust, responsibility, proactivity and innovation are the key values of our Open Power approach, underpinning an open and dynamic working environment, which promotes entrepreneurship risk-taking and management of discontinuity, thanks to an increasing integration of diversity. Leadership is becoming \u2018gentle\u2019 and fosters people\u2019s talents, attitudes and aspirations. The \u2018new\u2019 leader is empathic, generous, able to inspire, to work in team to show the Company\u2019s collective approach in practice, and to listen in order to boost the potential of their teams. In this context, the necessary skills quickly evolve and upskilling and reskilling strategies assume more and more significance to enable the development of talent and contribute to socially responsible approaches, with the aim of supporting a just transition without leaving anyone behind. This is why we invest not only in technical tools but also in relational skills, also known as soft skills, and we are committed to proximity to people, including by means of increasing attention to caring activities and active listening, to both individuals and groups in various organizational contexts.\nMind the Gap \u2013 beyond gender bias... wittily\n\n\u201cWe wanted to invite everyone to reflect, in a witty and inclusive way, on the topic of gender bias in everyday work. It really was a wonderful feeling to see our project become a reality. We hope that it has helped to free us from these stereotypes, erasing or disposing of them, just like the characters in our cartoons do.\u201d\n\nIs remote working and sharing space with family members an act of heroism or a hindrance to work? The setting is unique, although the way we look at it and the language we use to speak with colleagues in this situation could be very different and reveal stereotypes that could also turn into discrimination.\n\nThis is why Enel has launched Mind the Gap, a global communication campaign to train people to recognize prejudices and discriminatory behavior, in a witty manner. A comic strip event to lift the veil from some of the subtle biases that still affect the female universe in companies and capture everyone\u2019s attention on the language we use in our everyday work, and on the impact of words, promoting behaviors that inspire well-being, inclusion and feeling welcome. Six cartoons have been made, available in different languages, in which the only hero is common sense: stereotypes are overcome and the ending is rewritten with fairness in mind. A call to action was also launched to bring in additional stories.\n\nThe campaign was conceived and developed taking as a starting point the experiences and shared sensibilities of a team of colleagues who work in male-dominated technical professional areas and who have firsthand experience of some of the biases represented. The concept of the campaign was created in-house and was presented at \u201cMake it happen!\u201d, a corporate entrepreneurship program aimed at contributing to corporate culture evolution by promoting innovation and entrepreneurship. The comic strips were also produced in-house.\n\nSusanna Sit\u00e0, Ludovica Maria Gasparini, Alessia Pastori, Francesca Dabene, Irene Varoli, Valeria Virginia Checchi, Laura Tempra, Chiara Cancemi, Chiara Bonci\n\n*Cartoons owned by Enel SpA.

This reduction is the effect of the net balance between new recruits and terminations in the year (-461 people) and the change in scope of consolidation (accounting overall for +23 people), including the sale of Enel Green Power Bulgaria and the acquisition of CityPoste Payment SpA in Italy.\n\nWorkforce by Business Line\n\n| Business Line                        | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2020 | Percentage on total at December 31, 2021 | Percentage on total at December 31, 2020 |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Thermal Generation and Trading       | 7,847             | 8,142             | 11.80%                                   | 12.20%                                   |\n| Enel Green Power                     | 8,989             | 8,298             | 13.50%                                   | 12.40%                                   |\n| Infrastructure & Networks            | 33,263            | 34,332            | 50.20%                                   | 51.50%                                   |\n| End-user Markets                     | 6,148             | 6,324             | 9.30%                                    | 9.50%                                    |\n| Enel X                               | 3,352             | 2,989             | 5.10%                                    | 4.50%                                    |\n| Services                             | 5,734             | 5,731             | 8.70%                                    | 8.60%                                    |\n| Holding and other                    | 946               | 901               | 1.40%                                    | 1.30%                                    |\n| **Total**                            | **66,279**        | **66,717**        | **100.0%**                               | **100.0%**                               |\n\nChange in total workforce\n\n| Workforce as of December 31, 2020 | 66,717 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|\n| New recruits                       | 5,401  |\n| Terminations                       | (5,862)|\n| Change in scope                    | 23     |\n| **Workforce as of December 31, 2021** | **66,279** |\n\nSince 2015, Enel has implemented the Open Power model of values and behaviors, which translates into operating aspects fostering engagement and participation of the people working at Enel, and constituting the point of reference to manage people and their development. The People and Organization Function defines the organizational models in line with the Group strategy. People selection, management and development processes are governed by specific global and local policies and procedures, that are posted to specific sections on the Company intranet. Enel\u2019s organizational model features a matrix consisting of Business Lines/Countries and Regions, alongside the Global Service and Holding Functions, aimed at supporting the business.\n\nIn 2021, a \u201cPandemic Emergency Management\u201d unit was created within the Holding People and Organization Function, with the aim of coordinating the management of the Covid-19 emergency in the Group, defining global policies and guidelines for the prevention of the risk of infection among our people and the reduction of impacts on business continuity, in compliance with national and international legislation, providing support for their implementation within the Group, according to a uniform approach that safeguards local specificities and constraints, and by constantly monitoring the trend of pandemic indicators in different Countries and Regions. The unit is also tasked with promoting activities to overcome the emergency phase and to transition to a new working model, in conjunction with the other corporate Functions involved. Last year, as a clear sign that we consider individual well-being as a key goal, we also set up a well-being and welfare global unit aiming at strengthening the bond between our workforce and their company.\n\nThe main data and strategic objectives relating to the People and Organization Function are illustrated to the Control and Risks Committee, to the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and to the Board of Directors, in dedicated meetings focusing on the Sustainability Plan, the Sustainability Report, and the evolution of Enel\u2019s position in the main ESG ratings and sustainability indices.\nWe promote inclusion: the CSR Europe think tank\n\nIn the last two years, together with CSR Europe, a European sustainability network, Enel has promoted multistakeholder initiatives and dialogue on a just transition and the future of work. In 2021, the Group cooperated with the network on the Inclusion Think Tank project, which brought together companies, NGOs and representatives of institutions to take stock of the main challenges and opportunities arising from the pandemic crisis, with a specific focus on the future of work and on three main lines: i) Work-Life Balance: Extended well-being; ii) New skills; iii) Diversity & Inclusion.\n\nAt the end of the project, a \u201cCompanies and the Inclusive Society\u201d Blueprint was drawn up, which highlights the key role of the human resources function in the process of integrating new approaches to work (creativity, innovation, development of human capital) and to ensure renewed interest in employee needs, well-being and inclusion.\n\nThe document was presented during the Creating a Future-Proof and Inclusive Work plenary session at the European SDG Summit, which was also attended by the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs & Inclusion and the Chairman of Enel.\nRemote working and well-being to handle the pandemic\n\nEnsuring staff safety and business continuity have been the priority objectives since the early stages of the Covid-19 emergency. In 2021, over 39,000 people worked remotely; experiments on hybrid forms of office-home work began in the second half of the year. The deep-routed digital and technological transformation of the Group has allowed to apply varying flexibility measures in our countries of presence. These are set out in the table below.\n\n| Flexibility measures | Italy | Spain | Romania | Russia | North America | Latin America(1) | Africa, Asia, Oceania | Europe |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|---------|--------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|\n| Part time            | \u2611     | \u2611     | \u2611       | \u2611      | \u2611             | \u2611                 | \u2611                    | \u2611      |\n| Smart working        | \u2611     | \u2611     | \u2611       | \u2611      | \u2611             | \u2611                 | \u2611                    | \u2611      |\n| Telework             | \u2611     | \u2611     | \u2611       | \u2611      | \u2611             | \u2611                 | \u2611                    | \u2611      |\n| Seasonal schedule    | \u2611     | \u2611     | \u2611       | \u2611      | \u2611             | \u2611                 | \u2611                    | \u2611      |\n| Short week           | \u2611     | \u2611     | \u2611       | \u2611      | \u2611             | \u2611                 | \u2611                    | \u2611      |\n| Time bank            | \u2611     | \u2611     | \u2611       | \u2611      | \u2611             | \u2611                 | \u2611                    | \u2611      |\n| Flexible time        | \u2611     | \u2611     | \u2611       | \u2611      | \u2611             | \u2611                 | \u2611                    | \u2611      |\n\n(1) Argentina (smart working), Brazil (smart working, time bank, flexible time), Chile (smart working, telework, flexible time, short week), Colombia (smart working, time bank, flexible time, short week), Peru (smart working, flexible time, seasonal schedule, short week), Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala (smart working, telework, flexible time, short week).\nSince the early stages of the outbreak and also for 2022, Enel entered into a global insurance policy for all employees, aimed at ensuring an additional benefit on top of the other policies and healthcare measures already in place to the people admitted to hospital as a result of Covid-19.\n\nIn Italy, a trade union agreement was also signed in the first stage of the outbreak in 2020, to protect people unable to work remotely (known as \u201cnon-remote employees\u201d) by creating a solidarity system whereby all employees could choose to donate one or more days of their holidays to them, which were matched by the Group with an equivalent number of days of leave. In 2021, Enel and the trade unions decided to use the unused positive balance of holidays donated and leave provided by the Company to assist with further difficulties experienced by Italian non-remote employees. Specifically, paid leave was granted in the event of precautionary quarantine or in presence of vulnerable workers or workers belonging to categories for which vaccination was not mandatory, fully paid leave was ensured (compared to half-paid leave as currently set by the regulations in force) both during the quarantine and in the event of Covid infection or interruption of school activities of children under 14, while for children aged 14-16, employees can apply for paid leave.\n\nTo provide emotional support for people to deal with the \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances of the Covid-19 outbreak and to stay close to people, a listening and psychological support service has been available since the beginning of the pandemic in the Group\u2019s main countries(1). The service is free, provided in different ways, active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and is delivered anonymously and confidentially.\n\nThe global well-being framework\n\nIn 2021, together with our people (in co-creation mode), a global well-being framework was defined, based on eight pillars that affect overall satisfaction with the centrality of people in mind, specifically considering the needs that have emerged:\n\n- **psychological well-being**, more broadly \u201cfeeling comfortable in one\u2019s own skin\u201d, involving the management of perceived stress and individual skills of coping with stress;\n- **work-life harmony**, balance between working and family life, involving the management of working time and disconnection, taking due account of the person\u2019s family commitments (children, caring for elderly and/or disabled relatives);\n- **physical well-being**, intended as inspiration to take care of one\u2019s own physical health;\n- **social well-being**, intended as a sense of connection and belonging to the communities in which the person participates socially;\n- **economic well-being**, intended as a sense of satisfaction with the family\u2019s economic situation;\n- **sense of protection**, intended as a sense of security perceived by the person with respect to the occurrence of unpleasant events;\n- **ethical well-being**, intended as satisfaction with the value, meaning and purpose of the person\u2019s life;\n- **cultural well-being**, intended as \u201cfeeling encouraged to grow and learn new things\u201d.\n\nHow these eight factors act on the overall well-being depends on individual and cultural factors. That is why we carried out our first survey in this sense in order to measure the level of well-being and identify the most important initiatives for people, with a shared metric in the countries where Enel operates that covers intercultural differences. The results of the survey will enable an evaluation of the best actions to be taken, through a decision-making process that will involve an international, heterogeneous and multicultural team.\n\n---\n\n(1) Italy, Spain, Romania, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Panama, Costa Rica and Guatemala, Mexico, United States and Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, Greece, Turkey, France, Germany, Poland, Norway, Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan. These countries represent 98% of Enel people.\nCreating a Healthy Workplace\n\nThe WELL Building Standard explores how design, site management, and behaviors where we live, work, or generally interact can be improved to promote human health and well-being. Milan Carducci was the first Enel site to obtain WELL certification (November 2021), as well as the first location in Italy to achieve WELL Platinum status; the goal in 2022 is to obtain certification at certain buildings under renovation in LATAM, in particular at the sites in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and in Lima, Peru.\n\nIn 2021 we also joined the WELL Portfolio, a program that involves 549 sites \u2013 541 of which are in Italy, 2 in Peru, 4 in Brazil, 2 in Colombia \u2013 affecting over 30,000 employees; the objective of the Portfolio is, where possible, to extend on a large scale the logic of design and management of the site, but also the policies and initiatives, aimed at protecting people\u2019s good health and well-being, raising personal awareness of the adoption of healthy dietary habits and psychological/physical well-being. This program provides a score \u2013 regardless of whether the individual site has obtained certification \u2013 to indicate the application of the Enel WELL principles, which is updated over time and denotes progress made.\n\nThe features of WELL that promote air and water quality, natural light and the use of sustainable materials are complemented by those that require organizational transparency, training and information, access to health services and education. In other words, the requirements for WELL certification are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nInvesting in our people\n\nIn the current scenario of transformation and uncertainty, which requires new skills, professionalism and flexibility of adaptation, our ambition is to foster the empowerment of people, engaging and motivating them to reach their full potential and providing them with opportunities for personal and professional growth, to guarantee and support the achievement of the Group\u2019s strategic objectives. The selection and recruiting, training and development processes therefore play a key role.\n\nAttracting new talent\n\nDespite the pandemic, over 5,400 new people were recruited in 2021, partly thanks to the strengthening of relations with universities and to the Recruiting Day, carried out at a global level, and relying on an aptitude model based on the various positions to be filled. All open positions in the Group can be consulted on the enel.com website, in the \u201cCareers\u201d section.\n\nThe new digital tools supporting the selection process have made it possible, even during the pandemic, to fully engage and include all the candidates thanks to the use of gamification and an artificial intelligence-supported video interview aimed at deepening the knowledge of the young talents aptitudes.\n\nOver the last year, several initiatives, most of which have been digital, have been developed in relation to talent attraction and employer branding, aimed at building a corporate identity that is attractive to potential candidates and that includes the transmission of the value structure in the workplace, to immediately engage the interest of young people who could take a position at the Company in the future. The #OurPeopleOurEnergy social media campaign has been launched, with content dedicated to the enhancement of people and their stories, including with the use of testimonials: \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to work at Enel?\u201d. All the pages relating to our brands have been integrated into the Enel Group\u2019s and our brand positioning on the job boards (Indeed and Glassdoor) has been optimized. In order to match candidates with the profiles we are looking for, we have an application tracking system that picks up applications made via the various channels, to guarantee a uniform user experience for candidates all over the world.\n\nEnel\u2019s evolution in the field of talent identification begins with the direct, open and transparent involvement of every person in the Group in the selection and development pro-\n\n---\n\n(2) Fixed-term contracts are used to a limited extent, to cope with peaks in activity or to temporarily replace workers on extended leave (for example, maternity/paternity leave, etc.) and are paid wages at the same level as permanent workers.\n\n(3) The average \u201cStory Reach Rate\u201d for the campaign was 6%, about 3 percentage points higher than the average benchmark value recorded by RivalIQ. The campaign\u2019s Retention Rate was 74%, meaning that three quarters of people viewed the content from start to finish.\ncesses, with a view to inclusion and participation in corporate life. In 2021, the pilot version of the \u201cReferral Program\u201d was launched, to search for talent via two pathways:\n\n- **external**: every person at Enel can help to find people who could become new colleagues in the outside world;\n- **internal**: once a year, it is possible to recommend a colleague for advancement in their professional development.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, 1,072 referrals had been made.\n\nFinally, mobility at work was enhanced again in 2021, enabling people to open up to new professional challenges, facilitating the diversification of competencies, and creating increasingly horizontal profiles. To this end, new regulations have been released at a global level, by integrating also the e-profile tool as an opportunity to enhance people\u2019s hard and soft skills, their aspirations and their motivations for change.\n\n### Valuing and enhancing our people\n\nIn 2021, the process of qualitative and quantitative performance appraisal saw the engagement of Group people at various levels in a process of exchange and constant discussion that shifted the focus towards the organizational network as a model for growth and self-empowerment rather than pursuing a hierarchical model. In particular, a new evaluation model has been developed and extended to the entire Group: Open Feedback Evaluation (OFE), which encourages constant listening and constructive and transparent dialogue between people, networks and managers, in full compliance with the Code of Ethics.\n\nThe program, which involved 100% of the eligible people in the Group, has significant distinctive features compared to the past. In particular, in order to create constant dialogue between and with people, the evaluation has become continuous and all-encompassing, with three scheduled times for discussion between managers and employees during the year.\n\nThe new OFE model consists of three interdependent dimensions:\n\n- **\u201cTalent\u201d**, consisting of highlighting one\u2019s individual skills based on the 15 Soft Skills Model and linked to the 4 Open Power values of Trust, Responsibility, Innovation and Proactivity;\n- **\u201cGenerosity\u201d**, intended as the propensity to enter into relationships with others, dedicating time to acknowledging talent and getting involved in turn, requesting feedback proactively, thus generating a mechanism of individual and collective growth;\n- **\u201cAction\u201d**, i.e. employees\u2019 ability to achieve professional objectives, as evaluated by their managers.\n\nAlso in 2021, the succession planning took place, the annual process involving Group managers in the identification of high-potential colleagues available to fill managerial roles in the short term (ready) and in the medium term (pipeline). To accompany successor development in relation to their potential positions, the appointing manager, the manager responsible and the People and Organization Function identify shared development actions, based on individual and professional profile. Successor identification follows criteria based on meritocracy, diversity and the horizontal nature of the profiles, and requires a major focus on gender equality. In particular, 42.7% of the successors earmarked are women. The commitment to gender equality can also be seen in the managerial appointment process: compared to 2020, the proportion of female managers increased by 2%, from 21.6% in 2020 to 23.6% in 2021.\n\n---\n\n(4) Eligible and reachable: those on a permanent contract, currently working and active for at least three months of 2021.\nListening and dialogue\n\nBy listening to the Group\u2019s people, Enel has devised specific action plans for the various business areas in relation to the main needs that have emerged (meritocracy, personal development, work-life balance, etc.). In late 2020, the global \u201cOpen Listening: An interview to build our future\u201d program was launched. The global initiative, in which 70% of employees actively participated, provided significant feedback on the in-house climate but also on working conditions, asking colleagues to imagine the future in the era of the \u201cnext normal\u201d: from remote working methods to spaces, from new technologies to the leadership models of the future. The overall level of people\u2019s engagement was 93.5%.\n\nIn 2021, the \u201cEmployer Value Proposition\u201d survey was also launched, aimed at detecting the aspects of the working environment considered valuable and distinctive to the Group: as part of the project, the Net Promoter Score was also determined, i.e. the indicator that measures employee satisfaction and the main characteristics associated with the Enel brand as an \u201cemployer of choice\u201d. Sustainability, innovation, safety in the workplace and work-life balance are the main attributes that have emerged, which also coincide with the preferences people stated when choosing where they want to work.\n\nOther listening initiatives have been carried out in relation to well-being and disability; more details are provided in the relevant sections of this chapter.\n\nA further essential element is People Business Partners, figures dedicated to listening and dialogue with people, able to grasp individual aspirations and integrate them with the organization\u2019s needs.\n\nFinally, Enel considers internal communication a mainstay in the creation of corporate culture, people growth and the growth of the organization, stimulating and promoting the exchange of information, knowhow and experience. Internal communications are also the main vector to disseminate the Enel strategy and the objectives identified for the near future.\n\nLifelong learning to encourage our people to participate in cultural evolution\n\nThe rapid and continuous evolution of the business determines the need for new technical and professional profiles and the natural disappearance of others. In this context, the central pillars of our learning strategy are:\n\n\u2022 \"lifelong learning\": to ensure the constant updating and competitiveness of our people;\n\u2022 reskilling programs, aimed at learning new skills to fill positions or roles different from the previous ones taken;\n\u2022 upskilling initiatives, to optimize performance to meet new requirements.\n\nAs such, everyone has the opportunity to make an active contribution, to be motivated and to work in a context of well-being, thus contributing to the achievement of the Group\u2019s strategic objectives. During 2021, various actions were taken to promote the dissemination of issues related to upskilling and reskilling, involving both the Global Business Lines and individual countries. In particular, a global challenge was launched, 36 interviews were conducted with senior executives on current and future skills and a working group was launched to draft guidelines and map projects by adopting a shared taxonomy. European networking has been strengthened by means of two major interventions: signing up for the CSR Europe Upskill 4 Future initiative with e-distribuzione\u2019s \u201cPeople Business Partner R-evolution\u201d, intended for People Business Partners, the first facilitators of the energy transition in accompanying people in their professional pathway of growth, and the contribution to the drafting of the Joint Declaration between the European Social Partners, the Joint Statement on Just Transition, signed in November 2021.\n\nDespite the global pandemic crisis, the adaptability and versatility of technological platforms have made it possible to guarantee the continuity of the training offer, to make it more scalable and effective, building advanced learning experiences and contributing to the consolidation of our people\u2019s digital skills. In 2021, the training budget was increased by more than 10%, to approximately 20 million euros, with an average cost per employee of 306.3 euros;\n\n(5) The Climate Survey takes place every two years and 70% of redemption referred to \u201cOpen Listening: An interview to build our future\u201d, conducted in 2020. The deviation from the 86% redemption expected for 2021 (data in line with the previous 2018 Climate Survey), is as a result of a forecast made before the pandemic emergency and the change of global scenario that led, among other factors, to exclude communication channels generally used for this type of campaigns.\n95.7% of the workforce took part in over 3.2 million hours of training (about 44 hours per head), around 500,000 hours more than the previous year, thanks to some of the training courses having been redesigned to be conducted remotely.\n\nEnel\u2019s new training paradigm aims to contribute to the empowerment of people through the expansion of their knowledge, in line with the Group\u2019s values and with the development of the 15 horizontal skills deemed crucial. In a perspective of transmission of knowledge, generosity and sharing in intergenerational exchange, training initiatives have been promoted, aimed at \u201ctraining the trainer\u201d. The aim of this initiative is to strengthen the involvement of people with greater seniority as internal or external trainers, leveraging their experience and capitalizing on their skills with a view to developing the business community, as well as \u2018returning\u2019 knowledge to the ecosystem, with circularity of knowledge in mind.\n\nIn addition, cultural orientation and training programs have been developed and launched on the model of gentle leadership that puts the person at the center in a new dimension led by example, inspiration, distribution of responsibility, trust and sharing. In 2022, this program is expected to involve the entire global scope of the Company.\n\nIn terms of digital skills, in 2021 Enel involved over 80% of people in dedicated training activities; the 2021 goal of digital sustainability was reached courtesy of the contribution of the countries and Business Lines. For this purpose, more than 20 initiatives have been implemented that promote different concepts related to digital sustainability, grouped into 7 different areas: awareness, customer centricity, operational efficiency, smart grid, digital support, circular economy and e-mobility. These initiatives have reached 70% of the population, with an aim of raising awareness of the opportunities offered by technology, increasing sustainability and minimizing the environmental impact by improving the ecosystem in which Enel operates.\n\nIn 2021, the Schools and Academies developed training programs focused on responding to the specific needs of Enel\u2019s various organizational areas. These pathways were taken in conjunction with strategic university and academic partners, managed by the Enel Foundation. Over 15 Schools and Academies were active in 2021, with numerous editions delivered over the year, covering most of the Business Lines and Global Business Lines. The Schools and Academies, together with the training actions of upskilling, reskilling and external reskilling, contribute to enhancing the technical knowledge of the people who inhabit the Enel community in a context increasingly characterized by the ongoing energy transition.\n\nFinally, Enel\u2019s commitment to raising awareness of anticorruption issues remains strong: the interventions to disseminate knowledge of ISO 37001 certification for the Group\u2019s Italian companies, Model 231 and Global Compliance reached a course redemption level of around 80%, while in 2021, the new training course on the new Enel Code of Ethics was launched globally, having been updated in 2020.\n\nInclusion and uniqueness\n\nThe inclusion of diversity and the leveraging of people\u2019s multiple and unique talents are essential factors in the creation of long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders. Inclusion = Value is the paradigm that substantiates this approach, an increasingly relevant one in view of the changing conditions we are experiencing in the business, where the ability to imagine new scenarios and to dynamically co-create innovative solutions by leveraging the varied mix of individual characteristics is fundamental. For Enel, inclusion means creating open and welcoming contexts and ensuring the organizational and interpersonal conditions that enable us to take care of people, ensuring their individualities enter into conversation, so that everyone can freely express their unique value.\n\nThe approach is therefore based on the principles of non-discrimination, equal opportunities, dignity, work-life balance and inclusion of every person, beyond any form of diversity, and is substantiated in an organic set of actions that promote the care and expression of everyone\u2019s talents, an inclusive and bias-free organizational culture and a coherent mix of skills, quality and experiences that create value for people and the business. The action plan for diversity and inclusion takes the form of specific public commitments stated in the Sustainability Plan, approved as part of the Sustainability Report by the corporate governance bodies: balancing the two genders in selection processes; increasing the percentage of female managers and middle managers and the number of female students involved in initiatives related to the STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics); adopting a systemic approach to the inclusion of disability; disseminating a bias-free culture attentive to intercultural differences; supporting flexibility at work. Among the most significant initiatives developed in 2021 were the actions dedicated to a systematic impact on the various aspects of the gender gap and the inclusion of disability, specific listening and support services made available to people during the pandemic, projects dedicated to people with\nvulnerabilities, awareness initiatives on LGBTQ+ issues and cultural diversity.\n\nBack in 2013, Enel issued its Policy on Human Rights, followed in 2015 by the Diversity and Inclusion Policy, in parallel with the adoption of the seven Women Empowerment Principles (WEP) promoted by the UN Global Compact and UN Women, in compliance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In 2019, the Workplace Harassment Policy was also published, which spells out respect for individual integrity and dignity in the workplace and addresses the topic of sexual and discrimination-related harassment. In 2020, these principles were recalled in the Statement against harassment in the workplace, published on Enel\u2019s website. In 2021, to ensure equal opportunities for access to digital information and systems, the global policy on digital accessibility was issued.\n\nThe People Care and Diversity Management Holding unit, founded in 2016 and merged in 2021 into P&O \u2013 Global Industrial Relations, Welfare and Well-being, performs governance functions globally on these issues, ensuring coordination and monitoring of local initiatives, and sharing of best practice. Indicators measuring progress on diversity and inclusion are the focus of a prompt global reporting process.\n\nIn Italy and Spain, there are also specific \u201cEqual Opportunities Committees\u201d, which also involve the civil society partners who contribute to the identification of needs and the proposal of solutions in terms of inclusion, while in Colombia, Peru, Mexico and Enel X Europe, there are specific Diversity & Inclusion Committees.\n\nThe commitment and transparency shown in favor of gender inclusion were confirmed by Enel\u2019s appearance in the main rankings, ratings and ESG indices:\n\n- in early 2022, for the third time, Bloomberg included Enel and its subsidiaries Endesa and Enel Chile in the Gender Equality Index. The index acknowledged the actions taken to promote the presence of women on the Board, in managerial positions and in new recruits, the contribution in terms of equal pay, the conception of social benefits and work-life reconciliation solutions, and the prevention of harassment;\n- in 2022, for the third year running, Enel is one of the Top 100 companies in the Equileap Gender Equality Global Report & Ranking, and is the leading Italian company in the field. This positioning is the result of actions aimed at promoting the presence of women in the Board of Directors, in managerial positions and in selection, for the contribution to equal pay and the promotion of well-being and the integration of life and work for all employees. In addition, Enel\u2019s practices to promote human rights, freedom from violence, abuse and sexual harassment were also acknowledged;\n- in 2021, Enel was also confirmed in the Refinitiv Diversity and Inclusion Index, taking first place in the industrial grouping \u201cElectric Utilities and Independent Power Producers\u201d and seventh place in the Top 100, for the growing presence of women at all levels of the organization and for the Company\u2019s engagement on the transparency of the results obtained in terms of D&I, including externally.\n\nIn 2021, Enel also received the Impulsa Talento Femenino award in Chile for the presence of women including at managerial level, and in Italy the Lifeed Caring Company 2022 award, which promotes companies committed to enhancing the synergy between private life and work, to promote the diversity and uniqueness of each person. Finally, Enel North America was rated Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion in the Disability Equality Index and Mexico was awarded the \u201cEntrale\u201d Badge for its initiatives to include people with disabilities.\n\nAn inclusive culture in progress\n\nAt Enel, the evolution of the culture of inclusion has been supported over the years by intensive communications and awareness-raising at every level and in every organizational context. Each year, a specific theme has been developed to inspire both the campaigns and the wide range of events held: in 2017, the central topic was the enhancement of all diversities; in 2018, inclusion as a source of value for people and for the business; in 2019, sustainable value generated by inclusive behaviors; and in 2020, individual responsibility in genuine inclusion, even at a distance.\n\nIn 2021, two global training campaigns were launched, focused on bias and harassment in the workplace, intended for all Enel people. In particular, \u201cOltre i Bias\u201d (\u201cBeyond Bias\u201d), an initiative aimed at training people to identify the most common biases occurring at work (affinity, availability, halo, bandwagon and confirmation). These are often unconsciously triggered attitudes and the campaign points in a witty way at how to avoid them. In addition, in terms of gender bias, Mind the Gap has been launched. A global comic book campaign, it gently lifts the veil from some of the clich\u00e9s still encountered in the female universe in companies (for more details, see the specific inset in this chapter).\n\n(6) https://www.enel.com/content/dam/enel-com/documenti/investitori/sostenibilita/enel-statement-against-harassment.pdf.\nTo raise awareness of the global policy on harassment, the Harassment in the Workplace course, already carried out in Italian, has also been localized into Spanish and English and assigned in the countries that speak these languages. The course explores four realistic cases related to discrimination over age, disability, LGBTQ+ and sexual harassment.\n\nIn addition, many networks and/or communities within the Group are active in terms of:\n- **gender** (\u201cYin Yang\u201d in Mexico, \u201cWomen in Leadership\u201d in Chile, \u201cWomen in Energy\u201d in Peru, \u201cHer Community\u201d in Greece, \u201cThe Ladies\u2019 Room\u201d for the Enel X European countries);\n- **disability** (the global \u201cDisability Community Network\u201d for focal points on disability, \u201cComunidad de inclusi\u00f3n\u201d in Spain, \u201cDisability Community\u201d in Italy, specific networks in Mexico and Russia);\n- **LGBTQ+** (\u201cJust Be\u201d in Mexico, \u201cUn equipo con orgullo\u201d in Chile);\n- **age** (\u201cBeyond Generations\u201d in Mexico);\n- **ethnicity** (\u201cExpat Network\u201d in Mexico).\n\n### Multiple dimensions of uniqueness\n\nValuing people\u2019s uniqueness means bringing out and giving voice to each of the multiple dimensions in which it is expressed. Each individual represents a mix of skills, experiences, abilities, history and sensibilities, all of which contribute to their identity and are given the opportunity to be reflected in everyday work. However, there are aspects and dimensions that need to be acknowledged within organizations to enable everyone to express their potential in full. Different generations coexist in organizations and the exchange of skills and experience remains central to value creation. Again in 2021, this exchange involved hundreds of Enel people, junior and senior, in all the countries where the Company operates and the Business Lines, working on internal training, coaching, mentoring, shadowing and ambassador experiences on technical topics and soft skills.\n\nTo address the topic of age management systemically and through a new lens, in 2021 the Age-ility@work project was launched, an innovative co-creation pathway in which 40 people of different generations from all the Group\u2019s businesses took as a starting point the intergenerational experience gained in the organization and explored the territories of neuroscience and anti-fragility. They entered into discussion and identified concrete actions to be taken to encourage the adoption of a new mindset in an intergenerational perspective. In addition, over 1,400 people in Italy have engaged in the Re-generation program, created in conjunction with UniNettuno University, dedicated to the upskilling of staff over 50 on topics related to data management, artificial intelligence and innovation. A number of webinars have been organized to develop awareness of inclusive language in terms of age. For **outgoing staff**, Peru has proposed a pathway to deal with the change and ensure better quality of life (\u201cPensando en tu futuro\u201d); in Italy, counseling is offered, aimed at dealing with this time mindfully and constructively.\n\nGlobally, a tutor accompanies the onboarding period of **new recruits** and facilitates the integration of **expats** in their destination country.\n\nIn terms of LGBTQ+, during the year a team was created to explore these issues in the Group and to promote cultural change via actions that support full inclusion in the working environment. In this regard, two major measures taken in line with the Group\u2019s inclusive vision are worthy of note: in Italy, the extension of parental leave to same-sex couples, to meet childcare needs and offer them the same opportunities for protection as for the children of heterosexual couples, and in Peru the extension of health insurance coverage to cohabiting same-sex couples. Along this pathway, many countries have begun to cooperate with external associations and networks in order to promote actions aimed at enhancing talent regardless of identity, gender expression and sexual orientation. Italy is associated with Parks \u2013 Liberi e Uguali, Spain with REDI, Colombia, Chile and Mexico with Pride Connection. Some countries (Italy, Romania, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Poland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, France, Germany, Greece, Australia, South Africa, South Korea) have organized awareness-raising, training and communications campaigns to reflect on inclusive language, shed light on stereotypes and explore specific aspects of LGBTQ+ living, in particular for IDAHOBIT Day(7).\n\n---\n\n(7) International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia and Transphobia.\nEnel believes that cultural and ethnic diversity represent an extraordinary wealth, and is therefore committed to promoting and enhancing the knowledge, relationships and cross-fertilization between different cultures. The Company\u2019s commitment to promoting cultural diversity is represented by our people, who are of 80 nationalities and speak 24 different languages in the various countries where we operate.\n\nIn order to enhance this ethnic and cultural diversity, an analysis was carried out in 2021 to consider the option of stating this information in the various Countries and Regions. The analysis showed that most countries have legal and privacy protection constraints that do not allow this identification, while in some countries, including Argentina, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Canada, Brazil and the United States, data collection is allowed only on a voluntary basis.\n\nIn Brazil, to promote interculturality, 40% of internship positions were filled by black candidates, and a webinar was held on Black Awareness Day with in-house and external guests; for all managers and the P&O family, an in-depth study was also proposed on racial prejudice. Peru organized a workshop on the topic of the value of ethno-racial, identity and sexual intersections in working environments. Workshops on cross-cultural awareness and Spanish Heritage have been organized in the United States. In Mexico, informative materials on local culture and witty representations were provided on the needs of expatriate colleagues. Russia granted an extra day off according to national and religious holidays and launched an online contest on the culinary traditions of the various nations.\n\nCultures in dialogue\n\nIn order to create a unique language among the ethnicities and cultures present within the Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation Business Line, the WIRED: Connecting intercultural skills project was carried out, to raise awareness of cognitive/relational dynamics with interculturalism in mind. Initially intended for 200 key figures in Engineering & Construction from 19 countries, who were heavily exposed to international contexts, it was then extended to all employees and could be accessed via the e-ducation training platform. The course, consisting of three modules (\u201cBreaking Bias\u201d, \u201cCultural Sensitivity\u201d and \u201cLanguage & Communication\u201d), has been enhanced by the creation of a series of \u201cQuick Start Guides\u201d. In addition to retracing the topics covered, the guides also include monographs on the historical, political, cultural, religious and traditional aspects of the specific geographical regions considered in the training sessions, and a series of suggestions and Q&As on how to communicate and local customs. The online course, which can also be accessed flexibly as a podcast, has been created to fulfill the accessibility by design requirements for the content, to ensure maximum inclusiveness of every colleague\u2019s experiences. The course served as an opportunity for exchange and cross-fertilization, focusing on the typical skills of intercultural sensitivity in terms of understanding different points of view, tolerance of ambiguity, listening, observation but also the ability to prevent prejudices and to understand and constructively use stereotypes as a complex skill, with the capability to pay proper attention to non-verbal language as well.\nTaking action to close the gender gap\n\nIn 2021, Enel continued its commitment to overcoming the gender gap and achieving wage equality with an organic approach of actions that influence all phases of women\u2019s journey in the organization: from representation at entry level to empowerment and development in positions of responsibility, paying attention to various relevant moments in life, such as becoming parents and personal or family care.\n\nThe gender gap action plan consists of measures that directly and indirectly affect equal pay, given the fact that the gradual increase in female representation at different organizational levels is a prerequisite for natural generational exchange and thus for achieving parity in remuneration over time.\n\nThe indirect measures include a steady increase in women joining the Company and in positions of responsibility in the organization. Selection processes are closely monitored to ensure a fair balance of the two genders in the candidate pools, with a rising trend in the last five years (52.1% in 2021). The commitment to the growth of women in positions of responsibility is also significant: 23.6% of managers were women in 2021 (21.6% in 2020), and 31.4% of middle managers were female (30.4% in 2020), with an increase in the ratio between female managers and middle managers of 4%. Various actions have been taken at a global level, including the introduction to the Long Term-Incentive Plan 2021 of a new performance target, with weighting of 5% of the total: the \u201cpercentage of women in managerial succession plans\u201d by the end of 2023. This is an objective for all managers at Enel and its subsidiaries, including the Enel Chief Executive Officer, who occupy top positions of strategic interest to the Group; the powerful commitment in the Enel Group to ensuring equal representation of women is therefore emphasized, including in pools for managerial succession plans, and the increasing attention paid to the topic of \u201cgender equality\u201d is leveraged.\n\nAs at late 2021, women account for 22.5% of the entire Group workforce, whereas they cover around 15.7% of executive positions (CEO-1) out of the total of these positions (3 out of 19).\n\nThe direct measures include internal policies addressing succession plan management and salary review processes, which take into account gender diversity dimensions, as well as the allocation of a budget dedicated to ensuring equal pay for equivalent roles. In addition, the commitment to promote gender equality also resulted in setting a specific MBO 2021 track as part of the MBO objectives assigned to the management of the People and Organization Function.\n\nFor the purposes of monitoring equal pay, the number and proportion of female managers show a trend of steady increase over the years; in particular, in 2021 there was an increase of 2% (from 21.6% to 23.6%) in the percentage of women managers, and this led to a slight decrease in the Equal Remuneration Ratio (ERR), which went from 83.3% to 81.1%. All the actions taken to advance women\u2019s standing are also continuing, not only in senior management, the effects of which will be fully appreciable in the medium to long term, also taking into account the generational dynamic.\n\n---\n\n(8) Women working in managerial roles (managers and middle managers) in revenue-generating business areas account for 23.2%, up from 22.1% in 2020.\nIn countries where the Group maintains a presence, numerous initiatives are in place to promote the empowerment of women and a leadership style inspired by female models, such as \u201cEmpowering Conversations\u201d among female managers and colleagues of both genders, the \u201cForo Liderazgo Feminino\u201d symposium and the \u201cMujeres Fuera de la Caja\u201d in Peru.\n\nAs far as the parental dimension is concerned, in all Group countries the \u201cParental Program\u201d is active, aimed at promoting organizational and personal awareness of the culture of parenthood and at reconciling personal and professional needs in this stage in life, a fundamental one for both parents. The program is based on the values of trust, care and engagement, and provides for a structured process of interviews between the new parent, the manager and the People Business Partner, before and after returning to the Company. The program is supported by a single information point that offers all the information, services and training initiatives relevant in facilitating a return to the Company, in supporting work-life balance, and in promoting the motivation and organization of activities.\n\nIn 2021, the percentage of women in the Group working in STEM roles reached 18%, compared to 16.6% in 2020. Increasing importance is also accorded to supporting initiatives that promote the presence of women in study and professional pathways in STEM fields, in conjunction with schools, universities and institutions, to overcome gender stereotypes and disseminate the importance of the technical and scientific culture, increasingly integrated with the humanistic dimension. These initiatives over the last six years to raise awareness and orientation towards the STEM world have involved over 20,000 female students, confirming Enel\u2019s significant investment in directing the talent of women due to take up the professions of the future in the coming years. In particular, in 2021 in Italy the \u201cTech Talk\u201d cycle of inspirational digital meetings continued with domestically and internationally renowned female role models from the world of science, culture and entrepreneurship, as did meetings in the school-business system (promoted by ELIS); in Brazil, the volunteer program \u201cMujeres de Energ\u00eda\u201d was held, as part of \u201cRede do Bem\u201d, aimed at female university, high school and technical students; and in Spain the STEM workshops \u201cOrienta-T\u201d and \u201cElla te cuenta\u201d were held aimed at young people. Numerous initiatives were also focused on career guidance, such as \u201cP-tech\u201d (promoted by IBM) in Italy and \u201cSTEM Talent\u201d in Peru, and on social inclusion, such as \u201cSchool4Life\u201d (promoted by ELIS) and the STEM summer camp \u201cBrindisi Brilla\u201d, aimed at students in areas of Italy at high risk of dropping out of school, and the \u201cPlan Semilla\u201d in Colombia, which trains and offers job opportunities to young and adult women in conditions of social hardship. Various meetings also took place at universities in Italy, the United States, Central America, Russia and Greece, aimed at raising awareness of the Group and the main professional profiles required in the STEM field. Mexico finally opened the doors of the two sites at Villanueva and Magdalena II with a virtual tour, while Colombia created STEM summer camps for employees\u2019 daughters.\n\nFinally, all countries have held numerous events for International Women\u2019s Day and the International Day against Violence against Women, to celebrate the value of women and equal opportunities and raise awareness of respect for rights and overcoming gender bias.\n\nIn February 2021, to confirm its commitment to these issues, Enel joined the \u201cEqual by 30\u201d campaign, promoted by Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM), the initiative whereby various public and private sector organizations have committed to promoting gender equality in terms of pay, leadership and opportunities in the clean energy sector by 2030. Three specific commitments have been made to raising the awareness of an increasing number of girls towards STEM disciplines and professions, fair representation of women in selection shortlists, and growth in the number of women in managerial positions. Enel Chile adheres to \u201cEnerg\u00eda+MUJER\u201d, which aims to promote the participation and leadership of women in the energy sector.\n\nIn October 2021, during the G20 Women\u2019s Forum Italy, Enel signed the \u201cTowards the Zero Gender Gap\u201d CEO Champion Commitment, aimed at promoting ever greater gender equality, diversity and inclusion.\nValue for Disability\n\nTo ensure the full inclusion of people with disabilities and in line with the approach indicated by the UN Convention, Enel provides tools, services and working methods, and promotes initiatives aimed at creating an accessible environment that promotes the independent expression of the talents and potential of everyone in the organization. Globally, there are 2,152 people with disabilities and the topic is particularly relevant for Italy (1,612 colleagues with disabilities, around 75% of the Group total). In countries where the legislation provides for minimum quotas for the inclusion of people with disabilities, the Company is in line with the regulatory provisions, and in some cases resorts to compensatory measures as required by law. In all countries with people with disabilities, there is a focal point of reference to respond to specific needs and to devise dedicated initiatives. In 2021, a community was also created that connects all focal points for disability, a global network that acts to share best practices, offer support between countries and contribute to the implementation of specific projects.\n\nThe public commitment made as part of the Valuable 500 global initiative resulted in the 2020 Value for Disability global project, aimed at fulfilling the potential and promoting the full inclusion of people with disabilities at a corporate, social and economic level, at developing specific global and local action plans, including by means of discussion with associations and benchmarking with other companies, which are currently being implemented in line with the priorities identified in the Sustainability Plan. The project is organized into cross-Functional teams, operating in different countries and coordinated by a global team. As part of the 2021 action plan, awareness-raising and training events have been held in the various countries, aimed at staff and/or specific professional families, caregivers, those who work in direct contact with customers and suppliers. The empowerment of colleagues with disabilities has been promoted: for example, in Italy training sessions have been organized for the use of assistive technologies; in Romania, workshops have been held to develop skills; in Argentina, a dedicated counseling service has been set up; in Brazil, a tutoring service has been provided for people with disabilities who are smart working. Several countries have launched employer branding initiatives (Spain, Greece, Chile, Mexico), while others have launched selection initiatives to hire people with disabilities (Spain, Romania, Colombia, Brazil and Mexico). In Spain, a mandatory online course has been devised to explore and overcome disability-related bias, as well as interactive workshops, \u201cDisability with no fear\u201d, attended by over 3,000 people.\n\nGlobal initiatives are also being developed to ensure that the needs of Enel people with disabilities are listened to and known, to facilitate their active participation in organizational life and to ensure attention to specific needs in terms of physical and digital accessibility, health and safety. With regard to the horizontal projects, accessibility adaptation has been completed in various tools related to People and Organization, as has the WIN Questionnaire, a listening and awareness tool that evaluates the quality of interaction in the working environment and identifies their needs, participation and perception of the support offered by the organization. Various initiatives relating to digital accessibility have been carried out: the issue of a specific policy on digital accessibility, the preparation of a catalogue of assistive technologies, the extension of the service desk for colleagues with disabilities in Spain.\n\nCaring for all\n\nEnel promotes the value of care in all situations, including contingencies, that an individual may be required to deal with during their working life, and offers benefits and services that support the integration between private and working life. In 2021, caring initiatives dedicated to individuals and their families continued. A few examples of initiatives in the different countries where the Group maintains a presence are provided below.\n\n(9) The initiatives carried out involve all staff (Spain, Chile, Colombia, Greece, Romania, South Africa, Australia, India), the People and Organization professional family (Italy, Brazil, Romania, Peru), management (Spain, Brazil, Romania, United States), caregivers (South Africa, Morocco, Argentina) and those who work in direct contact with customers (Argentina, Romania, Colombia) and suppliers (Spain).\nCaring for people\n\nIn Italy, webinars have been organized on digital education, as have workshops with philosophers and writers on eating disorders; a dietician has been employed by the Company, with free consultations; video clips on dietary well-being, physical activity and good posture have been published on the corporate intranet. The promotion of physical well-being is encouraged in Italy by means of a specific agreement with the networks of gyms throughout the country, and likewise in Spain under the \u201cPrograma Entr\u00e9nate\u201d, which encourages physical activity. Colombia works systemically on these issues via its \u201cEstrategia de Felicidad Organizacional\u201d, which identifies elements such as consistency, gratitude, service, compassion and resilience as the fundamentals of happiness, affecting the full development of the person, the working environment and the organization\u2019s results. Among all the various experiences, Mexico stands out for promoting an integrated approach between well-being, engagement and happiness, expressed in the \u201cBecome and Engage \u2013 BE Program\u201d project, which includes a wide range of activities associated with a gamification system and provides access to benefits and supplementary welfare services. Of the initiatives taken by Enel to support people, including during the pandemic, particular attention was paid in Italy to those suffering from a chronic disease, as part of the \u201cMaCro@Work Caring Program\u201d. The initiative is a major step in awareness of a highly delicate issue, to enhance the relationship between the Company and our people with the aim of promoting the social and working inclusion of all employees. In 2021, the project was operationally launched in Italy with the training and creation of the network of Caring Managers, People & Business Partners who voluntarily applied to support \u2018vulnerable\u2019 colleagues by providing active listening and support to search for the most suitable solution to create an inclusive environment for the colleague experiencing difficulties, as well as for their entire working environment. Another corporate solidarity project launched in Italy is HeLP Me, a caring service for colleagues who are in a situation of temporary or permanent need, for example motherhood, convalescence, chronic illness or disability, who can request support from a network of volunteer colleagues available to provide their time.\n\nCaring for families\n\nIn most countries services and support are provided, including financially, focused on childcare and motherhood, such as breast-feeding rooms at our major sites. In addition, in Italy \u201cCare Master\u201d is available for caregivers at the Company, as well as an online family counseling service at subsidized costs and parenting training sessions, \u201cNew Parents, New Energy\u201d; workshops have also been held for employees\u2019 children on the topics of coding and STEM subjects; family services are available, such as financial support (bonuses for the purchase of school books, contributions for kindergarten, school and university, scholarships and agreements with schools), and to \u201csave time\u201d: baby-sitting, elderly care and home support. A range of initiatives have been introduced, in conjunction with the mobility manager network, to promote the sustainable movements of Enel people, including specific agreements for public transport subscriptions. Finally, all mothers and fathers of children attending primary school are granted entry permits for their children\u2019s first day of school. Spain has a dedicated channel on the company intranet, offering a wide variety of products and services at competitive prices, as well as leisure offers and training sessions, but also providing the option to make donations to improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable. An app can also be downloaded to access various services such as private car sharing, car cleaning and repairs, a dietician and a travel agency. Plus, at the Madrid site, a \u201cTo-Do room\u201d is available, offering services to save time that are open all day long (for example, laundry, dyeing, computer repairs, etc.), to improve work-life balance.\n\nCaring in the organization\n\nIn 2021, an analysis was carried out to harmonize the minimum duration of maternity leave within the Group. From 2022, Japan, Taiwan, Germany and Panama will therefore add to the leave required by law to reach a minimum threshold of 80 working days, as is already the case under European legislation. As in 2021 in terms of maternity leave, a similar analysis will be carried out in 2022 regarding paternity leave. In line with the care approach and to support the parental experience, Enel offers measures in addition to the provisions of local legislation in terms of additional days of leave and pay, with potential benefits in terms of work-life balance and caring for families. Where maternity leave is concerned, in more than half of the main countries in which Enel operates (Argentina, Spain, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Peru, New Zealand, Australia), Enel guarantees a higher number of leave days than those pro-\nvided by the local legislation. As such, Argentina, Colombia and Peru offer a substantial number of extra days. In terms of salary, where the total remuneration is not guaranteed by local laws, Enel intervenes by bridging the gap to reach 100% coverage. In particular, this happens in Italy, Romania, Russia, the United States, Canada, South Korea and Greece, while in all other Group countries, remuneration is already 100% guaranteed according to legal requirements. Specifically, in Italy Enel guarantees 100% coverage compared to the 80% required by law for the five months of compulsory leave.\n\nThe average number of days of fully paid maternity leave in total for countries that account for 80% of the global total workforce (Italy, Brazil, Spain, Argentina and Romania) is 24 weeks, with the minimum offered in Spain (17 weeks). Also with regard to paternity leave, in some countries Enel intervenes with additional measures both in terms of the number of additional days of leave (Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, United Kingdom, Ireland, Chile, Peru, New Zealand, India, Australia, Greece) and in terms of wages (in Russia, Mexico and Greece, Enel covers any pay gaps guaranteeing 100% pay, and in all other Group countries, remuneration is already 100% guaranteed according to legislative requirements). In particular, in Italy since 2021, the law requires 10 days of paternity leave to be paid at 100% of wages, even in the event of adoption.\n\nThe average number of days of fully paid paternity leave in countries that account for 80% of the global total workforce (Italy, Brazil, Spain, Argentina and Romania) is 3 weeks, with the minimum offered in Brazil (1 week).\n\nIn terms of parental leave, the measures on offer vary greatly from one country to another. Italy provides parental leave of 10 months, shared between the mother and father, in a child\u2019s first 12 years. If the father takes at least 3 months, the total leave rises to 11 months. The collective agreement pays a salary of 45% for the first month and 40% for the second and third months, compared to the 30% required by law for the first 6 months.\n\nIn 2021 in Italy, parental leave was extended to same-sex couples in civil partnerships who care for children, and in Peru health insurance coverage was extended to same-sex couples living together for a minimum of two years. In Italy, it is also possible to take leave for very serious family circumstances, and to offer holidays or rest periods from a solidarity point of view (solidarity holidays) to colleagues in the same company, to help children or adolescents, parents, spouses, civil partners or common-law spouses who need constant care or in the event of very serious family or personal circumstances. As well as holidays donated by colleagues, Enel provides the same number of days of paid leave. In Spain, it is also possible to take advantage of daily flexibility adapted to the temporary needs of the worker, in the form of a temporary change in working arrangements, reductions in working hours and leave for family care.\n\nThe analysis of the level of coverage of non-salary benefits concerned the entire Group workforce, showing a high percentage in terms of access to the main benefits.\n\nThe main support initiatives and the extent of their coverage of the Enel workforce are set out below.\n\n| Non-salary benefits, 100% of countries where Enel operates | Involvement |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Covid-19 insurance                                        | 100%        |\n| Life insurance                                            | 88%         |\n| Medical insurance                                         | 93%         |\n| Pension fund membership                                   | 81%         |\n| Additional parental measures (maternity, paternity and parental leave) | 94%         |\n| Meal allowances                                           | 86%         |\n| Child support initiatives                                 | 84%         |\n| Loans                                                     | 90%         |\n| Leisure and cultural initiatives                          | 91%         |\n\n(10) Non-salary benefits are the series of goods and services provided by the Company in addition to monetary pay.\nSupplementary healthcare assistance and additional pension coverage\n\nThe majority of countries where the Group maintains a presence offer supplementary health insurance policies at advantageous conditions with respect to the alternatives available on the market. In many cases, the Company provides benefits related to prevention and periodic checkups (see also the \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d chapter). For all Italian employees and their dependent family members, in agreement with the trade unions, Enel set up the Supplementary Healthcare Provision for Enel Group Employees (FISDE) in 1997. The Provision disburses repayments and redemptions for healthcare expenses, promotes initiatives for the disabled and individuals subject to socially challenging situations (drug addiction, alcoholism, learning difficulties, psychosocial disorders) and sets up preventive medicine programs. Also in 2021, members were able to take advantage of the agreement with the Italian National Council of Psychologists (CNOP) and Italian Psychoanalytic Society (SPI) for psychological support services. In line with the FISDE solidarity principle, former Enel employees can also continue to benefit from the services offered by the Provision by continuing to pay the membership fees. Staff support measures also include the option of accessing fixed-contribution and other pension plans, such as membership of mandatory or optional schemes and the award of various types of individual benefits in services associated with post-employment benefits provision. As at December 31, 2021, 81% of employees were covered by the Enel Group pension plan. The largest pension funds are in Italy (Fopen and Fondenel), Spain and Brazil. See also the \u201cRemote working and well-being to handle the pandemic\u201d section of this chapter.\n\nIndustrial relations\n\nEnel complies with the labor law in force in the various countries it operates in, with the fundamental principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and with the conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) concerning workers\u2019 rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining, consultation, right to strike, etc.), systematically promoting discussion between social partners and seeking an adequate level of agreement and sharing of corporate strategies by employees. In 2021, the percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements was 90%. Industrial relations activities on the Group level continue to be conducted in accordance with the model laid down in the Global Framework Agreement (GFA) signed by Enel in\nOne of the particularly significant principles of the GFA is on remuneration, whereby the minimum payment made to Group employees cannot be lower than the level established by the collective bargaining agreements and legislative and regulatory texts in the various countries in question, in line with the provisions of the ILO conventions. In terms of remuneration, Enel also guarantees that the equal pay principle is respected in all countries in which it maintains a presence, and therefore commits to guaranteeing the living wage for all its employees, promoting initiatives to ensure equal pay for equal work for men and women. This principle is also indicated in the Group\u2019s human rights policy, which states that everyone working throughout the entire value chain is entitled to remuneration in line with the principle of fair return for work, equal pay between male and female employees for work of equal value, and minimum payment no lower than the level established by the collective bargaining agreements and legislative and regulatory texts in force in the various countries, in line with the provisions of the ILO conventions.\n\nIn addition, it is also expressly provided in section 3.8 of the Code of Ethics that upon the establishment of the employment relationship, each employee will receive accurate information relating to the characteristics of the role and the duties to be performed, and to the regulatory and remuneration elements according to the principles set out above. This information is presented to the employee in such a way that acceptance of their position is based on an effective understanding and awareness not only of their duties, but also and above all of their rights (enshrined in the aforementioned collective agreements). As well as serving as the basis of the regularity of contracts, this approach enables us to operate fairly at all levels of the Company and in all the Countries and Regions in which Enel operates.\n\nUnder the GFA, Enel also acknowledges the right of its employees to set up or participate in trade union associations in order to protect their interests. In particular, employees may be represented, in the various generation units, by trade union organizations and other forms of representation elected in compliance with the legislation and practices in force in the countries concerned. Collective bargaining agreements are acknowledged as the main tool to determine the contractual conditions of its employees and to regulate relations between senior management and trade unions. Enel complies with the principle of trade union independence and does not interfere in any way with the organization of representation, allowing workers\u2019 representatives access to the workplaces in order to communicate with their members, in compliance with the law and the industrial relations systems in force in each country.\n\nEnel therefore recognizes as interlocutors the trade unions that represent workers in the Company, in compliance with the provisions of national legislation, and adheres to strict neutrality regarding the choice of workers whether or not to join a trade union organization and/or the choice of the union by which to be represented. In the event of a discrepancy between local and international standards, the Group strives to apply the provisions that best protect workers\u2019 rights. Finally, Enel provides adequate information to its employees and to the trade union organizations that represent them, in order to facilitate collective bargaining, and provides its people with a full range of information, including via the Company intranet, concerning collective labor agreements and trade union agreements, in accordance with current legislation.\n\nAt European level, the Agreement on the Enel European Works Council, last renewed in July 2016, is confirmed as one of the most advanced agreements in the EU electricity sector for the attention paid to bilateral issues such as occupational health and safety, training and diversity. In 2021, contact continued with the European Works Council, despite the pandemic.\n\nEnel and the domestic and European federations (IndustriAll Europe and the European Public Services Union) have transferred their consolidated experience of social dialogue to the sector\u2019s Social Working Group, supported by the European Commission \u2013 DG Employment \u2013 regarding the employment impacts of the energy transition and digitalization in the coming years in all European and global electricity companies.\n\nIn the various countries in which it maintains a presence, Enel is committed to managing the transition by entering into robust dialogue with the trade unions, translating in practice the principles of the just transition for everyone, including local communities and contractors, the people most directly involved in the process of change, in particular in the conversion of sites and coal-fired power plants.\nIn the event of organizational changes, **timely disclosure to trade union representatives** is required, as indicated in the table below.\n\n| Country       | Minimum Period                                                                 | Legal Provisions/Collective Agreements                                                                 |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Argentina     | In view of the general provisions of the law, and in analogy, a minimum period of 48 hours will be taken into account for the purpose of notifying any amendment of the essential conditions of the employment contract | There are no legal requirements or provisions in collective agreements                                  |\n| Brazil        | It is convention and practice to provide \u201ctimely\u201d information                  | There are no legal requirements or provisions in collective agreements                                  |\n| Chile         | Neither the law nor collective bargaining provide for a minimum notice period in the event of organizational changes | -                                                                                                     |\n| Colombia      | Neither the law nor collective bargaining provide for a minimum notice period in the event of organizational changes | -                                                                                                     |\n| Italy         | 25 days.

This model extends along the entire value chain: from the proactive analysis of the needs of the communities to the construction of sustainable plants and sites as well as their management. It has evolved further to extend this approach also to the design, development and supply of energy products and services, as well as to the innovation of processes through the use of new technologies to contribute toward the construction of communities that are increasingly circular, inclusive and sustainable.\n\nIn 2021 our contribution to the social and economic development and growth of the territories resulted in more than 2,400 sustainability projects in the various countries where we are present, involving more than 7.5 million beneficiaries. In line with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), the projects range from the expansion of infrastructure to professional education and training programs, as well as projects that support cultural and economic activities and promote access to energy, rural and suburban electrification, face energy poverty and promote social inclusion for the more vulnerable population categories. A fundamental lever for the implementation of these projects is the ability to make use of 581 active partnerships on an international level with nonprofit organizations, social companies, start-ups and institutions rooted in the territory. The reduction of the number of partnerships in comparison to 2020 is due to the fact that in 2020, 450 immediate response initiatives were activated in order to face the health emergency with partnerships in the field, some of which were not extended in 2021. This approach makes it possible to implement a wide range of projects in different areas, also thanks to the activation of virtuous ecosystems such as the Open Innovability\u00ae platform, which is based on openness and sharing in order to facilitate and promote the identification of innovative social ideas and solutions.\n\nIn particular, there are two large challenges: energy transition and post-pandemic recovery. Energy transition represents an important growth and modernization accelerator for the industry thanks to the potential it offers in terms of economic development, well-being, quality of life and equality. Taking advantage of these opportunities requires farsighted policies that ensure a just and inclusive transition and that take into consideration, in particular, the needs of social categories most exposed to change.\n\nWith the continuation of the Covid-19 pandemic also the commitment to support the communities continues by activating specific initiatives for social-economic recovery through the development of local marketplaces, favoring access to credit and promoting inclusive business models to support the weakest sections of the population, with particular attention to people who are vulnerable from a physical, social and economic point of view. There are also many digitalization projects for supporting connectivity in rural areas, computer literacy, encouraging the participation of women in STEM subjects, e-commerce platforms and online and offline solutions with a positive impact on local communities.\n\n(11) Beneficiaries are the people in whose favor the project was carried out. Enel considers only the direct beneficiaries for the current year. The number of beneficiaries considers the activities and projects carried out in all the areas in which the Group operates. Solely within the NFS perimeter (excluding companies consolidated using the equity method, foundations, Group non-profit organizations and companies to which the Build, Sell and Operate, or BSO mechanism has been applied), the number of beneficiaries in 2021 is 0.5 million for SDG 4 (0.5 million in 2020), 3.4 million for SDG 7 (1.8 million in 2020) and 0.5 million for SDG 8 (0.8 million in 2020).\nTo identify the best solutions for each territory, a path is used that is based on sharing with the local communities and constantly listening to the needs of the concerned stakeholders. With this process it is possible to anticipate the future needs and develop mapping that is as complete as possible of not only the potential positive aspects, but also the negative ones, that the activity carried out by the Group has on the communities where it is present.\n\nThis process starts in the design phase with the identification of the stakeholders who are potentially interested in the project thanks to specific initiatives that have the goal of:\n\n- guaranteeing that the concerned parties are suitably involved and that their requests are listened to and understood, also through an early community involvement process. An example of this is the SEECA (Social, Environmental and Economic Context Analysis) tool called CSV, which permits, for example, to trace the contacts and actions of involvement, as well as the key issues raised during the entire period of the project (refer to the following paragraph \u201cStrategy and model for creating shared value with communities\u201d);\n- analyzing the type of relationship that can be created between the Group and the mapped stakeholders in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest;\n- providing clear guidelines to our representatives who are responsible for managing the consultation processes with the stakeholders that each country supplements with respect to the specific local aspects and the business activities to be implemented;\n- sharing all the information about the project that is relevant for the concerned stakeholders in order to promote transparent and collaborative relationships. The sustainability teams of the various countries are also involved in negotiation activities for land that belongs to small owners or local communities considered key in the area of direct influence of the project;\n- guaranteeing that consultation satisfies specific conditions of quality, such as for example being free, preventive, inclusive, adapted to the local context, bidirectional and well documented;\n- providing an access channel for reporting by people who need to contact us, using the tools and means available locally, such as local teams or a specific person, toll-free numbers, the internet or, in the case of isolated rural communities, local leaders who are able to periodically collect any complaints;\n- involving independent third-parties in negotiation processes as \u201cgood faith witnesses\u201d, if applicable.\nStrategy and model for creating shared value with communities\n\nInnovation and sustainability represent the pillars at the base of the Group\u2019s strategy; from this point of view, the Creation of Shared Value (CSV) is both an objective as well as a precise methodology that aims to integrate sustainability into business by using an inclusive approach that does not leave anyone behind.\n\nIn 2021, in response to the growing challenges presented by the new social and economic context, we updated our CSV model, which was defined in 2015, placing at the center the Purpose (\u201cOpen Power for a brighter future. We empower sustainable progress\u201d) as a guiding element for the entire value creation process and in compliance with the Group\u2019s sustainability strategy (see the chapter \u201cOur model for sustainable progress\u201d). This evolutionary path is based on three main pillars:\n\n- **sustainability in the value chains of the Business Lines** by minimizing the use of natural resources and maximizing the value created for community (sustainable sites, for example);\n- **developing inclusive products and services**, for identifying solutions that solve the requirements of people (services for vulnerable and disabled customers, for example);\n- **expanding the ecosystem of partnerships and collaborations** (to continually seek ideas and talents within and outside of the Company).\n\nThe CSV model for managing community relations integrates socio-environmental factors within business processes and throughout the entire chain of value, with special reference to operations of business development, engineering and construction and supply chain, in addition to management and maintenance of assets. A model whose primary phases are described in the infographic below, and that describes a wide range of socio-economic, environmental and cultural data. In particular, a materiality analysis is provided to correlate the priorities of stakeholders with those of the Group in order to identify and meet common needs.\n\nThe model\u2019s functioning is regulated by a specific Policy (no. 211 \u201cCSV Process definition and management\u201d) and by an Operating Instruction (no. 1768 \u201cProject Portfolio Management System\u201d), which incorporates the operation of a dedicated digitized platform (Project Portfolio Management System) and the clear definition of roles and responsibilities. Definition and dissemination of guidelines on the use of CSV applications, the preparation and assessment of the sustainability projects, the management of the projects on a Group level and the dissemination of best prac-\ntices in the countries we operate in are guaranteed by the Holding\u2019s Innovability\u00ae organizational structure and by the relative sustainability structures in the various countries of operation. Each Country and each Business Line adapts the procedures for the global policy and the procedures for application of the CSV model on a local level, based on the specific aspects of business and the context.\n\nIn 2021, there were 1,478 applications of the CSV model\\(^{(12)}\\) in the various phases of the value chain. During the Engineering and Construction phase, and thanks to good practices in terms of circularity and sustainability in the use of resources for the generation of renewable energy, a \u201cSustainable model for the design and construction of plants\u201d was defined in order to minimize the environmental impacts while promoting local economic development by involving local labor, while guaranteeing at the same time improved operational efficiency, with respect for the territory. For additional details, please refer to the chapter \u201cTowards a nature-based model\u201d.\n\n### CSV Applications\n\n| Business Development | Engineering & Construction | Operation & Maintenance |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 15                   | 12                          | 80                      |\n| 110                  | 69                          | 1,093                   |\n| 6                    | 13                          | 76                      |\n| 1                    | -                           | 2                       |\n| **132**              | **94**                      | **1,251**               |\n| **1,478**\\(^{(1)}\\) |                             |                         |\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) The total value includes 1 CSV Corporate application.\n\n\\(^{(12)}\\) An application is interpreted as the use of at least one CSV instrument in relation to an asset, in any phase of the chain of value and in any Business Line. The CSV applications in the BD phase include applications regarding BD opportunities (also at the beginning phases) and business projects output from the pipeline. They can also relate to assets in O&M in the case of modernizing projects or decommissioning activities. The CSV applications in the E&C phase can refer to assets passed to the O&M phase at the end of the year. The number of CSV applications in Infrastructure & Networks (I&N) may refer to the concession area, but also areas identified by municipalities and substations. For the NFS perimeter alone (i.e. excluding companies consolidated using the equity method, foundations and non-profit organizations of the Group, and the companies for which the BSO \u2013 Build, Sell and Operate mechanism was applied) the number of applications for 2021 amounts to 1,456 (compared to 1,396 in 2020).\nThe value created for the communities\n\nThe contribution to sustainable development goals\n\nThe sustainability of the strategy is also confirmed by the progress achieved in terms of the Group\u2019s contribution to achieving the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDG), with particular reference to projects for:\n\n- ensure inclusive and equitable quality education (SDG 4), which has benefited 3 million people\\(^{(13)}\\);\n- provide access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy (SDG 7), that has been used by 13.2 million people\\(^{(14)}\\);\n- promote sustained, lasting, inclusive and sustainable economic growth (SDG 8) with 3.7 million beneficiaries\\(^{(15)}\\).\n\n| Activities | Targets 2015-2030 | Results 2015-2021 | Status | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|-----|\n| Quality education | 5 million beneficiaries | 3.0 mil | ON TRACK | SDG 4 |\n| | | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020\\(^{(1)}\\) | 2021\\(^{(1)}\\) |\n| | | 0.1 mil | 0.2 mil | 0.3 mil | 0.4 mil | 0.3 mil | 1.0 mil | 0.7 mil |\n| Affordable and clean energy | 20 million beneficiaries | 13.2 mil | ON TRACK | SDG 7 |\n| | | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020\\(^{(1)}\\) | 2021\\(^{(1)}\\) |\n| | | 1.5 mil | 1.3 mil | 1.3 mil | 2.2 mil | 1.6 mil | 1.9 mil | 3.4 mil |\n| Decent work and economic growth | 8 million beneficiaries | 3.7 mil | ON TRACK | SDG 8 |\n| | | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020\\(^{(1)}\\) | 2021\\(^{(1)}\\) |\n| | | 0.4 mil | 0.7 mil | 0.4 mil | 0.3 mil | 0.3 mil | 0.9 mil | 0.7 mil |\n\n(1) Beneficiaries are the people in whose favor the project was carried out. Enel considers only the direct beneficiaries for the current year. The number of beneficiaries considers the activities and projects carried out in all the areas in which the Group operates. Solely within the NFS perimeter (excluding companies consolidated using the equity method, foundations, Group non-profit organizations and companies to which the Build, Sell and Operate, or BSO mechanism has been applied), the number of beneficiaries in 2021 is 0.5 million for SDG 4 (0.5 million in 2020), 3.4 million for SDG 7 (1.8 million in 2020) and 0.5 million for SDG 8 (0.8 million in 2020).\n\n\\(^{(13)}\\) Cumulative data from 2015-2021 on the total number of beneficiaries of SDG 4 to date.\n\\(^{(14)}\\) Cumulative data from 2015-2021 on the total number of beneficiaries of SDG 7 to date.\n\\(^{(15)}\\) Cumulative data from 2015-2021 on the total number of beneficiaries of SDG 8 to date.\nValue for Disability: contribution to the communities\n\nMore than 1 billion people in the world, mostly in low income countries, are living with disabilities: it is the largest minority in the world (15% of the global population). Levels of participation in social and economic life, and also access to education and care are significantly less than for the rest of the population. For this reason, we wanted to start global and local projects in order to learn about and satisfy the needs of colleagues, customers and communities for creating inclusive products and services based on the Design for all methodology, with the goal of promoting the increase in the skills, employability and entrepreneurship of disabled persons.\n\nHere are some examples of projects:\n\n- Colombia: \u201cEmprende con Enel\u201d. This initiative offers training and consultancy services to small companies and business people, helping them to overcome the crisis generated by the pandemic, giving priority to entrepreneurs who work for the inclusion and for the reduction of barriers for people with disabilities. The project was launched using the Open Innovability\u00ae platform. One of the relevant projects that was selected concerns sustainable tourism with disabled persons as guides.\n\n- Italy: \u201cDiversamente Chiosco\u201d which was awarded by the Group and the municipality of Fossacesia within the scope of the Cresco Award contest related to the entrepreneurship of disabled persons. This is a project of inclusion related to the work and training for young people with disabilities through which a bar was established that is managed by young people with intellectual and/or relational disabilities, who opened their doors at the weekends in July and August 2021 in the square where the ATM is located along the waterfront.\n\n- Romania: small subsidies were assigned via FDSC (foundation for the development of civil society) to 13 NGOs that assist people with disabilities (with a total of 650 beneficiaries). The support provided was flexible and inclusive, targeted toward specific and priority needs indicated directly by the partners, which are usually difficult to cover with the subsidies assigned by traditional lenders. Furthermore, a subsidy targeted toward the foundation Pentru Voi was assigned in order to improve the structure of the NGOs activities who work with people with disabilities, both by preparing an accreditation guide as well as by providing methodologies so that these organizations can offer professional mediation services that help disabled persons enter the work world.\nMeasure the value of our commitment for communities\n\nWe make a substantive contribution to the development and social and economic growth of the territories and communities where we operate with varying types of intervention, ranging from the expansion of infrastructure to education and training programs, from initiatives targeting social inclusion initiatives to projects supporting local cultural life. To measure our action, we adopted the LBG (London Benchmarking Group) method, which makes it possible to clearly determine and classify the Company\u2019s contribution toward the development of the communities where it is present and compare it with other companies.\n\nIn particular, according to the LBG standard, the expense for the contributions to the communities can be divided as follows:\n\n- **donations**: pro bono contributions and without obligations for the beneficiaries, except that they have to use the donation for charitable purposes and for non-profit associations. For Enel, this item includes all the monetary and in kind charitable donations, including those for philanthropic and solidarity activities;\n- **investments in the community**: medium and long-term involvement in community support projects, also in partnership with local organizations, aimed at addressing significant problems both for the territory as well as for the Company. This category includes, for example, projects related to a wider strategy to the benefit of the community, such as Access to electricity, or specific initiatives dedicated to the communities near the power plants;\n- **commercial initiatives with a social impact**: contributes to activities connected to the core business, in which the Company promotes its own brand and its own corporate identity. Examples of these initiatives are the marketing campaigns that also provide benefits for the community, or that include contributions for charitable purposes.\n\nIn 2021, Enel contributed more than 91 million euros to the communities in which it operates.\n\n### 2021 initiatives in favor of communities by purpose (%)\n\n| Category                                      | Percentage |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Donations                                     | 10.7%      |\n| Community investments                         | 61.6%      |\n| Commercial initiatives with a social impact   | 27.6%      |\n\n### Initiatives in favor of communities by type 2021 (%)\n\n| Type                                           | Percentage |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Cash contribution                              | 89.6%      |\n| Employee volunteerism                          | 0%         |\n| Donations in kind (goods/services/projects)    | 2.7%       |\n| Management overheads                          | 7.2%       |\n\n(16) During 2021, donations decreased significantly in comparison to 2020 due to the effect of the disbursements made during 2020 by the countries, Enel Cuore and other Group foundations for the purpose of medical supplies together with donations to public and private institutions focused on fighting the pandemic.\n\nThe investments in communities are in line with the previous year, whereas the commercial initiatives increased 43.6% compared to 2020, especially in Latin America, Iberia and AAO due to the effect of the post-pandemic recovery.\nSome examples of sustainability projects\n\n**eCitySevilla: the 100% sustainable future city**\n\n#eCitySevilla is a public-private collaboration initiative guided by Endesa, a Spanish company in the Enel Group, by the Scientific and Technological Park Cartuja, the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda and the municipality of Seville. The project was created in order to develop a model of a sustainable, open, digital and decarbonized city in the Scientific and Technological Park \u201cCartuja\u201d in Seville by 2025. With a plan of pioneering initiatives that reach the energy and climate goals fixed for 2050 twenty-five years in advance, #eCitySevilla represents an international reference that will guide the development of the city of the future, and is also a model for the urban energy transition. The area of Isla de la Cartuja is an open-air laboratory of innovation that provides a model of a smart city of the future. It integrates the most advanced solutions in area of renewable energies, sustainable mobility, efficient buildings and digital infrastructures. The cornerstones of the project include reaching energy self-sufficiency due to the possibility of generating 100% renewable energy by constructing a photovoltaic generation plant and developing large storage systems.\n\n**School4Life: a path towards a sustainable future**\n\nThe School4Life project was created in 2021 as a result of the collaboration between the Group and the ELIS consortium and has involved 25 Italian schools, middle schools and high schools, for a total of 1,900 students, who were able to participate in learning and experimentation experiences. The initiative was participated in by Group experts as masters of the trade, role models and mentors, who helped the kids create concrete projects, simulating realistic challenges and problems to stimulate their creativity and express their individual talents. The role models were asked to motivate the students, whereas the mentors accompanied them down a development path that was focused on the creation of a sustainable future. The project, which is planned to be repeated and expanded during 2022-23, has the goal on the one hand to make the young people aware of the opportunities offered by the energy transition in terms of work possibilities, and on the other hand it aims to keep them from dropping out of school using a methodological approach based on experimentation and learning by doing.\n\n**Nuevo Pachac\u00fatec: education for progress**\n\nAmong the educational projects we promote around the world, the alliance with the technical institute Nuevo Pachac\u00fatec in Peru represents one of the initiatives that has a greater impact on the local community. Through this project, which was started in 2006 in the district of Ventanilla, which is located north of the capital of Lima, every year Enel Distribuci\u00f3n Peru contributes toward the training of approximately 125 students, offering them professional opportunities and growth paths in the electric sector, with a job placement rate in the work world of more than 90% at the end of their studies. The initiative aims to provide advanced technical training in the energy field and has generated value over the years in one of the most vulnerable areas of the country, promoting employment opportunities for young people with limited economical resources. A large amount of attention is placed on the topic of gender equality, stimulating the participation of female students in a sector that is traditionally considered only for men and offering them opportunities for professional development.\n\n**Ruta Pehuenche: a program for the development of small local business people**\n\nIn Chile, where the hydroelectric plant Los C\u00f3ndores is under construction in the region of Maule, interaction with the local community has generated training and work opportunities and has resulted in the creation of a micro-entrepreneurial fabric led by women. The local development program Ruta Pehuenche was created here, and its name was taken from the international corridor that extends to Argentina and is full of exceptional natural attractions. The project has the dual objective of promoting the economic growth of the entire community through training path-\nways and improving living conditions thanks to the use of ecocompatible technologies for the supply of water, food, housing, energy and for solving sanitation problems. Since 2018, the year in which the project started, more than 80 people (of which 70 women) participated in the professional laboratories organized in the Chilean towns of La Mina, Paso Nevado, Armerillo and Las Garzas, with a total of 130 hours of training. This initiative has led to the creation of small commercial businesses \u2013 linked to the tourism flow in the area \u2013 that produce items made of wood and jewelry made with stones and ceramic. In addition to improving the ability of families to generate income, the project represents a channel for promoting and strengthening the role of women in the local social fabric.\n\nSustainability Wonders \u2013 The digitalization of schools near our plants\n\nSustainability Wonders is a program of the Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation Global Business Line that was created due to the need to collect, enhance and share internally the best projects of sustainability in our generation plants all over the world, explaining them with the voice of those who are directly involved. To support this, a digital space was created where it is possible to read and learn about some of the projects that we are carrying out every day in more than 19 countries, learning from others, being inspired by best practices to replicate them and create new relationships.\n\nThe first edition of the program, in 2021, was dedicated to SDG 4 \u201cQuality education\u201d and made it possible to collect all the initiatives that have contributed toward the development of young people in the communities where we operate, through projects of education, training and support to schools by means of infrastructure and digitalization. During this first edition, the project that was appreciated most by Enel people and that was the selected as the winner was carried out in Spain in 2020-21 and had the goal of increasing digitalization in the schools near our plants. The project was included in the Public Responsibility Plan of Endesa to contrast the consequences of Covid-19, and to contribute toward alleviating the digital divide that was worsened by the pandemic and aggravated situations of confinement and social distance in all areas. More vulnerable students without access to a computer or the internet even had to renounce their right to education for a few months.\n\nThanks to this program, laptops and connection cards were given to the children of the most vulnerable families in 429 public schools near 40 generation plants of Endesa. More than 5,000 children in approximately 160 municipalities benefited from this initiative, and the teachers in 431 schools, as well as more than 55,000 students received online training on digital topics in order to support a new method of communication between students and teachers.\n\n\u201cFollowing the social-economic crisis caused by the pandemic, the Public Responsibility Plan prepared by our Company was another opportunity for demonstrating to our neighbors that we were there again another time to help them, offering the solidarity that is to be expected from a large company such as ours. All the beneficiaries, municipalities, schools, institutes etc. recognized our commitment and for this reason we are very proud to be part of the Endesa family.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Galv\u00e1n\nDirector of the North-West Hydro Generation Unit, O&M Hydro Iberia\nAccess to energy\n\nAccess to energy represents a challenge and a primary need as stated by the United Nations SDG 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy systems for all. The Energy Progress Report provided the international community with a global dashboard for recording progress toward this sustainable development goal. The 2021 report in particular highlights that 759 million people in 2019 did not have access to electricity, a figure which is down compared to the 1.2 billion of 2010.\n\nWith a proactive approach to the needs of society, we aim to develop sustainable business models that can drive change and guarantee not only access to clean energy, but also sustainable development of communities. In all countries where we operate, we are close to people and support in particular the most vulnerable sections of the population, both through initiatives, usually inspired by the government, that provide economic support in facing energy costs, as well as through projects in developing countries that promote access to energy by a greater number of persons.\n\nThis commitment is confirmed in the 2022-2024 Strategic Plan through the definition of specific objectives, including an increase in renewable sources, energy efficiency initiatives, the development of sustainable and circular products and services, engaging local communities through a creating shared value model (please see the section, \u201cValue for territories\u201d in this chapter and the chapter \u201cOur model for sustainable progress\u201d).\n\nThe Strategic Plan, the Sustainability Plan that describes in detail the goals and commitments from an ESG point of view, including access to energy and the corresponding financial and non-financial reporting are analyzed and monitored by the Board of Directors, by means of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Control and Risk Committee (see the Corporate Governance report, available at www.enel.com).\n\nTop Management is engaged on a daily basis in realizing these strategic objectives by contributing towards supporting the global challenge of guaranteeing access to energy. To support Top Management, each country is responsible for managing relationships with institutional bodies, regulatory authorities on a national, regional and local level, and associations for promoting the development of solutions for access to energy according to different needs. The Innovability\u00ae Function, both on a holding level as well as a Business Line/Country level, also promotes the dissemination of a shared value model. It supports innovative solutions that can promote access to energy in remote areas with limited access to electricity.\n\nPromoting access to energy\n\nWe are committed to promoting access to energy in developing countries not only by supplying electric energy, but also clean, innovative technologies to the population in order to generate energy that has a reduced impact on the environment. Approximately 1,950 MW of renewable generation was commissioned in Latin America in 2021, increasing the total renewable capacity to approximately 19,500 MW. In Africa, Enel Green Power is currently the main private operator in the renewable sector in terms of installed capacity (more than 1,500 MW in operation and 317 MW under construction), with a presence in different countries, including South Africa, Zambia and Morocco. In Asia, the Group is present in India through its subsidiary EGP India, one of the country\u2019s main renewable energy companies, which owns and manages 340 MW of wind capacity, producing approximately 270 GWh a year in Gujarat and Maharashtra.\n\nIn 2021, in just developing countries, more than 239 energy access projects were developed that reached around 2.3 million beneficiaries and roughly 70 related partnerships were in place. Some examples are provided below of initiatives that Enel is adopting in developing countries to support access to energy and that were promoted by the various Business Lines.\n\n- **Rural Electrification in Goi\u00e1s (Brazil).** As part of the initiative of rural electrification in Brazil, in the State of Goi\u00e1s, approximately 17,000 connections were made since 2017 in remote zones, using on-grid and off-grid solutions, reaching various isolated communities such as: Cavalcante, Colinas do Sul, Monte Alegre de Goi\u00e1s and Teresina de Goi\u00e1s. The projects that Enel Goi\u00e1s will carry out over the next three years include initiatives in favor of families and local producers that are part of the dairy industry and its related activities and that need to become increasingly energy efficient. Partnerships will also be created and strengthened with local institutions and dialog will be expanded between representatives of the Company \u2013 at the cutting edge of the energy transition process \u2013 and the communities.\n\n- **Cundinamarca 100% (Colombia).** The \u201cCundinamarca 100%\u201d program aims to provide energy to families in areas that are difficult to access with wide geographical dispersion. The project started in 2016 with the participation of public partners and private associations in three ways: connection to the conventional electrical grid, installation of off-grid plants powered by solar panels and the construction of a mini-grid to attempt to guarantee safe, reliable and continuous access to energy also in remote and isolated ar-\nThe program also includes education and professional training projects for the start-up of production companies and support for local agricultural development. With the development of the plan, from the process of identifying the users to access to the electrical service, more than 3,000 users were able to benefit in all geographically isolated rural areas. This program also made it possible to increase the coverage of the service and decrease the percentage of the population without service. \u201cCundinamarca 100%\u201d is a project that is life changing through the supply of electrical energy in a safe, reliable and sustainable way to rural communities located throughout the territory and that never had electricity, making it possible for them to meet primary needs.\n\n- Suburban and marginal areas of cities (Chile). In addition to rural electrification, we are committed to supplying access to energy in some areas located in the shadows of the extended mega-cities, guaranteeing safe, efficient, reliable and sustainable energy for citizens. With the \u201cSeguridad Energ\u00e9tica en Campamientos\u201d project in Chile, we are working in the marginal areas located in the municipality of Maip\u00fa to improve the living conditions of families who live in this suburban area. Enel Distribuci\u00f3n and two NGOs (Fundaci\u00f3n Techo and Litro de Luz) have entered into a collaboration that makes it possible to carry out various projects, including solar powered public lighting, social projects and workshops on the efficient use of energy and the prevention of electrical risks. The creation of a \u201ccommunity center\u201d not only offers a meeting place and recreation area, but it is above all the ideal place for holding seminars suitable for the entire community, creating work opportunities especially for those who are in vulnerable situations.\n\n**Fighting energy poverty**\n\nThe system for access to energy in developed countries has been guaranteed for some time now, however, following the widespread increase in the prices of raw materials on international markets starting from the second half of 2021, there has been an increase in consumers who find it difficult to manage the energy expense, especially families with low incomes. Even if governments have the primary responsibility of guaranteeing safe and economic access to basic energy services, also the electric sector is called to provide a tangible contribution by promoting fair and sustainable social-economic development.\n\nIn all the Countries in which we operate, we are always directly involved together with governments and local institutions to fight energy poverty and facilitate access to energy to customers living in vulnerable conditions. In line with the Group\u2019s sustainable business model and with the goals related to the topic of energy transition, every Business Line of the Group promotes specific initiatives to support the dissemination of solutions for energy efficiency and responsible consumption, the modernization of infrastructures and an increase in renewable sources.\n\nOver the past years we have adopted different forms of support, often through initiatives inspired by the government, in order to help some sections of the population support the costs for the supply of electricity and gas, in order to permit equal access to energy. Among our various initiatives, we have launched specific campaigns to support the populating living in conditions of vulnerability, providing information and advice for efficient and responsible energy consumption.\n\nSome examples of projects developed on an international level are provided below (see also the chapter \u201cThe decade of electrification and customer centricity\u201d):\n\n- **Training program on access to energy and social services (Spain).** This initiative is based on training courses on topics such as energy saving and efficiency measures, optimization of the electricity bill, the new Social Bonus and protection against having electricity cut off if the bills are overdue, and is directed towards NGOs and Social Services so they are able to improve their consultancy and their efforts for supporting families living in situations of vulnerability. In 2021 more than 35 thousand beneficiaries were involved in the project, which was developed together with the trainers at Endesa Energ\u00eda and with the participation of approximately 100 institutions (NGOs). The purpose of this initiative is to demonstrate the Group\u2019s commitment to vulnerable groups and to the right against energy poverty, improving the relationships with stakeholders, such as local institutions, municipalities and Non-Governmental Organizations. Involving the NGO and Social Service in the work of observing and the fight against Fuel Poverty increases their knowledge in order to help vulnerable families and as a result minimize the barriers to access to energy.\n\n- **Cerro Iglesias (Panama).** The project concerns the city of Cerro Iglesias, in Panama: a rural zone without access to electric energy near the Cerro Iglesias hydroelectric power plant, which was illuminated thanks to a creating shared value project together with the Oficina de Electrificaci\u00f3n Rural (OER) of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Panama. Thanks to the shared effort with local authorities, the residents of the community located in the Panamani-an district of Nole Duima, the comarca of Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9, receive electrical current in their homes. The project has made it possible to build approximately 14 km of transmission line, install 263 street illumination plants and electrify 423 homes. Sustainable and renewable energy guarantees illuminated streets for the residents of this small village and the electricity they need to manage their local businesses, schools and health-care facilities.\nPrimary development projects in progress and management of possible resettlement\n\nWe are located in a large geographical area and this necessarily requires being able to set up relationships tailored to each specific situation as well as developing a thorough knowledge of each territory and of the needs of the people who live there. By doing this, we can proactively include what is essential to them in the way we conduct our business. This type of constructive dialog makes it possible for all involved stakeholders, including ourselves, to become more aware of and contribute to the creation of innovative solutions, a fundamental element for a competitive, inclusive and sustainable business model. This interaction is even more necessary when the development of infrastructural projects involves the resettlement of a part of the population residing in the surrounding areas, which is a process that requires a very attentive engagement of those who are affected as well as a careful evaluation of the psychological and social problems that can be caused at an individual and collective level. This is why when we select the sites for developing our projects we adopt an approach that aims, first of all, to find alternative solutions, carefully studying what characterizes the communities from an economic, political, cultural and social-demographic point of view, to learn about the daily life of those who live in the area of influence, the distribution of the population, its forms of organization, levels of employment and wages. In the cases in which the option of relocation is the only viable solution, the project is developed in observance of applicable international standards, taking into consideration the possible impacts on the various forms of physical, human, economic, environmental and cultural capital of the affected populations as well as observance of the country legislation in force, including any local regulations that specify the conditions for resettlement and the methods for calculating the related economic compensation. This concrete commitment is stated in our Human Rights Policy (refer to chapter \u201cHuman Rights\u201d) and implemented through community relations based on a model for creating shared value (refer to the paragraph \u201cStrategy and model for creating shared value with communities\u201d in this chapter).\n\nHereafter, a description of the most significant projects under development and of past projects where we are managing residual critical issues jointly with a narrative outlining the positive and/or negative impacts (actual or potential) on the territory and the way in which we are promoting a proactive dialog to reach solutions that are as shared as possible.\nBocamina power plant (Chile)\n\nThe Bocamina II plant is a 350 MW coal-fired thermoelectric power station whose construction started in 2007 in the municipality of Coronel, Region of B\u00edo B\u00edo, in Chile. The plant is part of the coal-fired thermoelectric complex of Bocamina, whose first 128 MW unit was built in the 60s, commissioned in 1970 and closed at the beginning of 2021, three years ahead of the date identified in the Chilean National Decarbonization Plan, and subsequently to the closure of the coal-fired power plant of Tarapac\u00e1, which took place in 2019. The second unit, which is planned to close in 2022 in line with the pathway set to decarbonize our generation mix, was built in an area adjacent to the first unit, where approximately 1,300 families lived, for whom a resettlement process was necessary.\n\nIn 2017 this process was aligned with the main applicable international standards, including IFC no. 5 \u201cLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement\u201d. In particular, an extended analysis process was started in order to identify the suitable actions for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the resettlement project. This analysis was carried out with the support of a company with considerable experience in this area, Environmental Resources Management. The new quarters were equipped with social, sport and religious infrastructures, which were not initially included in the process, making it possible to preserve the social and human capital of the communities.\n\nToday, all the families concerned with the resettlement process have been consulted and involved and more than 1,200 agreements have been reached with a total of 1,370 involved families. The remaining families decided not to participate and remain in their place of origin. The resettlement process was formally closed in August 2020.\n\nThe redesign of the entire resettlement process makes it possible to redefine the relations with the concerned communities and focus on local development, as well as respect and transparency between the parties from a point of view of a just transition. The actions carried out in 2021 include:\n\n- the start of the work necessary for the requalification of approximately 240 homes in the communities of Huertos Familiares and Do\u00f1a Isidora, after a pilot phase in 2020 for six prototype homes that made it possible to identify the measures necessary for its subsequent extension on a larger scale. This is an important step in the process of recovering the relationship with these communities, which started in 2018 with the creation of a technical committee comprised of representatives of our Company, the community and the CITEC (Center of Investigation and Technologies of Construction \u2013 Universidad del B\u00edo B\u00edo) which has the objective of identifying the invention measures to be adopted for the requalification of homes with construction defects;\n- analysis of the impacts associated with the construction problems of the homes in which the communities lived since 2010, and the effects on the quality of life of the families, as well as the quantification and liquidation of the relative compensations;\n- reconstruction or financial compensation for the 12 churches which were not involved in the resettlement process;\n- an agreement for the reconstruction of the historical school in Coronel, \u201cRosa Medel\u201d financed by Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile in 2020, as agreed with the town hall and with the community;\n- the development of the \u201cMi barrio, nuestro barrio\u201d (My neighborhood, our neighborhood) program, which includes implementation of requalification projects for new and pre-existing areas affected by the plant. In addition to the completion of a sports center in the community of Huertos Familiares and company offices built by women of the community of Cerro Obligado within the scope of training activities for the development of eco-sustainable skills, the construction of a \u201cPark of the senses\u201d was completed, which provides an experience amongst greenery and native vegetation. Starting in 2020, and during all of 2021, work was carried out for two company offices, whereas work was started for two other offices as a part of the plan for the recovery of common spaces for the resettled communities. The same plan for the recovery of urban spaces includes the creation of the longest mural in Chile, along the external perimeter of the Bocamina power plant. This project was implemented with the local communities and is the graphic narration of the history of Coronel and its inhabitants and involved more than 70 people, from children to grandparents;\n- Coronel cleaning plan: which involves the elimination of the micro-waste landfills and the removal of residual materials from the homes where the transferred families lived previously, avoiding environmental impacts and situations of abandonment and insecurity;\n- transfer of eco-sustainable skills and circular economy projects: in the community of Cerro Obligado an eco-building project and an eco-furnishing project solely for women were realized in collaboration with the NGO Sembra; to date four women have had the training and from 2018 had their own operation in their workshop in Coronel where they reuse pallets and other materials of various local industries, transforming them into furniture and other items.\n\nFurthermore, in 2019, together with the local fishing community we defined a method for participating in borrowings dedicated to supporting artisan fishing, which allowed more than 580 small business people in 2020 to access resources to improve their activity. Two other notifications will be launched in 2022.\nTo further strengthen the local business fabric, since 2016 we have made an annual fund available to small companies in Coronel that made it possible for about a hundred of them to access economic resources to improve their business. 2021 was the last year of this initiative. Through the development of a system for managing the complaints and/or requests of the community based on criteria of transparency and fairness, it was possible to successfully resolve more than 1,000 reports, thanks to a multifunctional team that includes legal experts as well as resettlement and sustainability consultants, and that guarantees the verifiability, transparency and fairness of the solutions. The application of this system for managing complaints, in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on business and human rights, was recognized in 2021 by Pacto Global a nivel Latinoamericano as a practice of reference. Details are available at the following link https://www.pactoglobal-colombia.org/publicacion/buenas-practicas-en-derechos-humanos-y-empresas-en-latinoamerica/6/component.html#page/85. Further information can be found in the Enel Chile and Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile Sustainability Report (www.enel.cl; www.enelgeneracion.cl).\n\nAlto B\u00edo B\u00edo power plants (Ralco, Pangue and Palmucho \u2013 Chile)\n\nWe have an operational presence in the area of Alto B\u00edo B\u00edo (Ralco, Pangue and Palmucho), which is an area with a historical presence of the indigenous Pehuenche populations, where we manage three hydroelectric power plants. Numerically, the Pehuenche population in the area of influence of the plants amounts overall to approximately 3 thousand people, comprised of 800 families distributed in 10 communities (Pitril, Callaqui, El Avellano, Auki\u00f1 Wallmapu, Quepuca Ralco, Raico Lepoy, El Barco, Guayali, Pewen Mapu and Ay\u00edn Mapu). In February 2017 we signed an important collaboration agreement with 25 families of the Auki\u00f1 Wallmapu community for the start of local development projects, resolving the conflict related to the impacts generated by the construction of the Raico plant. The following June we also signed to similar agreements with the El Avellano and Quepuca Raico communities. In March 2017 we officially handed over the ancestral cemetery to the El Barco community, which completed the commitment that we had made with the community after the construction of the power plant. Furthermore, in 2020, our relationship with the local communities took an important step forward with the Quepuca Raico school project, whose construction was included in the agreements for the construction of the Raico power plant, and whose purpose is to valorize the cultural identity of the Pehuenche communities. Currently, working tables are active with the 10 communities in which plants have been defined for the sustainable progress of the territory that are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, mainly no. 8 and 4.\n\nSocial-economic development\n\nFollowing a request made mainly by the El Avellano community, a community project was created in 2018 for the collection, processing and sale of hazelnuts. In 2019, the production department was inaugurated, which allows the community to transform the native hazelnuts into sub-products to provide to the market, thereby diversifying their customer base. The project partners, who made it possible for a traditional activity to transform itself into a community type of micro-entrepreneurial business while maintaining the natural hazelnut groves, are the Universit\u00e0 di Concepci\u00f3n, the El Avellano community, the municipality of Alto B\u00edo B\u00edo and the Pehu\u00e9n Foundation. In consideration of the tourist and recreational potential of the areas near the plants, and in order to promote the social-economic development of the local communities, specific projects promoting sustainable tourism were started. In particular, one was started for the area adjacent to the El Barco Laguna, where local business people currently offer camping, tour and gastronomy services. More than 6,000 tourists visit the area every season, representing an important area for this initiative. The collaboration between us and the community was carried out mainly with the objective of improving the sanitary situation of the area and install new toilet facilities and discharges for the treatment of wastewater. A project is being developed in Los Chaicanes to promote potato cultivation. This initiative, which had the initial purpose of marketing the tuber for fresh consumption locally, led to the production of seed potatoes and the recognition of this production by the agricultural and zootechnical service (Servicio Agr\u00edcola y Ganadero) as authorized to sell seed potatoes in 32 municipalities of the region of La Araucan\u00eda. The establishment of community production cooperative allowed the community to access borrowings of more than 30,000 euros. During the period of health contingency due to the pandemic, the cooperative played a fundamental role in guaranteeing food safety for the municipality of Lonquimay. In fact, it was able to sell 15,000 kg of potatoes to the city, which were distributed to the families most economically impacted by the pandemic. In 2021, a depot was created for storage, which make it possible to lengthen the storage period and extend the period they can be sold. The processing room was expanded also in 2021 in order to expand the production capacity and also to support the production of high-quality honey.\nAccess to education\n\nAs regards access to education, we assign scholarships that cover school fees, room and board for young people in the cities where the schools are located and study materials. This initiative concerned more than 700 students in the areas where various indigenous communities reside in the southern part of the country. In 2021, in particular, the Company collaborated with the municipality of Alto B\u00edo B\u00edo, con la Fundacion Pehuen, with the communities of Renaico and, finally, with the communities of Mapuches di Pullinque and Pilmaiquen in the \u201cLos R\u00edos\u201d Region.\n\nShared and sustainable water management\n\nIn the region of B\u00edo B\u00edo, we also signed an agreement with the Chilean Minister of Public Works to improve the flexibility in the use of water, ensuring its supply to families and electric energy power plants. This agreement was subsequently ratified also with the local associations that manage the irrigation channels in the area of Saltos del Laja. This initiative is the result of a joint project with the associations Canalistas del Laja and Canalistas del Canal Za\u00f1artu, Direcci\u00f3n de Obras Hidr\u00e1ulicas, Direcci\u00f3n General de Aguas, Ministerio de Agricultura, Ministerio de Energ\u00eda and Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Riego. There is also an agreement with the municipality of Antuco in order to start a pilot project to promote tourism in the area of Salto del Trubunleo during summer. In order to manage possible contingent or emergency situations in a quick and coordinated manner, we defined a specific communication system between the power stations of Pangue and Ralco of Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile, the Angostura di Colb\u00fan power station, the municipalities of Alto B\u00edo B\u00edo, Quilaco and Santa B\u00e1rbara, the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security (ONEMI) and the Ministry of Energy. Further information can be found in the Enel Chile and Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile Sustainability Report (www.enelgeneracion.cl).\n\nEl Quimbo power plant (Colombia)\n\nEl Quimbo is the most imposing civil engineering project realized by the Enel Group over the past years and represents one of the greatest hydroelectric investments in Latin America. The power plant has an installed power of 400 MW and is located in the department of Huila, south-west of Bogot\u00e1. In line with our approach of sharing and involving all the stakeholders concerned with our activities in the areas involved with their development, starting in December 2014 we defined a multi-year plan of social-environmental projects that concern the local communities, and in particular families who are residents or who own property in the area of influence of the project, as well as those who work or have commercial and service activities in that area. The surveyed families who met the specified requirements were able to decide between resettlement (collective/individual) and the sale of their land. Of the 152 families who selected the first option, 40 selected individual resettlement, benefiting from the availability of land that could be used for a home as well as for production purposes. The remaining 112 families opted for collective resettlement (Montea, Santiago y Palacio, Llano de la Virgen, San Jos\u00e9 de Bel\u00e9n) with new homes equipped with essential services and inserted in an urban context with schools, churches, multifunctional sports facilities, soccer fields, green are-\nas, collection centers for the recycling of waste and waste water treatment plants. Each family also received 5 hectares of land with an irrigation system in order to develop their own productive activity (crops or mini ranches). Today, three of the four collective resettlement areas have completed and operative irrigation plants; the only exception is the district of Llano de la Virgen where the work is still in progress. Furthermore, 79 resident families, between collective and individual areas, already possess the ownership deed for their lot.\n\nSocial-economic development\n\nDuring 2021, we continued monitoring the technical aspects related to the resettlement activities. In particular, we performed more than 340 visits to the people responsible for the agriculture production projects. In 82% of the cases, we monitored and supported the agricultural production system, whereas in the remaining 18% of the cases, the processes were reinforced through the transfer of technological knowledge.\n\nIn addition to continuing the projects already identified for meeting the needs of the communities from the point of view of creating shared value, we started new ones with important entities and associations. Specifically:\n\n- 89 production projects related to the production of cacao, passion fruit, pineapple, coffee and the breeding of livestock were established;\n- we have fully distributed the contribution to be used for the realization of various productive projects and for promoting the economic growth in the municipalities of direct influence. In El Agradro (317 benefiting families) and Garz\u00f3n (13,832 benefiting families) the actions concerned the improvement in the sanitary conditions of the urban center and the road infrastructure, whereas in Gigante (2,559 benefiting families) the actions were targeted toward agricultural production projects and the improvement of road and sport infrastructure in the rural areas of the municipality; in Tesalia (92 families), a center concerned with the activities of three associations of local productions, we carried out a project for reinforcing the production supply chain of the cherry tomato through the application of protected crop technology;\n- we continued the implementation of the agreement stipulated with Casa Luker, the United States Agency for International Development, the University EAFIT and the Foundation Saldarriaga Concha in the seven concerned municipalities (Algeciras, Campoalegre, El Agradro, Garz\u00f3n, Gigante, Hobo, Riveral). Among the initiatives implemented within the scope of this agreement, we inaugurated the Training Center La Escalerita, rehabilitated 170 hectares in front of the Huila crops, with the replanting of 208 hectares, for a total accumulated since 2019 until today of approximately 590 rehabilitated hectares and 340 replanted hectares, reaching the prefixed goal. Furthermore, there was an improvement in the sales of cacao to the benefit of the almost 400 producer members of the department. The training and support for the adoption of management instruments should also be pointed out;\n- in the department of Huila, we signed an agreement with the association of ASOAPIS beekeepers in the municipality of Garz\u00f3n, which has 53 members. The agreement involves the transfer by us for the free use of 170 hectares of terrain next to the El Quimbo dam, which will be used for the production of honey and its derivatives. The project is without a doubt also to the benefit of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity, in addition to the association of beekeepers, as the presence of bees promotes pollination and the reproduction of plants. The objective for 2022 is to produce around 180 tons of honey, with an indirect benefit that will involve approximately 300 people, including families of the members and jobs to be created.\n\nEnvironmental management\n\nThe educational and support projects continued for the management and rational use of natural resources and environmental protection in the communities in the areas of direct and indirect influence, including the educational institutions of the six municipalities in the area. Specifically, we implemented 180 actions during 2021, including:\n\n- 3 training courses on the electric sector for each municipality;\n- 39 actions for promoting the environmental awareness of the communities and public and/or private institutions in the concerned regions, including the first webinar on climate change, called \u201cWhat is the climatic crisis? Searching for alternatives to protect the environment\u201d. The event was attended by approximately 270 people coming from 12 departments of Colombia and 10 municipalities of Huila with various profiles: ecological groups, university students, companies, governmental and non-governmental organizations;\n- 48 meetings with resettled families that were focused on good practices for environmental protection;\n- 13 training courses for resettled families on efficiency in productive projects: the rational use and management of water for consumption and irrigation, agri-food production and technology, administration and organization of the products for production and marketing;\n- the strengthening of 6 ecological groups through 30 coordination actions among the groups themselves and the institutions, and 37 consultations regarding the creation of projections;\n- 4 actions dedicated to sustainable tourism that involved the participation of public and private institutions locat-\nRestoration of the tropical forest (Colombia, Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation, El Quimbo hydroelectric plant)\n\nSince 2014 Enel-Emgesa has developed the largest ecological restoration project on a large scale of the tropical dry forest of Colombia in an area of more than 11,000 hectares, as a measure of environmental compensation for the construction of the \u201cEl Quimbo\u201d hydroelectric power plant in the region of Huila. The first pilot phase (2014-2018) involved identifying the most appropriate strategies to as well as determining the native species over 140 hectares. The main results were the propagation of approximately 215 thousand plants of 62 native species, the construction of almost 22,000 linear meters of fences for controlling the adjacent livestock farms, the building of a research center and the discovery of a new plant species unique to this area called Pitcairnia huilensis. Inside the restored area, a protected area of more than 900 hectares called \u201cCerro Matambo\u201d was created, which contributes to the conservation of the region\u2019s biodiversity. During the second phase, which started in 2018, a goal was fixed to have 500 hectares in active restoration by 2021, which, with the 640 hectares that were effectively reached, was significantly exceeded and resulted in the replanting of more than 480 thousand specimens of various native species. Finally, in 2021, approximately 2,700 hectares of the area under restoration were declared a Natural Reserve of Civil Society. Currently, almost 3,600 hectares out of the total of 11,000 hectares were declared a Protected Area of Colombia, which demonstrates the state of conservation and its importance for the purpose of maintaining the country\u2019s biodiversity.\n\nCommunication channels and legal proceedings\n\nSpecific communication channels were defined to provide information and respond to all the questions from the community regarding the project (dedicated web page, social channels, newsletter, etc.). The offices of Garz\u00f3n and Gigante have assisted approximately 470 people following requests and petitions who expressed total satisfaction with the assistance that was received. Some local inhabitants/fishers started \u201cacciones de grupo\u201d and \u201cacciones populares\u201d, which are currently pending, with the main complaint that the revenues from their businesses were reduced due to the construction of the power plant and a presumed impact on the activities of filling the Quimbo dam on downstream fishing. For more details, see the paragraph related to El Quimbo, in the section \u201cContingent assets and liabilities\u201d of the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional initiatives and information about the projects are available in the Emgesa Sustainability Report 2021 (https://www.enel.com.co/es/medio-ambiente-desarrollo-sostenible.html) and on the website dedicated to the project (https://www.enel.com.co/es/conoce-enel/enel-emgesa/el-quimbo.html).\nOther development projects\n\n850 MW EGP\u2013Nareva consortium wind project\n\nIn March 2016, a consortium between Enel Green Power and the Moroccan company Nareva, in partnership with the supplier Siemens Renewable Energy, was awarded the project for the development, construction and management of wind plants with a total installed capacity of 850 MW and for an overall investment of approximately 1 billion euros.\n\nThe purpose of the project is to supply renewable energy and support the social, economic and environmental development of the various involved areas from a point of view of greater access to electricity and reduction in dependency on fossil energy sources. The investment is managed, furthermore, in line with the principles adopted by the international community to ensure respect for human rights, protection of the environment and reduction in emissions deriving from coal and does not involve any type of extraction activity. The dialog with the concerned communities is a continuous process that is guaranteed by the repeated activities of consultation that support and update, if necessary, the results of the other analyses carried out.\n\nIn preparation of the development of the entire project, the consortium carried out a preliminary analysis of the social, economic and environmental context (SEECA) in the areas in which the plants are to be built (Midelt, Boujdour, Tiskrad, Jbel Lahdid), with the help of external specialists. The SEECA identified the relevant social-economic problems and the specific needs of the local communities that include: development of infrastructures, development of education, health care, development of social services, support for poverty and protection of cultural heritage.\n\nFollowing this, for the sites of Midelt and Boujdour, we carried out an Environmental Social Impact Assessment in compliance with the standards of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and other international guidelines; the same type of analysis is being carried out for Jbel Lahdid and will be developed for Tiskrad.\n\nThe accuracy of the analyses and the determination of the impacts and benefits for each site are starting points for defining the specific sustainability plan, which is expressed in actions that accompany all phases of the project, from construction to operation.\n\nIn particular, the construction phase is inspired by the \u201csustainable construction site\u201d model, which is based on practices and solutions that maximize the social, economic and environmental benefits for the territory and surrounding communities. This model is the standard practice we have adopted in all construction sites around the world.\n\nThis application of this model to the Midelt plant, for example, whose construction was completed in 2020, generated positive impacts on the local communities in terms of employment, training and transfer of skills: this includes an initiative that involved 300 workers selected from nearby communities, who were trained and employed by contractors and small-medium sized local businesses that operate in the transport, hotel, food service and cleaning sectors. The environmental impacts related to emissions, water consumption and waste were measured and mitigated by adopting virtuous solutions and actions. Specifically, the main solutions that were implemented are as follows:\n\n- **reduction in CO\u2082 emissions**: the installation of a photovoltaic mini-grid to power the base camp and auxiliary services; generation of photovoltaic energy integrated with batteries to power the turbine monitoring phase, autonomous photovoltaic modules to power prefabricated buildings/containers at the base camp; street lights powered by photovoltaic plants;\n\n- **reduction in the use of water and promotion of its reuse**: the adoption of systems for the collection, treatment, storage and reuse of rainwater, for the production, for example, of concrete and for dust control; reactivation of the well to the benefit of the community with the installation of a pumping system powered by the photovoltaic system mentioned above;\n\n- **reduction in the use of materials and the promotion of recycling**: reuse of all excavation materials to improve the conditions of roads and hillsides and to create new access roads and bridges to the benefit of the community; recycling of utilized wood pallets to create signs at the site.\n\nAlso for the operating phase, a sustainability plan was prepared that is based on the results of the second SEECA that was carried out, in line with the general approach that was described, with two main courses of action: realization and application of the sustainable plant model in order to maximize the social, economic and environmental benefits for the territory and the surrounding communities during the operating phase.\n\nTherefore, sustainability projects were started in favor of the surrounding communities, focused mainly on health and education in collaboration with the NGO Injaz Al Maghreb. In particular, caravans were provided dedicated to specialist medical examinations to the benefit of students in the community. 200 hours of training were provided to 15 people coming from the local community to insert them in the work force at the plant. In addition, 5 small and medium-sized businesses were involved for the supply of services related to the plant. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Moroccan Student Foundation, one scholarship will be granted per year to give the possibility to a student...\nin the local community to complete university studies. We are applying the same approach of a sustainable construction site also for the site of Boujdour. Some of the actions carried out are indicated below:\n\n- reduction of CO\u2082 emissions by means of a minigrid installed to power the base camps and auxiliary services;\n- reduction of the use of water through the reuse of the water used while working;\n- donations in favor of the surrounding community of systems for the water accumulation and recycling of materials used during construction for the requalification of roads and hillsides and to create signs at the construction site.\n\nAfter the construction phase, also in this case specific actions are planned for the plant operating phase that aim to maximize the benefits for the surrounding communities in terms of employment, creation of skills and use of local small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nFurthermore, during 2020, the Boujdour site was involved in the performance of a due diligence on human rights based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on business and human rights, the support of a renowned independent nonprofit organization with wide experience in this field. The results of this activity led to the preparation of an action plan that includes initiatives, among other projects, some of which were already completed, for:\n\n- guaranteeing anonymous access to channels that collect complaints from workers and the Saharawi communities;\n- avoiding discrimination in employment and promoting the use of Saharawi staff, including by means of specific training programs;\n- activating ad hoc projects/infrastructures for the needs of people who live in remote villages or for small local businesses, with a particular focus on the Saharawi population.\n\nThe results of the due diligence were also considered when carrying out the second SEECA and for defining the consultation process for the representatives of the Saharawi population, which is an activity carried out independently by an external qualified company and with proven experience in the area of sustainability. The consultation process included vulnerable groups, all belonging to the Saharawi population, and was carried out in Hassaniyya, the local language spoken by the Saharawi population, thanks to the inclusion in the team of an expert from that population. Interviews generally focused on: expectations and concerns about the project, perception of the project by the community, general challenges in the province and in the areas neighboring the site, means of support for the population, access to water and to electricity.\n\nThe completion of the consultation process provided a \u201csocial license\u201d to operate, in light of a general acceptance of the renewable project by the Saharawi stakeholders who were interviewed, who pointed out numerous opportunities that resulted in terms of employment and local economic development, evaluating the project in line with their advocacy activities for their people\u2019s right to development, work and access to energy.\n\nAlso in light of some fears that arose during the consultation by the younger segment regarding the shortage or absence of skills in the sector of renewables, the specific Sustainability Plan for Boujdour promotes the employment of the communities and local small business also during the operational phase of the plan with a particular focus on the Saharawi population, actions for training and the creation of local skills, projects in favor of more vulnerable pastoral communities and support for local cooperatives.\n\nDuring the phase of constructing the civil works, we trained and employed approximately 200 people of Saharawi origin as part of the non-qualified workforce. Currently the majority of the workers, approximately 79% (92 people), come from the local Saharawi community. Various contracts were stipulated with more than 100 local small and medium-sized business for the supply of auxiliary services during the construction work (supply of materials, vehicle rentals, security services, etc.). In this way, we contributed to the economic support of business people who were particularly affected by the consequences of the pandemic. Also in Boujdour, as for Midelt, attention was placed on health care requirements, in particular a medical caravan...\nwas made available to students coming from surrounding schools for specialist examinations of various type (general practitioners, dentists, ear, nose and throat doctors, etc.). Various projects were implemented to promote education, including: classes dedicated to approximately 1,000 beneficiaries held by local volunteers that covered topics related to renewables and the operation of the wind plants. Every year a scholarship will be given to one university student coming from the community of Boujdour, in collaboration with the NGO Moroccan Student Foundation. Finally, training centers were established that provided approximately 2,000 hours of teaching, to improve local knowledge for electrotechnical purposes.\n\nTo support the construction work of the plant, we also created new sections of road or requalified existing sections (approximately 60km) reconnecting state roads with grazing areas, thereby creating a benefit for the pastoral communities located in remote areas.\n\nA specific project is also planned for reinforcing the local connection to the city of Boujdour, which can therefore benefit from the renewable electric energy generated by the plant.\n\nFinally, we are monitoring the possible developments concerning the western Sahara. As regards the recent decisions of the European General Court agriculture and fishing agreements with Morocco in the Western Sahara, these concern aspects of treaty law that apply only to states and not to private investors. However, we are highly committed to implementing all of our projects in line with the principles adopted by the international community concerning human rights, protection of the environment and decarbonization. In this regard, the Boujdour project relates to the generation of electricity from renewable sources and is not directly connected to any extraction activity in the territory of residence of the Saharawi population.\n\nWindpeshi project \u2013 Colombia, La Guajira\n\nIn 2019 five Enel Green Power projects won approximately 740 GWh/year in the Cargo por Confiabilidad tender. The winning projects, of which three are wind turbines and two solar will power the country\u2019s energy system, which recently started its journey into the development of green energy. Windpeshi, Tumawind and Chemesky are the windfarms in the La Guajira department, a region characterized by a significant presence of the indigenous population, which represents 20% of this population in the whole country. Historically, it is a region with a very high rate of primary unmet needs such as access to potable water, energy and education.\n\nFor the Windpeshi plant, we launched the construction of both the windfarm and a transmission line. In both cases, the communities involved were consulted: 11 relating to the wind farm and 23 regarding the transmission line. The consultation process enabled identifying opportunities for developing projects that can promote access to both potable water and to education. In particular, with reference to:\n\n- **access to potable water**, the public water system was inaugurated in favor of the rural communities spread throughout the region. The project will benefit 3 thousand Wayuu indigenous people and will make it possible to access water, treat it and make it potable, store and distribute it, improving the quality of life of the population. This project was financed by the \u201cobras por impuestos\u201d mechanism and falls within the Colombian Ministry for housing\u2019s Guajira azul program. A second water system, Amalipa will benefit the communities in the area of influence of the transmission line. Finally, also in the department of La Guajira, wells are being constructed and rehabilitated to permit the use of water for other purposes;\n\n- **access to education**, an agreement was signed with SENA (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje) to start processes for job training and sustainable entrepreneurship in the communities in the area of influence of the projects, as well as the specialization of non-qualified work in the project activities, with the result that 65 people were trained in construction-related topics.\n\nWe also reached an agreement with the University of La Guajira for the creation of an intercultural manual, which represents a fundamental tool for understanding the dynamics and particular aspects of the ethnic communities and, through an agreement with Artesan\u00edas de Colombia, we are promoting in the Wayuu territory the artisan processing of the Wayuu fabric in the area of influence of the Windpeshi wind park.\n### Suppliers\n\n#### Priorities\n- Economic and financial value creation\n- Sustainable supply chain\n\n#### Plan\n- **PEOPLE**\n  - Suppliers\n\n#### SDG\n\n| Activities | 2021-2023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022-2024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Qualified suppliers\\(^1\\) assessed for health and safety aspects for all product groups (% qualified suppliers) | 100% | 99% | | 100% | S | 3 |\n| Qualified suppliers\\(^1\\) assessed for environmental aspects for all product groups (% qualified suppliers) | 100% | 99% | | 100% | E | 12 |\n| Qualified suppliers\\(^1\\) assessed for human rights and business ethics aspects for all product groups (% qualified suppliers) | 100% | 99% | | 100% | S | 12 |\n| Continual increase in the coverage rate of \u201csustainability K\u201d tenders (% of \u201csustainability K\u201d tenders/total tenders) | 80% by 2023 | 83% | | 92% by 2024 | S | 12 |\n| Supplies\u2019 value covered by Carbon Footprint (CFP) certification\\(^2\\) | + | 59% | | 75% by 2024 | E | 12 |\n| Supplies\u2019 value covered by Carbon Footprint certification or CFP estimation by international database\\(^3\\) | + | 76% | | 95% by 2024 | E | 12 |\n| Ratio of tenders including mandatory Sustainability Requirements | + | + | | 35% by 2024 | E | 12 |\n\n---\n\n1.

It also means suppliers are essential partners to achieve sustainable progress across our operating footprint.\n\nCompanies that stimulate their suppliers to commit to sustainability will also be able to better quantify the total impacts generated.\n\nOur purchasing processes are underpinned by loyalty, transparency and collaboration, and in addition to guaranteeing the necessary quality standard, we request that our suppliers adopt best practices in terms of human rights and environmental impact of their activities. The latter include working conditions, health and safety, adequate hours worked, rejection of forced or child labor, respect for personal dignity, non-discrimination and inclusion of diversity, freedom of association and collective bargaining, and respect for privacy by design and by default.\n\nAll of the above, within a clear codes of conduct framework that includes, to name a few, our Human Rights policy, Code of Ethics, Zero Tolerance for Corruption plan and our global compliance programs.\n\n### Purchases and tenders for goods and services\n\n**Supplies, works and services contracts (mil euros)**\n\n| Year | Supplies | Works | Services |\n|------|----------|-------|----------|\n| 2019 | 5,245    | 3,702 | 5,428    |\n| 2020 | 5,480    | 3,625 | 4,965    |\n| 2021 | 6,510    | 3,776 | 6,744    |\nTop 10 Enel sourcing locations\n\nThe graph shows the countries where suppliers are located.\n\nIn 2021, the total from contracts for works, services and supplies amounts to over 17 billion euros, of which more than a third is in Italy, followed by Spain and Brazil.\n\nOur procurement strategy is based on three fundamental principles:\n\n1. **enlarging buyers skills**, using user-friendly technologies, digitizing all processes and providing online training courses on the main aspects related to the procurement and Enel world, including courses dedicated to human rights and to employment practices standards that our suppliers must respect, while acknowledging everyone\u2019s contribution to a multicultural work environment based on trust and animated by passion;\n\n2. **enhancing integration and communication** with internal customers, jointly defining together solutions that can meet their needs, exploiting new, interdisciplinary and agile working methods;\n\n3. **involving suppliers from the onset of our internal customer needs**, to develop innovative approaches together.\n\nCost minimization, once a traditional indicator for measuring supply chain effectiveness, is now flanked by other metrics aimed at maximizing value creation in its various forms (safety, timing, quality, risk reduction, performance, flexibility, sustainability).\n\nIn addition, in 2021 **two communities** were launched with the involvement of different staff Functions and Business Lines at Enel, to further integrate the principles of sustainability and circular economy within the entire supply chain management process and to measure the value it creates, including the contribution to the sustainable development goals to which the Group has committed publicly.\nSupplier management and assessment processes\n\nIn addition to compliance with local legislation, procurement processes are based on criteria to promote sustainable development and social stability, as well as on the principles of free competition, equal treatment, non-discrimination, transparency and rotation. The selection of the best partners and the execution of contracts according to the highest standards of sustainability are guaranteed by our analysis and monitoring of the entire procurement process:\n\n- **100% of the purchasing product categories are preliminarily evaluated in terms of risk**, on the basis of integrity, environmental, social and economic criteria;\n- during the **qualification** stage, potential suppliers are assessed based on very stringent criteria relating to occupational health and safety, human rights, and the environmental impact of their activities;\n- during the **tender** stage, there are specific mandatory sustainability requirements and reward factors (sustainability K), in order to contribute to the promotion of responsible practices at a systemic level;\n- throughout the **duration of the contract**, we monitor compliance with the requirements and reward factors (Supplier Performance Management).\n\nTogether with suppliers, we work to define new metrics and indicators and to promote co-innovation projects fostering decarbonization and circular economy, with positive impacts on both manufacturing and purchasing processes. In particular, for the 13 most strategic product categories, which now represent more than 50% of the expenditure on the purchase of materials, we require the Environmental Product Declaration at a global level, the aim of which is to quantify, certify and objectively communicate the impacts generated in the entire life cycle of supplies (water consumption, CO\u2082 emissions, impact on the soil, etc.). Certified data enables us to measure emissions for the entire supply chain, supporting the Group\u2019s decarbonization pathway. All processes are carried out digitally via the portal made available to suppliers with a view to environmental sustainability, by reducing the use of paper.\nSupplier qualification system\n\nEach potential supplier, taking into account their business, can undertake a qualification pathway for one or more product groups and select the countries in which to supply goods and services. Suppliers are only acknowledged as suitable if they meet all the specific requirements for each product group (PG).\n\nAll product groups are analyzed at a global level and with the support of the different areas involved in the field, to set the requirements in question. In particular, the analysis involves:\n\n- mapping of the activities included in each PG;\n- choice of the qualification pathway depending on supplier type (there are ad hoc processes for start-ups, sector leaders and industrial groups);\n- allocation of a risk level for each key issue (safety, environment, human rights, irreplaceable supplier, etc.); and\n- categorization into product groups based on the risk detected.\n\nThe qualification pathways may therefore differ according to the combination of the risk level identified and the countries for which the supplier has chosen to qualify.\n\nWith specific reference to sustainability aspects, the questionnaires require information on:\n\n- **health and safety**, via the \u201cSafety Self-Assessment\u201d and its straightforward indication to our suppliers of the fundamental requirements on which to work and grow together;\n- **environment**: the environmental criteria provide an evaluation scale from 1 to 3 (where 1 is the worst rating and 3 the best) and differ depending on the product category in question and the associated risk level. Moreover, for product categories with a higher risk, an on-site audit at the contractor\u2019s premises/sites is always required;\n- **human rights**: the assessment is independent of the PG risk level and involves an analysis of potential suppliers regarding existing labor practices (such as rejection of forced or child labor, respect for diversity and non-discrimination, freedom of association and collective bargaining, fair and favorable working conditions, including hours worked and adequate wages, protection of workers\u2019 privacy, checks on the supply chain) and community relations (local, indigenous and tribal) and society.\n\nBefore proceeding with qualification, we also check the reputation of the potential supplier by means of national and international data providers and we check compliance with the legislation and regulations in force as well as adherence to the principles to which we have committed through our Human Rights Policy, Code of Ethics, Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan and global compliance programs, with specific reference to the lack of conflict of interest (including potential) and, depending on the specific risk classes, the submission of specific certifications/self-declarations or on-site visits to check whether the above-mentioned requirements have been met.\n\nIf the outcome of these analyses and assessments is positive, individual suppliers can qualify and be added to the Supplier Register (or remain on it if previously qualified) and then be invited to participate in the Group\u2019s procurement procedures. If the outcome is negative, the supplier may submit a new request for qualification at a later date.\n\nCompliance with the requirements must be assured for the entire duration of the qualification and, as such, those already included in the Enel Register of Qualified Suppliers are constantly monitored, partly by reference to external databases, for events that may affect their company and its main representatives.\nIn 2021, 100% of new qualified suppliers were assessed according to social, environmental and safety criteria. The number of qualified suppliers with a contract still active at the end of 2021 is approximately 6,900 (around 61% of active suppliers as of December 31), while the total number of active qualified companies is approximately 14,000.\n\nThe following table shows the trend in the qualified suppliers percentage for the three aspects analyzed by process.\n\n| % suppliers qualified at December 31 |\n|-------------------------------------|\n| Human rights                        |\n| Safety                              |\n| Environment                         |\n| 2019  85                            |\n| 2020  93                            |\n| 2021  99                            |\n| 2019  85                            |\n| 2020  93                            |\n| 2021  99                            |\n| 2019  85                            |\n| 2020  93                            |\n| 2021  99                            |\n\n**Tendering and contracting processes**\n\nConsistent with our commitment to introduce sustainability aspects into the tendering processes, we adopted a structured process governed by a specific procedure to define \u201csustainability Ks\u201d, which can be used in the tendering stage by the various purchasing and monitoring units throughout the entire life of the contract.\n\nThe process involves a \u201cLibrary\u201d, cataloging all the \u201csustainability Ks\u201d, consistent with the various PGs and grouped into two macro-categories:\n\n- **environmental Ks**, including waste management, carbon footprint assessment according to UNI EN ISO 14067:2018; circular economy projects;\n- **social Ks**, including training to develop the skills of local communities, or action to ensure respect for gender diversity.\n\nThe Library is periodically updated by the two sustainability and circularity communities, taking into account the maturity of the market in terms of specific sustainability practices and new business strategies.\n\nWe include specific clauses in all contracts for works, services and supplies, which are updated periodically to take account of the various regulatory changes and align to international best practices. The General Terms and Conditions comprise a general section containing provisions applicable to all countries, as well as Country Annexes which contain the clauses specific to each country.\n\nThe general terms and conditions refer to the current regulations on remuneration, contributions, insurance and tax, with reference to all workers employed for any reason in the execution of the contract by the supplier. In addition, the principles set out in the ILO Conventions and the legal obligations regarding the protection of child labor and women are explicitly recalled, as are equal treatment, prohibition of discrimination, abuse and harassment; freedom of association, association and representation; rejection of forced labor; safety and environmental protection and conditions of health safety (Art. 29.1.3 of the General Terms and Conditions). In the event of conflict between the latter and the ILO Conventions, the more restrictive standards will prevail.\n\nThe clauses also state that suppliers must undertake to prevent any form of corruption (Art. 29.1.5 of the General Terms and Conditions).\n\nIn addition to the legal provisions, the contractual conditions require that our suppliers:\n\n- recognize the \u201cTen Principles\u201d of the United Nations Global\nCompact and declare that they manage their business activities and operations in order to meet these fundamental responsibilities in the fields of human rights, labor, the environment and the fight against corruption (Art. 28 of the General Terms and Conditions);\n\n- acknowledge the commitments we have made in the principles listed in the documents below and refer to them in the execution of the contract: the Human Rights Policy, which also includes a principle relating to respect for biodiversity; the Code of Ethics; the Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan; and the global models for the prevention of criminal risks (Art. 29.1.2 of the General Terms and Conditions);\n- adopt suitable conduct to avoid the emergence of conflicts of interest throughout the entire term of the contract and to notify us promptly in writing if any such circumstances arise (Art. 29.2 of the General Terms and Conditions).\n\nWe reserve the right to carry out any control and monitoring activity to check compliance with the obligations set out above by both the supplier and any of its subcontractors, and to terminate the contract immediately if any breach is ascertained.\n\nSupplier Performance Management\n\nThe Supplier Performance Management (SPM) process enables us to evaluate and monitor the performance of our suppliers during both the procurement process and the execution of the contract.\n\nThe goal, with a view to collaboration with our suppliers, is not only to take any corrective actions during the execution of the contract, but also to encourage a pathway of improvement made possible by actions that reward best practices. The process is based on the objective and systematic disclosure of data and information on the execution of the contracted work. This data is used to develop specific indicators, also called categories (Quality, Punctuality, Health and Safety, Environment, Human Rights & Fairness, Innovation & Collaboration), which are combined to form a weighted average and produce the Supplier Performance Index (SPI).\n\nThe categories and SPI can be used as assessment elements for participation in tenders and for maintenance of the contractual relationship.\n\nMonitoring activities are conducted by the various Business Lines with support from the relevant health, safety and environmental units, where applicable, and the Qualification & Vendor Rating unit. In addition, all Enel people who interact with suppliers have the opportunity to express their own assessment using the dedicated Track & Rate app.\n\nIn the event of poor performance, we take specific actions that can be reflected in:\n\n- qualification (for example, its suspension, review of the application class \u2013 i.e. bands of tender amounts within which suppliers can gain access, placement on the blacklist, exclusion from the list of qualified suppliers, etc.); and/or\n- the contract (for example, further investigations, improvement action plan, termination, reduction in volumes, etc.).\n\nIf issues are found with the conduct of a supplier, an action plan may be drawn up jointly, the execution of which is subjected to our constant monitoring.\n\nThe SPM process monitored 638(17) PGs and 6,020 contractors last year (compared to 612 PGs and around 7,050 contractors in 2020).\n\n---\n\n(17) Out of a total of approximately 700 product groups.\nMonitoring systems\nThe monitoring process for our suppliers is regulated by specific Group procedures that state the rules to be followed for services rendered by:\n\n- contractors during the execution of the contract, via safety and environmental inspections aimed at preventing accidents, injuries, diseases and environmental events;\n- Enel people while performing their duties, to identify any existing non-conformities and potential dangers and reduce the reputational risk of the Company as a consequence of inadequate actions by workers and contractors.\n\nInspections are planned on an annual basis and are scheduled in an integrated manner, to ensure that no area of the organization proceeds without suitable monitoring. During on-site verifications (in 2021, 1,316 safety assessments were carried out as a result of non-compliance), specific checklists are used, which help to focus attention on the contractual provisions (for example, HSE conditions), on technical standards, on authority and legislative requirements, and also provide for the uniform classification of non-conformities for subsequent corrective action to be taken.\n\nAt each stage of the procurement process, specific committees comprising representatives from both the purchasing area and the Business Lines assess and monitor supplier performance.\n\nIn particular, the following committees have been established:\n\n- the Qualification Committee (396 sessions held in 2021);\n- the Integrity Committee (64 sessions in 2021): this includes representatives from Global Procurement, the Legal Function, the Security Function and the technical Functions of the Business Lines; it meets whenever a critical issue emerges that may have negative repercussions on the integrity of the supplier in question. The Committee is tasked with sharing and analyzing these critical issues and evaluating the activation of specific actions/sanctions on supplier companies.\n\nMoreover, individual country-specific units (\u201cContract Control Areas\u201d) have been set up to carry out checks on responsible management by our supply chain and to assess and manage risks relating to joint and several liability (contractually applicable to successful tenderers and any subcontractors). The checks include an initial mass document analysis to check that suppliers have made timely social security contributions and complied with their contractual obligations. A subsequent, second-level check on a sample of tenders involves targeted and thorough verifications with on-site inspections.\n\nIn addition, our suppliers have specific whistleblowing channels available, as set out in our Human Rights Policy and in our Code of Ethics. Local contact channels are available to ensure access to this mechanism for all interested stakeholders, in their own language.\n\nOur individual and ecosystemic approach to reject forced labor\n\nEnel\u2019s commitment against forced or compulsory labor and any form of slavery and human trafficking \u2013 as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO Convention n. 29) \u2013 is depicted in our Human Rights Policy (principle 2.1.1. \u2013 employment practices section). We comply with the UN Global Compact and require the application of ILO conventions to our contractors (please refer to the \u201cHuman Rights Management\u201d paragraph).\nIn addition to guaranteeing the necessary quality standards, our suppliers are requested to adopt best practices in terms of human rights and working conditions (including adequate hours worked, respect of personal dignity, non-discrimination and integration of diversity, freedom of association and collective bargaining), occupational health and safety, environmental responsibility, impact on local community, dissemination of human rights principles throughout the supply chain and respect for data protection by design and by default.\n\nWe have in place a voluntary due diligence process on our human rights management system, running on three-year cycles (please, refer to the \u201cHuman Rights Management\u201d paragraph). Mandatory due diligence mechanisms are being discussed at European Union level (refer to the proposed text of directive on \u201cCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence\u201d released on February 23, 2022) and are expected to bring benefits in terms of transparency about overall human rights management processes at corporate level and, hence, on procurement processes.\n\nWith specific reference to the photovoltaic supply chain, besides legislation, we are carrying out a number of initiatives both individually and working jointly with other utilities, our suppliers and sector associations. Namely:\n\na. on the individual side, we:\n   \u2022 request suppliers to develop a silicon traceability system to guarantee and verify the origin of silicon as well as tracing our supply chain, up to polysilicon, and planning on-site audit at the factories that are involved in the supply of materials and equipment used in the solar panels;\n   \u2022 verify, benchmark and instigate any necessary improvements to our suppliers\u2019 codes of conduct (such as Human Rights Policy and Code of Ethics, or equivalent) using our UNGPs, OECD, ILO and Global Compact based standards as a reference;\n\nb. on the ecosystemic side, we:\n   \u2022 participate in some specific initiatives like the \u201cSupply Chain Transparency Monitoring Programme\u201d. This is an initiative launched by the member-led association Solar Power Europe with the aim to ensure that solar products imported to our continent are not associated to human rights violations, as well as being aimed at enhancing the level of transparency, including a broader approach to sustainability, and therefore addressing the requirements that might be included in the upcoming EU legislation;\n   \u2022 have fostered the set up of the \u201cGlobal Alliance for Sustainable Energy\u201d, a recently launched initiative involving national and international players operating in the energy sector and who are willing to lead, accelerate and foster transition to a decarbonized economy. The objectives of the Alliance include the redefinition of the very concept of \u2018sustainable energy\u2019 and the involvement of stakeholders working in or having relations with such sector, such as civil society, policy-makers, academia and raw material suppliers. Within the Alliance, a specific human rights and inclusion working group has been set up with the aim of mapping salient issues along the value chain, define a code of conduct and a reporting tool to solve current fragmentation of standards;\n   \u2022 will carry out further specific initiatives in synergy with the solar industry with the aim to guarantee the sustainability of the supply chain. These initiatives will include:\n     - sharing best practices in terms of \u2018codes of conduct\u2019 (such as Human Rights Policy and Code of Ethics, or equivalent);\n     - assessing that labor practices at the factories involved in the supply of materials and equipment used in the solar panels to be installed in European power plants are sustainable, within any limit set by issues impacting factory visits resulting from the Covid situation, industrial property confidentiality and commercial as well as geopolitical restrictions;\n     - including, in EU companies requests for bids, requirements for photovoltaic (PV) module suppliers concerning the respect of human rights and sustainability standards along their supply chain, as well as the implementation of a traceability system for the materials that compose the solar panel, giving full visibility of it to their customers also through due diligence processes related to environmental and human rights aspects.\n\nConsidering that PV will represent a key technology to enable the energy transition in the EU and worldwide, we believe Europe needs to have a certain type of strategic PV production inside its borders and to build the related supply chain. We are convinced that if we leverage on the momentum for renewables, thanks to the existing R&D and industrial know-how still present in the EU and with support from the EU itself, a new roadmap can be created towards a European industry for solar panels. That is why we welcome the launch in January by the European Commission of a public consultation on the EU solar energy strategy. The consultation is seeking input on the main bottlenecks and barriers to investment under existing rules. It looks at policy measures with, among its objectives, that of\n\n(LB) In line with the framework of the United Nations Guiding Principles.\nensuring secure supplies of affordable and sustainable solar energy products through supply-side measures, including high sustainability standards and global PV supply chain resilience.\n\nIn the EU Industrial Strategy published by the European Commission in April 2021, Solar PV together with other renewable energy technologies is one of the key industrial ecosystems for the EU. The European supply chain will thus need to be strengthened in order to facilitate access to rapidly growing markets within the continent and globally. Moreover, the efforts that the European Commission is putting forward on the topic are complemented by the newly set European Raw Materials Alliance as a central platform aimed at identifying solutions to supply bottlenecks. Furthermore, the European Battery Alliance work is converging on the same goal.\n\nIn a nutshell, the EU is laying the grounds for the creation of a sound solar value chain within its borders.\n\nTraining and information\n\nWe have organized many meetings with contractors on sustainability matters in recent years, with a view to exchanging ideas. In addition, articles are published periodically on the Enel Global Procurement website that highlight the commitment made by the Group to these topics (https://globalprocurement.enel.com). We have also implemented numerous initiatives to engage contractors with regard to protection and awareness, particularly on health and safety matters. Due to these initiatives, there has been a significant decrease in accidents at work in recent years (for further details, see the \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d chapter of this document).\n\nEnel & Suppliers for Sustainable Value\n\nWe have launched several initiatives to increase the resilience of the supply chain and to make Supplier Centricity more and more concrete and tangible. One example is the Supplier Development Program, launched in July 2020 and relaunched in November 2021 when it was opened to over 6,000 suppliers in Italy, to support the growth pathway companies in the supply chain and, at the same time, to contribute to achieving the Group\u2019s strategic objectives. The program is aimed at companies, based or with branches in Italy, that are qualified or at an advanced stage of qualification in our Supplier Register and have a production value up to 250 million euros. We pay particular attention to small and medium enterprises operating in strategic sectors that will benefit from our direct support to provide access to certain services. By entering into agreements with the main players, we guarantee more favorable conditions than the market average and we contribute with partial coverage of the services offered as part of the program. These range from financial instruments that can facilitate access to liquidity, to managerial and technical training programs that promote the conversion of the business towards the energy transition, from consulting services on sustainability, circular economy, strategy, M&A and internationalization, to access to catalogs of means of transport and working machines, all the way to services to obtain certifications. Particular attention is paid to initiatives to support the conversion and diversification of businesses, such as the \u201cCompanies Counter\u201d, consisting of periodic meetings with individual traditional generation companies to support them in their processes of growth and redevelopment towards expansion in areas such as renewables or new services related to energy efficiency.\n\nThe development that Enel intends to promote takes the form of:\n\n\u2022 increased awareness about sustainability and digitalization matters;\n\u2022 differentiation of the business and consequent reduction in supplier dependence on Enel;\n\u2022 increased financial strength;\n\u2022 internationalization, which helps grow our business outside of Italy and Europe.\n\n(19) Source: https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/public-consultation-feed-new-eu-strategy-solar-energy-2022-jan-18_en#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20has%20launched%20for%20publication%20later%20this%20year%20a%20consultation%20on%20the%20socio%20economic%20benefits%20of%20solar%20energy%20for%20wider%20society.\nOn the other hand, the Supplier Journey project seeks to improve efficiency and maximize the value of our relations with suppliers, throughout the entire process. Here too, we actively analyze our processes, systems and the approach followed when working with suppliers on a daily basis, thus facilitating the improvement actions identified by listening to the principal actors involved: buyers, contract managers, administrative colleagues and suppliers.\n\n\u201cThanks to the Supplier Development Program we support more than 6,000 companies on the path to sustainable and digital development, encouraging the growth of skills and their economic and financial consolidation.\u201d\n\nFlavia Vicari\nHead of Supplier Development and Operational Excellence Procurement, Italy\n\nEnergie per Crescere (Italy)\n\nIn early 2022, the \u201cEnergie per Crescere\u201d (\u201cEnergies for Growth\u201d) program was launched, in conjunction with the training institution ELIS, to include around 5,500 young people in the world of work within the next two years. This program was created to meet the needs of network technicians to be employed in operational roles, with a specific focus on activities related to the management of electricity networks (cable installers, cable jointers, secondary substation and PTP installers, LV live operators). ELIS will coordinate the initiative for the selection, training and identification of professional profiles, to hire candidates at one of Enel\u2019s partner companies on a fixed-term contract of 6 months or more, with the possibility of continuing. Before starting work at the companies, they will follow a 5-week training course at Accredia-certified institutes and the participants will also receive a refund for the course.\n\nRequests for staff from companies participating in the program will be processed according to geographical area, and in the selection phase, will be managed by some of the major employment agencies; candidates will be able to evaluate the employment location proposed.\nFuel procurement\n\nSuppliers of solid and liquid fuel are selected through the \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d process that, for each counterpart, evaluates the reputational and economic-financial aspects and their satisfaction of the appropriate technical and commercial requirements.\n\nChecks also ensure that suppliers are not on any specific UN, EU or Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) blacklists. These lists identify individuals or organizations associated with terrorist associations, organizations under EU financial sanctions, and so-called Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) who are subject to US sanctions on terrorism or drug trafficking charges, among others.\n\nTo assess the sustainability aspects of coal sources, an internal process has been established to ensure that Group requirements for occupational safety, environment and human rights have been satisfied.\n\nPurchase contracts entered into with each supplier are subject to the Group principles embedded in the Human Rights Policy, the Code of Ethics and the Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan, with which suppliers must comply. We reserve the right to terminate contracts in severe cases of non-compliance with those principles.\n\nLastly, to mitigate the risks arising from the maritime shipment of fuel, we have adopted a tool to vet and select the carriers used. Vetting is a recognized industry standard for oil transportation; but, for a few years now, Enel and an increasing number of operators have also begun to apply this methodology to the transportation of bulk cargoes.\n\n| Resources used in the production process | UM | December 2021 | December 2020 | December 2019 |\n|-----------------------------------------|----|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Fuel consumption for thermoelectric production from non-renewable sources | | | | |\n| from non-renewable sources | | | | |\n| Coal (000 t) | | 5,958 | 5,893 | 18,483 |\n| Lignite (000 t) | | 0 | 105 | 730 |\n| Fuel oil (000 t) | | 863 | 975 | 1,246 |\n| Natural gas (Mm\u00b3) | | 15,682 | 13,075 | 13,513 |\n| Gas oil (000 t) | | 1,033 | 906 | 1,601 |\n| from renewable resources | | | | |\n| Biomass and waste for thermoelectric production (000 t) | | 71 | 89 | 131 |\n| Biogas (Mm\u00b3) | | 0.7 | 0.1 | 1.3 |\n| Geothermal steam used for electricity production (000 t) | | 350,160 | 350,090 | 109,891 |\nBettercoal\n\nTogether with major European electric utilities, we are actively engaged in Bettercoal \u2013 a global initiative to promote the continuous improvement of corporate responsibility in the international coal industry. Bettercoal has released a code of conduct based on existing and agreed standards of social responsibility in the mining sector. This details guidelines which mining companies can refer to when drawing up their own social, environment and ethical policies. The Bettercoal Code tells suppliers what members expect from their practices in relation to four main categories: management; commitment to ethics and transparency; human and labor rights; and environmental performance, while promoting ongoing improvement. In 2020, a new version of the Code was finalized to align it with the latest best practices in sustainability, thereby contributing to achievement of the applicable Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nAfter signing a letter of commitment, mining participants in the program embark on a virtuous path by accepting on-site checks, carried out by independent third parties, to verify that the Code\u2019s principles have been applied, and agreeing an ongoing improvement plan to overcome any shortcomings.\n\nIn addition to Bettercoal\u2019s growing presence in various forums in the area of coal and supply chain sustainability, the initiative has become an example of collaboration among the various stakeholders, geared towards improving socially responsible practices within the supply chain. During 2021, the mining companies committed to the Bettercoal initiative produced more than 400 mil t of coal. Although the global pandemic linked to Covid-19 prevented the inspections planned in Russia, Colombia and South Africa, 12 improvement plans were monitored actively throughout the year, and the two working parties dedicated specifically to Russia and Colombia continued their work.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the website: www.bettercoal.org.\n### Environmental sustainability\n\n#### Priorities\n- Economic and financial value creation\n- Ecosystems preservation and environmental management\n\n#### Plan\n\n#### SDG\n\n#### Targets\n\n| Activities | 2021\u20132023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022\u20132024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Reduction of specific SO\u2082 emissions | -94% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | -89% compared to 2017 (0.07 g/kWh) | | -94% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | E | 12 |\n| Reduction of specific NO\u2093 emissions | -70% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | -56% compared to 2017 (0.35 g/kWh) | | -70% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | E | 12 |\n| Reduction of specific particulate matter emissions | -98% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | -98% compared to 2017 (0.005 g/kWh) | | -98% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | E | 12 |\n| Specific water requirement* | -65% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | -52% compared to 2017 (0.21 l/kWh) | | -65% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | E | 12 |\n| Reduction of waste products | -87%* in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | -87% compared to 2017 (1.2 mil t) | | -87%* in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | E | 12 |\n\n**\u201cZERO Plastic\u201d project** - Reduction of single-use plastics at Enel Group sites\n- Reducing single-use plastics (office scope), compared to the new structure imposed by the pandemic, in the main countries of operation\n- Extension of the project in plants by 2023\n- Enel sites in Italy*: -85% by 2023\n- Enel sites in Spain: -75% by 2023\n- The project follows the evolution of the pandemic emergency and the \u201cnew-normal\u201d are being evaluated to define an effective plan to reduce the single use plastic\n- Enel sites in Italy*: -75% by 2021\n- Enel sites in Spain: -65% by 2021\n- Reducing single-use plastics (office scope), compared to the new structure imposed by the pandemic, in the main countries of operation\n- Extension of the project in plants by 2024\n- Enel sites in Italy*: -85% by 2024\n- Enel sites in Spain: -75% by 2024\n\n---\n\n(1) The target for 2024 is -93% compared to 2017.\n(2) The target for 2024 is -65% compared to 2017.\n(3) The target for 2024 is -98% compared to 2017.\n(4) Extractions considered net of the portion of water discarded into the sea after the desalination process (brine).

For this reason, in Enel they are considered strategic and integrated factors in the planning, operation and development of our activities for promoting sustainable economic development in the communities where we work, as well as determining factors for consolidating the Company\u2019s leadership in the energy markets. Being an energy company, our operations depend on natural resources, but at the same time they have an impact on them. For this reason, we integrate risk and opportunity assessments into our decision-making processes and our Group governance, through the definition of specific targets aimed at reducing impacts on nature, restoring habitats and sharing the benefits of ecosystem services with the communities with which we interact.\n\nRecent years have marked a significant increase in global awareness of the need for a commitment to tackle the ever-increasing loss of biodiversity. This commitment has been strongly relaunched by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which is working on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, a policy document that will be adopted by signatory countries at COP15 to be held in 2022 in Kunming, China. In parallel, the European Commission has published the Biodiversity Strategy(1) which includes targets that are binding for Member States.\n\nEnel\u2019s commitment to biodiversity\n\nEnel commits to achieve No Net Loss of biodiversity for new infrastructures by 2030, starting implementation on selected projects in high Biodiversity significance areas as of 2025. To reach this goal, Enel will operate in line with the mitigation hierarchy principles, to avoid, minimize and recover impacts to Natural Habitats or habitats and species that are threatened, endemic or restricted-range. Moreover, Enel commits to preserve forests and in case deforestation cannot be avoided, Enel pledges to restore/benefit areas of an equivalent value in line to \u201cNo Net Deforestation\u201d principle. Enel will not build new infrastructures in UNESCO World Heritage Natural Sites(2).\n\n---\n\n(1) COMM (2020) 380 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.\n(2) In any case, Enel commits to accomplish the obligation arising from service needs with the best viable and affordable solutions.\nWe actively support the definition of a European Commission action plan, \u201cTowards a Zero Pollution Ambition for air, water and soil \u2013 building a Healthier Planet for Healthier People\u201d\\(^3\\), as a concrete tool to guide environmental performance for the industrial sector, and we have updated our environmental policy\\(^4\\) with a view to continuous improvement and management of our assets and service offerings. We are also an active participant in the discussion of targets, evaluation and reporting methods and financial instruments aimed at achieving the goal of halting the process of biodiversity loss by 2030 and working towards a broadly positive ecosystem recovery by 2050.\n\nEnvironmental governance\n\nEnel ensures constant supervision and monitoring of environmentally relevant activities through a widespread and harmonized organization at the level of central coordinating structures and at national level. In particular, the Holding Company has a central HSEQ (Health, Safety, Environment and Quality) function with responsibility for guidance, coordination and definition of environmental policy. This is flanked by the HSEQ functions present in the global structure of each Business Line with a role of coordination in the management of the respective environmental issues, ensuring the necessary specialist support in keeping with the Holding\u2019s guidelines. At national level, there are staff units with a local coordination function and managers and reference persons identified in the individual operating units who manage the specific aspects of the various industrial sites.\n\nIn support of activities for monitoring environmental performance and the definition of improved plans for the operating units of the Business Lines, the Group environmental reporting system Enel Data on Environment (EDEN) is used. During 2021, version 2.0 of the EDEN tool was developed to improve the performance of the system and make the data validation procedure and the calculation and reporting of environmental KPIs even more solid.\n\nEnvironmental Management System\n\nApplication of the ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management Systems (EMS) is one of the strategic tools defined by the Group\u2019s environmental Policy. At the end of 2021, EMSs were activated and certified on almost all operating assets, while for the new plants and installations propaedeutic activities are progressively planned for certification. Given the complexity and variety of operations carried out in the Group, a modular approach has been adopted with the definition of a management system at Holding level, certified ISO 14001:2015, which provides guidance and coordination to the Business Lines on environmental issues. Each Business Line has launched its own EMS focussed on its own specific activities. Furthermore, the main thermal and geothermal production sites in Europe also have EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) registration. In complying with the fundamental pillars that form the basis of our environmental policy, specifically in terms of our commitment towards \u201cprotecting the environment by preventing adverse effects\u201d, the Group \u201cStop Work Policy\u201d was set up whereby all people who work for us are asked to intervene promptly and stop working when risks arise that affect not only their own health and safety but also the environment.\n\nThe environmental policy also identifies training as an integral part of the EMS. In 2021, 60 thousand hours of training were provided, an increase of about 25% compared to 2020, of which 14 thousand hours were delivered directly by SHE.Factory, the unit of the HSEQ function dedicated to specialist training on health, safety and environmental issues.\n\n---\n\n\\(^3\\) COM (2021) 400 final\n\\(^4\\) Enel has had a Group Environmental Policy in place since 1996, updated in 2018 and again in 2022. The Enel Group\u2019s environmental policy extends across the entire value chain and applies to all the production phases of every product and service, including distribution and logistics phases, as well as the related waste management; to each site and building; all relationships with external stakeholders; all Mergers&Acquisitions; every key business partner (including partners related to non-managed operations, joint ventures, outsourcing or third-party producers); every supplier, including service and contractor suppliers; all due diligence and Merger&Acquisition processes.\nStrategic factors in the planning, implementation and development of Enel\u2019s operations include protecting the environment and natural resources, tackling climate change, and contributing towards sustainable economic development. These are also key factors in consolidating the Company\u2019s position as leader in the energy market. Enel has had a Group environmental policy in place since 1996, based on four fundamental principles:\n\n1. protecting the environment by preventing impacts and exploiting opportunities;\n2. improving and promoting the environmental sustainability of products and services;\n3. creating shared value for the Company and stakeholders;\n4. meeting legal compliance obligations and voluntary commitments, advancing ambitious environmental management practices\n\nand pursuing ten strategic goals:\n\n1. To apply internationally recognized Environmental Management Systems to the whole organization, underpinned by the principle of ongoing improvement and adoption of environmental indices to measure the environmental performance of the whole organization.\n   a. Ensuring annual compliance with ISO certifications 14001 extension to the entire scope of the Group\u2019s activities\n   b. Streamlining and harmonizing certifications in the various organizational areas, seeking out partnerships and sharing best practices in environmental management\n\n2. To reduce environmental impacts by using the best available technologies and best practices in the construction, implementation and decommissioning stages of plants, with a view to life cycle analysis and circular economy.\n   a. Assessing the environmental impact caused by the construction of plants or by major restructuring operations\n   b. Examining and applying Best Available Technologies (BAT)\n   c. Protecting and monitoring surface and groundwater quality in the areas surrounding the plants\n   d. Ensuring the internal development and application of international best practices\n\n3. To build infrastructure and buildings that protect the local area and biodiversity.\n   a. Assessing the risks and opportunities of biodiversity\n   b. Developing and implementing infrastructures based on the Mitigation Hierarchy, the No Net Loss and the Zero Net Deforestation principles\n   c. Developing and updating a Biodiversity Action Plan with projects that take into account the specific aspects of local environments (conservation of the habitats of protected species, reintroduction of particular species and replanting of indigenous flora in cooperation with research centers and nature observatories)\n   d.

The programme will continue throughout 2022, dealing with other relevant environmental topics in order to ensure uniformity of skills and operating standards in all countries where the Group operates. Training sessions were also held for the adoption of the new Group policy on environmental inspections, involving the inspectors of each country with a view to aligning execution and assessment criteria. Awareness days were also held on sustainability, proper management of environmental events and, in Italy, biodiversity.\n\nEnvironmental risk analysis\n\nIn order to identify and minimize environmental risks related to our activities, we also apply a series of important investigation and intervention tools at Group level which operate in synergy to protect the environment.\n\n- **Group Policy for the classification and analysis of environmental events.** Environmental events are classified according to their type and relevance. This classification is based on their possible impact on the environmental matrices and on any potentially sensitive areas (eco-systems and protected areas), in addition to their negative impact on the organization itself. The policy defines the communication procedures for such events, analyzing their causes, and monitoring subsequent corrective actions and improvements in accordance with their classification and relevance.\n\n- **Policy for assessing environmental risks and opportunities.** The policy applies to all operational sites and staff functions in the various countries and regions where Enel operates, with the adoption of a unitary model for classifying and assessing environmental risks and opportunities throughout the organization through the adoption at Group level of an IT tool called ERA (Environmental Risk Analysis). The analysis process includes the evaluation of the impacts of significant operational aspects with the various environmental matrices and the mitigation controls adopted to ensure regulatory compliance and observance of the most stringent voluntary targets for continuous improvement. It also makes possible the assessment of environmental significant risks and opportunities linked to governance and strategic activities carried out by the central functions of the organization. Finally, through the definition of aggregate risk indicators and the possible comparison with the evidence derived from the analysis of any accidental environmental events and the periodic Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) visits, the ERA tool allows a high level of integration of continuous control processes between the different levels of the organization and the prioritization of improvement actions.\n\n- **Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) Policy.** The ECoS is a tool for planning and conducting site visits by cross-divisional teams of experts in support of plants and operational facilities and with a view to identifying improvement plans and sharing best practices. In 2021, the different Business Lines across all the Countries in which the Group operates realized 90 ECoS with a focus on the environment. See also the chapter \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d.\n\n- **Environmental assessment of suppliers.** In consideration of the importance that suppliers have in determining the overall environmental performances of the Company, we have adopted a supplier environmental assessment procedure that is structured and homogeneous for the entire Group, and that can be activated in the supplier qualification phase, especially for high environmental risk activities, or following significant environmental events. Assessments aim to verify the Environmental Management System as a whole and propose improvement actions to be shared with the supplier.\n\n- **Environmental inspections of suppliers.** In order to guarantee high environmental standards, including for activities carried out by the contractors, the assessments are accompanied by environmental inspections of activities performed at the operating sites. In order to standardize inspection standards and obtain a structured and widespread control system, the Group\u2019s Guidelines on environmental inspections were issued in 2021. This document defines the criteria for planning and carrying out field inspections.\nTowards a \u201cnature-based\u201d model\nProtection of biodiversity is one of the strategic objectives of our environmental policy and is regulated by a specific policy adopted by Enel in 2015 and which defines the guidelines throughout the Group and the principles according to which we should operate.\n\nWith the conclusion of the United Nations Biodiversity Decade, based on the Strategic Plan 2011-2020 (Aichi Targets), there has been an increase in global awareness of the need for further efforts to address not just the climate crisis but also increasing loss of biodiversity.\n\nAware of the opportunities, but also of the risks, that the energy transition may entail, Enel has decided to contribute actively and to strengthen its commitment to achieving a \u201cNo Net Loss\u201d of biodiversity in the development of new infrastructure by 2030, with particular attention to areas of high biodiversity importance, with respect to the conservation of forests and the safeguarding of protected areas.\n\nThe achievement of the No Net Loss objective is based on application of the Mitigation Hierarchy in the construction of all new infrastructures, operating, in order of priority, to avoid, mitigate and recover impacts. Only if there are significant residual impacts that cannot be avoided will the most appropriate offset actions be considered to conserve the overall biodiversity value.\n\nThis commitment is aligned, in terms of timing, with the targets identified in the European Union\u2019s 2030 Biodiversity Strategy, and also plans to begin operating according to these principles from 2025, on selected projects in areas of high biodiversity importance.\n\nWith reference to direct activities, and linked to the No Net Loss objective within the same time horizon, Enel has decided to make a further commitment to the conservation of forests according to the principle of \u201cNo Net Deforestation\u201d, recognizing the importance of this both in terms of the richness of the biodiversity that forests preserve and the role they play in terms of carbon sequestration and long-term storage.\n\nFinally, as regards safeguarding protected areas, Enel will not build new infrastructure on UNESCO World Heritage Natural Sites.\n\nIdentifying dependencies and pressures on biodiversity\n\nThe identification of potential impacts on biodiversity and nature is fundamental in order to define the most effective strategies to avoid, minimize, remedy or compensate for the associated effects, in line with the Mitigation Hierarchy. Similarly, the identification of dependencies on biodiversity and natural capital enables identification of the most appropriate strategies to reduce the risks to the Company arising from these dependencies.\n\nThe main dependencies identified are associated with ecosystem services and the use of resources and raw materials required to build and operate infrastructure, as summarized below:\n\n- maintenance of the water cycle, which enables the operation of hydroelectric power plants;\n- regulation of the climate and climatic events on which the operation of all assets depends;\n- soil stabilization and erosion control, important for hydroelectric reservoirs and transmission and distribution infrastructure;\n- protection from floods and extreme environmental events, which are one of the primary causes of failure and unavailability of network facilities;\n- use of water in production cycles, mainly in thermoelectric power generation;\n\n[5] The policy is also available at the following link: https://www.enel.com/en/investors/sustainability/topics-performance-sustainability/biodiversity.\n[6] United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/65/161 March 11, 2011 (https://www.cbd.int/undb/goals/undb-unresolution.pdf).\n[7] To identify areas of high biodiversity importance, the following general criteria are considered: 1) protected areas (UNESCO World Heritage Natural Sites and IUCN I-IV); 2) Critical Habitats as defined by IFC Performance Standard 6; 3) presence of protected species (\u201cBiodiversity indicators for site-based impacts\u201d - UNEP-WCMC 2020).\n[8] The FAO definition of forest is used: Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10%, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Reforestation actions to compensate for impacts that could not be avoided will be offset, alternatively, through dedicated projects or by contributing to reforestation initiatives promoted by partners, conservation organizations or through public or private projects, giving priority to offsets in the same geographical areas or regions where the impacts occurred, if possible, and of the same value.\n[9] In any case, Enel commits to accomplish the obligation arising from service needs with the best viable and affordable solutions.\n\u2022 use of raw materials (mineral and non-mineral) for the construction and operation of assets.\n\nEnel\u2019s decarbonization strategy, focused on the growth of renewables and in particular wind and solar power, makes it possible to reduce most of the dependence on raw materials. Moreover, by reducing the risk of climate change, it helps to ensure the continued availability of ecosystem services.\n\nThe main pressures that can be exerted on nature are summarized in the following categories: use and modification of ecosystems (terrestrial, freshwater, marine); use of resources (mainly water withdrawal); climate change; pollution; disturbances and introduction of invasive species. These categories are inspired by those identified by Science Based Target for Nature (SBTN)\\(^{(10)}\\) and are the point of departure for analyzing the actions implemented to mitigate the associated risks.\n\nIn order to identify the priority areas for the Group, a risk analysis has been developed which, starting from the importance of each of the previous categories (understood as the potential impact of the activities carried out by the Group), and considering the risk mitigation and control actions already in place, identifies the priorities for action. From this analysis, by focusing on the categories of medium and high significance, it emerged that the level of control is already very high for risks associated with the use of natural resources (water withdrawals), climate change and pollution of environmental matrices. Indeed, for years Enel has already been defining stringent improvement targets that enable it to mitigate the main risks associated with them. The priority identified is the control of risk relating to land occupation and transformation of ecosystems, and in particular to land use and the transformation of terrestrial habitats, in relation to which the new commitments reported at the beginning of this paragraph have been undertaken.\n\n| Pressure | Importance | Level of control | Priorities |\n|----------|------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Land use | \u2022 Relevance | \u2022 Mitigation action | \u2022 Goals |\n| \u2022 Habitat transformation and fragmentation | High | Moderate | High |\n| Exploitation of resources | High | High | Moderate |\n| \u2022 Water consumption | Very high | Very high | Moderate |\n| Climate change | Very high | Very high | Moderate |\n| \u2022 Climate-changing gas emissions | High | High | Moderate |\n| Pollution | High | High | Moderate |\n| \u2022 Pollutant emissions | Low | Low | Low |\n| \u2022 Water and soil pollution | Low | Low | Low |\n| Invasive species and other | Low | Low | Low |\n| \u2022 Introduction of invasive species | Low | Low | Low |\n| \u2022 Noise and other | Low | Low | Low |\n\n\\(^{(10)}\\) Science Based Target for Nature \u2013 Initial Guidance (September 2020).\nMeasures taken to reduce impacts\n\nEnel has consolidated experience in the management and protection of biodiversity in the surroundings of our production sites, an activity which, over the past few years, has been focussed on the renewables segment and on grids in an increasingly large number of countries. As a general safeguard, since 2019 Enel has adopted a Group Guidelines which outlines the principles and procedures for managing impacts on biodiversity during the entire life cycle of plants, from the development phase through to operation and decommissioning, and provides, as already anticipated, for the application of the Mitigation Hierarchy in the various project phases.\n\nOn the basis of these principles, in the Group\u2019s plants and installations in the area, monitoring is carried out to prevent impacts on ecosystems, also considering that these plants have generally achieved a new balance with the surrounding nature.\n\nIn relation to new plants, and in particular renewable ones, the potential exposure to a biodiversity risk is highlighted starting from the phase of feasibility analysis, taking into account the geographic proximity of the sites to protected or important biodiversity areas, and the potential presence of endangered species, to continue with Environmental Impact Assessments. A local prioritization of risks is then defined in order to identify solutions to avoid the most significant impacts and to define a local action plan.\n\nThese evaluations are part of a more extensive analysis for the application of the \u201cCreating Shared Value\u201d model through which the Company engages with the socio-economic and environmental requirements of the local area, defining the project to create long-term value for itself and for the local communities.\n\nOnce the infrastructure is commissioned, protection of biodiversity becomes an integral part of environmental management, through periodical monitoring for the control of impacts highlighted in authorization phase. This is also the moment where the plant consolidates its relationship with the local area and where initiatives are developed, such as voluntary projects, to safeguard local species based on the knowledge of the environment surrounding the site. The results of monitoring at the local level are communicated and analyzed at global level, allowing the identification of those general issues that need to be addressed with improvement plans or projects at Group level.\n\nGlobal initiatives include the Wind Wildlife Challenge project, which involves identifying needs, sharing experiences and best practices, as well as innovative solutions, to reduce further the interference of wind plants with avifauna and bats. As part of this initiative, in 2022 tests will also be launched on various sensors and innovative tools based on radar, camera and multi-sensor technologies capable of detecting, deterring and possibly triggering the automatic shut-down of the affected turbine, involving plants in Italy, Spain, the United States and Canada. This testing campaign follows the one already launched in 2021 in the South African plant of Gibson Bay with ultrasonic deterrent systems specifically for bats.\n\nAs part of the Global Infrastructure and Networks Business Line, specific strategies will be adopted to mitigate the environmental impacts of the construction of new grids and the modernization of existing ones. The cabling ratio is the relationship (in percentage terms) between the length of the cable lines and the total length of the lines, showing immediately the mitigation of the environmental impacts of the electric lines. The increase in this index over time is due to a progressive increase in the length of overhead insulated cable and buried cable lines, reducing the proportion of bare conductors, with benefits in terms of the resilience of the grid, curtailing plant-cutting activities and a drastic reduction in the risk of electrocution for birdlife. In 2021, the cabling ratio showed an increase of two decimal points compared to the previous year, standing at 60.6%, thanks also to the noteworthy contribution from Latin American companies.\n\n(11) Other assessments include, where significant, effects on population and sensitive or migratory species due to noise and habitat degradation, soil erosion due to drainage, pesticide use and tree felling, possible loss of plant species due to chemical use, aquatic flora, and sediment transfer.\nThe biodiversity action plan\n\nIn 2021, 183 projects were carried out to protect species and natural habitats at operating plants, 60 of which were developed in partnership with government agencies and non-governmental organizations and universities, for a total investment of 8.2 million euros. The projects are carried out in all countries and regions and mainly concern renewable generation plants and distribution networks. Examples of measures to mitigate impacts on biodiversity, by way of implementation of the relevant policy, are available in the Sustainability section of the website www.enel.com at the following link: https://www.enel.com/investors/sustainability/daily-commitment/environmental-sustainability/biodiversity.\n\nSpecifically, as regards projects that also include habitat recovery activities, these have involved over 9 thousand hectares, most of which are related to ecological restoration and reforestation, mainly in Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Spain. The surface area affected by restoration projects in 2021 increased compared to the previous year (4,356 hectares in 2020), both for the commencement of new restoration projects and for the effective increase of the surface areas subject to restoration in the ambit of projects already active beforehand.\n\nIn addition to biodiversity projects developed on plants in operation, in 2021 94 projects were developed for the construction phase of new renewable energy plants, mainly in Brazil, Chile, Spain and North America, targeted at the conservation and monitoring of native species impacted, for an overall capital expenditure of 7 million euros.\nThe projects for the protection of species and natural habitats\n\nTable of projects (excluding Worksites)\n\n| Country                                      | Number of projects | Mandatory | Voluntary | of which voluntary | Monitoring | Conservation (species) | Restoration (habitats) | Research and other purposes |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|--------------------|------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Iberia                                       | 31                 | 4         | 27        | 87%                | 6          | 15                     | 5                      | 5                           |\n| Italy                                        | 28                 | 7         | 21        | 75%                | 2          | 26                     | -                      | -                           |\n| ROE* (Greece;

In order to achieve this goal, a specific GIS (Geographic Information System) application, the Environmental Engine, has been developed to correlate geo-referenced information related to industrial assets with environmental maps related to land use classification, natural habitats, protected areas, critical habitats and ranges of endangered species. The main indicators introduced are shown below.\n\n**Land occupation**: the area of land occupied by power generation assets. This is a general indicator, as it does not provide an indication of the quality of the land that has been occupied by the assets.\n\n| Technology       | Hectares (ha) |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| Solar            | 16,650        |\n| Wind             | 12,640        |\n| Hydroelectric    | 202,500       |\n| Geothermal       | 445           |\n| Thermal          | 5,200         |\n\n**Transformation of natural habitats**: measures the area of land occupied in hectares (ha), classified according to the IUCN categories on which the assets have been built. It therefore represents a specific indicator of the habitats that have been transformed to build the plants. Estimating the value of this indicator for new infrastructures will make possible the assessment of the effectiveness of impact reduction processes and the adequacy of mitigation and offsetting actions.\n\nFor assets starting operation from 2021, the total new land occupation was approximately 10,700 ha, of which approximately 7,530 ha (70%) related to natural habitats, and 176 ha (1.6%) to forest type habitats.\n\n**Presence of assets in protected areas**: mapping was carried out for all power generation assets to assess the presence of assets in UNESCO protected areas and IUCN I-IV classified protected areas. As can be observed, the presence of power generation assets in protected areas mainly concerns hydroelectric plants, being mainly reservoirs built many years ago, generally before the protected areas were established, and for which a new balance with the surrounding environment has been achieved.\n\n| Technology                  | no. infrastructures in protected areas / total number | Countries          | Presence in protected areas (ha) | Presence in protected areas as % of the total occupied by technology |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Solar                       | 4 / 141                                              | Greece             | 32                               | 0.2%                                                                |\n| Wind                        | 8 / 266                                              | Italy/Spain        | 116                              | 0.9%                                                                |\n| Hydroelectric reservoirs    | 161 / 1,096(14)                                     | Italy/Spain/Chile  | 5,595                            | 2.8%                                                                |\n| Geothermal plants           | 0 / 39                                               | -                  | -                                | -                                                                   |\n| Thermoelectric plants       | 2 / 98(15)                                           | Italy              | 2                                | 0.04%                                                               |\n\n(12) Land occupation was calculated for power generation facilities using a GIS application in which each plant was modeled and geo-referenced. The following criteria were used to model land occupation and the area of influence: solar, thermoelectric and geothermal were modeled with the plant perimeter; for hydroelectric, the perimeter of the reservoirs was modeled; for wind plants, from the position of the generators the area of land occupation is modeled in a precautionary manner to take into account ancillary works such as yards, roads and areas used when the construction site is operative (in so as far as they are subsequently restored).\n\n(13) IUCN Habitat Classification: 1) Forest, 2) Savannah, 3) Shrubland, 4) Grassland, 5) Wetlands (inland), 6) Rocky Areas (e.g. inland cliffs, mountain peaks), 7) Caves & Subterranean Habitats (non-aquatic), 8) Desert, 9) Marine Neritic, 10) Marine Oceanic, 11) Marine Deep Ocean Floor (Benthic and Demersal), 12) Marine Intertidal, 13) Marine Coastal/Supratidal, 14) Artificial \u2013 Terrestrial, 15) Artificial \u2013 Aquatic, 16) Introduced Vegetation, 17) Other, 18) Unknown; https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/habitat-classificationscheme.\n\n(14) Number represents single reservoirs, not hydroelectric power generating plants.\n\n(15) The figure includes plants being decommissioned.\nPresence of power plants in protected areas (GRI 304-1) \u2013 by country\n\n| Countries | Renewable and thermoelectric power plants |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------|\n|           | Hectares (ha) | % in protected areas on the total area occupied in the country |\n| Italy     | 3,712         | 19% |\n| Spain     | 1,986         | 8%  |\n| Greece    | 32            | 5%  |\n| Chile     | 15            | 0.03% |\n| Group total | 5,745       | 2.4% |\n\nBiodiversity Significance: this qualitative indicator makes it possible to classify power generation plants according to the importance of biodiversity present in their proximity (high/medium/low). The methodology therefore makes it possible to identify priority sites for the protection of biodiversity in order to ensure proper management to mitigate potential impacts. It should also be noted that most sites of high significance are related to hydroelectric power, so they are generally infrastructures built in mountain areas and present in the locality for many years.\n\nPresence of endangered species in the proximity of plants/assets: knowledge of protected species potentially present in the proximity of assets is important in order to evaluate the actions needed to reduce the risk of interference by Enel assets. This type of mapping is carried out on all infrastructures for which biodiversity projects are executed, so as to verify the adequacy of the monitoring and conservation actions implemented. The summary of this mapping is presented in the infographic table of biodiversity projects.\n\nValuation of ecosystem services: among the approaches that have been developed for some years in the scientific community to describe fully the contribution provided by biodiversity and nature, one of this concerns the evaluation of ecosystem services. On this topic, Enel has launched pilot studies to verify how this approach facilitates better environmental management of its infrastructures in order to maximize the benefits for the environment and for local communities (see the box \u201cOptimization of ecosystem services in Chile\u201d).\n\n(16) To identify areas of high biodiversity importance, the following general criteria are considered: 1) Protected areas (UNESCO World Heritage Natural Sites and IUCN I-IV); 2) Critical Habitats as defined by IFC Performance Standard 6; 3) Presence of protected species, according to the methodology developed by UNEP-WCMC (\u201cBiodiversity indicators for site-based impacts\u201d, 2020).\nOptimization of ecosystem services in Chile\n\nThe objective of the study is to define an approach to evaluate the ecosystem services provided by seven natural areas taken as a benchmark and which are part of the appurtenances of several hydroelectric plants owned by Enel in Chile. In particular, the most important ecosystem services have been identified and characterized, proposing feasible and sustainable management and conservation actions, with the aim of enhancing the natural capital available. Starting from the knowledge of the natural capital available in the area, the study conducted applies models of territorial management that seek to protect the natural assets present and the potential benefits associated with them, including especially those at risk of being lost, through an adaptive management of nature in the area, and their contribution to social and economic development.\n\nThe methodology has already been applied to five of the seven areas covered by the project, all with different characteristics from each other, for a total area of about 10,300 ha. Ecosystem services have been classified according to the \u201cCommon International Classification of Ecosystem Services\u201d (CICES - https://cices.eu/) and other locally accepted international standards, and identified through a scientific and participatory approach, classifying them into three main areas: cultural services, regulation and procurement. The main ones are shown in the following table.\n\n| Area            | Sector                  | Ecosystem service                                      |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| La Escuadra     | Regulation              | \u2022 Deep water infiltration                               |\n|                 |                         | \u2022 Erosion control                                      |\n|                 |                         | \u2022 Fire protection                                      |\n| Pehuenche       | Procurement             | \u2022 Firewood                                             |\n|                 |                         | \u2022 Wild fruits                                          |\n| Pilmaiqu\u00e9n      | Regulation - Cultural   | \u2022 Hydrogeological regulation                           |\n|                 |                         | \u2022 Recreational activities                              |\n| The Blue Lagoon | Regulation              | \u2022 CO\u2082 capture by the forest                            |\n| Bajo Pascua     | Regulation              | \u2022 CO\u2082 capture by the forest                            |\n\nIn quantitative terms, it was possible to enhance 40 out of 43 ecosystem services identified for the La Escuadra - Pehuenche area, 14 out of 26 for Pilmaiqu\u00e9n and 28 out of 41 for Bajo Pascua - The Blue Lagoon. The total is about 5,000 tCO\u2082 sequestered per year, in the case of management fully oriented to the provision of this ecosystem service, and about 360,000 euros per year of value shared with local communities for all other ecosystem services.\nStakeholder engagement\n\nIn recent years, nature and biodiversity issues are climbing up the global sustainability agendas and new stakeholders and multilateral initiatives are emerging to set goals and targets and stimulate the development of more ambitious policies to preserve biodiversity.\n\nEnel is actively committed to this process, collaborating with the most relevant global stakeholders and participating in multistakeholder initiatives and dialogues. In particular, the main initiatives undertaken during 2021 included:\n\n- joining the Science Based Target Network, a project that, on the trail of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in the area of climate change, will define a process to identify specific improvement targets for nature and biodiversity conservation;\n- our collaboration with Business for Nature, launched in September 2020 with the signing of the call-to-action \u201cNature is everyone\u2019s business\u201d. In particular, Enel is contributing to the organization\u2019s efforts to raise the ambition of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, which is compared, in terms of international relevance, to what the Paris Climate Agreement was, and which is expected to be adopted at the United Nations Conference on Biodiversity (COP15). Through the network, Enel has also joined the business delegation for the pre-COP15 negotiations in Geneva in March 2022;\n- membership of CSR Europe\u2019s Biodiversity & Industry platform, which aims to provide a framework for the integration of biodiversity into the decision-making processes of companies;\n- participation in the multistakeholder dialogue promoted by the WBCSD for the definition of the concept of \u201cNature Positive\u201d, which led to the report \u201cWhat does nature-positive mean for business?\u201d;\n- membership of the TNFD Forum, an advisory group in support of the new Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) working to establish a global framework for companies and financial institutions to assess and report on nature- and biodiversity-related risks and opportunities by 2023.\n\nFurthermore, a series of initiatives was recently launched globally, targeted at the definition of metrics and approaches for the evaluation of the sustainability of economic sectors in terms of impacts on biodiversity. Among the most significant are those of the World Economic Forum (WEF), which defines general reference metrics for land and water use and, in the framework of the European Commission, the definition of the biodiversity taxonomy, which, by 2022, will provide a common classification of economic activities that contribute to protecting and restoring biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nTraining and internal communication\n\nWith the aim of involving and raising awareness of all Enel people on the issues of protection and conservation of biodiversity, a series of specific initiatives have been promoted.\n\n- Following the completion in 2020 of the Biodiversity pillar of the Competence Building Program dedicated to technical personnel and those with operational responsibilities, in 2021 an awareness-raising training course on biodiversity was carried out in Italy, during which the basic principles, the Enel policy, the main projects at Group and Italy level, and the points of view of the main NGOs active on the subject were covered. This initiative will be extended during 2022 to all Group personnel.\n- The Enel X Global Retail Business Line launched a new project in 2021, \u201cWe\u2019re part of the solution\u201d, to raise awareness of the importance of the United Nations\u2019 International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB) and reaffirm that biodiversity is the solution to many of the challenges facing us, from climate change to health issues, and from the safety of food and water to sustainable livelihoods.\n- A photo contest was launched, in which all Group people could participate, with the aim of capturing the best positive examples of integration of our industrial infrastructure with nature.\nSeveral biodiversity projects\nAGROVOLTAICS: the balance between nature and solar power\n\nIn 2021 Enel launched an experimental program on agrovoltaics, involving 9 solar plants in Spain, Italy and Greece with the aim of demonstrating the technical and economic feasibility of coexistence between large solar plants \u201con the ground\u201d and agro-zoological activities, promoting the conservation of local biodiversity and indigenous ecosystem services, and enhancing local communities through a multistakeholder approach. The results obtained to date are very promising in terms of feasibility of integration of solar plants with crops, as they promote better shading and reduction of water stress due to less direct solar radiation on the crop itself. Some experimental projects were launched in 2021, which have involved the use of new technologies and layouts for solar plants, with the aim of protecting crops from possible extreme events due to climate change. Specific solutions are also being tested for the safeguarding of local biodiversity and the improvement of ecosystem services both in the areas where the plant is situated and in marginal areas in the plant\u2019s vicinity. In Totana, for example, techniques are being tested for the protection and improvement of the habitat of steppe birds living in this area, through the use of a species of leguminous plant, a source of nutrients, able to improve oxygenation of the soil and avoid the formation of invasive grasses while at the same time favoring nesting. In the Pezouliotika plant in Greece, in addition to the use of crops that attract pollinator species in areas close to the plant, a biodiversity hot spot has been created through the restoration of a strip of semi-natural grassland, typical of the surrounding ecosystems, improving the ecosystem services of the area itself and the habitat of some species of butterflies, some of which are even at risk of extinction. The application of the BACI (Before-After-Control-Impact) protocol will make it possible to measure and evaluate the effect of the adopted solutions on the target species. The activities will continue in 2022. It should be noted that in January the feasibility analysis was started in the Las Corchas plant in Spain, on an area equal to 60\u201370% of the total extension of the plant, corresponding to about 50 ha. This will represent the first large-scale ground-mounted agrovoltaic plant with technological application of integration and coexistence on the same soil of the two different businesses, power generation and agriculture. Finally, in the Bastardo plant in Italy, beginning in April 2022 crops will be used that promote the increase in the presence of pollinator species. In addition, the installation of some high-tech hives is planned, equipped with sensors of humidity, temperature, weight and sound of the hive to characterize the surrounding environment through the analysis of the health status of the bees, which should be considered as biosensors.\n\n\u201cAt Enel Green Power we aim to improve the environmental and social sustainability of photovoltaic plants, seeking and testing innovative approaches and solutions to promote biodiversity and enhance ecosystem services. We are working on defining new business models in partnership with farms and local communities with the aim of promoting the co-location of sustainable agro-livestock activities on ground-based photovoltaic plants and creating shared value.\u201d\n\nMiriam Di Blasi\nEnvironment and Impacts Mitigation \u2013 Innovation at Enel Green Power\n\u201cLa Primavera\u201d project \u2013 Colombia\n\nThe project is framed as a work of compensation of mandatory maintenance activities carried out at the electrical transmission and distribution networks, which involve clearing of vegetation, in compliance with current environmental regulations and applicable technical standards, in order to limit the risk of service interruption or fire ignition. In this context, Codensa, an Enel Group subsidiary in Colombia, has developed a Forest Compensation Plan with indigenous plant species to protect and conserve areas of interest.\n\nThe activities started in 2018 with the planting of more than 42 thousand trees in the \u201cLa Primavera\u201d forest reserve in the municipality of Pacho, which covers about 40 ha, and takes on a key role in the protection of the waters in the department of Cundinamarca. The project included an initial biophysical characterization study of the area, to collect information on the ecosystem, climate, geology, hydrology and flora and fauna species of the forest reserve. As a result of this research, 18 indigenous plant species suitable for the area were selected. A monitoring plan was also defined through the use of innovative tools such as drones, to analyze the development of the plantation. The project has involved the local community in the activities of ecological protection of the area, including training, planting and forest maintenance, promoting environmental awareness within the community itself. In 2021, after 3 years of maintenance, it was possible to hand over the area to the authorities having comprehensively compensated the maintenance activities considering 5 trees planted for each one felled.\n\nEnel X: Urban Biodiversity Strategy\n\nEnel X has begun promoting a global urban biodiversity strategy to provide cities and its customers with new opportunities to introduce nature-based solutions that promote biodiversity and help make cities resilient by mitigating the microclimate, the quality of the air and by generally improving the quality of life. The strategy, which involves the integration of nature-based solutions into the Enel X offering portfolio, is being developed in the main countries where Enel X is present. Among the various initiatives, mention should be made of the work being carried out at the SUBA e-bus electroterminal, located in the Thomas Van der Hammen reserve located in the city of Bogot\u00e1 (Colombia). The electroterminal was built in a site that existed before the construction of the infrastructure where, in collaboration with leading universities and local authorities, Enel X presented a project to restore ecological connectivity through the restoration and planting of 730 specimens of native forest species, in order to reduce the ecosystem fragmentation of the reserve.\nand to generate a suitable habitat for pollinator species. In addition, Enel X was the first company to make a commitment to nature-based solutions and to adopt three beehives that have been placed in the Bee Garden on the roof of the Tor di Quinto headquarters in Rome, housing up to 180 thousand honeybees. Thanks to this project, educational workshops will be organized in which participants will be able to observe bees from close up, in complete safety and under the guidance of experts, and to learn why they are so important for our survival.\nReducing pollution in the atmosphere\n\nThe reduction of the environmental impacts associated with the operation of our plants is a strategic objective for us, pursued through the application of the best technologies available and of best international practices. The energy transition towards production from renewable sources, such as solar and wind power, contributes to a progressive reduction in specific emissions. During 2021, in particular, Enel\u2019s commitment to the path towards decarbonization continued, with the closure of the Litoral coal-fired power plant in Spain. It should be noted, however, that, during 2021, higher demand for power, in conjunction with lower hydroelectric generation in some countries of the perimeter and in particular in Latin America, led to an overall increase in thermoelectric generation compared to 2020, particularly from O&G plants (+17% compared to 2020) and CCGT (+19% compared to the previous year).\n\nDirect greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe reduction of greenhouse gases is one of the priority objectives indicated in our environmental policy as well as in the Group strategy, and must be pursued through the progressive broadening of generation capacities in terms of renewable energy sources and improvement of the efficiency of infrastructures. Direct greenhouse gas emissions from Enel\u2019s industrial activities can be mainly traced back to carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) emissions from thermoelectric power plants and, to a lesser extent, to sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086) losses across the distribution network. Specific CO\u2082 emissions (Scope 1) in 2021 amounted to 227 g/kWh\u2091q (\u221245% compared to 2017), up slightly compared to 2020 (+6%) due to higher energy production from gas-fired plants, as anticipated. Despite the 2021 figure, linked to the contingency of the year, the medium-term reduction remains in line with the target verified by the Science Based Targets initiative that the Group has set at 2030. As a further contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the Infrastructure and Networks Business Line will commit to purchasing an increasing number of SF\u2086-free equipment and devices in the coming years. For further details on greenhouse gas emissions, please refer to the chapter \u201cThe path to Net-Zero\u201d.\n\nSO\u2082, NO\u2093, and particulate matter\n\nOur commitment to improving the quality of the air in areas where we operate is testified to by the great care we pay to the constant reduction of the main atmospheric pollutants associated with thermal production: sulfur oxides (SO\u2082), nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093), and particulate matter. To this end, over the years various measures have been taken to improve environmental performances on specific thermal plants, the choice of which is the outcome of an analysis that, beginning from best technologies and international practices, takes into consideration factors such as context and local priorities, the plant\u2019s operation mode, understood as annual operating hours, current plant configuration and the prospects of productive life. During 2021, the total investment in environmental measures amounted to 29 million euros. With respect to the values in 2017, the Group set further important targets specifically related to the reduction of emissions of atmospheric pollutants by 2030. These targets see specific emissions in 2030 of 0.05 g/kWh\u2091q for SO\u2082 (\u221294% compared to 2017), 0.24 g/kWh\u2091q for NO\u2093 (\u221270% compared to 2017) and 0.005 g/kWh\u2091q for particular matter (\u221298% compared to 2017). Pollutant reduction trends and targets are consistent \u2013 in as much as they are linked to the Strategic Plan and to the Group\u2019s decarbonization objectives. Emission measurements are carried out in compliance\n\n(17) Value related only to consolidated production. In relation to the overall value of the capacity managed, CO\u2082 emissions amount to 205 g/kWh\u2091q.\nwith each country\u2019s regulatory framework and, in the majority of large plants, a measurement system is used that can assess compliance with the limits in real time. Its reliability is guaranteed by accredited certifying entities and through assessments carried out by inspection authorities.\n\nIn 2021, there was a decrease in absolute and specific terms for SO\u2082 and particulate matter. For NO\u2093, mass emissions recorded a slight increase linked to the higher amounts of power generated from gas-fired and CCGT plants, but specific emissions decreased due to the concomitant increase in the generation of energy from renewable sources. Specifically, specific NO\u2093 emissions were 0.35 g/kWh\u2091q (-56% compared to 2017), SO\u2082 emissions were 0.07 g/kWh\u2091q (-92% compared to 2017), and particulate matter emissions were 0.005 g/kWh\u2091q (-98% compared to 2017).\n\nTowards a \u201cnature-based\u201d model\nThe responsible use of water resources and their protection are vital for the safeguarding of natural ecosystems and for the wellbeing of people that live in them, as well as for the success of our activities. The Group withdraws water prevalently for industrial purposes and uses it primarily for thermal and nuclear power generation, for the cooling of thermal cycles, and atmospheric emission abatement systems. Overall water needs for production are covered through withdrawal from what is referred to as non-scarce sources (seawater) and scarce sources (surface freshwaters, groundwater and water for civilian use). Where locally permitted, we use, as incoming water resources for our own processes, treated waste waters, typically supplied by water management consortia.\nEfficient use of water resources\n\nTotal process and closed-loop cooling water withdrawal in 2021 was approximately 55.6 Mm\u00b3, with an increase of approximately 8% compared to 2020 due to increased thermoelectric power generation.\n\nEnel is vigorously pursuing the objective of reducing its specific water requirement\\(^{(18)}\\), with a target of a 65% reduction in 2030 compared to the 2017 value, defined on the basis of the results achieved and the new Plan, which envisages for an even more efficient use of the water resource in existing thermoelectric plants, the evolution of the energy mix towards renewable sources and the progressive reduction of generation from fossil fuels. The specific requirement in 2021 was 0.21 l/kWh, stable compared to 2020 (0.20 l/kWh) and in line with the Group\u2019s reduction targets (~52% compared to 2017).\n\nThe progressive reduction of water requirements is pursued by promoting, where possible, the recovery of wastewater. Particular attention is paid to the use of water in cooling towers, the efficiency of which is being increased by upgrading the control and recovery systems of the blowdowns, thus also reducing their environmental impact. Other optimization interventions carried out concern the use of crystallizers, a technology developed in the field of coal-fired generation that is in the pilot test phase on some combined cycle plants, with the aim of completely reusing wastewater in the power generation cycle. Finally, the collection and reuse of rainwater represents another important lever for reducing the environmental footprint of our power generation sites, thanks to the installation of appropriate storage tanks.\n\nEnel is also constantly monitoring all power generation sites located in zones at risk of water scarcity (water stressed areas) in order to ensure efficient use of water resources. Mapping of power generation sites falling within water stressed areas is done in line with the criteria of GRI 303 (2018) with reference to the conditions of \u201c(baseline) Water Stress\u201d indicated by the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas\\(^{(19)}\\) and, beginning this year, will also include nuclear plants. Among the sites mapped, those defined as \u201ccritical\u201d are those positioned in water stressed areas and which withdraw fresh water for process needs. For these sites, methods for managing water withdrawal by 2030 (vs base year 2017)\ning waters are analyzed for the purposes of minimizing requirements and maximizing withdrawals from sources of lower quality or which are non-scarce (wastewater, industrial or sea water).\n\nIn 2021, approximately 14% of the total energy generated by the Enel Group used freshwater in water stressed areas\\(^{(20)}\\). In these areas, withdrawals from scarce sources amounted to 15 Mm\\(^3\\), with an increase of 36% compared to 2020 (11 Mm\\(^3\\)). In this case, too, higher withdrawals are related to the contingency of increased energy generation from thermoelectric plants in 2021. The percentage of water withdrawn in water stressed areas is 27% of total withdrawals.\n\nThe robust expansion of the solar power plants, naturally destined for location also in water stressed areas, has brought to the fore a new use of water connected with the cleaning of dust deposits on the surfaces of photovoltaic panels. Although these volumes are not very significant, Enel has adopted innovative initiatives and solutions for these plants aimed at further reducing their needs. The Enel Group\u2019s constant attention to monitoring and improving its water footprint is also testified by the WaVE (Water Value Enhancement) project, launched in 2020 by the Enel Green Power & Thermal Generation division, which made possible an assessment of the use of water resources in all thermoelectric and renewable power generation sites, and the consequent planning of specific innovative improvement actions, particularly in water stressed areas. The project continued in 2021, refining the mapping of assets with progressively greater granularity, also in view of the effects that climate change may have on the availability of water resources.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(20)}\\) The percentage of energy generated in water stressed areas, as well as the percentage of water withdrawn in water stressed areas, is calculated by including thermal plants that use water from scarce sources.\nMechanized panel washing in the Panama solar plants\n\nPhotovoltaic power generation in Panama is distributed over 7 plants, consisting of about 375 thousand panels for a total capacity of 62 MW. The humid tropical climate, often combined with the presence of nearby sugar cane and oil processing plants, as well as vehicular traffic, lead the panels to get dirty and to require cleaning at least once a year in order to avoid possible degradation phenomena. Until now carried out manually, cleaning of PV panels has recently been improved and optimized by adopting a semi-automatic cleaning system with low water consumption, consisting of a motorized unit equipped with a special brush that extends over the entire surface of the panel and is able to slide along the entire length of the row of modules, allowing them to be cleaned in a single pass.\n\nCompared to manual cleaning, water saving is estimated at 68%, corresponding to over 0.5 million liters of water during a normal year of operation. The initiative can be further enhanced in the future by providing for the storage and reuse of rainwater instead of the water currently supplied by wells, so as to reduce further the pressure on local water resources.\nOptimization of wastewater treatment\n\nDownstream of internal recoveries and reuses, wastewater discharged from the plants is returned to the surface water body. Discharge always takes place downstream of a treatment process that removes any pollutants present to a level where they will not have a negative impact on the receiving water body, in compliance with the limits provided for under national regulations and by operating permits.\n\nResponsible and integrated management of water catchment areas\n\nThe activities of hydroelectric power plants are an important element of water management. These power stations, which do not contribute to the Group\u2019s water consumption in that the water withdrawn is completely returned to its source, provide a series of additional services for the community compared to the sole generation of renewable energies. Several power plants are in fact involved in the management, shared with the interested public and private stakeholders, manage the water resource for multi-purpose services ranging from flood control, drinking water and irrigation and firefighting services, to the management of river waste held by artificial dams, also including numerous cultural, leisure and nature-based initiatives, made possible thanks to the presence of the power plants. The reservoirs of hydroelectric plants also carry out a vital role in the response to the effects of climate change, increasing the level of protection of the communities subject to increasingly frequent severe flooding and to prolonged periods of drought. Management of the outflows from hydroelectric plants is done through specific programs to ensure the volumes of water required to preserve the ecological state of rivers (minimum vital water flows).\n\n\u201cWater: a shared heritage\u201d\n\nMultiple uses of water in Chile\n\nLaguna del Maule is a volcanic area in the Chilean Andes in the province of Talca, whose easternmost foothills extend beyond the border with Argentina. Since 1947, following an agreement with the Direcci\u00f3n General de Obras P\u00fablicas, which also allowed an increase in the capacity of the reservoir to 1,570 million m\u00b3, Enel has effectively managed the water availability, in order to share its use for irrigation as well as for hydroelectric generation.\n\nIn fact, the waters of the Maule river and its tributaries are used for the generation of hydroelectric power in 4 Enel and third party power plants. Thanks to a monthly average flow rate of 25 m\u00b3/s, Enel has generated an annual average of 330 GWh in recent years. At the same time, the waters of the Maule Lagoon have been used to irrigate agricultural land in the Maule region, supplying 67 agricultural associations and covering a land area of more than 200 thousand hectares.\nThe example of Colombia (fishing in the Bethany reservoir)\n\nThe Bethany Dam, built on the Rio Magdalena and located in the department of Huila, forms a reservoir with an area of approximately 7,400 ha and a volume of approximately 1,300 million m\u00b3. The department is the main producer of fish nationally, accounting for 39% of Colombian production. The fish farming cage system accounts for 40% of Huila\u2019s total production and the fish farming sector is estimated to generate about 3 thousand direct jobs.\n\nIn 2020, Enel received authorization from the National Aquaculture and Fisheries Authority (AUNAP) to begin the process of seeding two sectors of the Bethany reservoir of Yaguar\u00e1 Santa Helena (SH) and Pacand\u00e9 (PA) with fry of indigenous species. The fry come from the Experimental Station of Hydrobiological Resources built by Enel and managed by the SurColombian University, the first to obtain certification from the Colombian Agropecuario Institute (ICA) as a biosecure aquaculture establishment for indigenous species.\nEnergy efficiency\n\nEnergy efficiency in production processes\n\nUsing energy in an efficient manner is, for us, a constant commitment in the entire value chain, from generation to distribution; in particular, the strategy of reduction consumption entails capital expenditure to increase the energy efficiency of our activities, from interventions to maximize the output of generation plants to the operational improvement of the distribution grid, leveraging the diffusion of greater awareness in behaviors (see also the chapter \u201cThe path to Net-Zero\u201d). Energy consumption is mainly represented by fossil fuels to operate thermal power plants (in 2021 71% was natural gas) and by uranium to operate nuclear power plants. A limited amount of energy consumption is related to the operation of renewable power plants (biomass and geothermal).\n\nThe overall direct consumption of energy for the production of electricity is 1,099,302 TJ (26.26 Mtoe). During the year, there was an increase in fuel energy consumption of about 10% compared to 2020, a difference that reflects the increase in thermoelectric generation (+16% compared to 2020) and, within that, the increase in gas-fired generation (+19% compared to 2020). The Group\u2019s energy intensity, which provides a measure of its operational efficiency, in 2021 was 4.8 MJ/kWh eq, up approximately 2% compared to the previous year.\n\n2021 saw the continuation of process efficiency initiatives, followed by the implementation of operational excellence programs across the different Business Lines, both for operations and in buildings management. In particular, as regards the Infrastructure and Networks Business Line, the commitment to reduce network losses continued, also contributing to the reduction of CO\u2082 emissions. Among the actions to be taken are the progressive reduction of single-phase electric lines, the construction of new electric lines to lighten the load on the pre-existing ones, and the use of low-loss transformers. Other actions include boosting the grid by using conductors with a greater cross-section and rephasing primary transformer. Finally, the realization of new transformer cabins will help reduce the length of the low-voltage lines which are characterized by higher levels of loss. More broadly, optimizing the grid set-up will allow a significant reduction of its losses.\n\nEnergy efficiency in the management of buildings\n\nIn addition to operational sites, the strategic commitment to energy efficiency is fundamental in the sustainable management of our buildings and administrative offices. In order to pursue this objective in a structured and organic way, Enel has adopted a Workplace Handbook in which it has collected the measures and technical references recommended within the Company for the design, construction and management of workplaces. In the Handbook, particular attention to people and to the environmental, social and economic context in which they work is placed at the heart of every work environment. The environmental sustainability of each building, whether new or undergoing renovation, is pursued with reference to its entire life cycle, through the adoption of\ncircular(21), low-emission and sustainable materials and products, with an environmental footprint certified by tools such as the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) or Cradle to Cradle (C2C) standard. Where possible, models such as sharing and product-as-a-service are favored, capable of increasing the utilization factor of the building and the equipment it contains. Priority attention is also paid to the reduction of waste and its reuse, the sustainable management of water resources, the containment and control of air emissions and noise, as well as air quality inside and outside the workplace, with the aim of minimizing the environmental impacts of the building at every stage of its life cycle. Finally, the commitment to sustainability is guaranteed by the achievement of LEED and WELL certifications for new buildings and for those under renovation, or by the request for such certifications in the case of rented buildings. For more details refer to chapter \u201cProgress starts with people\u201d of this document.\n\nWith reference to the specific aspects of energy efficiency, the adoption of technological solutions and energy management systems with continuous control, that can qualify the building as a \u201cNearly Zero Energy Building\u201d, is recommended. In particular, the choice of equipment with energy efficiency corresponding to the highest market standards, i.e. with Energy Star certification, and the adoption, wherever possible, of solutions for the generation and use of renewable energy, is indicated. These include the installation of photovoltaic or solar-thermo-dynamic plants, hydrothermal plants for exchange with groundwater or cogeneration/trigeneration or, finally, the connection to district heating/cooling systems, where available.\n\nThe project for redevelopment of the Enel office in Viale Regina Margherita (Rome, Italy)\n\nThe redevelopment project of the Rome Headquarters involves a facility with a total surface area of approximately 80 thousand m\u00b2, capable of accommodating up to 2,600 people. Through the adoption of innovative principles of bioclimatic, sustainable and biophilic design, the project aims for excellent performances in terms of energy efficiency, circularity of resources and living comfort of the building, which will be subject to LEED and WELL certifications.\n\nThe renovation works, commenced in November 2019, will have an expected duration of about 40 months. Due to the urban context and high population density, each potential significant environmental impact has been subjected to management plans and dedicated control and mitigation measures, in compliance with all the limits imposed in the concession and best practice standards.\n\nFrom the energy point of view, the high efficiency of the air conditioning systems, the LED lighting, the external walls made of highly insulating glass and the computerized management of the entire \u201cbuilding system\u201d will make possible a significant containment of electricity consumption, which will be partly satisfied by the enhancement of photovoltaic self-generation, with an estimated reduction of about 50% in electricity drawn from the grid (approximately from 12 to 6 GWh per year). With regard to water consumption, the collection and full recovery of rainwater is expected, which, appropriately treated, will feed the vegetation watering systems, hydrants, evaporation towers and car wash services. Regarding the production of waste, during 2021 in particular a total of about 25 thousand tons were produced, of which around 98% (24.4 thousand tons) was destined for recovery.\n\n(21) Please refer also to the chapter \u201cCircular economy.\u201d\nEnergy efficiency and electrification products for customers\n\nIn 2021, the interventions carried out by the Enel X Global Retail Business Line in relation to efficiency, technological innovation and reduction of CO\u2082 emissions in the sectors in which the division operates, were strengthened and consolidated. In the public lighting sector, work performed in 2021 by Enel X in Italy, Spain, Chile and Colombia resulted in cumulative savings of approximately 153 GWh. In public transport, Enel X participated in the commissioning of more than 1,000 electric buses in Chile, Spain and Colombia. For its B2C (Business to Customer) customers in Europe and Latin America, in 2021 Enel X installed about 64 thousand energy-efficient products, including condensing boilers, air conditioners, air-to-water heat pumps and photovoltaic plants (some with storage systems), while in the B2B (Business to Business) sector, the photovoltaic plants managed by Enel X for its customers in Brazil and Spain in 2021 made possible a production of distributed renewable energy equal to about 10 GWh, in addition to the energy savings obtained by the cogeneration and trigeneration plants managed by the company in Italy and Spain.\n\nOverall in 2021, Enel X\u2019s efficiency and electrification products and services enabled its customers to avoid the emission of approximately 128 thousand tons of CO\u2082, corresponding to the environmental benefit of more than 7 million equivalent trees per year, values calculated by applying algorithms validated by an internationally recognized certification body according to the principles identified in the UNI EN ISO 14064-2:2019 standard.\n\nFor further details, see the chapter \u201cThe decade of electrification and customer centricity\u201d.\n\n238 Sustainability Report 2021\nWaste management\n\nOptimal waste management is a strategic objective of our environmental policy, which results in a constant commitment to a reduction in its production, as well as to the definition of new methods of reuse, recycling and recovery, in the perspective of a circular economy (more information is available in the chapter \u201cCircular economy\u201d).\n\nFor the purposes of reinforcing this commitment even further, we have equipped ourselves with a Group Guidelines for Waste Management, which collects the best Company practices deemed fundamental for optimal waste management. In particular, Enel has set important targets to reduce the amount of waste produced (-87% of waste produced in 2030 compared to the 2017 base year\\(^{(22)}\\)). The reduction target takes into account the results already obtained and of the predicted evolution of the production mix towards renewable energies, as indicated in the three-year Strategic Plan. The target value includes the technological upgrading of renewable power plants, especially wind farms, which will reach their end-of-life in the next few years. For this reason, although the target was already reached in 2020, it was decided not to change it in order to take into account the potential impact of upgrading activities on waste production in 2030.\n\nDuring 2021, waste production remained constant compared to 2020, with a value at 2021 of 1.2 mil t (-87% compared to 2017). Waste sent for recovery across the Enel perimeter was around 62%, slightly down on 2020 (66%). The commitment to a continuous increase in the percentage recovery of waste products is fundamental to ensure an efficient transition towards a circular economy in order to minimize the exploitation of natural resources in accordance with sustainable objectives and in combating climate change. A key role in this area is played by the significant recovery of process waste from thermoelectric generation, significant, that is, in terms of the quantities produced and their characteristics, including coal ash and desulphurization gypsum, reused in the construction industry for the production of cement, concrete and bricks according to specific technical and environmental control requirements. In particular, the percentage sent for recovery is, respectively, 67% for coal ash (from 74% in 2020) and 81% for desulphurization gypsum (from 63% in 2020)\\(^{(23)}\\).\n\nNumerous other maintenance wastes from thermoelectric generation plants, such as waste oil, batteries and numerous metal scraps, including iron, copper and aluminium, as well as residues from primary filtration in hydroelectric plants, are also destined for almost complete recovery. A significant commitment is also directed at the recovery of waste produced from demolition and dismantling of end-of-life power plants, by using selective demolition techniques of the structures, as well as solutions to make the best use of the materials produced. Within the Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation division, the commitment made in 2020 with the launch of \u201cZero Waste\u201d continued during 2021. This is a global project whose objective is to limit the environmental impact\n\n\\(^{(22)}\\) These targets exclude waste produced from the demolition of decommissioned thermal plants.\n\n\\(^{(23)}\\) The variations in the percentages of recovery compared to the previous year are due to plants decommissioned or shut down in the period.\nof waste produced by the various plants and technologies in all the countries where the division is present. This is achieved through the reduction of the amount of waste generated and an improvement in the percentage of its recovery through the sharing of the best initiatives and best practices implemented by individual countries, which contribute to the definition of increasingly challenging objectives. Among the global initiatives carried out during 2021, the extension of the project to contractors who want to work with us, operating along the entire value chain, should be highlighted. In fact, a \u201csustainability K\u201d factor has been introduced in relation to waste, through the definition of minimum requirements for participation in tenders and the adoption of additional bonus mechanisms that companies can activate optionally, should they be able to achieve higher levels of recoverability. Particular attention was then paid to wind and solar technologies, in order to identify, as of now, possible strategies for the reuse of components that are subject to replacement or disposal throughout the life of these plants, an issue that we expect to become relevant from 2030, as anticipated. For wind technology, the \u201cWind New Life\u201d project has been activated for the recovery of wind turbine blades, with a view over the next decade to gradually replacing components that will progressively reach the end of their useful life (around 2 kton/year in Italy). In addition to focusing on possible future recovery scenarios, the project has also involved analysis of energy reuse and recovery in the cement production process of the materials making up the blades, with overall recyclability values of the components of a wind turbine ranging from 80 to 85%. Details of further projects can be found in the chapters \u201cInnovability\u00ae\u201d and \u201cCircular economy\u201d. An increasingly greater effort has been made in particular to acquire, in a life cycle perspective, solid and comparable information on the environmental impact of the substances and of products procured. Similarly, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) models have also been adopted in relation to the post-consumption phases of the products and services provided. Of particular importance in this context was the commitment made by Enel X through its membership in Europe of consortia on WEEE, batteries and packaging, as well as the increasing attention paid to the design phase of the products marketed. As regards the waste generated by the management of grids, recovery programs have been reinforced, in particular for dielectric mineral oils, used as insulation in electric equipment, and in the accumulators, utilized as energy reserve in transformer substations. These oils are sent to companies registered and authorized for regeneration and waste-to-energy treatment, where regeneration is not possible, whereas the end-of-life accumulators are sent to registered and authorized companies that can recover secondary raw materials. Particularly relevant are the results obtained by the projects launched across various countries for the sustainable replacement of intelligent first-generation meters and the recovery of their constituent materials. The meter is made up of around 65% plastic materials and the remainder is mainly iron (12%), copper (7%) and electronic boards (7%). These materials, appropriately recovered at authorized plants, become reusable resources in other production cycles. For further initiatives, see the chapters \u201cCircular economy\u201d and \u201cSuppliers\u201d in the present document. 2021 also saw the continuation of Enel\u2019s commitment to the elimination of single-use plastics within the Group, initiated with the launch of the \u201cZero Plastic\u201d project in June 2019 to coincide with World Environment Day. The project, which encompasses the gradual abandonment of disposable plastic, has involved the offices of the main headquarters (with more than 20 employees) in Italy and Spain, and is gradually being extended to the other countries where the Group is present. Despite the continuation of the pandemic, in 2021 the reduction of disposable plastic in offices (including caf\u00e9s, canteens and beverage and food dispensers) can be estimated at 75% in Italy and 65% in Spain compared to the year of reference (2018), thanks to interventions for the replacement of the products supplied and the installation of water dispensers. It was not, however, possible to carry out actual measurements, due to the prevalent recourse to home working for personnel in the large offices as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, precisely in view of possible specific health security requirements to be adopted as precautionary measures on the return to work of staff, however partial, the targets previously set for the following years have been appropriately updated, while awaiting a complete return to working normality. The pandemic linked to Covid has also produced the appearance of a new type of waste in operating workplaces kept active for electricity service continuity needs. It is made up of mandatory personal protection devices (face masks and disposable gloves) distributed by the Company in all workplaces in order to prevent the spread of the contagion. Management of this waste was based everywhere on principles of maximum precaution, in line with the development of health provisions and requirements issued in the different countries.\nZero waste\n\nIn May 2021, the Spanish distribution company e-distribuci\u00f3n, first among all Spanish DSOs (Distribution System Operators), obtained the \u201cResiduo Cero\u201d certification issued by Aenor, a leading certification body. The certificate is issued to organizations that evaluate the different fractions of waste, avoiding disposal in favor of recovery. The generation of waste is not, therefore, eliminated, but the method adopted by the organization to reduce its production and ensure its reintegration into the value chain is recognized and duly certified. More specifically, for e-distribuci\u00f3n the award of the certificate implies the optimization and complete traceability (collection, transport and delivery) of waste, from the site where it is generated to the treatment plant. Also for e-distribuci\u00f3n, the certification attests that the waste generated in the autonomous community of Aragon and in the towns of Castile, Le\u00f3n and Galicia has been optimized in order to give it a second life.\n\nProtection of soil, subsoil and groundwater\n\nEnel is committed to the continuous application of the most advanced technologies available and of best practices to minimize the possible environmental impacts deriving from its activities, using international standards as a benchmark even where the required environmental protection is less stringent. Among the areas of prevention, the highest level of attention is paid to the protection, monitoring and remediation of soil, subsoil and groundwater in the areas where plants and generation and service facilities are present in all countries. The protection of these environment matrices guides all phases of their life, from design choices to construction, operation and end-of-life management. Both active and passive protection and safety measures will be used in project phase to prevent any possible form of uncontrolled or accidental contact of potentially polluting substances (fuels, reagents, liquid and waste flows) with soils and subterranean waters.\n\nDuring plant operations, every process undergoes compliance controls as well as ongoing upgrades as required by the Environmental Management Systems to prevent and minimize the risks of any potential environmental contamination. At the same time, control plans are executed to monitor the condition of the previous environmental matrices. In the event of an accident, for example the accidental spillage of polluting substances, the timely application of the Stop Work and Emergency Management Policies allows elimination of any possible environmental impact, rigorously complying with the provisions and the legal obligations of the various countries. For management of the end of life of power plants, once they have been secured and prior to their being dismantled and the area reassigned to new development projects, Enel proceeds, according to the authorized provisions and legal requirements of the various countries, to verify further the environmental quality of the soil, subsoil and groundwater in the areas where the plant is located. In the event of potential contamination phenomena, characterization of the environmental matrices in the areas potentially affected and, if necessary, implementation of safety measures and subsequent remediation, are executed according to intervention plans shared with the competent authorities and by resorting to specialist, qualified companies able to restore promptly the level of quality suitable for the intended use of the area (industrial/commercial, residential). Particular focus is on power plants falling within the large industrial hubs.\n\nIn order to mitigate further the risk connected to the detention and consequent potential uncontrolled release of substances that can have an impact on the environment, numerous projects have commenced for their progressive substitution, for example, verifications under way on the use of vegetable (hence biodegradable) oil, replacing the traditional dielectric oil of mineral origin.\nNew use of industrial sites\n\nReclamation of the Augusta site\n\nThe Augusta site falls within the wider area of national interest for the reclamation of Priolo in Sicily. In this context, as early as 2003-2004 site characterization and consequent reclamation procedures were initiated following the identification of soil contaminated by hydrocarbons. The soil remediation procedure, agreed upon with the authorities, encompassed the construction of an impermeable diaphragm wall along the entire perimeter of the contaminated area, the treatment of the soil using soil washing and biopile techniques, and subsequent re-use of the remediated soil. The remediation work was completed in 2011 with the return of the land concerned to its intended use, while post-operam monitoring continued until 2016. A photovoltaic plant is to be built on the reclaimed area. After the closure of the plant, which took place in 2019, the overall characterization plan of the area was presented and is currently awaiting approval. Among the proposals under consideration, one is the development of a \u201cremediation hub\u201d, a research and study center aimed at identifying innovative solutions for the mitigation of environmental impacts caused by plants and infrastructures.\n\nTeruel Power Plant - Preparing for new uses\n\nThe Teruel site is located in the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain, and is home to a coal-fired power plant that received authorization to cease operations in June 2020. The Teruel plant repurposing project involves the development of a combination of renewable energy generation facilities (solar, wind and battery storage). This has made it possible to optimize the demolition project with respect to the future use of the site, anticipating the characterization of the soil and groundwater in the area affected by the installation of the photovoltaic plant in the zone previously occupied by the coal house, without having to wait for the completion of the demolition of the plant. The results of the risk analysis already prepared showed an acceptable level for all uses, without the need for further action.\nOther activities\n\nEnel X: e-mobility\n\nDuring 2021, Enel X proceeded with an important development of the e-mobility Emission Saving tool, developed to provide evidence of the division\u2019s commitment to sustainable mobility through the electrification of the vehicle fleet in circulation. The algorithm, already capable of calculating the CO\u2082 avoided, the equivalent trees per year and the pollutants saved in the use of an electric or electrified vehicle compared to one powered by a traditional endothermic engine, was enriched in 2021 by the addition of the calculation of noise and avoided costs to health and environment.\n\nThe new e-mobility algorithm Emission Saving tool 4.0 has been verified and validated by an internationally recognized certification body (RINA) in accordance with the principles identified in the UNI EN ISO 14064-2:2019 standard. Enel X has therefore calculated the reduction in the level of environmental noise obtained thanks to the adoption of the electric-powered or plug-in vehicle in purely electric mode, compared to internal combustion vehicles, both non-rechargeable hybrids and purely thermal. To do this, it relied on CEDR studies, which showed a clear reduction in noise emissions between 20 and 50 km/h. Above this speed, in fact, the noise derived from the rolling of tires and from aerodynamic penetration of the vehicle makes noise emissions comparable, regardless of the type of power supply, whereas below 20 km/h battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are equipped with acoustic devices that facilitate their detection by pedestrians. The results showed that, by adopting a conservative approach for a quick evaluation of the \u201cgain\u201d obtained from using electric vehicles, an overall noise reduction of 3 dB(A) compared to internal combustion vehicles can be considered, corresponding to 50% less noise related to vehicular traffic. The use of an electric vehicle (EV) in purely electric mode instead of an internal combustion vehicle (HEV/ICEV) is therefore equivalent to halving the vehicular traffic in terms of noise pollution.\n\nEnel X has therefore quantified the savings in air and noise emissions related to the recharging services provided. January 2018 to December 2021 saw over 3.6 million recharges at Enel X stations across Italy; approximately 46 mil kWh was delivered by the charging stations and about 273 million km were traveled by electric vehicle owners. Compared to 2020, there has been an increase of over 100% in the energy supplied by the recharging stations, with a consequent doubling of CO\u2082 savings thanks to the greater diffusion of both electric vehicles and Enel X\u2019s connected public and private recharging points. The emission of about 33,400 tCO\u2082 has been avoided, corresponding to about 1.8 million equivalent trees per year, as well as about 82,400 kg of NO\u2093 and 2,500 kg of PM\u2081\u2080. The noise avoided is equivalent to an annual reduction of 52,200 HEV/ICEV cars.\n\nEnvironmental legal disputes\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the number of legal proceedings pending was 243 across the whole Group. The main environmental disputes related to Italy, Latin America and Iberia.\n\nThe total amount of fines issued to Group Companies in 2021 was about 5 million euros, primarily in Spain in relation to network operations of Edistribuci\u00f3n Redes Digitales, and secondarily in Brazil.\n\n(24) \u201cNoise emission of electric and hybrid electric vehicles\u201d \u2013 CEDR (Conference of European Directors of Roads).\n### Priorities\n- Economic and financial value creation\n- Innovation, circular economy and digital transformation\n\n### Plan\n- **GROWTH ACCELERATORS**\n  - Innovation\n\n### Targets\n\n| Activities | 2021-2023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022-2024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| \u2022 Further enhance the reach of our innovation ecosystem, to find the best solutions on a global scale | Launch of 350 Proof of Concept to test innovative solutions in the period 2021-2023 | 168 Proof of Concept launched | | Launch of 520 Proof of Concept to test innovative solutions in the period 2022-2024 | ISG | 9 17 |\n| \u2022 Generate value by solving the ever-increasing needs of the Business Lines, by enabling open innovation tools (collaboration with start-ups, crowdsourcing, partners, universities, intelligence, technological communities, solution design activities) | Scale-up of 100 solutions to accelerate the implementation of the Strategic Plan in the period 2021-2023 | 46 solutions adopted in the business | | Scale-up of 137 solutions to accelerate the implementation of the Strategic Plan in the period 2022-2024 | ISG | 9 17 |\n\n### Goals\n- **Industrial**\n- **Environmental**\n- **Social**\n- **Technological**\n\n### Status\n- **New**\n- **Redefined**\n- **Outdated**\n- **Off track**\n- **On track**\n- **Achieved**\nIn order to encourage new uses of power and new ways of managing it and making it accessible to increasing numbers of people in a sustainable way, we have made innovation a key component of our strategy. It is a path that involves traditional activities and the development of new models and technologies, based on cutting-edge innovation, creativity, passion and ideas not only from inside the Group, but also from outside.\n\nWe identify the most innovative solutions to meet the main challenges of sustainable development as well as the 17 SDGs of the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations, both in line with and as a support for the Group\u2019s strategy, its Industrial Plan and its Sustainability Plan. Currently, we are defining a three-year innovation plan, shared with Top Management and submitted for approval to the Group\u2019s Innovation Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer. In conjunction with the various functions and Business Lines in all countries where we operate, the Holding Innovability\u00ae Function (Innovation and Sustainability), reporting directly to the CEO, manages innovation activities in conformity with regulations currently in force and with the Group\u2019s compliance programs. Furthermore, dedicated facilities at Business Line level have been set up to facilitate the development and dissemination of innovative solutions.\n\nISO 56002:2021 \u201cInnovation Management Systems\u201d standard implementation\n\nIn 2021, following the publication of ISO 56002:2021 \u201cInnovation Management Systems\u201d, we decided voluntarily to extend the Group\u2019s existing Integrated Health, Safety and Environmental Management System to include also innovation. The Management System has the following objectives:\n\n- improvement of the Group\u2019s governance;\n- integration between processes;\n- identification any areas of improvement in processes and implementation of the appropriate measures;\n- improvement of the company organization with a view to obtaining operational excellence.\nThe innovative ecosystem\n\nIn line with the Open Power vision, we promote an Open Innovation approach, renamed Open Innovability\u00ae in 2017, to address the challenges of the energy transition. Innovation and sustainability merge in a way that compels us rethink traditional business models and create new ones.\n\nWe aim to link the different areas of the Group with start-ups, industrial partners, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), research centers, universities and entrepreneurs, including through the use of crowdsourcing platforms, such as openinnovability.com. The platform is dedicated to the world of innovators and people in the Company who wish to contribute to business development with innovative and sustainable solutions, transforming proposals into concrete projects capable of solving the challenges inspired by specific business needs, many of which are directly related to the United Nations 2030 Agenda.\n\nSince the platform was launched, almost 170 challenges have been published, more than 43 thousand users have signed up (plus around 400 thousand potential solvers from partner platforms) and more than 10 thousand proposals have been received. The solutions presented cover the entire value chain, from power generation to networks and markets.\n\nThrough the \u201cI have a project\u201d touchpoint, the platform also offers a space to anyone with innovative business-related projects, even if the proposals do not comply with any specific active challenge.\n\nTogether we can design the future\n\nGenerally speaking, thanks to the Open Innovability\u00ae approach more than 1,000 innovation projects have been activated and about 41 partnership agreements have been signed, covering assorted topics of relevance to the Group. These include innovative technologies and materials for smart grids (3M), promotion of space applications in the energy sector (ESA, Thales Alenia Space), and co-development of innovative digital solutions (Cisco and Microsoft).\n\nThe global network of Innovation Hubs and Labs supports the Group\u2019s innovation strategy and significantly contributes to consolidating the collaboration model with start-ups and SMEs. The latter propose innovative solutions and new business models, and the Group provides its expertise, testing facilities and a global network of partners to support their development and scale-up. The Hubs, which are located in the most significant innovation ecosystems for the Group (Catania, Pisa, Milan, Silicon Valley, Boston, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Moscow, Santiago de Chile and Tel Aviv), handle relations with all players involved in innovation activities and are the main source of research for innovative start-ups and SMEs. The Labs (Milan, Pisa, Catania, S\u00e3o Paulo, Tel Aviv and Be\u2019er Sheva being the most representative) allow start-ups to develop and test solutions together with our Business Lines. During 2021, thanks to the Group\u2019s stable positioning in innovative ecosystems and the intense use of the Hub and Lab network over 90 exploration initiatives were launched (more than half of which were in the form of virtual bootcamps) in different technological areas. This made it possible for us to meet more than 2,000 start-ups and initiate more than 100 new collaborations.\n\nWe also continued to implement the We4U (World energy 4 Universities) partnership program with national and international universities and research centers, with the goal of maintaining an ongoing, multidisciplinary dialogue focused on the challenges of the energy transition. The program, consolidated by over four years of activity, sees among its partners the Polytechnic of Milan, the Polytechnic of Turin, Bocconi University, Sant\u2019Anna High School, Ricerca sul Sistema Energetico (RSE), UC Berkeley, MIT, Columbia University (NYC), Comillas University (Madrid), Strathmore University (Nairobi) and, more recently, the University of Genoa, LUISS (Free International University of Social Studies) and Venice International University.\nSicily in support of the global energy revolution: the Hub & Lab and the Gigafactory in Catania, hydrogen in Carlentini\n\n\u201cThe Solar Innovation Lab in Catania is a multifaceted facility that makes it possible to broaden our knowledge in the field of photovoltaics from the point of view both of the individual technology components and of the plants as a system. The aim is to contribute to the growth of Enel\u2019s competences so as to provide maximum support to the development of the global renewables ecosystem and, with the same level of commitment, to support Enel\u2019s business in this sector.\u201d\n\nAn example of how innovation is an integral part and beating heart of the Group\u2019s business is the Catania Hub & Lab (Italy), where research did not cease even during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is one of the world\u2019s largest and most advanced industrial innovation districts for renewable technologies, as well as an innovative ecosystem open to universities, start-ups and businesses. In the Lab\u2019s workshops, the yields and performances of solar panels are tested, evaluating their reliability and providing useful data to support investments in the plants where they will be installed. The technologies used simulate the accelerated ageing of the panels, exposing them to thermal cycles in climatic chambers and to ultraviolet radiation in solar simulators, or else subjecting them to the combined effect of light and temperature through LeTID (Light- and Elevated Temperature-Induced Degradation) tests. Finally, there is the stabilization system, which measures power loss in panels during the very first phase in which they are exposed to light, thus focusing attention on the initial degradation, especially in cases where this is higher than the amount declared by the manufacturers. The Lab\u2019s infrastructure also lends itself to testing mounting facilities such as trackers or welcomes projects for the automated assembly of PV panel arrays. Our commitment to the development of increasingly efficient photovoltaic panels was strengthened in 2021. Relying on the existing 3SUN plant, the Group intends to expand from 200 MWp/year to about 3 GWp/year of photovoltaic power, developing an architecture based on cells with even more innovative heterojunction technology (HJT) that will make it possible to achieve over 30% efficiency. TANGO (ITAliaN pv GigafactOry), the name of the initiative behind the building of the Gigafactory, is one of the seven projects recently selected for funding from the ETS (Emissions Trading System) Innovation Fund totaling Euro 1.1 billion. Furthermore, in Carlentini, in the province of Syracuse, we have launched NextHy, an initiative to stimulate growth of the entire green hydrogen ecosystem, which will have as its core an industrial platform for technological validation. Together with start-ups and global players, we will validate innovative technologies capable of accelerating the full commercial maturity of all technologies that enable the sustainable and competitive generation of green hydrogen.\nInnovation Communities\n\nWe have set up Innovation Communities, specific interfunctional working groups that, by comparing and sharing ideas and experiences, tackle relevant business issues in an innovative way and represent a point of reference for the various technologies.\n\nBlockchain, literally meaning a \u201cchain of blocks\u201d, exploits the characteristics of an information network of nodes to manage data and information securely in a shared manner without the need for a central control and assessment body. In this area, we have fostered collaboration with various stakeholders and have worked on different fields of application (asset tracking, trade, energy poverty management), despite the fact that it is not yet a scalable technology suitable for mass implementation.\n\nDrones. We have been implementing this technology in power generation and distribution plants in all countries since 2012. The main uses within the Group concern thermal imaging and the inspection of thermal, hydroelectric, solar and wind plants, the detection of abnormalities, 3D modeling, photogrammetry and laser scanning. For several years we have also been carrying out tests and trials in collaboration with the regulatory bodies ENAC (Ente Nazionale per l\u2019Aviazione Civile - National Civil Aviation Authority) and ENAV (Ente Nazionale di Assistenza al Volo - National Flight Assistance Agency), since the regulation of drone flight is still evolving at both national and European level. We have over 200 drones and 450 pilots worldwide. In 2021, the Community started working on the development of a common drone management platform in terms of fleets, operations, authorization processes, and so forth.\n\nEnergy storage. The use of storage systems ensures improved levels of reliability and network quality indicators, opening up new, sustainable frontiers and guaranteeing nationwide balancing of the grid and stability of system loads. The Group is investigating new storage systems, such as solid-state lithium batteries, vanadium flow systems, gravitational accumulators, and other alternative technologies for long-life applications. Today, the Community is working on a programmatic document to map all major innovative technologies and use cases within the Group to explore new opportunities.\n\nAugmented and virtual reality. This Community aims to seek out sector products and platforms in order to follow their technological evolution and redefine use cases for the Company. In 2020 a shared database was created to gather all available virtual scenarios to be utilized for training.\n\nRobotics. The main applications of robotics are in the construction and automated maintenance of PV arrays or other inspection and maintenance activities in areas that may present high-risks to personnel operating in remote areas or in challenging or repetitive work environments. We are testing legged robots for specific, autonomous inspections, as well as remotely operated vehicles for underwater cable inspections, and for maintenance work on hydroelectric reservoirs, photovoltaic plants and wind turbines. The new frontiers in the use of robotics include autonomous construction with a variety of possible\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Currently AI and automatic learning are broadly used for the automation of processes and of physical device operations, from sensors to drones, on up to robots. The Business Lines make extensive use of these technologies as applied to the analysis of activities related to the O&M Functions. The Group can benefit from an ecosystem of artificial intelligence, a unique place where each user can access services developed internally and a data school for the development of in-house know how.\n\nSensors. Sensors transform the world around us into combinable data that can be used to monitor and predict human and technological behavior. We make significant use of sensors to monitor assets and facilitate predictive maintenance of power plants. Building on the policy document developed by the Community in 2021, we set out to explore new areas of application that can ensure increasingly widespread knowledge to improve management of operations and customer service.\n\nQuantum computing. As the latest addition to the Innovation Community family, quantum computing has the potential to address new challenges for conventional computing architectures by leveraging the unique properties of quantum particles, such as entanglement and superposition, as the basis for driving computational systems.\n\nFinally, other Innovation Communities, such as those related to wearables, additive manufacturing, data monetization, materials and hydrogen, are currently active, continuously monitoring the evolution of technology and sharing new business models and use cases with all participants, as well as value-added services that could be adopted in different areas of Group activities.\n\nThe culture of innovation is enriched by the Agile approach\n\nIn 2021, the integration of the culture of Open Innovation with Agile Transformation was launched at Group level in order to support business from idea generation to project implementation. The Innovation and Agile cultures work in synergy, and are driving forces behind the creation of a competitive advantage and for the optimization of costs over time.\n\nWe are working to increase the portfolio of initiatives so as to promote and spread Innovation and Agile knowledge and methodologies at distinct levels, and to support business in generating value through the use of creativity, lateral thinking and agile techniques.\n\nThe \u201cInnovation Ambassadors\u201d Community thus merges with the \u201cAgile Agents\u201d Community, reaching a total of over 400 people and offering its contribution to \u201cmaking sure that innovation becomes part of the daily work of everyone in Enel\u201d.\n\nIn 2021, the \u201cMAKE IT HAPPEN!\u201d program, designed to promote and celebrate entrepreneurship, reached a record of 12 approved projects, with the valuable contribution of the Idea Hubs in the collection and exploitation of new concepts.\n\nOur innovative solutions\n\nWe leverage the deployment of systems and applications on common platforms to improve the operability, reliability and accessibility of systems to ensure customer centricity, while maximizing adaptability to internal and external changes. Different solutions based on automation, artificial intelligence tools, robots, remote control systems and technologies have been tested and adopted to support health and safety. In addition, the Group has made use of the culture of sustainability by pushing for the adoption of circular models to increase competitiveness.\n\nConsidering the expected growth trend for wind power in the coming decades, we have worked in synergy with lead-\nPrati Armati\u00ae has been successfully tested, making it possible to stop water and wind erosion of the soil and combat desertification. At the Gibson Bay wind farm in South Africa, three special acoustic deterrent devices (made by the US company NRG Systems) were installed to create a \u201cbarrier effect\u201d that stops bats from approaching the wind turbines, thus preventing potentially fatal accidental impacts. For the Group, automation, robotics and AI systems are technological allies for making power plants increasingly efficient, sustainable and safe. With health and safety always first and foremost in our minds, we have launched the AI4Safety project on several sites. Thanks to new artificial intelligence solutions based on computer vision, it is possible to identify risk situations at an early stage, thereby expanding the number of critical events identified and enabling timely notifications and event classification through the digitalization of the entire process. We are also developing an innovative AI-based system for automatic fault recognition of wind turbine blades. This has proven effective in drastically reducing inspection times for analysis of data and in optimizing maintenance activities that can be prioritized and also expanded in numerical terms. In 2021, at the Totana photovoltaic plant in Spain, testing of a solution developed by the Italian start-up Reiwa was successfully completed. This was based on the use of autonomous robots to clean photovoltaic panels automatically without using water, demonstrating an increase in power generation, sustainability and safety.\n\nSeveral projects have also been developed to support the power network business, exploring approximately 600 solutions from start-ups and SMEs over the past year, selected by the Group\u2019s Innovation Hubs or through internal and external crowdsourcing channels. We have initiated and accelerated three major initiatives to promote the energy transition globally, as outlined below.\n\n- **Grid Blue Sky** is innovating and digitalizing our infrastructures and networks, industrializing Group innovations (such as the Network Digital Twin), advanced field operation technologies (such as remote and virtual assistance), and intelligent maintenance into a global platform.\n\n- **Gridspertise**, a new company launched in September 2021, leverages the innovation developed and tested by the Group in the fields of metering and digitalization (grid edge, grid infrastructures and field operations), to offer cutting-edge solutions to other distribution companies.\n\n- The Group\u2019s **Grid Futurability\u00ae** is based on the transformation of conventional grids into smart grids, starting from the needs of customers and stakeholders. It redefines operations based on digitalization and innovative technologies, leading to a vision of power grids as resilient, participatory and sustainable platforms. Innovation contributes to Grid Futurability\u00ae by testing novel solutions in terms of resilience, such as the Internet of Things and advanced grid sensors, grid automation and\nedge computing, drones and robots, as well as innovative cyber security and emergency management techniques. In terms of participation, new options are being examined to plan and manage the grid by taking advantage of the flexibility services offered by distributed energy resources. As regards sustainability, sustainable and recyclable raw materials, as well as safety solutions for field operations and third parties, are being tested.\n\nEnel X is committed to the development of energy communities, from the construction of photovoltaic plants to the technical-economic management of the energy community itself.\n\nRegarding smart city services, in addition to the adaptive lighting and smart poles solution integrated with different functionalities (adaptive lighting, video surveillance, Wi-Fi, etc.), a new application of the City Analytics tool, namely, City Analytics - Mobility Map, was developed and placed on the market. This is intended to qualify macro-mobility statistical indicators to facilitate management of Covid-19 containment measures and help shape policy in this new phase of normalcy. Two additional indicators based on open data have been developed by Innovability\u00ae Enel X: the CE City Index (circularity index of municipalities) and the 15 Minutes City Index (service proximity index), accessible free of charge to government authorities who can register on Enel X\u2019s YoUrban portal.\n\nAs regards storage, numerous initiatives have been launched, from predictive anomaly detection to end-of-life battery treatment and second-life battery aggregation (Pioneer) to provide grid and storage distribution services. We have also initiated the development of telemedicine products and services, exploring and defining implementation scenarios for chronic patients, frail and elderly people, citizens interested in approaching monitoring and prevention programs, and public and private facilities of the National Health Service. The development is carried out in conjunction with primary health institutions, such as the Policlinico Gemelli, the Catholic University of the Sacro Cuore, the University of L\u2019Aquila and the Prato Diabetes Center.\n\nFurthermore, in conjunction with Mastercard, Enel X has launched the FinSec Innovation Lab in Israel to advance innovations in financial technology and cyber security for payments. The laboratory was established following a tender launched by the Israel Innovation Authority. The FinSec Innovation Lab will collaborate with start-ups to test and develop products and solutions, with a focus on digital security, fintech platforms, digital authentication and financial inclusion.\n\nFinally, the global \u201cRoBoost\u201d program aims to accelerate and integrate market-ready technologies (both innovative and robotic) into Operation & Maintenance activities on more than 1,300 power plants located in 20 countries. We are working with innovative technology providers (start-ups, industrial partners, local and international companies) to build and develop robots, drones and other devices. Through this approach, Enel Green Power is combining its own knowledge with the technological and digital skills of various suppliers whose wealth of experience and capabilities it also helps to increase. Several applications of the technology include monitoring solar power plants using drones and AI as part of the maintenance work required for these installations, while also reducing health and safety risks and increasing operational efficiency.\nCreating value in the future: intellectual property\n\nThe ecosystem of Open Innovability\u00ae generates innovation through the creation and sharing of internal and external solutions that give life to a flow of ideas that we are committed to protecting in a suitable manner. Intellectual Property (also defined as \u201cIP\u201d) guarantees double protection: on the one hand it allows to control inventive solutions, technologies and knowledge that originate from the Company and the ecosystems of which Enel is part and in which universities, research institutes, suppliers, programmers and consultants are involved; on the other hand, IP makes it possible to safely and sustainably disseminate technological solutions that are used to implement electrification, platformization and stewardship programs.\n\nDuring 2021, we have strengthened the strategic, responsible and sustainable management of IP, both with the adoption of a new Intellectual Property Management procedure on a Group level, as well as by continuing the project of structuring reporting related to intellectual property, which must be viewed in the wider context of the Enel Group\u2019s non-financial reporting.\n\nThe new Intellectual Property Management procedure\n\nThe new procedure includes all the phases of the intellectual property life cycle, from the moment of conception of the invention up to the protection and maintenance of the portfolio and relationships with external parties. In particular, the procedure regulates the cases in which the intellectual property generated in Enel is transferred abroad, in contexts such as: (i) collaborative research, (ii) procurement, (iii) relationships with start-ups, (iv) merger, acquisition and stewardship operations, (v) direct or licensed acquisitions of intangible goods of Enel and third parties. This regulates the methods for protecting intangible assets, monitoring their use, the metrics for measuring, also quantitatively, the Group\u2019s performance in managing intellectual property, outlining elements that are useful for future actions concerning planning and optimization of assets and risk mapping.\n\nThe procedure is based on the following pillars:\n\n- **involvement of people**, as it is concerned with regulating and encouraging the participation of employees in the inventive process and make them more responsible with respect to the strategic importance of intangible assets;\n- **a holistic view of IP**, as it includes all forms of intangible company assets, regardless of the legal methods of protection;\n- **an approach that is coherent with the widespread system of innovation adopted in Enel**;\n- **management based on the concept of measurability**, also quantitatively, of the Group\u2019s performance in managing IP.\n\nThe new procedure was prepared in accordance with the principles of ISO 56005:2021 and is connected to the Trade Secrets Management procedure, which defines the rules for the correct protection, management and internal and external circulation of the industrial secrets of the Group or of which it became aware in its contractual relationships with supplies, partners and, in general, with third parties.\n\nThe Intellectual Property Reporting project\n\nStarting in 2020, the Group has challenged itself to correctly represent its intellectual heritage in non-financial reporting. We have therefore carried out a quantitative and qualitative recognition of the existing heritage and its systematization, both for coded and protected components (patents, design, utility models) as well as for trade secret. In 2021, we created the basis for the definition of an internal non-financial reporting process for intellectual property, which is based on proprietary methodology that is able to ensure the continuity, year after year, of the activity of assessing and optimizing the Company\u2019s intangible assets, in view of their future communication also outside the Company. The methodology being defined applies to all internal Group projects that generate intellectual property and is based on the necessary and preventive identification of the various components that result from the project, in terms of documentation, technology, algorithms, processes, products, layouts, schemes and dashboards. Each ontology of the intangible asset, that is the identified intangible elements, is associated with one or more forms of intellectual property law in order to measure the intensity of the results of the project in terms of intellectual content. The internal methodology also includes the assessment of the intellectual property generated internally that, even though it is not meant in any way to replace other assessment methods adopted within the Group for determining the fair value and based on income methodologies, makes it possible to recognize the intrinsic value of these intangibles by leveraging elements of an equity nature and providing an indication.\nof the investment that would be necessary to replicate the assessed technological solution. On an experimental level, to test and perfect the methodology, some projects that contributed to the generation of IP within the Group were selected from inside the Global Business Lines, the Global Service Functions and Staff Functions.\n\nPractical applications of the Intellectual Property Reporting methodology: Grid Blue Sky and the 3SUN factory\n\nThe Grid Blue Sky project aims to completely re-engineer the operative model of the grids for the integrated management of all activities, from design and planning to operation and maintenance up to interaction with customers and support for new distributor business models. All of this makes it possible for the various functions to be natively compatible with the various aspects of the operational environment, including those of a regulatory nature typical of energy markets. Grid Blue Sky is based on a paradigm of innovative development that makes its architecture scalable, sustainable and resilient as it is based on the idea that all the activities that the operator carries out take place by accessing a single integrated platform where data converges. This makes it possible to avoid the need to develop redundant vertical solutions because the data base is shared, and open to the possibility of developing numerous services and integrating third-party solutions. The platform includes the following components: (i) asset owner, which concerns everything that regards the planning and development of the electrical grid; (ii) asset operator, which concerns grid management in terms of operating and maintenance processes; (iii) customer engagement, which controls the process of interacting with the customer, who can therefore benefit from a single platform of interaction and relationship management; and (iv) system operator, who is preparing for the future of electricity distribution, regarding the use of the flexibility offered by resources connected to the grids to resolve voltage regulation and congestion problems. Examining the project using the Intellectual Property Reporting methodology made it possible to identify the various intangible components that make up the platform and confirmed the considerable intellectual property density of Grid Blue Sky. Associating the intangible elements with forms of protection \u2013 which is part of the methodology inaugurated by Enel \u2013 reveals the presence of copyrights on all the source code that is at the base of the platform, all the aspects of conceptual design and informational flows at the basis of the operational model and all the original graphical elements (user interfaces and dashboards for reading data). Furthermore, in application of the internal procedure for the protection of trade secrets, we have identified, isolated and coded all the confidential components that underlie Enel\u2019s considerable knowledge of grid management and that are expressed in technological, organizational, economic, financial and marketing aspects.\n\nEnel Green Power\u2019s 3SUN is the factory that studies and develops applications of new generation photovoltaics. Enel has long been at the forefront of the design of double-sided heterojunction solar panels, which increase the efficiency of systems due to the increased capacity to capture solar radiation. 3SUN\u2019s knowledge in this area does not only concern the panel as such, but also the innovative materials, the assembly methods as well as all the industrial knowledge needed for the their implementation and the automated management (from the point of view of Industry 4.0) of the production lines. The codification of intellectual property in the case of 3SUN revealed all the technological components and the relative forms of protection that concern an extensive group of patent families on processes that were adopted on materials and the heterojunction technologies for panels, as well as a substantial set of secret knowledge, adequately identified and protected, that is necessary for the production of the panels, as well as specific production know-how that directly concerns the implementation of all the components of the Gigafactory.\nThe Group\u2019s main patents and designs\n\nAs at December 31, 2021 Enel has a portfolio that guarantees protection in all markets where the Group is present, and that includes overall 892 patent rights for inventions belonging to 146 technological families; of these, 749 have been granted patents and 143 applications are pending. Our portfolio also includes 15 utility models and 170 design registrations. Together with the patents, utility models and designs, the rights to IP also concern industrial secrets of a technical and commercial nature that are constantly coded and kept in line with what is required by the Trade Secrets Management organisational procedure. As regards trademarks, the Group owns 1,576, of which 1,455 already awarded and 121 pending approval.\n\nWe are investing resources in the development of innovative solutions with high IP density, mainly in the form of authorial protection and trade secrets, concerning climatic models and advanced quantitative models for the analysis of energy systems aimed toward supporting the decarbonization and electrification processes in the main countries and regions of interest, with an integrated, future-oriented vision.\n\nEnel Green Power and Thermal Generation: we have developed innovative technical solutions in the area of energy generation from renewable solar sources that aim to (i) increase the photovoltaic generation of plants, increasing at a micro and nanometric level the mechanisms for transferring the loads in correspondence of the various layers, both in single heterojunction cells as well as in tandem systems and (ii) implement an innovative system for the quick and automatable installation of photovoltaic panels on predetermined support structures, therefore obtaining significant savings in terms of installation times, and an increase in the precision of the operation, its scalability and therefore Company competitiveness on an international level. With reference to these solutions, there are overall 11 patent families including currently 28 pending national and international patent applications and 7 granted and currently valid national patents.\n\nGlobal Infrastructure & Networks: our patent heritage contributes in a significant manner to the strategy of creating platforms and the exploitation of network externalities in the services market, as well as automation of the management of utilities. The Grid Blue Sky project, analyzed within the scope of Intellectual Property Reporting as specified in the previous paragraph, is contributing toward the implementation of a new global operating platform for the Group\u2019s grids.\n\nEnel X Global Retail: the development of solutions that have an impact on IP heritage has essentially concerned applications of telemedicine business and urban liveability platforms. In the first area, of particular importance is a health pathway studied and managed by the specialists of the Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli and made available through a telemedicine platform and an app, both developed by Enel X and protected by copyright. For the second area, there is the 15 Minutes City Index, an urban index developed with the support of the University of Florence. Enel X is the holder of the trade secret and a pending Italian patent. Using open data, the 15 Minutes City Index assesses the essential services (public transport, hospitals, schools, etc.), indicating the areas in each city and the individual micro-districts with lower levels of service (with respect to the density of the population), and thereby supports urban planning. As concerns the business of electric mobility, the IP portfolio presents a diversified structure of forms of protection, which includes patents for inventions, designs, trade secrets, utility models and copyright for technological content. In particular: (i) the patent family concerning the high power bidirectional charging infrastructures for which a patent was initially deposited in the United States, and then the procedure was started on an international level; (ii) the trade secrets inherent to the strategic mobility platforms; (iii) the copyright on the JuicePass app; (iv) the community design that protects the aesthetic form of JuiceMedia, an innovative product that makes it possible to offer electric charging and multimedia advertising services at the same time; and (v) the designs of the Mini JuicePole, protected in the European Union as well as in India, Chile, Norway, United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n### Digitalization\n\n#### Priorities\n- Economic and financial value creation\n- Innovation, circular economy and digital transformation\n\n#### Plan\n- Growth Accelerators\n- Digitalization\n\n#### Targets\n\n| Activities | 2021-2023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022-2024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Disseminating the IT security culture and changing people\u2019s behaviour in order to reduce risks | 15 cyber security knowledge-sharing events held each year | 18 events delivered | | 15 cyber security knowledge-sharing events held each year | S | 4 |\n| Information security verification activities (Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Assessment, etc.) | 800 verification activities per year | 1,580 verification activities carried out<sup>(1)</sup> | | 800 verification activities per year | T | 9 |\n| Execution of cyber exercises involving plants/industrial sites | 36 cyber exercises<sup>(2)</sup> | 23 cyber exercises carried out | | 40 cyber exercises<sup>(2)</sup> | S | 9 |\n\n---\n\n**Find out more**\n\nCyber exercises are drills aimed at simulating a cyber security incident, executed with the objective to train the reaction capacity of the involved subjects and to verify the processes and the technologies in the field.

The simulation performed generates awareness and addresses possible needs for improvement of technical or organizational aspects.\n\n---\n\n<sup>(1)</sup> The year 2021 was characterized by an exceptional performance thanks to the extra commitment and the exploitation of synergies and cross operational opportunities of the areas involved.\n\n<sup>(2)</sup> Cumulative value for the three-year reference period.\n| Activities | 2021\u20132023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022\u20132024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Activities to reduce CO\u2082 emissions | -13 mil printed pages in 2023 (vs. 2019) | -53 mil printed pages compared to 2019<sup>(3)</sup> | -15 mil printed pages in 2023 (vs. 2019) | | S | 12 |\n| Reduction of CO\u2082 produced for optimization of PCs, laptops and monitors in Italy | 12 mil hours of downtime | | Activities to reduce PC, laptop and monitor downtime | | S | 12 |\n| Extension of the use of videocommunication systems | 7.3 mil meetings held via video communication services | | Extension of the use of videocommunication systems | | S | 12 |\n| Reuse and exchange of information in the e-API Digital Ecosystem | | | 130 new e-API interconnections in the period 2022\u20132024 | | S | 9 |\n\n<sup>(3)</sup> The 2021 result has been significantly impacted by working methods tied to the pandemic.\n\nThe e-API Digital Ecosystem is the digital environment thanks to which all the companies of the Enel Group can share information, normally confined within specific vertical applications (information \u201csilos\u201d), in a simple, fast and automated way. Thanks to the enabling technology of the API (Application Programming Interface), data flows and Enel\u2019s functionalities are treated as \u201cdata-as-a-product\u201d, promoting sustainability through a real reuse and exchange of information and a reduction of time and resources needed.\nTechnology is now on a journey that shows little sign of slowing down. Not only is it an integral part of every company\u2019s business, but it is also a fundamental enabler of sustainable development. When pursuing sustainable development goals, decarbonization, circular economy models or energy efficiency cannot be achieved without the right technology. We are seeking to pursue the \u201ctwin transition\u201d (energy and digital transition) to make our business model more high-performing, resilient and inclusive.\n\nThe digital transformation\n\nThe energy transition requires utility companies to evolve and become orchestrators of a complex system, characterized by multiple players and distributed assets. Digital technologies allow us to manage this new paradigm, improving the efficiency and profitability of assets and processes, and generating new business opportunities. In particular, by using digital platforms we can achieve increasing levels of scalability, efficiency and flexibility thanks to plug and play and reuse models, reducing marginal costs.\n\nAt Enel, the digital transformation process is guided by the Global Digital Solutions unit which \u2013 working together with all the Holding\u2019s Business Lines and Functions \u2013 guides strategic choices, defines development paths, and ensures their implementation. Since 2015, we have been working to simplify our application map by developing global digital technologies that can be used across the value chain, and help develop and implement platform operating models throughout the organization, which has been made possible by the full migration to the cloud in 2019.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- our global digital platforms promote renewables development through shared interfaces and intelligent solutions to enhance business development (BD), engineering & construction (E&C) and operation & maintenance (O&M) activities;\n- growth in the quality of service, efficiency and safety of our grid infrastructure is driven by a single digital platform \u2013 Grid Blue Sky \u2013 which standardizes the grids\u2019 planning, operation and maintenance phases and makes them more efficient;\n- the Group\u2019s digital transformation has enabled it to support Retail and Enel X\u2019s merger into a new organizational structure in 2021, which is focused on increasing customer centricity. Our global customer base is managed by the Customer Operations platform, which provides customer support, service activation, and quick and easy payment and billing methods. Moreover, through Enel X\u2019s digital platforms, we are able to offer innovative products and services at global level for the B2C, B2B and B2G segments.\n\n(1) B2C (Business to Consumer), B2B (Business to Business), B2G (Business to Government).\nIn 2021, Enel launched a project to calculate digital-related emissions (the \u2018digital carbon footprint\u2019) in line with the calculation tools and methods set out in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol). The pilot project looked at cloud services-related emissions for 2020 in terms of infrastructure-related tCO\u2082eq and emission tied to our key cloud IaaS/PaaS (Infrastructure/Platform as a Service) and cloud SaaS (Software as a Service) providers. This enabled us to identify actions we can take to reduce and contain these emissions.\n\n**Key platforms to make routine activities more sustainable**\n\n**Cloud computing**\n\nThe cloud represents a fundamental strategic enabler which allows us to use IT resources (both in terms of infrastructure and applications) and which, by making full use of the access possibilities provided by the network, allows to reduce waste tied to the consumption of unused resources. The cloud used by Enel requires on average around 16% of the energy required by conventional on-premise infrastructures, which allows an average reduction in CO\u2082 emissions of around 88%, as well as optimized use of water for equipment cooling.\n\n**Unified Communications and Collaboration (UCC)**\n\nThe UCC platform integrates real-time communication services such as instant messaging (chat), IP telephony, audio and video conferencing, with various means of communication, such as voicemail, email and SMS. This way, by taking full advantage of the sharing model to share and enjoy content online from personal computers, smartphones or tablets, we can reduce the need to travel and, in turn, lower our carbon dioxide emissions.\nData sharing and Enel Application Programming Interface (e-API)\n\nThe e-API ecosystem is the digital environment where all Group companies can share quickly and in real time \u2013 through standard interfaces and data paths \u2013 information that would normally remain confined to specific vertical applications (information silos). This ecosystem has helped speed up the adoption of digital solutions, reduce data redundancies within the Group and, more generally, reduce the amount of time and resources spent on exchanging information flows. A total of 123 new e-API interconnections were implemented in 2021.\n\nMachine learning and predictive maintenance\n\nWe adopt machine learning technologies to conduct predictive analysis in relation to the maintenance of electricity distribution networks and generation plants, identifying possible errors in advance and acting before faults occur on the main components. Therefore, using these technologies improves the quality of service provided, making it more sustainable over time, while ensuring an optimized use of internal resources and inspections focusing on the equipment most exposed to the risk of failure.\n\nDigital circular assets\n\nUsing platforms makes the management of digital assets more effective in line with the principles of the circular economy, helping to maximize recoverable value and providing accurate information on the availability, location and condition of the assets. The circular management of digital assets in the Group\u2019s various countries is achieved by safeguarding both the extension of the devices\u2019 service life, selling them to employees or third parties (over 24 thousand devices sold in 2021), and disposing of these devices in line with recycling principles, for a total of 56 tons of equipment in 2021.\n\nPersonal computer donations\n\nThe initiative to donate personal computers that have reached the end of their service life has been implemented with the aim of creating a positive social impact on public and private entities, which carry out various kinds of activities of social relevance and/or which pursue public benefit purposes. By giving PCs a new life, we are reinforcing our commitment to supporting communities in the countries where we operate, promoting digital inclusion, and enhancing the circular economy of digital devices, extending their service life through reuse.\nShared IT services for Enel people\n\nWe promote the use of shared IT services by taking full advantage of the new opportunities provided by digital technology, always paying close attention to the most vulnerable segments of the Enel population. For example, a dedicated telephone help desk was made available to people in the Company with disabilities (including temporary disabilities) who use assistive technologies and software. Dialing 0 for assistance, they can receive support for their technical and practical needs. The service is overseen by a team with specialized skills in compliance with international guidelines and standards.\n\nIn 2021, we enhanced, integrated and extended the services and digital tools that were used to support the 39 thousand people who worked remotely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These actions led to increasingly widespread use of video communication solutions, helping to maximize savings on travel and out-of-office missions while also reducing the CO\u2082 emissions tied to these activities.\n\n### Video communication\n\n- **more than 7.3 million** meetings\n- **more than 587.5 thousand** tons of CO\u2082 avoided\n\n### Printing service\n\n- **83 million** pages printed\n- **6.5 tons** of CO\u2082 produced\n\nThe printing service, based on new generation printer models set up for a more eco-sustainable use, continues to be in operation at all Group offices. Together with a more rational use of prints and digitization, the service has made it possible to reduce paper consumption over the years and, in turn, reduce the impact on the environment.\n\n### PC Power Management \u2013 Italy\n\n- **12 million** hours of use\n- **77.4 tons** of CO\u2082 produced\n\n---\n\n(1) Almost 5.1 million meetings in 2020 and 244 thousand in 2019, respectively with an avoided CO\u2082 contribution of 444.7 thousand tons in 2020 compared to 242.1 in 2019.\n(2) 88 million pages printed in 2020 and 136 million in 2019, which respectively produced 8.4 and 12.5 tons of CO\u2082.\n(3) 18 million hours of use in 2020 and 32 in 2019, which respectively produced 159.6 and 321.1 tons of CO\u2082.\nIn 2021, we continued to monitor electricity consumption outside normal working hours\\(^2\\) of the IT workstations (desktops, laptops, monitors) of Enel people working in Italy. This was measured thanks to a Microsoft function (System Center Configuration Manager) on the workstations, which can identify when a workstation is on and not being used. Following the analysis, specific awareness-raising initiatives were defined, aimed at reducing electricity consumption. Also this year, there has been a decrease in the hours of inactivity. This is thanks to both our awareness-raising activities on energy efficiency and to the new IT tools made available to our people during the Covid-19 pandemic, which enabled a reduction in emissions. The greater use of mobile devices has in fact made it possible to reduce the number of fixed devices in the Group\u2019s offices and, in turn, cut down the amount of time that devices are on outside working hours.\n\nDigital sustainability starts with you: the 10 things we can do for our planet\n\nDigital technology is a great resource for sustainability and it makes a real contribution to our commitment to safeguarding the environment, territory and communities. We have launched a number of initiatives aimed at digital sustainability, including creating a decalogue of virtuous behaviors to raise the awareness of all Enel people about their behavior when using digital technologies.\n\n\u201cSustainability is the goal we must strive towards and digital technology is the way we can achieve it. Digital technology is a great resource for sustainability: let\u2019s use digital technology with virtuous behaviors.\u201d\n\nAntonio Ganzerli\nHead of Sustainability and Circular Economy Global Digital Solutions\n\n\\(^2\\) Monday-Friday (from 7pm to 7am); Saturday and Sunday. Monitoring is not carried out on servers and personal computers which, by their nature, must be operational at all times. Specifically, the indicator represents the amount of CO\\(_2\\) associated with the electricity consumption of desktop computers, laptops and monitors, calculated after applying the average CO\\(_2\\) emission value per unit of electricity generated (gCO\\(_2\\)/kWh) in relation to the mix of sources present in Italy.\nTowards cyber-safe electrification\n\nIn the era of digital transformation, cyber security has taken on a key role in ensuring business operations. Typical cyber-attack types have changed radically in recent years: the number has grown exponentially, as has their level of sophistication and impact, making it increasingly challenging to identify the source in a timely manner. Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a further increase in security events worldwide given the need to operate in agile work modes and make use of home networks. In 2021, many of the world\u2019s major attacks were carried out by leveraging the supply chain and through compromised third parties. This could cause a sharp rise in the number of victims, considering for example that a single hacked software would be able to compromise many more subjects than those of the main injured party, reaching its customers or causing the interruption of the provided services (inducing the so-called \u201cscale effect\u201d).\n\nOn top of constantly applying the cyber security strategy, we have set out special measures, bearing in mind that cyber risks are not merely a corporate problem but can become a risk of ecosystemic proportions within the broader context of the complex and highly interconnected electricity industry. For example, a large-scale blackout in this scenario would have socio-economic ramifications throughout the population, companies and key institutions. The regulations and laws that produce common guidelines to combat risks tied to cyber security must also stay abreast of their ongoing evolution.\n\nThe key elements are therefore sharing and cooperation on cyber security issues with participation among all stakeholders including companies, legal institutions, supervisory bodies, suppliers, customers, and employees.\n\nPolicies and management models\n\nIn line with the needs of the energy industrial sector and with the Open Power strategic approach, the Group has adopted a systemic vision of cyber security issues, as well as a global strategy of analysis, prevention and management of cyber security events. The cyber security path to support the Group\u2019s digital transformation is based on the definition, enhancement and adoption of a security governance model, as well as infrastructures and services, in order to take advantage of best opportunities \u2013 including with the help of cutting-edge technologies \u2013 to boost the cyber resilience of our solutions.\n\nSince September 2016, the Cyber Security unit has been operating within Global Digital Solutions, reporting directly to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) who works under the Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The unit is committed to ensuring the governance, direction and control of cyber security topics, establishing strategy, policies and guidelines in compliance with national and international regulations, engineering support for the protection of the Group\u2019s environments, monitoring of the risk posture through checks based on processes and technology, as well as monitoring and implementing compliance requirements tied to cyber security regulations, and adopting technical solutions and procedures to mitigate any weaknesses detected. The unit works synergically with the Business Lines and with the technical units responsible for systems design and management, thanks to the Cyber Security Risk Managers and Cyber Security Response Managers. CISO and the Cyber Security Risk Managers also make up the Cyber Security Operating Committee, which aims to evaluate cyber risks across the business and determine the risk acceptance criteria based on the Group\u2019s risk posture. The Cyber Security Committee, chaired by the Group\u2019s CEO and made up of his/her front lines, approves the cyber security strategy and periodically checks its progress. As determined at the meeting of April 2021, the Committee meets every six months. Two meetings were held in 2021 (April and October).\n\nIt should be noted that, as part of the Control and Risks Committee meetings, one was held in October 2021. This meeting was an opportunity to deepen the Group\u2019s risk taxonomy, which also includes cyber security risk, classified in the \u201cdigital technology\u201d category. All areas actively participate in implementing the cyber security strategy by way of an integrated operating plan in line with the Group\u2019s objectives. Moreover, cyber security strategy and initiatives are a key focus area for the Group\u2019s principal executive and control bodies (e.g. Board of Directors, Control and Risks Committee, Supervisory Bodies, etc.).\n\nMoreover, the Group policy adopted in 2017 (the \u201cCyber Security Framework\u201d) addresses the principles and operational processes that support a global strategy of risk analysis, prevention and management. This Framework, based on a \u201csystemic\u201d vision applies across the more traditional Information Technology (IT) sector, as well as to Operational Technology (OT) environments tied to the industrial world and the Internet of Things (IoT). Simultaneously with the definition of the Framework, the Cyber Security Risk Management method was established in 2017. The method is applicable to all IT, OT and IoT environments and includes all of the phases.\nrequired to carry out a risk analysis and define the related mitigation plan, in line with the stated cyber security goals. Enel has also created a \u201cCyber Emergency Readiness Team\u201d (CERT) to ensure proactive management and responses to cyber incidents, while also encouraging collaboration and exchanges of information within a network of accredited international partners. Having entered into an agreement with the US national CERT, there are now 9 accreditations with: Romania, Italy, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Spain, and the US. Enel\u2019s CERT is also part of Trusted Introducer \u2013 a service that includes 445 CERTs in 73 countries. In September 2018 Enel also joined FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which is the largest and most widespread community in the sector, with 602 members spread across 99 countries.\n\n**Definition of the IT security strategy**\n\nThe cyber security strategy deals with setting objectives and priorities to direct and coordinate investment initiatives for the Group as a whole, and to ensure adherence to cyber security policies, setting targets, managerial reporting, and constant monitoring of ongoing security activities. This process is guided by CISO and leverages on close integration and synergy with the various business areas, which communicate their needs, analyze opportunities, manage any criticalities, and make proposals for initiatives. Devising strategies is an iterative activity based on sharing and consolidation of the Group\u2019s risk posture target. The various actors involved analyze the options and potential initiatives within their respective business areas in order to assess the feasibility, guarantee consensus, and the necessary funds. The Cyber Security unit guides the process and, together with the other key players, gradually consolidates aspects such as future scenario, objectives, and possible strategic initiatives in a cyber security strategy proposal document, with a high-level budget estimate and prioritization. The cyber security topic is also on the agenda of managerial meetings (such as business reviews, operational review meetings) and meetings of the control committees (such as the Control and Risks Committee).\nCyber security incident management\n\nThe multiplicity and complexity of the areas in which we operate (data, industry, and people) and of the technological components (e.g. business critical systems such as SCADA \u2013 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, smart grids and smart meters) increasingly integrated in the Group\u2019s digital life, have made it necessary to configure a structured cyber security system. This leads to the need for a new cyber defense model based on a systemic vision that integrates the IT sector (starting from the cloud down to the data center and mobile phone), the OT (everything concerning industrial sector, such as generation plant remote control) and the IoT (extension of communication and artificial intelligence to the world of things).\n\nThrough the monitoring systems, CERT collects 3 billion events every day relating to the company\u2019s assets from 6 thousand data sources, correlates them through automatic analysis, and produces a hundred \u201cincidents\u201d on average. The incidents are classified based on the Enel Cyber Impact Matrix (on a scale of 0 to 4), making use of the best events correlation capabilities thanks to the adoption of highly advanced services.\n\nThe vast majority of \u201cincidents\u201d are classified as 0/1; these have no significant impact on Group systems and are automatically or semi-automatically blocked and/or managed by the existing company defenses, preventing and/or mitigating the impact of potential cyber-attacks.\n\nIncidents classified as 2/3/4 have a potential impact on the Group and are managed by CERT analysts, involving any affected stakeholders. Thanks to the protection services, CERT intercepts 1.5 million at risk emails, 47 viruses, 165 web portal attacks, and 1.2 million connections to harmful websites every day.\n\nIf a cyber security incident involves a possible data breach, the appropriate and necessary actions are taken immediately, in line with the specific Group policy on \u201cPersonal Data Breach Management\u201d. Should a crisis situation arise that threatens the Enel Group\u2019s business continuity, assets, reputation and/or profitability, the appropriate actions are taken immediately, in line with the specific Group policy on \u201cCritical events management\u201d.\n\nIn 2021 Enel CERT responded to: 175 cyber security incidents with impact level 2; 31 incidents with impact level 3; and zero incidents with the highest impact level of 4.\n\nIn the cases detected, to ensure an efficient and rapid response and minimize the impact on people, services and assets, all the relevant management procedures have been put in place.\n\nSpecifically, when a cyber security incident translates into a potential data breach, the necessary actions are taken immediately, in line with the Enel Group \u201cPersonal Data Breach Management\u201d policy.\n\nMoreover, the \u201cIT Service Continuity Management\u201d policy formalizes a process to bring the risk affecting the availability of IT infrastructure down to an acceptable level, support to business continuity requirements, and restore IT services based on the results deriving from a Business Impact Analysis when a severe interruption occurs, including when caused by an incident.\n\nIn 2021 we adopted EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) technology \u2013 a solution to block violations, and which uses innovative features and advanced paradigms not only to block viruses and malware on endpoints, but also to detect individual suspicious behaviors that could prove to be part of an attempted attack.\n\nDetailed below is the number of cyber security events recorded in 2021.\n\n| 2021 | Total number of cyber security breaches or other cyber security incidents(1) | 0 |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|\n|      | Total amount of fines/sanctions paid related to cyber security breaches or other cyber security incidents | 0 |\n|      | Total number of customers and employees impacted by data breaches affecting the Group | 0 |\n|      | Total number of data breaches(2) | 0 |\n\n(1) The value reported for the KPI \u201cTotal number of cyber security breaches or other cyber security incidents\u201d refers to Level 4 incidents.\n\n(2) The KPI \u201cTotal number of data breaches\u201d refers to the number of events that occurred as a result of a cyber security incident (i.e. the number reported does not include any disclosures occurring as a result of non-digital incidents).\n\nFurthermore, in order to boost our capacity to prevent, react to and manage incidents, cyber exercises simulating a real attack were carried out, involving staff working in the production environments. At the end of each exercise, reports were produced containing details of the actions taken during the simulation, to assess \u2013 with a view to continuous improvement \u2013 the quality and completeness of the materials provided to help with decision-making, the execution times for each phase, and how well the procedures had been followed.\nMain projects and initiatives\n\nAll cyber security projects, programs, and initiatives are designed to avoid, mitigate or remediate cyber security risks for the entire Group. As a result, all activities are managed with a risk-based approach following the security by design principle to ensure a continuous due diligence process that also includes self-assurance activities. The most notable projects are detailed below.\n\n\u201cCERT \u2013 Risk Monitoring extension\u201d\n\n- In the last quarter of 2020, CERT began to develop new functionalities using the higher potential of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to help boost cyber threat detection capabilities and automate the analysis and incident response process. In 2021, the first use cases were activated, such as the automatic identification and blocking of malicious IPs that make repeated attack attempts against Enel applications.\n\n\u201cEndpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solution adoption\u201d\n\n- A platform which uses a unified set of cloud-delivered technologies to prevent all types of attacks, including malware, and which boosts the ability to block and detect individual suspicious behaviors that could be part of an attempted attack.\n\n\u201cMulti Factor Authentication (MFA)\u201d\n\n- Is a cloud solution used to enforce the identification method for users during the authentication procedure. Adopting MFA enables a person accessing a system to identify himself/herself through a second authentication factor via SMS or an app installed on his/her smartphone. The MFA solution enables regulatory compliance and is strongly recommended to counter emerging threats of theft of credentials, including those using social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing or potential user behavior not in line with policy). Adoption for internal users was completed during 2021.\n\nTheRedPill\n\n- The Group\u2019s platform that allows the improvement of training initiatives and simulated phishing campaigns; it aims to raise awareness of the main cyber security issues, address any upskilling and reskilling needs and teach how to defend against possible attacks. Four global simulated phishing campaigns, a knowledge assessment and an awareness campaign were launched in 2021 \u2013 the year the platform was released.\n\nAssurance checks (Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Assessment)\n\n- These activities are carried out on an ongoing basis both using automated tools and manually, to assess and quantify any weaknesses in IT, OT and IoT environments (applications, systems, IoT devices, architectures and/or infrastructures). Following these checks, we can identify the best measures to eliminate or mitigate the detected vulnerabilities or threats and, consequently, the elimination of the potential concretization of malicious exploits associated.\nCollaborations with external bodies and agencies\n\nIn line with the Open Power approach, we believe that networking with external entities and organizations is a key element in the cyber security strategy, to share best practices and operational models, develop and strengthen information sharing channels, and help define standards and regulations. In 2021, we provided feedback in public consultations to help draw up cyber security regulations, including by drafting legislations, promoting a harmonization of the current regulatory landscape, and implementing a risk-based approach and the principle of security by design. Collaborations carried out during the last year also aim to construct more homogeneous structures for defining the taxonomy of security incidents, more organic criteria for their classification, as well as more harmonious notification procedures in European contexts. Moreover, taking into account the context of regulatory compliance, no cases of non-compliance with standards or cyber security regulations were detected in 2021.\n\nIn recent years, a solid network has been established and developed by interacting with key stakeholders in the energy sector such as ANEEL (Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Energia El\u00e9trica) and ONS (Operador Nacional do Sistema El\u00e9trico) in Brazil and CNO (Consejo Nacional de Operaci\u00f3n) in Colombia. We took part, for example, in the Confindustria Digitale team, which aims to help develop the Italian digital ecosystem, we participated in the working groups of the World Economic Forum, and contributed in recent years to the publication of several reports including \u201cCyber Resilience in the Electricity Ecosystem: Securing the Value Chain\u201d and \u201cCyber Resilience in the Electricity Industry: Analysis and Recommendations on Regulatory Practices for the Public and Private Sectors\u201d.\n\nTraining and information\n\nThe \u201cCyber Security Awareness Program\u201d has become a constant and ongoing initiative at Group level, which aims to disseminate our cyber security culture and raise awareness of threats and attacks that exploit the human vector. Building culture is key to boosting corporate defense, the latter being also conveyed by the way people operate. The \u201cRules of Behavior for Digital People\u201d policy, released in 2020, is available in four different languages and was updated in 2021. It serves as a code of conduct for all Enel people, to safeguard their digital identity, disentangle themselves in the world of social media, and report potential incidents.\n\nIn 2021, we held 18 knowledge sharing events on cyber security issues. Bulletins and news were created and disseminated through the company intranet and documents were made available to keep up to date on these issues. The Open Tech Journey project continued to provide access to training courses focused on technological topics, promoting internal skills to spread awareness of strategic topics and manage upskilling and reskilling needs. This was the background to the creation of the Cyber School, which delivered eight courses on the main cyber security topics. The first set of courses were delivered in a virtual classroom (four courses in 2020 and four in 2021, now seven as per the compaction of two courses with converging themes in one). To make the initiative constant and always usable, all courses in 2021 were engineered and made available to the entire Enel population in the e-learning format.\n## Circular economy\n\n### Priorities\n- Economic and financial value creation\n- Innovation, circular economy and digital transformation\n\n### Plan\n- **GROWTH ACCELERATORS**\n  - Circular economy\n\n### Targets\n\n| Activities | 2021-2023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022-2024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Circularity improvement | 86% by 2030 | 62% | | 92% by 2030<sup>(1)</sup> | I | E |\n| Strategic circular economy projects to reduce raw materials consumption | Definition and application of circular economy solutions and new business models focused on key technologies | Implementation of new circular smart meter solution, analysis of new technologies for wind blade recycling, redesign of photovoltaic panels, evaluation of recycling solutions for electric vehicles batteries, deployment of new electric charging stations (with recycled plastic), photovoltaic panels reuse | | 15 projects in the period 2022-2024<sup>(2)</sup> | I | E |\n\n### Find out more\n\nThe **circularity improvement** index measures the reduction of materials and fuel consumption of the Group\u2019s power fleet throughout the life cycle, compared to 2015.\n\n**Strategic circular economy projects** and the related solutions developed are focused on key technologies such as wind power, photovoltaics, smart meters, electric vehicle charging stations, batteries.\n\n---\n\n<sup>(1)</sup> The target for 2024 is 77%.\n\n<sup>(2)</sup> Seven of these projects are included in Innovation projects.\n| Activities                                                                 | 2021\u20132023 targets                                                                 | 2021 results                                                                 | Status                                                                 | 2022\u20132024 targets                                                                 | Tag | SDG |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|\n| Definition and application of suitable industrial and financial circularity metrics to support and enhance circular economy activities, engaging the respective business areas | \u2022 Stat of data collection for Group financial/industrial KPIs                      | \u2022 Started the fine tuning for the Financial/Industrial KPIs, the data collection and the definition of the process to include them in the sustainability reporting | Definition of the Group\u2019s financial/industrial objectives on the circular economy in 2022 | \u2022 Defined a circularity KPI for the investment evaluation process and ongoing definition of circularity metrics for finance | I   | 12  |\n| \u2022 Consolidation and adoption of potential other specific KPIs for Business Lines/ Countries in 2021 | \u2022 Improved process for circular KPI calculation for CEO Business Review, also including Business Lines and Countries | \u2022 Improved process for circular KPI calculation for CEO Business Review, also including Business Lines and Countries | \u2022 Improved process for circular KPI calculation for CEO Business Review, also including Business Lines and Countries | \u2022 Improved process for circular KPI calculation for CEO Business Review, also including Business Lines and Countries | E   |     |\n| \u2022 Definition of the Group\u2019s financial/industrial objectives on the circular economy in 2022 | \u2022 Definition of the Group\u2019s financial/industrial objectives on the circular economy in 2022 | \u2022 Definition of the Group\u2019s financial/industrial objectives on the circular economy in 2022 | \u2022 Definition of the Group\u2019s financial/industrial objectives on the circular economy in 2022 | \u2022 Definition of the Group\u2019s financial/industrial objectives on the circular economy in 2022 |     |     |\n| Strengthening of partnerships and collaborations with cities and other public entities (e.g., region, metropolitan areas, etc.) on circular economy | Strengthening partnerships and collaborations with international networks, companies from other sectors, external players focused on the development of \u201ccircular cities\u201d | Members of: Ellen MacArthur Foundation;

With this in mind, for years we\u2019ve been working to constantly rethink our activities, leveraging innovation not only in terms of technology but also in business models, across the whole value chain. We have also been revisiting various internal Company processes with a coordinated approach, supported by solid material and economic metrics.\n\nAdopting a circular approach means decoupling business and resource consumption by reducing the use of finite natural resources, avoiding waste and maintaining the value of goods and materials. This way we can create environmental benefits not only in terms of reducing emissions throughout the value chain, but also by lowering all kinds of impacts, from the consumption of natural resources, including water, through to waste generation and the loss of biodiversity.\n\nWe need to leverage all pillars of the circular economy: reducing the consumption of non-renewable resources and maximizing the value of those already in use and of the goods produced, and extending their life by recovering resources at the end of their lifecycle. Moreover, shifting from a linear model to a circular one, i.e. from a model based on resource extraction, production and consumption that is strongly reliant on automation, to one based on maintaining the value of products and goods through design, repair, service, reverse logistics and recycling, allows for much higher value to be placed on human labor.\nIn this context, digitization becomes an enabler of circularity, by developing initiatives for circular management of IT assets (e.g. life extension and reuse of devices, product as a service models, such as the cloud for data center management, etc.), as well as digital solutions to support circular business models (such as machine learning techniques geared towards predictive maintenance, digital management of information on materials, etc.).\n\nLastly, the circular economy provides opportunities in terms of business competitiveness thanks to a better use of resources, lower risks tied to the dependence on raw materials (critical resources\\(^{(1)}\\) in particular) and extended supply chains, new revenues associated with services and asset enhancement, and a constant focus on innovation in each area of activity.\n\nThe governance of the circular economy\n\nTo ensure an organic and effective circular transition and strategy implementation, specific areas have been created in Enel\u2019s various Business Lines and geographical areas, coordinated by a Holding area so as to ensure a coordinated approach towards strategies, to share knowledge and experience and to help integrate circular economy principles into daily choices and activities. In particular, the Business Lines are redesigning or developing business models with a circular approach, while the units at country level are providing support locally to create new business opportunities in collaboration with the local ecosystem.\n\nGroup circularity targets and indicators\n\nOne of the main challenges for the effective implementation of a circular economy model is setting criteria and metrics to be able to distinguish between circular and non-circular solutions, measure their environmental, economic and social impacts, set objectives and understand the levers for improvement.\n\nThe Group\u2019s commitment to measuring circularity began in 2017 when it developed a metrics model, the \u201cCircularAbility\u00ae Model\u201d, which takes into account all five pillars of the circular economy i.e. circular inputs, product as a service, sharing platforms, life extension, and new life cycles, taking a quantitative approach in both the material and energy components. The model was shared with other companies and institutions so as to make a proactive contribution to the dialog, becoming a key point of reference in this area. To date, its application is being extended to company assets, suppliers and end customers.\n\nIn order to accurately measure circularity, the Group is increasingly analyzing how its resource consumption is evolving in its various business activities. In line with the resources\u2019 productivity indicators, established also by Eurostat, we measure the consumption of material by service for its entire service life. In terms of generation capacities, the consumption of resources throughout the life cycle of the production plants is measured: from the raw materials extracted through to the materials consumed as well as the energy used in the manufacturing, operation and decommissioning phases. This aggregate value is then compared to the energy produced over the entire service life.\n\nWe have set ourselves the target of improving circularity by 92% by 2030 (compared to 2015) for the whole-life consumption of materials and fuels in our power generating capacity. This circularity indicator is associated with the electric generation park and is an addition to the existing indicators on direct emissions, making it possible to monitor the evolution of the whole-life material consumption per MWh generated over the years, measuring consumption along the entire life cycle: from generation up to the decommissioning of the generation assets.\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Defined as \u201ccritical\u201d (or essential) for the user country\u2019s economic system and the supply risks tied to the geographical focus (and respective geopolitical risk) of the various stages of the supply chain. These kinds of lists are published by the United States, Japan, the European Union and Australia for example.\nThe Group\u2019s circularity performance is analyzed in terms of its contribution to the main environmental indicators (emissions, water consumption, resource consumption) and the Group\u2019s economic performance. More generally, as the circular economy is also closely tied to the creation of economic value and not just environmental value, we are also working to establish hybrid metrics, such as \u201cCircular EBITDA\u201d, which can be correlated to both aspects \u2013 analyses and results that are periodically presented to Top Management.\n\nFor all Group investments tied to the development of physical assets, a circularity KPI is assessed, which takes into account whole-life material consumption compared to industrial performance (energy produced in the case of power plants for example).\n\n### The involvement of the ecosystem\n\nA circularity-based business model requires the utmost collaboration between all players involved. That\u2019s why we consider it essential to open up to dialog with parties who share this vision, involving the supply chains and promoting common initiatives to safeguard natural resources and boost the ecosystem\u2019s competitiveness. Indeed, a circular solution cannot be found by looking only within a company or its area of activity; rather it is necessary to explore synergies with other areas that the company has perhaps never interacted with in the past.\n\nEnel is part of a global coalition, the Capital Equipment Coalition, which engages leading companies on the topic of circular economy. Since 2017, together with many other Italian companies from different sectors, Enel has also launched the Alliance for the Circular Economy, and in 2020 it launched a similar initiative in Spain. Enel is also present and active in several networks such as Ellen MacArthur Foundation, European Remanufacturing Council, and the Italian Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform.\n\nTo fully develop a circular business, it is necessary to adapt the way we relate to the outside world, and to review our usual negotiation and contractual models and the typical figures of a legal system that had previously been geared towards an economically linear world. In 2021, in order to identify and remove regulatory or negotiation barriers to circularity, we launched an in-depth regulatory-contractual analysis in collaboration with the legal Functions of the Business Lines and countries. We aim to identify innovative contractual solutions and standards to support circular business models and, if necessary, put forward proposals for regulatory interventions to help develop the circular economy in the various countries. This can be achieved by enhancing the value of existing goods and products, supporting new models such as recycling, and through product as a service or sharing, to unlock new development potential in terms of new business opportunities and new professional skills.\n\n### A new circular culture\n\nA transformation such as the transition towards a circular economy model also requires a commitment in terms of new skills, work methods and integration. We use our experience and knowledge to create informational and educational content to share with stakeholders both inside and outside the Company.\n\nWe organize internal training and information activities, such as the Circular Economy School, which engaged about 430 Enel people, staff and Business Lines in Europe and Latin America, each lasting two weeks. The topics covered cut across various professional areas in order to fuel a discussion on technological, process, business model, contractual, regulatory and institutional issues, etc. The first \u201cCircular Economy Open School\u201d was also held in Latin America (8 meetings between June and November), which was attended by Enel staff and over 200 external guests. Various communities were also created to support activities and promote the culture and best practices of the circular economy across all areas. The communities were given thematic webinars (cities, social impacts, finance, etc.)\nto support their participation in the activities. In total, more than 1,000 participants were involved in the programs. Another key element is e-circular, an in-house company platform to promote people\u2019s \u201ccircular\u201d behavior, thereby helping to connect at a personal level what the Group is doing in its business. The platform can be used to offer goods, search for items and make skills available. Moreover, e-circular is a reference point for all of the circular culture initiatives we are promoting through information, news and multimedia content.\n\nLastly, Enel puts young talents to the test on the circular economy and innovation by way of two programs, which involved more than 8 thousand young people in 2021:\n\n- PlayEnergy, directed outside the Company, involves young innovators between the ages of 7 and 18 to seek solutions for a better future, making use of their creativity and imagination;\n- We are Energy, a program targeted exclusively at the children (aged 7 to 18) of Enel people in all countries where we operate. The 2021 edition, entitled ReciproCity, focused on circular, inclusive and sustainable cities.\n\nEnergy transition and raw materials\n\nWhile the transformation of the energy system will reduce fossil fuel consumption, it will also require the use of up to six times more minerals in 2050 compared to today. The new technologies will in fact require \u201ctraditional\u201d materials such as steel, copper or aluminum, as well as previously less used raw materials, the so-called critical materials, such as lithium, cobalt, rare earths and especially silicon used in photovoltaic modules.\n\nWe are committed to significantly reducing resource consumption by 2030, even though the use of non-combustible raw materials is set to increase in the coming years (see the \u201cGroup circularity targets and indicators\u201d section in this chapter). Adopting a circular and sustainable model as an integral part of the energy transition process will allow us to lower our dependence on raw materials as much as possible, particularly on critical raw materials, ensuring not only the competitiveness of the business model, but also full social and environmental sustainability across the chain.\n\nSince 2020, an ad hoc working group has been set up, involving all of Enel\u2019s relevant areas, to constantly update the strategy, set priorities and targets, guarantee an integrated approach to the issue, develop skills, and ensure an extensive implementation of projects throughout the chain to achieve the set objectives. In particular, the working group has specific areas of focus, such as analyzing the supply chains of raw materials, defining a homogeneous taxonomy of materials and raw materials, identifying environmental and social impacts throughout the value chain (particularly in relation to human rights) and adopting solutions to ensure sustainability, ranking raw materials by priority and making ad hoc plans for key materials, defining strategies to reduce geopolitical, commodity, environmental and social risks, as well as new technologies and business models. All these focus areas are carried out by comparing and examining the best practices of each industrial sector, monitoring and analyzing the market trends associated with raw materials for key technological sectors (wind, solar, batteries, networks, etc.) and by collaborating regularly with all relevant stakeholders.\n\nThis involves rethinking all phases, identifying renewable or recycled raw materials and assessing whether to replace the most critical materials with new ones. The plants must be designed in such a way as to extend their life, by identifying models of use to make the most of the plants, and regenerate those at the end of their service life. Where this is not possible, the raw materials must be recycled and reused, considering also the key role of digital infrastructures.\n\nTo achieve these goals, Enel is carrying out a major plan of activities with its suppliers, the innovation ecosystem, companies and major institutions.\n\nA number of innovative projects have also been carried out to use second-life batteries from the automotive sector or in power generation plants (Second Life Battery Project in Melilla) or to create energy storage systems (PI-ONEER project) for example. The Photorama project aims to automate the process of dismantling solar panels and recovering valuable materials. New smart meters are also being designed and manufactured using materials recovered from replaced smart meters at the end of their lifecycle (Circular smart meters).\n\nIn terms of institutional partnerships, in July 2021 Enel was the first utility company to join the European Raw Material Alliance (ERMA) \u2013 an initiative launched by the European Union in late 2020 to ensure access to all raw materials needed to achieve the vision of Europe\u2019s Green New Deal.\nCircular cities\n\nEnel has been working on the topic of circular cities for some years now, with the awareness that cities\u2019 evolution towards circularity does not depend on individual technologies or individual sectors, but requires a cross-cutting vision, integrated strategies, clear economic, environmental and social objectives, as well as open governance.\n\nCities are in fact responsible for approximately 80% of global GDP, and are also the areas where global challenges are most critical, since they contribute to more than two thirds of emissions and of the world-wide consumption of natural resources, and produce half of the planet\u2019s waste, with trends continuing to rise as the urban population is expected to grow through to 2050.\n\nAccording with the circular city approach, technologies and innovation play a central role. Solutions ranging from renewable energies through to transportation electrification and building consumption, from digitalization through to the way people use them, can help introduce a new paradigm that\u2019s capable of lowering global and local environmental impacts and improving the quality of life for citizens by enabling access to new services and job opportunities. However, technology alone is not enough: it must be part of an overall and integrated vision of how the city should evolve, one that engages all stakeholders and translates into clear and concrete benefits for citizens.\n\nFor this reason, Enel\u2019s contribution towards this vision of the city is not limited to business solutions and services, but is also aimed at building knowledge, collaboration and sharing on the issue with institutions and all entities working towards the same goal in the urban context.\n\nBearing in mind how important it is to engage cities directly and for them to take responsibility in leading the transition, in October 2021 Enel (together with CEPAL and IILA) backed the creation and launch of the \u201cDeclaration of Circular Cities of Latin America and the Caribbean\u201d to encourage the participation of cities wishing to accelerate their transition towards a circular and more sustainable urban model. To date, the Declaration has already been signed by four capitals (Lima, Santiago, Buenos Aires, Mexico City) and many other cities in Latin America, demonstrating the importance placed on the circular approach in local development policies.\n\nIn 2021, Enel also published the fourth edition of the study on circular cities, which was carried out with the Enel Foundation and Arup to highlight \u2013 by analyzing possible circular interventions in the main sectors of urban life \u2013 the impact of adopting circular economy principles in cities in terms of reducing emissions and improving quality of life and resilience. The study \u201cCircular Cities - Decarbonization and Other Benefits\u201d is available at: https://www.enel.com/content/dam/enel-com/documenti/azienda/storie/circular-cities_december2021.pdf.\nCircular activities throughout the value chain\n\nIn order to systematically apply a circular approach, Enel is working across the board, through all of its business areas, to involve suppliers and customers and ensure a structured and effective approach when rethinking its business model. The main areas of activity are supplier relations and asset and customer management.\n\nSuppliers\n\nEnel\u2019s circular procurement strategy is divided into the following steps:\n\n\u2022 engaging suppliers: including rewarding K-factors or requirements in the bidding phase to increasingly engage suppliers in their transition towards the circular economy;\n\u2022 setting metrics and measuring environmental impacts of what is acquired, using the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and developing IT systems to provide support. At global level, approximately 200 suppliers are currently involved in 13 strategic product categories, accounting for more than 50% of the expense for purchasing materials; certification is being applied (Carbon Footprint, for example) for the remaining categories, works and services;\n\u2022 co-innovation: launching projects with suppliers to jointly redesign the lifecycle of goods, including by modifying customer requirements.\n\nAsset\n\nThe circular approach is applied through all of the main phases of assets\u2019 lifecycle (power plants, electrical grids, etc.): from the planning (design and input material selections), implementation (management of construction site phases) and operation (maintenance geared toward extending their service life) through to decommissioning (management of areas, equipment, materials and infrastructures to identify new lifecycles through reuse, upcycling, remanufacturing, recycling, etc.).\n\nSolar\n\nAt our 3SUN factory, we are experimenting with the possibility of introducing recycled materials into the production process, including by completely overhauling the photovoltaic module to increase its circularity. We are designing panels with above-average conversion efficiency in order to reduce the amount of materials consumed and the amount of land occupied per kWh of energy produced. The recycling rate of photovoltaic modules is already one of the highest out of the electrical and electronic equipment available on the market, with recovery percentages of their materials (glass, aluminum and copper) ranging from 80% to 90% of the total weight of the module itself. Existing recycling technologies, however, do not yet make it possible to recover the more precious or rare elements contained inside the modules, such as silicon or silver. This is why Enel is investing in innovation projects to test new technologies for recovering the most precious or rare elements. These projects will not only further increase recycling percentages to close to 100%,\nbut will also regenerate high-quality, pure materials with high added value, which can be reused in industrial processes, thereby reducing the need to extract new natural resources.\n\n**Wind**\n\nIn order to make the wind power industry more circular, we are working with start-ups and major players to promote the development of new, more sustainable, high-performance and recyclable materials. For example, we are studying new wind turbine towers made entirely of wood, which are lighter, easier to transport and make a negative contribution to CO\u2082 emissions, as well as new models of wind turbine blades using textile materials typically used in the nautical sector. Around 90% of a wind turbine is made up of metal, which can be easily recycled. Blades, on the other hand, are made mainly of composite materials, and recovering them is not currently very effective or efficient due to the lack of an established supply chain for both the reprocessing of this type of waste and the subsequent reuse of potentially recoverable materials. For this reason, we are evaluating innovative technologies to reuse wind blades at the end of their service life, exploring cross-sectoral collaborations, such as the possibility of reusing materials recovered from the construction sector.\n\n**Energy storage**\n\nProjects are being rolled out in the field of energy storage systems to identify innovative technological solutions and alternatives to chemical storage that could mitigate the consumption of critical materials, such as flow batteries, new chemicals not based on critical materials, new non-electrochemical storage technologies. Innovative technical solutions to extend the life of batteries are also being tested, such as Second Life Battery Project in Melilla. Pilot plants are also being designed to systematize and promote battery recycling, such as the Compostilla project, which aims to construct an industrial-scale pilot plant to recycle automotive batteries on the site of a decommissioned thermal power plant in Spain. The plant will have to address the logistics phases of collection, selection and directing of batteries for immediate reuse or disassembly, where the batteries will be treated and disassembled to extract valuable materials such as cobalt, nickel and lithium that are suitable for use in the battery production cycle.\n\n---\n\n**Energy transition and raw materials**\n\n\u201cThe technologies we need to decarbonize the planet must also be sustainable in terms of raw materials. To make this possible, we apply the circular economy throughout the goods\u2019 lifecycle: from the design or purchase stages through to their use and then reuse in a new cycle at the end of their service life. For batteries for example, we can extend their life further with the Melilla project, and then recover the materials to use them in new batteries.\u201d\n\n---\n\nNicoletta Dante\nHead of Circular Economy Projects & Initiatives\nIn 2021, the two main areas of focus were to include a circular approach in the design phase, and to regenerate materials from end-of-life assets.\n\n**Circular by design**\n\nRight from the earliest stages of the network asset planning, a \u201ccircular by design\u201d approach was adopted so that the design of the assets and materials used could be revisited with a sustainable vision. This approach has made it possible to experiment with new solutions to ensure lower consumption of polluting materials, including cement. Solutions were explored in Chile and Colombia where concrete recovered from old poles served as the basis for generating new poles to be installed from 2022. In Brazil, Colombia and Spain, the project to decontaminate oil from PCBs and regenerate it for use in the grid or other industrial supply chains continued into 2021, leading to a profit of 2.63 million euros and savings of 3.8 kt of CO\u2082, extending the service life of existing assets.\n\n**Grid mining**\n\nIn order to maximize material recovery at the end of the lifecycle, Enel is applying a strategy called \u201cgrid mining\u201d, which considers grid assets as a \u2018mine\u2019 of materials that can be recovered and reintroduced into the production cycle. Starting with the analysis of the value chain, new business processes are being geared towards recovering precious and rare metals from obsolete infrastructures. The goal is to minimize environmental impacts by aiming to reuse and regenerate materials at the end of their service life, maximize positive impacts at a local level, and create open ecosystems to boost the solutions\u2019 scalability. To this end, we are working to develop a materials passport and improve the tracking system for disused assets to improve their end-of-life management in terms of economy and circularity. This has paved the way for the end-of-life material sales initiatives, generating revenues of around 27 million euros and CO\u2082 savings of around 48.8 kt by 2021.\n\nThe first grid mining project was the \u201cCircular Open Meter\u201d, launched in Italy and Brazil, recovering polycarbonate from decommissioned meters to create new ones. As part of the plan to replace first-generation meters, 80,000 pieces of Circular Open Meters were produced in Italy by 2021. The successful experience of the circular smart meter has also led us to weigh up the possibility of reducing the use of virgin material, and using the same material from the meters to design new street boxes, thanks to the challenge launched last year on the Open Innovability\u00ae platform where 3 out of the 71 solutions received awards.\n\nThe new goal is to open up our mine also to the outside world by making it available to other companies or different sectors so as to involve their respective production chains, feed new markets for raw and secondary materials, and promote local development and new job opportunities with initiatives for recovering waste materials (see also the chapter \u201cThe decade of electrification and customer centricity\u201d).\nA new operating model has been launched which Global Energy and Commodity Management is applying in its various Business Lines to improve asset management strategies with a view to circularity, both from a financial perspective and in terms of traceability and cycle closure indicators.\n\nProjects with a greater innovative impact are running alongside our business-as-usual activities. These include the waste management project in Spain and the decommissioning of thermal plants in Italy. In 2021, the first pilot projects began in Spain, producing more effective uses for almost 100 thousand tons of recovered material.\n\nCustomers\n\nWe engage customers on one hand by offering them products and services that are increasingly circular and, on the other, for industrial customers and government bodies, by helping them measure and improve their own circularity.\n\nIn 2021, Enel X Global Retail continued its efforts to spur the market towards high standards that may serve as an example and driving force for other companies, both suppliers and customers.\n\nSustainability Boosting Program \u2013 Circular Economy Score\n\nEnel X Global Retail provides special innovative consultancy tools to support companies and government bodies with establishing and implementing sustainability paths. The entire process \u2013 which is unique in terms of its completeness and innovation \u2013 is called the \u201cSustainability Boosting Program\u201d and is aimed at promoting circularity and social inclusion.\n\nThe starting point of the Sustainability Boosting Program as for circular economy is the Circular Economy Score, which measures the starting level of circularity of the solutions in the portfolio. By the end of 2021, more than 50 solutions in four countries had already been assessed. The calculation method is based on the CirculAbility\u00ae Model and is being updated to take into account the provisions of the LCA (Life Cycle Assessment). For each product, the supply chain that precedes and follows it is analyzed to identify measures that can boost the circularity of the product itself. This is followed by the \u201ccircular intelligence\u201d phase (analysis of the market context, scouting for innovations and start-ups) to identify opportunities to boost the circularity of the various solutions, which ultimately completes the Circular Economy Boosting Program. One application was the JuiceBox \u2013 Enel X Global Retail\u2019s private electric re-\ncharging solution \u2013 which resulted in a process being established to reuse plastic from disused Group products in order to produce the outer casing of JuiceBoxes, resulting in savings of almost 24 tons of polycarbonate and over 150 tons of CO\u2082 in 2021.\n\nCircular Economy Score Client Report (CE Report)\n\nIn 2021, approximately 170 CE Reports were completed, supplying customer companies with solutions which, if adopted, can generate potential yearly savings of more than 17,000 tons of CO\u2082 and 76 GWh of energy. One example is the collaboration with Genagricola, which after this assessment became the first Italian zero impact farm. This company, with 8,000 hectares cultivated in 22 sites across Italy, used the CE Report to measure the level of circular maturity of its activities and identify tools to start the process of full decarbonization. The use of renewables, better energy management and circular enablers will enable an environmental impact reduction in terms of CO\u2082 equal to 12,000 thousand tons for the next 20 years, thanks only to energy-related interventions. This collaboration stands as an example of international best practice, and has also been included in the \u201cNet Zero Industrial Clusters\u201d report published by the World Economic Forum.\n\nMonitor for Circular Fashion\n\nEnel X Global Retail has also launched, in collaboration with SDA Bocconi Sustainability, the Monitor for Circular Fashion project, with the aim of providing an accurate and dynamic overview of the state of the circular economy in the Italian fashion sector. The first report dedicated to the sector\u2019s macro-trends and the companies\u2019 ability to apply circular economy principles across the value chain was completed in 2021, involving 14 ingredient brands, brands & retailers and service providers from the Italian fashion sector. The evidence from the energy analysis showed that the current emissions of the companies involved in the study amounted to 146,448 tCO\u2082 and could be significantly reduced (~30%) thanks to policies to supply electricity from renewable sources and through investment in self-generation plants.\n\nCircular Economy PA (Public Administration) Report\n\nTo spur government bodies towards a more sustainable and circular approach, Enel X has developed an assessment model (CE Report PA) to evaluate the level of circular maturity of municipalities and identify a series of solutions to be introduced into a roadmap of concrete interventions with a local impact. This assessment is performed on two levels of analysis: at entire urban/city perimeter level; and for one or more specific sites (buildings and public structures) with a focus on energy circularity.\n\nCircular City Index\n\nIn 2021, the Circular City Index also became available in Italy \u2013 an innovative tool to measure the level of urban circularity of municipalities and identify areas of strength and improvement. The index was developed in collaboration with the Department of Economics and Statistics of the University of Siena and is based exclusively on open data. It is available free of charge to all of Italy\u2019s nearly 8 thousand municipalities as of September 2021. Four areas are analyzed to establish the level of urban circularity: digitalization, environment and energy, mobility, and waste. Each of these are given specific scores (based on comparisons with national and European regulations or guidelines) to assess to what extent policies and infrastructures have been adopted to enable the town or city to start a transition towards a circular economy.\nMarket units play a fundamental role in customer relations by constantly focusing on their needs, and committing to provide quality products and services. Four key lines of action have been established:\n\n- **Customer Relationship**: to create a new circular relationship with our customers by leveraging digitalization and new business models. New digital solutions can reduce material consumption, and new business models (such as sharing Enel spaces with partners and customers) can increase the use factor of the spaces themselves, promoting new types of relationships;\n\n- **Circular Offer**: to design services that make our customers\u2019 consumption circular, including offers geared towards renewable energy and services to consume energy more efficiently or extend the assets\u2019 service life;\n\n- **Customer Behavior**: to create a new way of interacting with our customers and raise their awareness of environmental issues in order to make their behavior more circular, e.g. through loyalty programs, campaigns and specific engagement initiatives;\n\n- **Partnerships**: to accelerate circularity through partnerships and joint projects with other companies, municipalities, etc.\n\nThese levers were then converted into specific projects in the various countries where we operate, such as:\n\n- **GEA (Iberia)**: a participatory platform to exchange views on social and environmental issues, which lets customers participate in sustainability and circularity projects to improve the community and the planet. The pilot project engaged around 10 thousand customers;\n\n- **Digital Register Email (Italy)**: this initiative was developed in collaboration with a technology partner (Info-cert) and provides customers with a temporary certified email to ensure secure receipt of formal notifications. Replacing physical mailing with digital delivery also produces a positive impact by saving tons of paper and CO\u2082.\n## Occupational health and safety\n\n### Priorities\n- Economic and financial value creation\n- Occupational health and safety\n\n### Plan\n\n#### Targets\n\n| Activities | 2021-2023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022-2024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Safety Extra Checking on Site (ECoS)\\(^1\\) | 150 ECoS on health and safety and environment in 2023 | 279 ECoS on health and safety and environment carried out | | 80 Safety ECoS in 2024 | S | 3 |\n| Safety Contractor Assessment\\(^2\\) | 300 Contractor Assessments and Support on health and safety and environment in 2023 | 1,514 Contractor Assessments and Support on health and safety and environment | | 802 Safety Contractor Assessment in 2024 | S | 3 |\n| Reduction of injury frequency rates compared to prior years (LTIFR) | 0.65 (+25% vs 2020)\\(^3\\) | 0.61 in 2024 | | | S | 3 |\n| Training hours provided by SHE Factory | | | +1% training hours (compared to previous year) | | S | 3 |\n| Strengthening of horizontal initiatives on Business Lines and/or Countries aimed at growing the culture, awareness and commitment of employees and contractors with respect to health and safety issues | \u2022 Executed 104 inter Business Line activities (including ECoS, Safety Walk, etc.) \u2022 \u201cHSEQ\\(^2\\) Professional Family Days\u201d held \u2022 \u201cWelcome to HSEQ\\(^2\\)\u201d project dedicated to new resources \u2022 Stop Work Policy course provided by SHE Factory on Global perimeter | | Target outdated because replaced with specific quantitative targets | | S | 3 |\n\n---\n\n1.

We are committed to developing and disseminating a robust safety culture in order to guarantee a workplace that is free from health and safety hazards for everyone who works with and for the Group. The protection of health and safety of our people is the responsibility of every one of us.\n\nThe constant commitment of all, integration of safety in processes and in training activities, disclosure and analysis of near miss accidents, rigorous selection and management of contractor companies, continuous quality controls, sharing of experience and benchmarking with the top international players are the foundational elements of our safety culture.\n\nSince the start of the Covid-19 emergency in February 2020, we have taken action in order to protect the health of our colleagues and guarantee a continuous supply of electrical energy to the communities where we operate, which is an aspect that is even more crucial at a moment like this one. In order to face the progressive spreading of the pandemic, during 2021 we created a new organizational unit called Pandemic Emergency Management, targeted at ensuring the monitoring and management of emergency situations in all areas of our Group.\n\n2.86\nTotal Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRI FR) combined Enel and contractors\n\n0.65\nLost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTI FR) combined Enel and contractors\n\n279\nExtra Checking on Site (ECoS) safety and environment\n\n1,188\nthousand hours of training for Enel people\n\nTogether for safety\n\nEnel, and Infrastructure and Networks Italy in particular, have always been committed to promoting safety with particular reference to injury prevention. A conference day was organized on November 22, 2021 that covered safety topics, which was attended by people from Infrastructure and Networks Italy and contractor companies, who spoke about their experiences with injury events in which they were directly or indirectly involved. These experiences were used as a starting point for stimulating an in-depth and constructive analysis. In order to underline the importance of the event, all operating activities were suspended, with the exception of those assigned to personnel who are available for fault repair operations. More than 1,600 contributions were collected during the meeting, and a decalogue was prepared with the most significant phrases to make sure everyone is always paying attention to and promoting the safety of the people who work every day at the various job sites.\nOur commitment to safety\n\nThe head is the most important piece of PPE and I never forget to wear it.\n\nWhen in doubt, I choose certainty: 5 Rules, Zero Injuries\n\nI always share safety so that I never have to share an injury.\n\nTeamwork divides tasks and multiplies my safety.\n\nI take care of myself if I have the courage and humility to ask for help.\n\nIf I\u2019m not sure about something I ask, if I\u2019m uncertain I stop.\n\nI let timeframes be dictated by safety.\n\nI can do more for safety if I ask questions.\n\nI report near misses today to avoid injuries tomorrow.\n\nI do not play with safety, there\u2019s nothing to gain from it.\n\nThe health and safety system\n\nThe \u201cStatement of Commitment to Health and Safety\u201d and the \u201cStop Work Policy\u201d, both signed by the Chief Executive Officer, are two documents on which the commitment of our Group is based.\n\nThe Statement of Commitment is based on the following principles:\n\n\u2022 compliance with legislation, adoption of the best standards and sharing of experience;\n\u2022 creation, implementation and continual improvement of the Occupational Health and Safety Management System in compliance with international standard ISO 45001;\n\u2022 reduction of injuries, occupational diseases and other accidental events through the implementation of suitable preventive measures and checking of their adequacy and effectiveness;\n\u2022 assessment of all health and safety risks and adoption of a systematic approach to eliminate them at the source if possible, or to minimize them, while guaranteeing maximum protection for anyone working for Enel;\n\u2022 promotion of informative initiatives to disseminate and consolidate a culture of good health, safety and organizational well-being;\n\u2022 adoption of working methods inspired by quality and their dissemination by means of incisive and effective training that aims to create a lasting connection between technical aspects and safety aspects;\n\u2022 direct commitment of the persons in charge aimed at strengthening a robust culture of leadership in relation to safety;\n\u2022 adoption of safe and responsible conduct throughout all levels of the organization;\n\u2022 design of workplaces and supply of suitable equipment and tools for the execution of operating activities, guaranteeing optimal and the safest conditions;\n\u2022 rigorous selection and management of contractors and vendors, promoting their involvement in safety performance continual improvement programs;\n\u2022 constant attention towards communities and towards all those who work with or come into contact with the Group\u2019s activities by sharing a culture of health and safety protection;\n\u2022 annual definition of specific and measurable goals and continual monitoring to check their effective implementation through the involvement of Top Management.\n\nBased on the Stop Work Policy, our people are required to promptly report and/or interrupt any risky situation or unsafe behavior by internal or external personnel.\n\nIn line with the Code of Ethics, the Statement of Commitment and the Stop Work Policy, we have defined a specific Health & Safety Policy that requires every Group Business Line to have its own Health & Safety Management System in compliance with international standard ISO 45001.\n\nThe Management System is based on the identification of hazards, the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the risks, the planning and implementation of the preventive and protective measures, as well as checking their effectiveness, any corrective measures and the preparation of work teams. The Management System involves both Enel people and personnel from contractor companies who work at Enel\u2019s plants and sites, and is based on the following shared principles:\n\n\u2022 prior evaluation, elimination and/or reduction of risks through application of the latest technical know-how;\n\u2022 identification of the necessary preventive measures and the associated implementation program;\n\u2022 adoption of residual risk mitigation measures, awarding priority to collective rather than personal solutions;\n\u2022 active, responsible and integrated intervention of all\nparties concerned with safety, involving workers and/or workers\u2019 representatives, starting from the identification of risk situations up to the choice of solutions to prevent and/or reduce them;\n\u2022 appointment of a medical officer, when required, and setting up health surveillance for workers responsible for specific high-risk processes;\n\u2022 preparation of a program of information and training of workers in order to increase awareness when dealing with situations of risk;\n\u2022 regular upkeep and cleaning of workplaces;\n\u2022 the adoption of tools, also technological tools, to support the assessment of the risk and its resulting mitigation.\n\nFrom an organizational perspective, the Holding Health, Safety, Environment and Quality unit (HSEQ) assumes the roles of supervision, guidance and coordination, promoting the dissemination and sharing of best practices within the Group and external health and safety benchmarking with top international players in order to identify improvement opportunities and ensure constant commitment in the area of risk reduction.\nAlongside the Holding Function, the Global Business and Country Lines HSEQ structures orient and support the business in relation to health and safety issues, define improvement plans and monitor their execution.\n2021 performance\n\nCombined Enel and contractors\n\nTotal Recordable Injury (TRI)\n\n- 2021: 1,212\n- 2020: 1,308\n- 2019: 1,472\n\nTotal Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRI FR)(1)\n\n- 2021: 2.863\n- 2020: 3.243\n- 2019: 3.650\n\nFatalities (FAT)\n\n- 2021: 9\n- 2020: 9\n- 2019: 7\n\nFatalities Frequency Rate (FAT FR)\n\n- 2021: 0.021\n- 2020: 0.022\n- 2019: 0.017\n\nLife Changing Accidents (LCA)(2)\n\n- 2021: 4\n- 2020: 0\n- 2019: 2\n\nLife Changing Accidents Frequency Rate (LCA FR)\n\n- 2021: 0.009\n- 2020: 0.000\n- 2019: 0.005\n\n(1) This rate is calculated by proportioning the number of Recordable Injuries with hours worked/1,000,000. The Recordable Injuries represent all the events that caused physical damage to a person and are inclusive of the injuries that caused days of absence from work (LTI) and \u2018First Aid\u2019, i.e. injuries that did not require days of absence from work.\n\n(2) These are injuries that caused consequences to health that permanently changed a person\u2019s life (for example amputation of limbs, paralysis, neurological damage, etc.). Furthermore, as of the 2021 reporting cycle, the Life Changing Accident indicator has replaced High Consequence Injuries following the standardization of Company safety information, therefore the 2020 and 2019 values were recalculated using the new methodology.\nIn 2021 the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) decreased 11.7% compared to 2020, with 2.9 injury events for every million hours worked. This decrease involves both Enel people (-19.2%) as well as personnel from contractor companies (-12.0%).\n\nAs regards the number of injuries with days of absence from work (LTI), in 2021 there was an increase both in the number (275 compared to 210 in 2020) as well as in the frequency index (0.65 compared to 0.52 in 2020). This increase is concentrated in the area of events with a low number of days of absence and with a low potential of causing fatalities or Life Changing injuries, therefore concerning less serious events. Therefore, although it certainly represents a signal to pay attention and a phenomena to intercept and correct, this increase is associated in any case with only minimal impacts on the safety of workers. In 2021 there were 9 fatalities involving 3 employees of our Group (2 in Italy and 1 in Brazil) and 6 involving contractors (2 in Brazil, 2 in Chile, 1 in Italy and 1 in Spain).\n\nFurthermore, there were 4 Life Changing injuries (LCA) during the year, 1 of which involved an Enel employee in Brazil, and 3 that involved personnel of contractor companies (1 Brazil, 1 Colombia and 1 Spain). The causes of all these injuries are mainly associated with electrical (7), mechanical (5) and chemical (1) related accidents. For more details, please refer to the numerical attachment (\u201cSustainability Statement, Occupational health and safety\u201d).\n\nOur Group has a specific policy (Policy 106 \u201cClassification, communication, analysis and reporting of incidents\u201d) that defines roles and methods employed to guarantee prompt communication of incidents, ensuring the related cause analysis process, definition of improvement plans, and monitoring of the associated actions depending on the event type. Based on evidence resulting from the monitoring and control system, a data-driven approach was implemented that is based on IT tools and analytical dashboards, which makes it possible to appraise the performance of suppliers in relation to safety, identify areas at greater risk of fatalities and Life Changing injuries and the subsequent management methods. This approach is combined with the collection and sharing of the best practices that support the process of continuous learning and help avoid the same events from repeating.\n\nIn order to identify the most appropriate corrective measures, all High Potential events (not only the injuries, but also the so-called \u201cnear miss\u201d injuries) and injuries that involve missing work for more than 3 days are monitored in an analytical manner. This makes it possible to focus on events that have a greater potential/industrial impact profile, in order to orient the organization toward the removal of the most relevant risk causes, regardless of how long the injury lasts.\n\nIt is very important for each event to be reported promptly, not only for monitoring purposes, but also to guarantee that people will act in a responsible manner and not underestimate the hazards for themselves and for their colleagues. From this point of view, in addition to the Stop Work Policy, also the \u201cBuddy Partner\u201d role was defined for work activities, to underline the important of mutual control and true teamwork.\n\n279 Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) assessments were performed in 2021, meaning the internal assessment of safety and environment in order to evaluate the suitability of the organization and processes in a specific operating area of the Group. These checks are performed by expert HSEQ personnel who come from outside the operating unit under assessment, in addition to technical profiles who are specific to the business. After the check is performed, a report is issued with the evidence found in the field and the proposed corrective measures, whose implementation is monitored until complete conclusion.\n\nSafety in contract processes\n\nSafety is integrated in tender execution and the performance of companies is monitored both on a preliminary level, by means of the qualification system, and during contract execution through a large number of control processes and tools such as the Supplier Performance Management tool (SPM).\n\nThe preparation of a specific document (\u201cHSE Terms\u201d) was started in 2020 and is attached to all contracts that must be signed by contractors when the works are awarded. The document, which is the same throughout the entire Group, defines the obligations in relation to health, safety and environmental aspects that the contractors must respect, placing the same obligation on their subcontractors. This tool defines Enel\u2019s requirements regarding the environment, health and safety and includes a list of violations that could involve specific penalties, up to the termination of the contract and/or suspension of qualification on the Enel supplier portal.\n\nThe Contractor Assessments also continued in 2021, which are detailed assessments regarding safety and environmental issues carried out on the premises of the suppliers as well as at their job sites. In spite of the continuation of the Covid-19 emergency, 1,514 Contractor Assessments were carried out for the Enel Business Lines and Countries and Regions. The Contractor Assessment is a safety related assessment (also performed remotely if it is not possible to perform it on site) that is carried out during the qualification phase for each new supplier, or in cases in which criticalities emerge (severe inju-\nries or fatalities) or low Supplier Performance Management rating scores. For more details please refer to the \u201cSuppliers\u201d chapter in this document.\n\n2021 was also the year for additional extension and development of a structured and data-driven approach for supplier assessment, also thanks to the calculation of the Contractors Safety Index (CSI), which is an indicator based on the detection in the field of non-conformities, the number of injuries and their relative severity, and has been applied extensively to all Business Lines as an indicator used to detect faint signs and operational criticalities of contractors, so prevention can be selectively focused on the most critical companies and to make it possible to perform the assessment and implement consequence management for our suppliers.\n\nPeriodic multidisciplinary meetings (Evaluation Groups) were held in all the Business Lines and Countries and Regions of presence to assess the safety performance of suppliers, which made it possible to define targeted actions as well as accompaniment and support plans customized for the companies, in order to reach the desired safety standards and mitigate possible areas of risk in advance.\n\nInfrastructure safety and technological innovation\n\nEnel views technological innovation as a valid tool capable of improving a large number of processes from the H&S perspective. Several innovation projects on safety proceeded and various new projects were launched in 2021, in continuation of what was developed over the past years, in order to improve processes, starting from personnel training, continuing with the implementation of preventive and protective measures, up to the execution and analysis of corrective checks.\n\nPersonal voltage detectors, portable devices designed to identify electrical voltage on medium-voltage power lines located at operationally significant distances from the worker but not necessarily involved in the activity in progress, are being used in the Infrastructure and Networks area.\n\nWithin the scope of the \u201cIntrinsic Safety\u201d program, which was started already in 2020 and was inspired by the intrinsic safety concept and implemented in synergy and co-design between various Enel Global Business Lines and Holding Functions, many innovative projects were completed in 2021, such as:\n\n- **\u201cAI4Lifting\u201d**, which uses Artificial Intelligence to detect any potential situations of danger when handling loads;\n\n- **\u201cHop Safe\u201d**, system that allows personnel to use a ladder when working at a height only when they are properly connected to the life line.\nTechnology and innovation for guaranteeing the safety of our people\n\nThe Intrinsic Safety project focuses on the revision of plant elements, equipment and processes from the point of view of making them intrinsically safe, also in the case of error by the people who are working at our infrastructures and plants. The project, which was started in 2020 and is in the process of being adopted in the 31 countries in which the Generation Business Line operates, was extended during 2021 also to all the critical infrastructures of the plants managed by the Distribution Business Line, with the start of the phases of analysis and engineering of the components and processes in the 9 countries in which it is present.\n\nTechnologies and innovation represent one of the pillars on which our safety improvement strategy is based, together with digitalization which supports our operating assets. The use of artificial intelligence makes it possible in fact to guarantee suitable safety conditions for assets and plants, with an approach to prevention and monitoring in real time of the plants themselves.\n\nThis is the case of the 5 Golden Rules app, which is an application used in the Networks Business Line that makes it possible to guide and support Enel people who work in the field to correctly carry out the five maneuvers necessary for securing the electrical installations to prevent electrical injuries from occurring. The app is not only a support and guidance tool, but is also a tool for the monitoring, reporting and post-analysis of the maneuvers that were performed, making it possible to detect non-compliant actions and identify areas of improvement.\n\n\u201cInnovation and technology allow us to direct our activities towards intrinsically safe and correct operating methods. We constantly work toward obtaining the objective of zero accidents.\u201d\n\nMarcello Butera\nHead of Health & Safety, P&O Holding\n\n(1) The five Golden Rules are: 1) disconnect the plant and in particular the area where the work will be performed, 2) secure against reconnection and place warning signs, 3) check that the work area is de-energized, 4) carry out grounding and short-circuiting, 5) delimit the area from the adjacent active parts.\nInnovative solutions are currently being developed in the area of HMI (Human-Machine Interaction) to prevent the risk of accidental impacts with moving work equipment or with underground service lines, as in the case of the following projects:\n\n**Anticollision System:** whose objective is to improve the functionality of devices that generate alarms through the use of Artificial Intelligence programs;\n\n**Smart Bucket:** which implements a system that is able to prevent damaging underground utilities during excavation works, which are a significant market problem because it can create construction delays and risks for the safety of machine operators;\n\n**AME:** a project with the purpose of creating a device able to define a safe work area dedicated to operators and vehicles, through the use of proximity and voltage presence sensors.\n\nFinally, innovative solutions are being developed for monitoring health conditions during work activities in order to prevent and quickly manage potential situations of danger and/or emergency. An example is **Safety 4 Lone workers:** which involves the use of a multifunctional device (smart-watch) that uses specific algorithms to monitor the main biometric parameters in order to prevent possible situations of risk, in particular for Enel workers working alone.\n\n**Health**\n\nHealth is a relevant factor in the development and care of our people and, for this reason we have defined a structured health management system based on preventive measures, to develop a corporate culture oriented towards the promotion of mental-physical health, organizational well-being and balance between the professional and personal spheres. In this context, the Group carries out global and local awareness raising campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles, sponsors screening programs aimed at preventing the onset of illnesses and guarantees the availability of medical services. This approach is described in the new version of the \u201cHealth and Well-being\u201d Policy, approved in January 2022, and defines in three main steps \u2013 health surveillance, prevention and well-being \u2013 the path for promoting good health and well-being. This includes, but is not limited to, initiatives promoted on a global scale that improve the quality of the work day, both physically and mentally (for example, brief active break video pills, which can be performed also in front of a work station and that help prevent the adoption of incorrect physical behaviors and postures). A process of collecting the needs for wellness initiatives is also active since 2020, by means of an internal survey that provides important feedback from a point of view of continuous improvement.\n\nAn initiative for strengthening the digitalization of the Enel people health surveillance process was started in Italy last year, which involves the introduction of an IT tool that manages medical records. This will provide benefits in terms of efficiency and document archiving, and will make it possible to monitor health parameters in an aggregated and anonymous manner.\n\nFurthermore, on a global level, in relation to **business travel**, the \u201cHealth, safety and emergency aspects for expats or long term travellers\u201d policy was updated in 2021, which in addition to providing guidelines to travellers in terms of health, safety and emergency management, also defines in a uniform manner the preliminary steps and authorization...\nflow for the temporary assignment of Enel people abroad. For the latter and their families, insurance coverage was activated in 2021 which provides access to health care services in the host country, as well as home care. Tools were also introduced that support people who are traveling abroad, for example a smartphone application that provides travel information, vaccination guidelines and a global insurance policy that provides health coverage also in the case of epidemics and pandemics, was extremely effective over these past two years.\n\nIn relation to the injury phenomenon, apart from implementing plans designed to reduce the frequency to zero, it is planned to adopt a psychological support program for employees who have suffered severe injuries, together with their families, in order to assist them from the time of the event up to the return to normality. Constant monitoring of epidemiological and health trends is carried out within the perimeter of the Group, with the aim of implementing plans composed of preventive measures and measures to protect the health of employees and anyone working for the Group, on both a local and global level. With regard to the Covid-19 emergency, a new Covid-19 Global Insurance Group policy was established since March 2020, which provides compensation to Group employees who had to be hospitalized for at least two nights or who required hospitalization in intensive care after testing positive for Covid-19. A listening and psychological support service was renewed also for 2021, in continuation of 2020, which will remain active also after the end of the health emergency, the purpose of which is to provide employees with a customized help program in an anonymous, free and confidential manner.\n\nOur Group is also committed to a systematic process for the identification and assessment of risks of work-correlated stress, to allow the prevention, identification and management of stress in work situations that can affect individuals and more extensive areas of the organization, supplying also a series of indications aimed at promoting a culture of organizational well-being.\n\nFinally, we also provide our people with specific conventions that provide ready access to: medical and healthcare services, assistance actions for persons with disabilities or in emergency situations, and specific preventive medicine initiatives.\n\nDevelopment of safety culture: training and information\n\nOverall in 2021, Enel people received approximately 1.2 million training hours regarding safety, with the purpose of increasing the know-how and specific skills of workers throughout the Group.\n\nIn particular, the SHE Factory unit, with the objective of promoting a new mentality on a global level for a better way to work that is safer for people and more sustainable for the environment. In 2021, this unit created, prepared, managed and provided specific training courses on health, safety, environment and quality (HSEQ), to spread a different cultural approach to HSEQ topics by everyone, and at all professional levels, also by using training projects and learning processes not only based on technical aspects, but also so-called soft skills. Overall over the past year, SHE Factory involved almost 63 thousand people, and provided more than 241 thousand hours of internal training, in addition to the training and information activities that were carried out by other training units (global and local) in relation to the legal obligations regarding HSEQ.\n\nAs regards safety, the main topics that were addressed last year were:\n\n- **Stop Work Policy**: approximately 45,500 people belonging to different Business Lines and in all Countries and Regions participated in and completed at least one Stop Work Policy course, which demonstrates the commitment that our entire Group, starting with the CEO, is placing on this extremely important cultural approach to safety.\n\n- **Buddy Partner**: approximately 12 thousand employees, especially those working in the Infrastructure and Networks Business Line, participated in and completed at least one \u201cBuddy Partner\u201d course, which points out the importance of mutual control and true team work, which must always be carried out in observance of the preventive and protective measures regarding safety related risks.\n\nParticular attention is also placed on suppliers with the \u201cPartnership for safety, health and the environment\u201d project, which focuses on assisting Enel partners in adapting their company standards regarding HSEQ, with assessments and collaboration opportunities in the field. From this point of view, SHE Factory provided a dedicated software platform (ENEL4SHARE Platform) for the sharing of training material and carried out numerous meetings during the year with our main suppliers in order to increase their awareness by explaining the main principles of Enel\u2019s safety culture. In particular, an event was held in November 2021 in the Italian perimeter that involved more than 600 suppliers for all Business Lines.\nSafety of communities and third parties\n\nOur installed plants are built in compliance with legislative prescriptions and the rules of best technical practice. Plants, machines and work equipment are subject to systematic and periodic checks and maintenance activities to guarantee correct operation in compliance with regulations and in accordance with the adoption of the best safety standards.\n\nIn order to guarantee the health and safety of the community and reduce the impact of the typical activities of the Company\u2019s generation process on the external environment, the Company carries out monitoring campaigns. These include, for example, measurement of the electromagnetic fields of power networks, the detection of the noise level, vibration and dust created by the electrical machines of power plants and distribution and transformer substations. Also the following environmentally significant factors are monitored: atmospheric emissions and air quality, effluent discharge into surface waters, water quality, production, reuse and disposal of waste, soil quality, biodiversity impacts.\n\nConsiderable attention has been devoted to preventing injuries involving members of the public who accidentally come into contact with electricity networks during operations such as job sites near transmission lines or sports and leisure pursuits (fishing, flying kites, etc.). For this reason, a large number of awareness campaigns have been conducted, addressed both to the general public and to specific categories such as, for example, construction companies and sports associations.\n\nEmergencies management\n\nOur Group has defined a common crisis and critical events management system across the various countries where we are present. This system involves evaluation of the impact caused by critical events by means of a standard reference scale with three levels. High-impact crises are managed centrally, while medium- or low-impact crisis situations are managed within the specific organization in the individual countries.\n\nHigh-impact crises (\u201cGroup Red Code\u201d) are addressed by creating a central crisis committee in the Security Control Room at the Viale Regina Margherita headquarters in Rome, supplying support 24/7 for communication and coordination of information flows. Moreover, the crisis committee defines strategies and actions to deal with critical events and coordinates all actions designed to restrict damage to the Enel Group\u2019s property, profitability and reputation.\n\nEnel SpA has a Security unit in the Holding\u2019s People and Organization Function, aimed at defining strategies and guidelines on matters of security, reporting to top management and promoting sharing of best practices. Also, a travel safety process has been set up in order to protect Enel people travelling in different countries, supplying information and communications on destination countries, indicating conditions that can constitute health and safety risks of travelers (e.g. political turmoil, terror attacks, crime, health threats, etc.), the guidelines and conduct to follow, and activation of the necessary safety measures for the level of risk identified for the destination country.\n\nConstant monitoring of epidemiological and health trends is carried out within the perimeter of the Group, with the aim of adopting plans composed of preventive measures and measures to protect the health of our employees and anyone working for the Group, on both a local level and a global level.\n\nSince the start of the Covid-19 emergency in February 2020, we have taken action in order to protect the health of our colleagues and guarantee a continuous supply of electrical energy to the communities where we operate, both through specific global and country task forces, and subsequently by providing the organization with a unit that is responsible for controlling this process. This resulted in the creation of a new unit, called Pandemic Emergency Management, which ensures the monitoring of emergency situations, the definition of the strategy and global policies and their adoption in all areas of the Group. In addition, this unit aims to direct, integrate and monitor all actions of prevention, protection, safeguarding, and intervention aimed at protecting the health of its employees and contractors, also in relation to exogenous health risk factors not strictly correlated with the work activity.\nNuclear policy\n\nIn the context of its operations in the field of nuclear technologies, Enel has made a public commitment, in the role of shareholder, to guarantee that a clear nuclear safety policy is adopted in its atomic energy plants and that the plants are managed in accordance with criteria capable of assuring the absolute priority of safety and protection of workers, the community and the environment. Further details are available on the Enel website (https://www.enel.com/investors/sustainability-performance/enel-and-nuclear).\n\nIndustrial relations on health and safety topics\n\nIn order to consolidate the culture of safety and promote the adoption of behaviors that are consistent with company policies, Enel supports social dialogue and participation of workers\u2019 representatives. Joint committees have been set up for this purpose in the main countries in which Enel is present, dedicated to monitoring the issues and projects concerning workers\u2019 health and safety on the national level and also in terms of Business Lines. In Italy, in implementation of the matters provided for by the national trade union agreement on the \u201cItalian model of Enel Italia industrial relations\u201d, there has been a bilateral commission on workplace safety and protection policies in force since 2012. The commission examines the main projects aimed at improving safety standards, training projects, preventive initiatives. In 2013, the Enel Global Framework Agreement created an analogous bilateral commission at the Group level, which defined a \u201cjoint recommendation\u201d concerning health and safety standards applicable in all Enel countries. Negotiations are in progress to renew the Enel Global Framework Agreement.\n\nThe following details concern the commissions that operate in the main countries on the national and/or local levels.\n\n| Country | Joint committees for health and safety |\n|---------|---------------------------------------|\n| Italy   | Apart from the bilateral commission on safety policies and workplace protection set up in 2012, there are two committees working for Infrastructure and Networks and for Generation. Periodic meetings are also organized, involving the employer, the prevention and protection service manager, the medical officer and the workers\u2019 safety representatives. The meetings are held at least once a year. |\n| Russia  | Every power plant in Russia has a health and safety committee. Each organizational unit has a worker representative for issues concerning occupational health and safety, with a total of 33 representatives reporting to company managers and union organizations. In compliance with legislative provisions, there is an Occupational Safety and Health Committee (CSSM) comprised of representatives appointed by the trade organizations who represent the workers for each company (worker representatives) on the one hand, and on the other, a number of people representing the employer equal to the number of worker representatives. The occupational health physician is required to participate in the CSSM meetings. The Occupational Safety and Health Committee aims to guarantee employee involvement in the development and implementation of decisions regarding occupational health and safety. Committee members meet periodically (every three months and each time it is necessary) to discuss specific problems and propose measures/actions for managing, controlling and improving the level of employee health and safety. |\n| Romania | The Comisi\u00f3n de participaci\u00f3n y control has been set up on the national level, while the local level is handled by Comit\u00e9s de seguridad y salud territoriales. The power plants have bilateral committees responsible for health and hygiene issues, which meet once a month or once every two months. The agreement does not specify the frequency with which the meetings are held. All generation centers with more than 25 workers have Comit\u00e9s paritarios de higiene y seguridad, which make decisions concerning occupational health and safety by means of an annual operating plan. These committees meet once a month. |\n| Spain   | We have bilateral committees (workers and Company representatives) that approve occupational health and safety policies according to law. |\n| Argentina | The Comisi\u00f3n interna de preven\u00e7\u00e3o de acidentes has been established at all sites, which is comprised of Company representatives and worker representatives; the committee focuses on the creation of accident prevention initiatives. |\n| Chile   | Two joint committees have been set up (COPASST), one for networks and one for generation, with the role of promoting the application of occupational medicine legislation. |\n| Peru    | |\n| Brazil  | |\n| Colombia| |\n## Sound governance\n\n### Priorities\n- Sound governance and fair corporate conduct\n- Economic and financial value creation\n\n### Plan\n\n#### BACKBONES\n- Sound governance\n\n### Targets\n\n| Activities | 2021-2023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022-2024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| **Diversity Policy** -

Notably, the shareholder structure at December 31, 2021 was as follows: (i) 59.4% institutional investors; (ii) 17.0% retail investors; (iii) 23.6% Ministry of the Economy and Finance. Enel\u2019s corporate structure includes the main international investment funds, insurance companies, pension funds and ethical funds, thanks also to the adoption, by the Company and the Group, of the best international practices on transparency and corporate governance. Moreover, at the date of this Sustainability Report, the Enel Group includes a further 14 companies issuing shares listed on the Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Peruvian, Russian, Spanish, and US Stock Exchanges.\nPolicy for managing the dialog with institutional investors and with all shareholders and bondholders\n\nEnel is committed to ensuring a constant and open relationship that is based on the mutual understanding of the roles with all shareholders and bondholders, as well as with the institutional investors and their representative associations in order to increase the relative level of understanding regarding the activities performed by the Company and the Group. In this context, Enel maintains dialogue with investors based on principles of fairness and transparency, in compliance with EU and national regulations on market abuse, as well as in line with international best practices. This engagement activity has led to the positive result, over recent years, of a significant increase in participation of the institutional investors in the Shareholders\u2019 Meetings.\n\nIn order to regulate the methods for developing this dialog, in March 2021 the Board of Directors adopted a specific Policy, acting on a proposal of the Chairman made in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, (the so-called \u201cEngagement Policy\u201d), which clarified to a large extent the practices already followed by Enel and whose use takes into account the applicable best practices adopted by the institutional investors and reflected in the stewardship codes.\n\nThis Engagement Policy, which was applied consistently during 2021, also identifies the corporate structures that, in line with the practices established by Enel from the moment their shares were listed on the stock exchanges, are responsible for the dialog activities, and specifically with: (i) a specific Investor Relations office which is part of the Administration, Finance and Control Function, which interacts on a continuous basis with the institutional investors (as well as with the financial analysts and the rating agencies); as well as (ii) a specific area in the Corporate Affairs office, which is in turn part of the Legal and Corporate Affairs function, which interacts on a continuous basis with the retail shareholders and bondholders, providing them with all useful explanations regarding the respective issues of interest.\n\nThe information provided to Enel\u2019s institutional investors and all their shareholders and bondholders by the above-indicated organizational structures \u2013 as well as by any other duly authorized Company member \u2013 complies with the criteria of truthfulness, clarity, coherence, completeness and symmetry of information; the information is also supplied in a timely manner and in compliance with what is required by the regulation adopted by Enel regarding the processing of corporate information.\n\nIn particular, the Investor Relations structures are, for example, responsible for the following: (i) preparing Enel\u2019s equity story and organizing meetings between the Company\u2019s Top Management and the financial community; (ii) managing relationships with ratings agencies and with the fixed income investors; (iii) managing relationships with institutional investors and financial analysts; (iv) coordinating the management of relationships with the institutional investors who have an interest in the listed share capital controlled by Enel; (v) preparing market analyses and reports concerning Enel shares, also monitoring the consensus of the financial analysts; (vi) supporting the Communications Function, in coordination with the Corporate Affairs unit with the definition and approval of Enel\u2019s price sensitive press releases, as well as developing and updating the content dedicated to investors on the Company website and in the app called \u201cEnel Investor\u201d.\n\nFor more details, refer to the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure for 2021. Also, Enel\u2019s website (www.enel.com, \u201cInvestors\u201d section) provides access to economic, financial, environmental, social and governance information and updated data and documents of particular interest, providing a multidisciplinary and integrated vision.\nEnel\u2019s corporate governance system complies with the principles contained in the Italian Corporate Governance Code (the \u201cCorporate Governance code\u201d), in the January 2020 edition, to which the Company adheres, and with international best practices. The corporate governance system adopted by Enel and the Group is oriented toward the goal of sustainable success, given that it is aimed at creating value for shareholders over the long term, aware of the social importance of the Group\u2019s operating activities and the consequent need to proceed with adequate consideration of all the interests involved.\n\n**Board of Directors**\n\n**CHAIRMAN**\nMichele Crisostomo\n\n**CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND GENERAL MANAGER**\nFrancesco Starace\n\n**SECRETARY**\nSilvia Alessandra Fappani\n\n**DIRECTORS**\nCesare Calari\nCostanza Esclapon de Villeneuve\nSamuel Leupold\nAlberto Marchi\nMariana Mazzucato\nMirella Pellegrini\nAnna Chiara Svelto\n\n**Board of Statutory Auditors**\n\n**CHAIRMAN**\nBarbara Tadolini\n\n**AUDITORS**\nRomina Guglielmetti\nClaudio Sottoriva\n\n**ALTERNATE AUDITORS**\nMaurizio De Filippo\nFrancesca Di Donato\nPiera Vitali\n\n**Audit Firm**\n\nKPMG SpA\n\n---\n\n(1) It is available on the Borsa Italiana website (at https://www.borsaitaliana.it/comitato-corporate-governance/codice/2020.pdf).\nFor a detailed illustration of Enel\u2019s corporate governance, we invite you to refer to the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure for 2021, which is available on the Company\u2019s website (www.enel.com); we further refer you to the specific sections of this Sustainability Report for an illustration of the governance of sustainability and the management of climate change.\n\nComposition of the Board of Directors\n\n1 executive director\n1 in 2020\n\n8 non-executive directors\n8 in 2020\nof which 8 independent\n7 in 2020\n\n(1) The figures for 2020 refer to directors qualifying as independent pursuant to the Corporate Governance Code for Italian listed companies (2018 edition). The figures for 2021 refer to directors qualifying as independent pursuant to the Italian Corporate Governance Code (2020 edition).\nThe Board of Directors in office was appointed by the Ordinary Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of May 14, 2020 and consists of nine members. Enel applies diversity criteria, also in relation to gender, in the composition of the Board of Directors, in line with the priority goal of ensuring adequate competence and professionalism of its members. Specifically, in January 2018 the Board of Directors, acting on a proposal of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Nomination and Compensation Committee, and in implementation of what is required by the Single Financial Act, approved a diversity policy that describes the optimal characteristics of the Board\u2019s composition to ensure it can fulfil its duties as effectively as possible, making decisions that can tangibly benefit from the contribution of a plurality of different qualified members able to examine the issues under discussion from diverse perspectives.\n\nThe Board of Directors held 16 meetings in 2021, of which 11 related to sustainability issues (8 of which addressed climate-related matters, reflected in the strategies and related implementation methods). Furthermore, following the extensive and comprehensive induction program organized during 2020 in order to provide Directors with suitable knowledge of the business sectors in which the Group operates, as well as the Company dynamics and their evolution, the market trends and the regulatory framework of reference, in 2021 specific investigations concerning corporate governance and climate change were taken, with the participation of an external expert for the latter.\n\nThe maximum number of offices that the relative members can hold on the Board of Directors or governing bodies of other companies of a relevant size is regulated by a specific corporate policy, which was updated in 2020 in order to adapt the contents to the relevant best practices prepared by the main proxy advisors and relevant institutional investors.\n\nIn order to regulate the methods with which the Company conducts the dialog with institutional investors and with all shareholders and bondholders, in March 2021 the Board of Directors adopted the Engagement Policy (see paragraph, Policy for managing the dialog with institutional investors and with all shareholders and bondholders).\n\nIn relation to the topic of succession plans for executive directors, in September 2016 the Board of Directors, acting on a proposal of the Nomination and Compensation Committee made in agreement with the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, shared the contents of a specific \u201ccontingency plan\u201d aimed at regulating the steps to be taken to assure proper management of the Company in case the Chief Executive Officer ceases to hold office before the end of their ordinary term (defined as \u201ccrisis management\u201d cases).\n\nFinally, at the end of 2021 and during the first two months of 2022, with the assistance of an independent consultant, the Board of Directors carried out an assessment of the size, composition, and functioning of the Board itself and its committees (\u201cboard review\u201d), in line with the most advanced corporate governance practices followed internationally and assimilated in the Corporate Governance Code. The board review was conducted also in accordance with the peer-to-peer review method, i.e. through assessment not merely of the operation of the body considered globally, but also of the style and contents of the contribution provided by each of its members, and was extended to the Board of Statutory Auditors. Within the scope of the board review, specific attention was dedicated to verify the Directors\u2019 perception regarding (i) the training activity carried out during 2021 for the induction program, in relation to the topic of climate change, as well as (ii) the involvement of the Board of Directors in sustainability issues and the integration of sustainability topics in corporate strategy. The results of the board review are provided in Enel\u2019s Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure.\nRemuneration policy\n\nEnel\u2019s Remuneration Policy for 2021, which was adopted by the Board of Directors acting on a proposal of the Nomination and Compensation Committee and approved by the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of May 20, 2021, was defined in consideration of (i) the recommendations contained in the Corporate Governance Code; (ii) the national and international best practices; (iii) the information that emerged from the favorable vote of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of May 14, 2020 on the remuneration policy for 2020; (iv) the results of the engagement activities regarding corporate governance carried out by the Company between January and March 2021 with the main proxy advisors and institutional investors with an interest in Enel capital; (v) the results of a benchmark analysis regarding the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and the Non-Executive Directors of Enel for 2020, which was prepared by an independent consultant.\n\nThis Policy aims to: (i) promote Enel\u2019s sustainable success, which is based on the creation of long-term value to the benefit of its shareholders, taking into due consideration the interests of the other relevant stakeholders, in order to encourage reaching the strategic goals; (ii) attract, retain and motivate people with the skills and professionalism required for the delicate managerial tasks assigned to them, in consideration of the compensation and work conditions of the Company and Enel Group employees; as well as (iii) promote the company mission and values.\n\nThe remuneration policy for 2021 sets out the following compensation for the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and for Key Management Personnel (referred to as DRS - Dirigenti con Responsabilit\u00e0 Strategiche):\n\n- a fixed component;\n- a short-term variable component (MBO), to be paid based on the achievement of specific performance targets. Specifically:\n  - for the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager, the 2021 MBO is based on the following annual performance targets:\n    - Ordinary consolidated net income;\n    - Group Opex;\n  - for DRSs, the respective MBOs identify specific and objective annual targets linked to the reference business and differentiated in accordance with the Functions and assigned responsibilities;\n- a long-term variable component linked to participation in specific multi-annual incentive plans. In particular, for 2021 this component is linked to participation in the Long-Term Incentive Plan destined for the management of Enel SpA and/or of its subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code (\u201c2021 LTI Plan\u201d), which contains the following three-year performance goals:\n  - average Enel TSR (Total Shareholders Return) vs average Euro Stoxx Utilities \u2013 UEM index TSR in the three-year period 2021-2023;\n  - cumulative ROACE (Return on Average Capital Employed) in the three-year period 2021-2023;\n  - Consolidated net installed capacity from renewable sources/Total net installed capacity at the end of 2023;\n  - Emissions of GHG Scope 1 per equivalent kWh generated by the Group in 2023;\n  - Percentage of women in the managerial succession plans at the end of 2023.\n\nThe 2021 LTI Plan also requires any premium accrued to be represented by a share component, to which \u2013 based on the level of achievement of the various targets \u2013 a monetary component can be added. In particular, 100% of the base bonus of the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager (with respect to a maximum amount that can reach 280% of the base bonus) and 50% of the base bonus of the DRS (with respect to a maximum amount that can reach 180% of the base premium) is to be disbursed in Enel shares, mainly purchased from the Company. In addition, the disbursement of a significant portion of the long-term variable remuneration component (70% of the total) is deferred to the second subsequent financial year with respect to the three-years of reference for the objectives of the 2021 LTI Plan (i.e. \u201cdeferred payment\u201d).\nThe table below shows the \u201cpay ratio\u201d for 2019, 2020 and 2021, also with an indication of the pay ratio for the fixed component of the remuneration.\n\n| Pay Ratio \u2013 Ratio between the total remuneration of the CEO/GM of Enel and the average annual gross remuneration of Group employees | 2021(1) | 2020(2) | 2019 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 91x (34x fixed remuneration) | 145x (35x fixed remuneration) | 143x (36x fixed remuneration) |\n\n(1) The 2021 value decreased slightly with respect to 2020 due to some results that caused a sharp drop in the long-term and short-term variable component.\n(2) The 2020 value was recalculated to take the effects of exchange rates into account and therefore make the information comparable.\n\nFor more information on the contents of the 2022 remuneration policy, refer to the Report on the Enel remuneration policy for 2022 and on the compensation paid in 2021, available on the Company website (www.enel.com).\n\n**Internal Control and Risk Management System**\n\nEnel adopts a governance model in line with best risk management practices, which involves:\n\n1. **Group Risk Committee**\n   - created at the highest levels and guided by the Enel Group Chief Executive Officer.\n\n2. **Localized risk committee**\n   - based on the principles of the Business Lines and the scopes of the Countries and Regions, guided by the manager of the responsible Function (Business Line/Country/Region Manager) and coordinated with the Group Risk Committee.\n\n3. **Risk Appetite Framework**\n   - specifically formalized in the Group risk catalogue.\n\n4. **Three lines of defence**\n   - Clear and defined assignment of roles and responsibilities based on the principle of \u201c3 lines of defence\u201d (1 = Management, 2 = Control, 3 = Internal Audit).\n\n5. **Organizational procedures and risk policy system**\n   - to define the processes related to the measurement, management, monitoring and control of the most significant risks.\n\n6. **Reporting system**\n   - continuous and structured, targeted towards decision makers regarding risk exposure and metrics, supplied on the level of the Group, Business Lines and relevant Countries and Regions.\n\nEnel, in consideration of its operations, classifies the risks to which it is exposed, which includes six categories: strategic, financial, operational, governance & culture, digital technology and compliance.\n\nThe risks are defined in a catalogue to be referred to in all Group areas and for all the structures involved in management and monitoring processes. Adoption of a common language facilitates mapping and organic representation of risks within the Group, thus aiding identification of risks that affect Group processes and of the roles of the organizational units involved in their management.\n\nThe Group also adopts a **Risk Appetite Framework**, in order to enable, for each risk and in accordance with an integrated approach, the appropriate management and control measures, plus development and updating (metrics and models for measurement of risks). For the effective management of such risks, Enel set up an Internal Control and Risk Management System (\u201cSCIGR\u201d), updated periodically, that strengthens risk profile awareness, picking up the related opportunities, and supports management in decision-making processes aimed at value creation in a constantly evolving external context. The system is com-\nposed of the set of rules, procedures, and organizational structures designed to allow identification, measurement, management, and monitoring of the main corporate risks within the Group. In this context, the Board of Directors performs a policy making and coordination role for risk management, which assures the adoption of aware, structured decisions that are consistent with the nature and level of risk at all levels of the Group. More details are provided in the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure, available on the Company website (www.enel.com, \u201cInvestors\u201d section).\n\nDue to the nature of its business and its geographical distribution, the Group is exposed to different types of ESG risk (environmental, social, and governance), identified within the reference framework of risk categories adopted by Enel.\n\nIn the identification of potential ESG risks, the following were considered:\n\n- the results of the materiality analysis (see the section \u201cOur sustainable progress\u201d);\n- the 2022 Global Risk Report of the World Economic Forum (WEF), involving more than 1,000 experts and leaders from all over the world;\n- the risk assessments carried out as part of Enel\u2019s due diligence process on human rights, which involved numerous experts from different sectors, including civil society, academic institutions, local communities, customers and suppliers, in the various countries in which the Group operates;\n- the analyses of some of the most highly internationally accredited ESG rating agencies, which use specific risk assessment systems to rate the level of company performance in relation to sustainability.\n\nIn the risk identification and assessment stage, the \u201cPrecautionary Principle\u201d was applied, particularly in relation to risks relating to the environment, health, and safety. For each type of risk, specific actions have been identified to mitigate effects and ensure correct management. Enel\n\n---\n\n(2) Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, June 3-14, 1992), Principle 15.\nalso applies this principle to risk management, especially with regard to the development and introduction of new products/technologies, planning of operating assets and the development and construction of new plants/assets.\n\nThe following is a description of the main ESG risk types, the actions intended to mitigate the effects and assure their correct management.\n\n**Strategic**\n\n**Reference scenario and description of risk**\nThe markets and business in which the Group is present are facing processes of progressive, increasing competition and evolution from both a technological as well as a regulatory point of view, with timelines that vary from country to country.\n\nAs a result of these processes, Enel is exposed to growing competitive pressure and, as electricity is the carrier of the century, competition is increasing also from related sectors which, on the other hand, makes it possible for utility companies to enter into new areas of business. Furthermore, Enel is operating in regulated markets and changes to the operating rules of the various systems, as well as the related provisions and obligations, have an impact on operating performance and results.\n\n**Mitigation actions and associated strategic goals**\nThe differentiation on which Enel can rely, both on a geographical level as well as with regard to the various sectors in which it operates, represents an important mitigation factor, and in order to better orient the strategic development guidelines, the evolution of the competitive panorama is continuously monitored, both inside and outside the world of Utilities.\n\nIn relation to risks that may arise from regulatory factors, relations were intensified with local government and regulatory bodies, adopting an approach based on transparency, collaboration and proactiveness in addressing and removing sources of instability of the legislative and regulatory framework.\n\n**Reference scenario and description of risk**\nThe physical risks arising from climate change can be classified as acute (or extreme events) or chronic: the former are linked to extremely intense weather-climatic conditions, while the latter refer to gradual and enduring changes in climatic conditions.\n\nExtreme events may expose the Group to potential unavailability of assets and infrastructure, service restoration costs, inconvenience for customers, etc. Chronic changes in climatic conditions, on the other hand, may expose the Group to other physical risks or opportunities (depending on the geographical location): for example, structural changes in rainfall or wind patterns could impact the Group\u2019s business in generation terms, while structural temperature changes can impact electricity demand.\n\nWith regard to the energy transition process towards a more sustainable model with a progressive electrification and reduction in CO\u2082 emissions in line with the Group\u2019s decarbonization strategy, there are risks, but above all opportunities, tied to both the changing regulatory context and the technological and electrification trends, and resulting market developments, with potential effects also on commodity and energy prices.\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nThe Group is committed to the continuous improvement of the environmental impact of its activities. In this context, the Group has recently brought forward by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040, its public commitment to \u201cNet-Zero\u201d emissions, both direct and indirect. Moving towards complete decarbonization, Enel has constructed a roadmap that includes medium-term objectives to 2030 against 2017 as a benchmark. In particular, the Company has committed to reducing (i) direct greenhouse gas emissions per kWh by 80%, in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C pathway as certified by the Science Based Targets (SBTi) initiative; (ii) emissions related to the retail sale of gas by 55%; (iii) emissions related to electricity sales by 80%. The Group\u2019s strategic actions make it possible to mitigate the potential risks and exploit the opportunities associated with transition variables. In this context, capital employment is centered on decarbonization through the development of assets for generation from renewable sources, on enabling infrastructure linked to the development of networks, and on the implementation of platform models, fully exploiting technological and digital evolution which will favor consumption electrification and the development of new services for end customers.\n\nFurthermore, Enel participates in the entire electricity value chain and has a diversified activities portfolio, in terms of both generation technologies and the Countries and Regions in which it operates, mitigating climate change risks and their implications in terms of economic and financial impacts.\n\nThe management of weather and climate phenomena adopts the best strategies for prevention, protection and increasing resilience. For example, the Group uses weather forecasts, procedures for the management of adverse events and monitoring and analysis activities that provide for the definition of actions to protect and increase resilience, both for existing assets and for those under construction. Also, best practices are implemented in relation to physical events to ensure prompt recovery of operating conditions following adverse events. In terms of insurance risk assessment activities, the Group manages loss prevention global programs for property and liability risks, aimed at covering losses relating to damages to assets, business interruptions and damages to third parties. Such activities also include the assessment of the main exposures linked to natural events and, together with prevention and resilience enhancement measures, contribute to optimizing the insurance strategy. The Group develops short, medium and long-term scenarios in the energy and macro-economic financial spheres in order to support its strategic and industrial planning activities, investments assessment, scenario planning activities and activities related to extraordinary transactions.\n\nAll these activities, together with the integration of climate and transition scenarios and the development of an energy model at Country level, enables a prompt assessment of the risks and opportunities relating to climate change. This approach makes it possible to intercept effects on variables such as electricity demand, the system energy mix and consumption electrification. In addition, the Group\u2019s policies set guidelines for the assessment of risks and opportunities relating to climate change.\n\nSee also the \u201cThe path to Net-Zero\u201d chapter of this document.\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nIn recent years, a growing sensitivity of the entire community has emerged in relation to risks linked to models of development that generate impacts on the quality of the environment and on ecosystems, with the exploitation of scarce natural resources (including raw materials and water). In some cases, synergistic effects between these impacts, such as global warming and the growing exploitation and degradation of water resources, increase the risk of environmental emergencies arising in the most sensitive areas of the planet, with the risk of competition for different water resource uses, i.e. industrial, agricultural, and civil.\n\nTo address these needs, institutions are updating environmental regulations to be more restrictive, placing increasingly stringent constraints on the development of new industrial initiatives, obliging or facilitating a shift away from technologies considered to be no longer sustainable in what are seen as the highest impact sectors.\n\nIn this context, the European Commission has recently launched an operating plan to set challenging targets on environmental recovery, in relation to both air quality and land reclamation in river areas and contaminated land, as well as to reduce loss of biodiversity.\n\nIn this context, companies in each sector, and especially leading companies, increasingly aware that environmental risks are also economic risks, are urged to step up their commitment and take on greater responsibility in identifying and adopting innovative and sustainable technical solutions and development models.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nEnel has made the effective prevention and minimization of environmental impacts and risks a foundational element of each project across its entire life cycle. The adoption of ISO 14001-certified Environmental Management Systems certified within the Group ensures the presence of structured policies and procedures to identify and manage the environmental risks and opportunities associated with all corporate activities.\n\nA structured control plan combined with actions and improvement objectives inspired by the best environmental practices, with requirements higher than those linked to simple environmental regulatory compliance, mitigates the risk of impacts on the environmental matrix, reputational damage and legal disputes. Also contributing are the multitude of actions to achieve the challenging environmental improvement objectives set by Enel, such as, for example, those regarding atmospheric emissions, waste produced and water consumption, especially in areas with high water stress.\n\nThe risk of water scarcity is directly mitigated by Enel\u2019s development strategy, which is based on the growth of generation from renewable sources that are essentially not dependent on the availability of water for their operation. Special attention is also devoted to assets in areas with a high level of water stress, in order to develop technological solutions to reduce consumption. Ongoing collaboration with local river basin management authorities enables us to adopt the most effective shared strategies for the sustainable management of hydroelectric generation assets.\n\nLastly, in relation to the protection of biodiversity, an analysis of the impacts/dependencies of the Company\u2019s business on natural resources was carried out and priority areas of action were defined throughout the value chain. On the basis of this analysis, appropriate terrestrial, marine and river monitoring of ecosystems is carried out to verify the effectiveness of measures adopted in order to protect, restore and preserve biodiversity.\n\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cTowards a nature-based model\u201d chapter.\nReference scenario and description of risk\nThe main health and safety risks to which Enel\u2019s people and contractors are exposed are related to the operating assets carried out at the Group\u2019s sites and its assets. In this context, violation of the laws, regulations, and procedures in force concerning to health and safety, workplaces, management of structures, company assets and processes, which can have a negative impact on the health of employees, workers, and stakeholders, can give rise to the risk of administrative or judicial penalties with associated economic-financial and reputational impacts. These risks were identified by analyzing the main events that occurred in the past three years. In particular, in relation to probability of occurrence, mechanical risks (falls, knocks, crushing and cuts) are the most likely, whilst in terms of potential associated impact, electrical risks are those with the most severe consequences (fatalities).\nAlso, in relation to the Group\u2019s presence in different geographical contexts worldwide, employees and contractors may be exposed to health risks relating to emerging infectious diseases, of epidemic and potentially pandemic nature, which may affect their good health and well-being.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\nEnel has adopted a Declaration of Commitment to Health and Safety, signed by the Group\u2019s Top Management.\nTo implement it, each of the Group\u2019s Business Lines has its own Occupational Health and Safety Management System in compliance with international standard BS OHSAS 18001, based on identifying hazards, qualitative and quantitative risk assessment, planning and implementing preventive and protective measures, verifying the effectiveness of preventive and protective measures, and any corrective actions required. This system also considers the rigorous selection and management of contractors and suppliers, promoting their involvement in continuous safety performance improvement programs.\nThe Enel Group has defined a structured health management system based on preventive and protective measures, functional also in respect of the development of a corporate culture oriented towards promoting mental-physical health and the organizational well-being of workers, and also the balance between the professional and personal spheres.\nFurthermore, with regard to emergencies relating to risks resulting from the current and persistent pandemic scenario, a unit has been set up within the Holding PO Function with references in each Business Line and in each country, in order to assure the definition of the global strategy and policies for management of the emergency and their adoption in every Group organization. In particular, this organizational structure and the related management processes make it possible to direct, integrate and monitor, both at Group level and in the individual countries in which it operates, all the prevention, protection and intervention actions aimed at protecting the health of employees and contractors, also in relation to exogenous health risk factors that may not be strictly related to work activities.\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d chapter.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\nEnel may be exposed to the risk of reputational, economic, or financial losses further to ineffective procurement activities or contracts management, inadequate supplier qualification processes, excessive recourse to direct awards, deficiencies in scouting activities, insufficient monitoring of compliance with contractual obligations, and failure to apply penalties.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\nGroup procurement processes and the related governance documents constitute a structured system of standards and checkpoints that make it possible to combine the achievement of economic business goals with full compliance with the fundamental principles set down in the Code of Ethics, in the Enel Global Compliance Program, in the Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan, and in the Policy on Human Rights, while continuing to promote initiatives aimed at\nsustainable economic development.\n\nThese principles are expressed in the processes and organizational measures that Enel has decided to adopt in a self-regulation regime in order to establish relationships of trust with all its stakeholders and to define stable and constructive relations that do not only guarantee economic competitiveness but that take account of the best practices in essential areas for the Group, i.e. opposition to child labor, promotion of occupational health and safety conditions, and environmental responsibility. Thanks to greater interaction and integration with the outside world and with the different parts of the corporate organization, the purchasing process increasingly assumes a central role in value creation. Global Procurement contributes to the creation of a resilient and sustainable supply chain, to thinking in terms of circular economy, to encouraging innovation, sharing the Group\u2019s values and objectives with suppliers who, as such, become enablers to achieve Enel\u2019s targets.\n\nMore specifically, reward factors are introduced in the tenders, aimed at generating virtuous behavior on the part of our suppliers: for example, the environmental impact of any customer is strongly influenced by the impact of its upstream supply chain. Global Procurement therefore pushes its suppliers to objectively measure their carbon footprint and to embark on pathways of improvement.\n\nFrom the perspective of the procurement process, the various Procurement units adopt the practice of tenders almost by default, guaranteeing the maximum competition and equal opportunity of access to all operators having the necessary technical, economic-financial, environmental, safety, human rights, legal and ethical characteristics. Procurement by direct award and without a competitive procedure can occur only in exceptional suitably motivated circumstances in compliance with the relevant statutory legislation.\n\nMoreover, the global supplier qualification system, the same one throughout the Enel Group, checks \u2013 even before the procurement process starts \u2013 that potential suppliers are in line with the strategic corporate vision and with expectations in relation to all the mentioned profiles and requirements, and that they hold the same values.\n\nWith regard to the risk governance system, the Group is focused on the application of metrics that indicate the level of risk before and after the mitigation action, in order to implement precautionary actions to reduce uncertainty to a tolerable level or to mitigate any impacts in all business, technological and geographical areas.\n\nThe effectiveness of risk management in the supply chain is monitored using specific indicators, including the probability of insolvency, the concentration of contracts with individual suppliers or industrial groups, the supplier\u2019s dependence on Enel, the performance index for proper conduct during the tender, quality, punctuality and sustainability in the execution of the contract, Country risk, etc., for which thresholds are defined that guide the definition of the procurement, negotiation and award strategy of a tender, allowing informed choices of risk and potential benefit (savings).\n\nThe actions taken to counter the impacts of the Covid-19 emergency were centered around differentiation of procurement sources to prevent interruptions in the supply chain and in remote management of activities that would normally require physical interaction between Enel and the supplier (e.g. company on-site inspections).\n\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cSuppliers\u201d chapter.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nEnel may be exposed to the risk of judicial or administrative sanctions, economic or financial losses, and reputational damage as a result of partial or total interruption of commercial operations and of electricity supplies to customers, caused by technical faults, malfunctions of assets and plants, human error, sabotage, unavailability of raw materials or adverse weather events, or infectious diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential that may limit the normal functioning of the Group\u2019s activities or of its supply chain.\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nEnel has systems and mechanisms to guarantee a continuous and safe energy supply to the national electrical systems of the countries in which it operates. The Company is therefore constantly at work to develop and improve the efficiency of the transport and distribution network, in coordination with the other entities operating on the network infrastructure in various capacities. Enel carries out actions of network development, modernization, and maintenance on the infrastructure existing in all Countries, with the primary aim of improving the quality of the service delivered and reducing the number and duration of outages.\n\nEnel also constantly takes operational efficiency and safety measures to guarantee correct functioning and availability of all its power plants. Lastly, the Group\u2019s assets are covered by adequate insurance mechanisms to protect the Company from potential negative economic consequences resulting from future and uncertain events.\n\nMoreover, with special reference to the management of critical events, Enel has drawn up Group policy on a Business Line and Country level to ensure effectiveness of the decision-making process in the management of any event that could impair continuity of the public service and the Company\u2019s business, including health emergencies with a local and/or global impact.\n\nEnel implements adequate protocols, plans and actions to ensure the smooth running of its business activity worldwide or, if necessary, its rapid recovery in the event of service interruptions.\n\nEspecially in relation to the health emergency, Enel defines specific protocols designed to limit the spread of contagion among the people involved in operating assets and consequently guarantee the continuity of service.\n\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cThe decade of electrification and customer centricity\u201d chapter.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nEnel aims to lead the transition towards a more sustainable development system, essential for the future of the planet, accelerating the process of decarbonization of its energy mix via renewable growth and the ever-increasing electrification of consumption.\n\nThe profound transformations of the energy sector require the calls for new profiles and professional skills, as well as a major cultural and organizational shift toward achieving the Group\u2019s objectives.\n\nOrganizations must orient their activities in line with new lean and flexible business models. Policies for the promotion of diversity and the management and promotion of talent become key elements for companies currently negotiating the transition and having a widespread geographical presence.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nEnel places the people who working for the Company at the center of its business model. The management of human capital is a priority to which specific objectives are linked, the main ones including: development of digital skills and expertise, promotion of reskilling and upskilling programs for our people to support the energy transition, but also external skilling to foster the development of a benchmark ecosystem, widespread correct engagement with respect to the corporate purpose, which ensures better results supported by higher personal satisfaction; development of the workplace and performance appraisal systems; the dissemination, in all the countries in which the Group is present, of the diversity and inclusion policy, as well as an inclusive organizational culture based on principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunities, key drivers to attract and retain talent.\n\nThe Group is committed to strengthening the resilience and flexibility of its organizational models through strategies of process simplification and digitalization, in order to enable the effectiveness and autonomy of the people who work at the Company within new agile working formulas, already tested effectively in response to the Covid-19 pandemic emergency, which will be a key element of future working models.\n\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cEnel people\u201d chapter.\nGovernance & culture\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\nThe risk of ineffective engagement of key stakeholders in relation to the strategic positioning of Enel on sustainability and financial objectives, due to the lack of understanding, anticipation, or orientation of their expectations, could cause incomplete integration of such expectations within the Company\u2019s business strategy and sustainability planning processes, with a potential negative impact on its reputation and competitiveness.\n\nEnel currently operates in a vast geographical area, with a presence in more than 40 countries distributed in five continents, conducting business activities that call for the development of infrastructure in local areas, which can provoke criticism or potential disputes with communities in some cases. Such conditions could lead to delays in the execution of projects for new sites and impacts on operational continuity, with a potential negative economic-financial and reputational effect.\n\nOn the other hand, Enel\u2019s commitment to decarbonize its energy mix \u2013 with a particular focus on the coal mining phase \u2013 could have a potential negative impact in local areas that are heavily dependent on coal operations (mining and electricity generation) in terms of job losses and socio-economic development. This could ultimately expose Enel to reputational risks or even delay the Group\u2019s achievement of the decarbonization goals set out in its Strategic Plan.\n\nIn the meantime, the outlook of investors is shifting fast: the changes in progress and challenges presented by the modern world are also revolutionizing the method of investing. The ESG investors are continuously increasing: since 2014 there has been a significant change such that at December 31, 2021 the SRI funds represent approximately 14.6% of share capital, whereas the signatory investors of the PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment) represent 46.6% of share capital.\n\nPossible incorrect or incomplete disclosure by Enel of the results obtained, and likewise ineffective communications to the financial community of its strategy, which aims to create value for customers, society, and the environment, could have significant negative impacts on the assessment of Enel\u2019s shares and bonds.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\nIn order to identify the priority issues for the Company and its stakeholders, materiality analysis is carried out annually, aimed at engaging and listening to all the Group\u2019s main stakeholders. This approach has also allowed us to develop robust actions for the new context associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, given the changed conditions caused by restrictions such as social distancing and restricted movement.\n\nTaking into account the results of the materiality analysis, the Group therefore defines its Sustainability Plan, to ensure alignment with stakeholders\u2019 expectations.\n\nSince 2015, a Creating Shared Value (CSV) model has been in force, centered on the integration of sustainability in the business, in which the Company\u2019s success is directly related to the prosperity of the communities where it operates.\n\nAs well as an objective, this model represents a precise methodology applied to all our Business Lines and therefore introduces a new way of managing community relations and integrating socio-environmental factors within the processes and throughout the entire value chain, with special reference to operations of business development, engineering and construction and procurement, in addition to the management and maintenance of assets.\n\nThe development of a business project is accompanied until its final definition through specific context analysis tools, stakeholder mapping, the definition of materiality matrices and action\nplans.\nIn addition, Enel promotes a fair and inclusive energy transition, through global reconversion and hybridization projects, in which over 40 sites around the world are currently engaged, with the aim of finding sustainable solutions (focused primarily on the energy reconversion and hybridization, the promotion of the circular economy and innovation, and the complementary development of third-party projects in full cooperation with local stakeholders) for the areas involved in the transition phase of thermoelectric sites.\nFrom an operational viewpoint, knowledge of specific local requirements and continually listening to the needs of stakeholders are fundamental elements for mapping as comprehensively as possible the potential positive, but also negative impacts that the Group\u2019s activity has on the communities where our plants operate.\nFurthermore, with a view to mitigating the risk associated with community relations and, more generally, human rights, we carry a specific analysis both for the individual country and for individual assets, continually to monitor the potential critical issues and respond rapidly to the emerging needs.\nSince 2019 the Investor Relations unit has organized an annual proactive engagement activity with the main Enel shareholders, on environmental, social, and governance issues.\nIn addition, by means of dialog with shareholders and bondholders, this collects feedback on how to integrate and improve the Group\u2019s reporting process and make its communications as effective as possible.\nFurther information on risk management can be found in the \u201cOur sustainable progress\u201d, \u201cLocal and global communities\u201d and \u201cSound governance\u201d chapters.\n\nDigital technology\n\nRisks related to cyber security\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\nThe speed of technological development, which brings an endless stream of new challenges, the frequency and intensity of the ever increasing number of cyberattacks, as well as the tendency to strike critical infrastructure and strategic industrial sectors, highlight a potential risk that can cause normal business operations to grind to a halt in extreme cases. Cyberattacks have changed dramatically in recent years: the number has grown exponentially, as has their level of complexity and impact (theft of corporate and customer data), with timely identification of sources becoming increasingly difficult. In terms of the Group, this is due to the numerous contexts in which it operates (data, industry, and people), in addition to the intrinsic complexity and interconnection of resources which, over the years, have been increasingly integrated into routine operating processes.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\nThe Group has adopted a holistic governance model in relation to cyber security, which is applied to the Information Technology (IT), Operational Technology (OT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) sectors. The framework is based on the commitment of Top Management, the global strategic approach, the involvement of all business areas, as well as the units responsible for the systems design and implementation. The framework is also committed to use the latest technology available\non the market to design ad hoc business processes, to strengthen people\u2019s IT awareness, and to implement regulatory requirements.\n\nMoreover, the Group has defined and adopted a management method for IT security in accordance with risk-based and cyber security by design approaches, thereby making the corporate risk analysis a key step in all strategic decisions. Enel has also set up a Cyber Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) to respond to and proactively manage possible incidents in the field of cyber security.\n\nIn addition, since 2019, in order to mitigate exposure not only with technical countermeasures, the Group has taken out insurance on the risks related to cyber security.\n\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cDigitalization\u201d and \u201cInnovability\u00ae\u201d chapters.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nThe Group is carrying out a complete digital transformation of the management of the entire energy value chain, developing new business models and digitalizing its business processes, integrating the systems and adopting new technologies. One result of this digital transformation is that the Group is increasingly exposed to risks relating to the operations of IT systems integrated across the Company, with impacts on processes and operating assets that could lead to the exposure of IT and OT systems to service interruptions or data losses.\n\nMitigation actions and associated strategic goals\n\nControl of such risks is guaranteed by a series of internal measures developed by the Group to oversee the digital transformation. In particular, an internal control system has been set up, which introduces control points along the entire IT value chain, enabling us to prevent the emergence of risks relating to such issues as the creation of services that do not meet business needs, the failure to implement adequate security measures and service interruptions. The internal control system oversees both the activities performed in-house and those outsourced to external associates and service providers. Enel is also promoting the dissemination of digital culture and skills within the Group, so as to guide the digital transformation successfully and minimize the associated risks.\n\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cDigitalization\u201d and \u201cInnovability\u00ae\u201d chapters.\n\nReference scenario and description of risk\n\nIn the era of digitalization and globalization of markets, Enel\u2019s business strategy is focused on accelerating the process of transformation towards a business model based on a digital platform, by means of a data driven and customer-focused approach, which is being developed throughout the entire value chain.\n\nThe Company, which is present in more than 40 countries, has the largest customer base in the public utilities sector (around 69 million customers), with a current workforce of approximately 66,000 people; consequently, the Group\u2019s new business model requires the management of an\nincreasingly relevant and growing volume of personal data in order to achieve the financial and business results envisaged in the 2022-2024 Strategic Plan. This implies an exposure to the risks associated with personal data protection (also due to the increasing volume of privacy regulations in the majority of countries in which Enel is present). These risks can take the form of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the personal data of customers, employees, and others (e.g. suppliers), resulting in the application of penalties in proportion to global sales, obstructing processes with consequent economic or financial losses and reputational damage.\n\n**Mitigation actions and associated strategic goals**\n\nIn order to manage and mitigate this risk, Enel has adopted a global model of personal data governance, partly through the assignment of privacy roles at all levels \u2013 including the appointment of Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d) both at a global and Country level \u2013 as well as via digital compliance instruments to map applications and processes and manage relevant risks to personal data protection, in compliance with the peculiarities of local sector regulations. Further information on risk management is given in the \u201cHuman rights\u201d section of this chapter.\n\n**Reference scenario and description of risk**\n\nEnel may be exposed to the risk of judicial measures, administrative sanctions, economic or financial losses and reputational damage as a result of:\n\n- illegal or illicit conduct, including active and passive acts of corruption, perpetrated by people inside or outside the Group in order to secure an unjust benefit for themselves or for others;\n- infringement of international, national, or local laws and regulations concerning: accounting, financial, or tax discipline, market disclosures, anti-trust and consumer rights issues or other applicable legislative provisions (e.g. rules concerning permitting or contracts, regulation of electricity markets, etc.).\n\n**Mitigation actions and associated strategic goals**\n\nEnel has adopted an Internal Control and Risk Management System expressed in company rules and procedures that all who work in Enel or on behalf of Enel are required to follow, by means of their respective contractual commitments. The Internal Control System also includes specific compliance programs, i.e.: the Code of Ethics, the Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan (ZTC Plan), the Policy on Human Rights, the Enel Global Compliance Program (EGCP), the Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01 and other national compliance programs adopted by Group companies in accordance with their national legislation. Furthermore, to further pursue its commitment to fighting corruption, Enel voluntarily decided to certify its Anti-Bribery Management System (SGPC) in compliance with the requirements of international standard ISO 37001:2016 (international certification of anti-bribery management systems). This certification process has involved the Group\u2019s main subsidiaries. External staff, working for Enel Group company suppliers, undertake to comply with the ethical clauses set out in their respective contracts, which incorporate references to Enel\u2019s commitment in terms of business integrity in the pursuit of its activities.\n\nThe ongoing monitoring of legislative and regulatory developments at the local, national and international levels is guaranteed by the operations of specific company Functions with competence in relation to these matters.\n\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter.\n\nIn relation to the specific contexts pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 concerning climate change, human rights, and the fight against corruption, we invite you to refer to the sections dedicated to these topics in this Sustainability Report.\n\nThe other types of risk to which the Enel Group is exposed are detailed in the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section of the Integrated Annual Report available on the website (www.enel.com, \u201cInvestors\u201d section).\nTransparency in institutional processes\n\nEnel constantly manages relations with institutions (local, national, European, and international) in line with the Enel Compliance Program, providing complete and transparent information with the aim of placing institutional counterparts in the best possible position to make the decisions within the sphere of their competence. Enel also contributes to the consultation processes regarding political and legislative dossiers on energy and environmental issues. In the context of relations with European institutions, Enel is actively present in every phase of the consultation process on political and legislative dossiers of corporate interest through careful monitoring and analysis (see also the chapter \u201cThe path to Net-Zero\u201d).\n\nThe Enel Group has been enrolled in the EU voluntary transparency register since its creation in 2008. The register aims to provide citizens with a single and direct access point to information on who carries out activities aimed at influencing the EU decision-making process, the interests pursued, and the resources invested in these activities (http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/homePage.do). In line with the provisions of the Code of Ethics, paragraph 3.26, Enel does not finance political parties, their representatives or candidates in Italy or abroad, nor does it sponsor conventions or events whose sole purpose is political propaganda. It refrains from any direct or indirect pressure on politicians (for example, by granting the use of its facilities, accepting new recruit recommendations, or awarding consultancy contracts). Enel and its subsidiaries are present in various trade and employer associations whose role includes representing the positioning of its members in the regulatory processes inherent in the business activity. The annual contributions paid to the above-mentioned organizations in the form of membership fees in 2021 totaled approximately 8.4 million euros, compared to 8.3 million euros in 2020(3). In particular, in 2021 the three largest contributions in terms of overall amount concerned AELEC (Asociaci\u00f3n de Empresas de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica) in Spain, Confindustria and Elettricit\u00e0 Futura in Italy(4).\n\nThe institutional dialogue with the trade and employer associations in which Enel and its subsidiaries took part in 2021 concerned the support of regulatory and consultation processes, including also the following main issues:\n\n- development of energy policies: including, among other topics, the strategic outlook of the sector, energy efficiency, the growth of renewables, smart grid development and energy costs(5);\n- increasing business competitiveness: including, among other topics, tax regulation, labor law issues and environmental policies(6).\n\nValues and pillars of corporate ethics\n\nA solid and dynamic ethical system, constantly oriented towards implementing best practices on the national and international levels is the foundational element of the Enel system of values underpinning the Company\u2019s operating assets, and of relations entertained with all its key stakeholders. A system based on compliance programs, including the Code of Ethics, Policy on Human Rights (see the chapter \u201cESG backbones \u2013 Human Rights Management\u201d), the Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan (TZC Plan), Enel Global Compliance Program, the Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01, plus any other national compliance models adopted by Group companies in accordance with local regulations.\n\nCode of Ethics\n\nIn 2002, Enel adopted at Code of Ethics that expresses the commitments and ethical responsibilities to which it adheres in its operating assets, regulating and harmonizing corporate conduct according to standards based\n\n---\n\n(3) These amounts include the contributions paid by Enel SpA (including the main Italian companies) and by its foreign subsidiaries Endesa, Enel Am\u00e9ricas and Enel Chile.\n\n(4) Specifically: Confindustria 1.7 million euros; Aelec (ex \u201cUNESA\u201d) 1.4 million euros; Elettricit\u00e0 Futura (formerly \u201cAssociazione Nazionale delle Imprese Elettriche\u201d) 0.7 million euros.\n\n(5) The 2021 contribution was 4.5 million euros.\n\n(6) The 2021 contribution was 3.9 million euros.\non the maximum transparency and integrity towards all stakeholders. The Code of Ethics is applicable to the entire Group, notwithstanding the cultural, social, and economic diversity between the various countries in which Enel operates. Enel also requires all its main suppliers and partners to adopt conduct in line with the Code\u2019s general principles. We draw your attention to the fact that in February 2021 the Board of Directors approved a further update of the Code of Ethics in order to align the contents with the current situation, the changes that have occurred in the organizational structure and in the Group\u2019s procedural system, and with national and international best practices. More information is available on the website https://www.enel.com/investors/sustainability/daily-commitment/sound-governance-ethical-conduct/principles-underpinning-our-work/code-ethics.\n\nStakeholder reports\n\nAny violation or suspected violation of the ethical system can be reported, also anonymously, through a single platform at Group level (\u201cEthics Point\u201d), which is accessible at www.enel.ethicspoint.com. The Audit Function receives and analyses these reports, performing the related checks and ensuring uniform treatment at Group level, in compliance with company policies and local regulations.\n\nThe reports management process is governed by the whistleblowing policy \u201cManagement of anonymous and non-anonymous reports\u201d, which guarantees anonymity and protection against any form of retaliation and also ensures adequate protection against groundless reports made maliciously to harm or cause prejudice to individuals and/or companies.\n\n| KPI                              | UM | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2021-2020 | %  |\n|----------------------------------|----|------|------|------|-----------|----|\n| Reports received                 | no.| 153  | 151  | 166  | 2         | -1 |\n| Violations related to incidents of: | no.| 41   | 26   | 38   | 15        | +58|\n| Conflict of interest/corruption | no.| 7    | 2    | 10   | 5         | -  |\n| Misappropriation                 | no.| 5    | 14   | 11   | -9        | -64|\n| Labor practices                  | no.| 25   | 9    | 11   | 16        | -  |\n| Community and society            | no.| 1    | -    | -    | 1         | -  |\n| Other reasons                    | no.| 3    | 1    | 6    | 2         | -  |\n\nDuring 2021, 153 reports were received through the Ethics Channel(7), which is generally in line with the previous year, with an increase in the incidence of verified violations. The cases of \u201cConflict of interest/corruption\u201d refer to episodes of failure to observe the internal policies in order to pursue personal interests. There has been a greater number of violations related to \u201cLabor practices\u201d(8), mainly related to respect for diversity and non-discrimination, attributed to individual behaviors that are inappropriate and/or harmful to personal dignity, for which measures have been taken and initiatives considered in order to improve the Company climate.\n\nOrganizational and Management Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01\n\nItalian Legislative Decree no. 231 of June 8, 2001 introduced an administrative (essentially criminal) liability into the Italian legal system for companies in respect of certain types of offences committed by directors, managers, or employees in the interest of or for the benefit of the companies concerned. Already in 2002, Enel \u2013 the first in Italy \u2013 adopted an Organizational and Management Model that meets the requirements of Legislative Decree 231/01 (Model 231). Since then, it has been constantly updated in line with the reference regulatory framework and current organizational context.\n\n(7) The Ethics Channel can also be used to send reports regarding the Group\u2019s commitments regarding human rights.\n(8) Of the violations that were verified related to labor practices, 15 are related to cases of behaviors that are inappropriate and/or harmful to personal dignity, and 10 related to health and safety issues.\nActive and passive fight against corruption\n\nIn compliance with the 10th Global Compact principle, according to which \u201ccompanies are committed to combating corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery\u201d, Enel intends to pursue its commitment to fighting corruption in all its forms \u2013 whether direct or indirect \u2013 by applying the principles expressed in the pillars of its Anti-Bribery Management System.\n\nEnel\u2019s Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) is based on the Group\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption by applying the criteria of transparency and conduct as set out in the Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan (ZTC Plan) and confirmed in the Anti-Bribery Policy adopted in compliance with international standard ISO 37001:2016 (anti-bribery management systems).\n\nTogether with the ZTC Plan, the pillars underpinning the ABMS are:\n\n- the Code of Ethics;\n- Models to prevent the main criminal risks (for example, bribery in relations with public administrations and among private individuals, environmental offences, corporate offences and, for Italian companies, manslaughter, severe personal injury or grievous bodily harm committed in violation of the rules on the protection of occupational health and safety), as described by the applicable regulations on corporate responsibility (the \u201cCompliance Program\u201d) in the various countries where the Group operates (for example, Organizational Model 231 for Italian companies, the Risk Prevention Model/Integrity Program for Group companies in Spain and Latin America);\n- the Enel Global Compliance Program (\u201cEGCP\u201d), a governance tool aimed at strengthening the Group\u2019s ethical and professional commitment to preventing offences committed outside Italy that might result in corporate criminal liability and reputational risks. The EGCP applies to the Group\u2019s non-Italian companies and supplements any compliance programs adopted by the same companies, in compliance with local regulations.\n\nThe mentioned governance measures (in relation to which we refer you to the specific section of the website), together with the current body of procedures, outline an effective prevention system, which is an integral part of the Group\u2019s Internal Control System.\n\nIn 2017 Enel SpA was among the first companies in the world to obtain certification of the conformity of its Anti-Bribery Management system to international standard ISO 37001:2016 (\u201cAnti-Bribery Management System\u201d). This certification was issued following an independent verification process, carried out by a primary accredited certification body, which was carried out in two separate phases, aimed primarily at certifying the adequacy of the design of the Enel anti-bribery management system (in terms of governance, roles, and responsibilities, control procedures, etc.), and secondarily at assessing the level of application and effectiveness.\n\nAfter Enel SpA obtained certification ISO 37001 for its anti-bribery management system, it gradually extended the 37001 certification plan to the Group\u2019s main Italian and foreign subsidiaries, guaranteeing maintenance of the certifications already obtained.\n\nData Protection\n\nProtection and processing of personal data are an important challenge for Enel in the era of digitalization and market globalization, and also a constant commitment to ensure continuous improvement of the service we supply to our customers.\n\nTo respond to this challenge in line with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679), in 2017 Enel set up a specific unit within the Legal Function (Data Protection Office) and appointed the data supervisors (\u201cData Protection Officers\u201d \u2013 DPO). The DPOs are appointed based on their professional skills and knowledge, and their ability to carry out the assigned tasks in accordance with the principle of independence. The Data Protection Office is structured as follows:\n\n- **Data Protection Governance**: a unit that monitors the evolution of data protection legislation and defines the Group\u2019s compliance. The office also carries out the role of DPO in countries in which the creation of a local Data Protection Office is not necessary;\n- **Holding and Global Service Functions Data Protection**: units that promote privacy by design from phase of process planning at the global level and ensure consistent development at the national level;\n- **Global Business Lines Data Protection**: a unit that supports the Global Business Lines in compliance concerning data protection, and monitors the evolution of data protection certification mechanisms for products and services;\n\u2022 **Country unit**: a unit that monitors the evolution of regulations on a local level and supports the local Business Lines as regards compliance related to data protection. In 2020 country units were set up in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru), alongside the European area units already in place (Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain).\n\nAlso internal tools were developed based on the size and complexity of Enel, in order to guarantee conformity of the protection and valorization of data to favor the presence of Enel in the European data economy, including the registers of personal data processing activities and impact assessment on data protection (DPIA \u2013 Data Protection Impact Assessment). The DPOs implement processes and activities in compliance with the indications of legislation concerning Personal Data Protection and are committed to drawing up data protection agreements and clauses; planning data governance and corporate policies; providing privacy consulting in the design and default phase; ensuring adequate risk management and monitoring the consistency of data protection policies within the organization, especially among European and non-European legal entities.\n\nFurthermore, in order to guarantee full and effective protection of personal data, the Group has adopted a digital platform (the Data Protection Platform), which is able to ensure digital compliance, through the use of the following tools:\n\n\u2022 **Processing register**, which integrates the registers of the data controller and the data processor on a single platform, guaranteeing the dynamic mapping of the processing activities and their life cycle, as well as the fulfilment of the obligations required by the regulation. For the Enel Group, this tool also represents an essential resource for designing and monitoring intra-group dynamics.\n\n\u2022 **Privacy by Design**, which makes it possible to create every new project in line with the principles regarding privacy.\n\n\u2022 **DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment)**, which makes it possible to perform an evaluation of the effective risks for the freedom and rights of the data subjects and to monitor the current risk of each processing operation that is changed in light of the implementation of a remedy plan.\n\n\u2022 **DTIA (Data Transfer Impact Assessment)**, which makes it possible to evaluate the transfer risk that accounts for the methods by means of which the data is transferred, as well as the regulatory aspects of the country where the data is transferred.\n\n\u2022 **Data Breach Management**, which permits the structured and timely management of all possible incidents that involve multiple companies and countries, and makes it possible to study these events in order to implement common prevention solutions.\n\n\u2022 **Analytics**, that, with the definition of precise KPI, makes it possible to continuously analyze, compare and monitor the data and processes processed by the Companies.\n\nIn 2021, the Group\u2019s companies handled more than 17,343 communications concerning personal data protection from customers, and collaborated with the national authorities, receiving 94 requests for information and clarifications.\n\n### Procedures started by competent Supervisory Authorities\n\nWith specific reference to **Italy**, the Data Protection Authority, with a notified measure on May 14, 2021, on the basis of some reports made by consumers who complained about receiving undesired marketing phone calls, started (i) a procedure for the adoption of corrective and disciplinary measures against Servizio Elettrico Nazionale, due to alleged privacy violations, disputing, in particular, undesired phone calls, the undue provision of personal data (POD, supply address, tax code, etc.) to unauthorized parties for third-party promotional purposes, and (ii) proceedings for the adoption of corrective and disciplinary measures toward Enel Energia, due to alleged privacy violations, disputing, in particular, the unsuitability of the activities for the supervision and control of internal data processing processes within the scope of telemarketing activities, as well as the failure to adopt a structured and effective action to prevent undesired calls. In relation to the proceedings brought against Enel Energia, a measure was issued on January 18, 2022 with which, at the end of the proceedings, the Data Protection Authority fined the Company for approximately 26 million euros, ordering also other prescriptive measures. The fine was contested by Enel Energia on February 9, 2022 before the Civil Court of Rome which, with an order dated March 20, 2022, ordered the suspension of its effects pending the judgement.\n\nIn 2021, in Spain the local control Authority started 30 proceedings in which: (i) 26 related to Endesa Energ\u00eda (of which only 11 are in progress); (ii) 3 related to Endesa X Services (of which only 2 are in progress); (iii) 1 related to e-Distribution.\n\nIn **Portugal**, in 2021, the Authority started proceedings against Endesa Generaci\u00f3n Portugal as a result of sending direct marketing communications to data subjects.\nwithout their prior consent, which resulted in a fine of 5,000 euros\\(^9\\).\n\nIn Brazil, between the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, the local control Authority started proceedings against Enel SP (i) regarding a data breach involving the personal data of customers in November 2020, as well as (ii) two proceedings related to the requests to exercise rights by the data subjects.\n\nIn Peru, the competent control Authority started proceedings in 2021 against Enel Distribuci\u00f3n Per\u00fa, which resulted in a fine of 14,500 euros due to the Company\u2019s failure to observe specific privacy guidelines issued by the same local Authority and through which an appeal was presented.\n\nIn Colombia, on February 10, 2021, the local control Authority started proceedings against Codensa due to the failure to observe the terms specified in the regulation concerning the online maintenance of the personal data of a data subject on the Company\u2019s website. On February 23, 2021, Codensa appealed these proceedings and there have not been any further investigations and/or penalties.\n\n### Data breach\n\nRegarding data breaches, during 2021 six violations of personal data were recorded within the scope of the Enel Group.\n\nIn particular, in Italy, four violations of personal data were notified to the Data Protection Authority. More specifically, with reference to Servizio Elettrico Nazionale, (i) a data violation was caused by the illegitimate behavior of an employee of the same Company, which led to the loss of confidentiality of the personal data of approximately 230 customers, (ii) the other concerned the improper use of customer e-mail addresses by 4 of the Company\u2019s sales partners, for the activation of energy bill information services, which involved 7,000 customers as data subjects. In relation to Enel Energia, the latter notified a data breach, which consisted in the activation by persons unknown, on behalf of Enel Energia customers, of contracts that were not requested with Sorgenia, in order to benefit from a promotion with Amazon offered by Sorgenia for new customers.\n\nAs regards CityPoste Payment, the latter notified an incident to the Data Protection Authority, as they were subject to a ransomware attack on two Company servers in June 2021, which led to the temporarily unavailability of personal data related mainly to Company customers. On August 30, 2021, the said Authority terminated the proceedings.\n\nIn Argentina, Empresa Distribuidora notified an incident \u2013 which occurred due to unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s website \u2013 to the local energy regulation Authority (Ente Nacional Regulador de la Electricidad).\n\nFinally, in Colombia, Codensa notified a violation of personal data to the local control Authority, which was caused by a security incident in the private area of an application used by customers only in Latin America.\n\n---\n\n\\(^9\\) As regards the administrative proceedings indicated for Portugal, it was notified by the local authorities after the closure of Endesa\u2019s Sustainability Report.\n### Human Rights\n\n#### Priorities\n- Economic and financial value creation\n- Engaging the local and global communities\n- Employees management, development & motivation\n- Occupational health and safety\n- Sustainable supply chain\n\n#### Plan\n\n**BACKBONES**\n- Human rights\n\n#### Targets\n\n| Activities | 2021-2023 targets | 2021 results | Status | 2022-2024 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Human rights due diligence | \u2022 In 2021: application of the site due diligence methodology to the pilot assets identified during the 2020 analysis | Site due diligence\\(^{(1)}\\): \u2022 Launched tool for Asset Level Human Rights Impact Assessment \u2022 Identified assets in pilot countries (Italy, Iberia, Chile, Colombia) | Definition of a strategic framework relating to the management of human rights in business operations, implementation of the ensuing action plans, analysis of the results and tailoring of the inputs to update the initial framework including any evolution of the international landscape | | S | 16 |\n| | \u2022 In 2022: extension of the application of the site due diligence methodology; review of the due diligence on the human rights management system to enable the use of the new IT platform during the process | | | | G | 17 |\n| | \u2022 In 2023: completion of the review of the due diligence on the human rights management system | | | | | |\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Due diligence activities at site level delayed because of Covid-19 pandemic situation.\nRespecting human rights is a fundamental element to empower sustainable progress. Our business model aims at creating sustainable value jointly with our internal and external stakeholders, innovating, and pursuing excellence and leveraging the respect of human rights along the whole value chain of our business activities. Innovation and sustainability are inseparable parts of our strategy, together with the spirit of service and care for the well-being of people and the society in which we operate. Engaging the main external and internal stakeholders is a crucial element to enhance awareness and develop a constructive dialogue that can provide a valuable contribution to the current challenges posed by societal impacts of economy decarbonization. Indeed, we belong to the territory, and we are an essential element in the lives of people, businesses, and society at large and their needs and priorities are an essential input for processes and products innovation, as well as being crucial for a competitive, inclusive and sustainable business model aiming at generating positive impacts in society. This means rejecting harmful practices like modern slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking, to name a few, and promoting diversity, inclusion, and equal treatment and opportunity, and guaranteeing that people are treated fairly and valued for their uniqueness throughout the entire value chain of the businesses in which we operate. The main reference international standards underpinning our commitment are the United Nations \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d framework outlined in its guiding principles on business and human rights and the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. Our commitment is transparently reflected in a specific policy on Human Rights developed and adopted as early as 2013. Such policy has been refreshed in 2021 to accommodate the evolution of the international reference frameworks and of our operating, organizational and management processes and strengthens and expands commitments already included in several codes of conduct like the Code of Ethics, Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan and the global compliance models. The updated text has been approved by the Board of Directors of Enel SpA and subsequently adopted by its subsidiaries. Engagement with our stakeholders, an essential element for all Enel\u2019s activities, is at the core of the policy updating as well: we have, indeed, held a consultation in line with the \u201cUN Global Compact Guide for business: how to develop a Human Rights Policy\u201d and we have involved people within our organization, as well as suppliers, human rights experts, think tanks, NGOs, other companies. We commit to respect such principles in any country where we operate, with due regard for the cultural, social, and economic diversities from one country to another and require that our stakeholders deal with us in accordance with them, with a particular attention to conflict affected and high-risk contexts. The updated Policy identifies twelve principles, classified into two macro-issues: employment practices and community relations and society, and sets out how environmental degradation and climate change are intertwined with human rights since the implementation of measures to mitigate the effects of the former will happen only if their societal impact is taken into account. The included principles have been selected\nbased on their relevance to our business activities and relationships, as well as on the outcome of the above-mentioned consultation process.\n\nThe most relevant integrations are as follows:\n\n- added introduction listing the connection of the principles with the broader industrial strategy and integration of the scope of application of the policy in terms of stakeholder categories most directly correlated to Enel\u2019s value chain, specifically: any party with a direct or indirect interest in Enel Group\u2019s business, such as customers, people working in the corporation, whether they are executives or employees, suppliers, contractors, partners, other companies and trade associations, the financial community, civil society, local, and indigenous and tribal communities, national and international institutions, the media, and the organizations and institutions that represent them;\n- strengthened the principles \u201cRespect for diversity and non-discrimination\u201d and \u201cHealth and safety\u201d. The latter has been renamed \u201cHealth, safety and well-being\u201d to accommodate the reference to the respect of physical and psychological well-being as well as the promotion of work-life integration behaviors; section, namely:\n  - \u201cEnvironment\u201d since a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment is integral to the full enjoyment of a wide range of human rights. Such principle is aligned to the environmental policy and introduces the notion of respect of biodiversity;\n  - \u201cRespecting the rights of local communities\u201d and \u201cRespecting the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples\u201d (the latter, according to with ILO Convention n. 169), which were formerly included in the broader \u201cRespecting the rights of communities\u201d principle;\n  - splitting of the \u201cPrivacy and communications\u201d principle in two separate ones, \u201cPrivacy\u201d and \u201cCommunications\u201d and strengthening of the messages of both as well as elaborating on their correlation with our customers in more detail.\n\nIn line with the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights we have a grievance mechanism in place to which stakeholders, whether internal or external, believing a violation might have occurred may resort.\n\nAnalysis of grievances is carried out by our Audit Function that contacts, if necessary, the person who has filed it and the person responsible of the alleged violation, ensuring uniform treatment at Group level, in compliance with Company policies and local regulations.\n\nWhenever, following a grievance, a violation of the principles contained in the Human Rights Policy is ascertained, the relevant procedure provided for in the Code of Ethics is implemented.\n\nWe ensure that whistleblowers are not subject to any acts of retaliation and that their identity remains confidential, unless otherwise required by the law.\n\nAny stakeholder who may be potentially affected has access to both digital and physical contact channels, which are also available for whistleblowing relating to potential violations of the Code of Ethics.\n\nMoreover, we have grievance channels also at local level and this ensures accessibility to all potentially affected stakeholders in their own language.\n\nFor detailed info on 2021 data, please refer to the section \u201cStakeholder reports\u201d included in the paragraph \u201cValues and pillars of company ethics\u201d of the chapter hereof.\n\nWe have committed to monitor the implementation of the policy i) through a specific due diligence process, ii) the promotion of practices in line with a just and inclusive transition, and iii) by reporting evidence of improvement plan actions identified to prevent and remedy should critical issues occur.\n\nSpecifically, as required by the UN Guidelines and by the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, we have developed a specific process of due diligence of human rights (described below). Such process covers the entire value chain across our geographic footprint and aims at identifying if any of our operating procedures and processes require an improvement plan to strengthen the management system that ensures we comply with the commitments undertaken in our Human Rights Policy.\n\nOur commitment extends to supporting heightened responsible business conduct also through European reference organizations, like Eurelectric, the utility-sector one, through which, during 2021 we have participated in the public consultation process concerning the draft directive on mandatory Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence and during 2022 we will contribute to its finalization.\n\nBesides the management system due diligence process, we ensure that sustainability, and hence respect of our commitment in terms of human rights, is an integral part\n\n---\n\n(10) Web or toll-free number shown on the Enel Code of Ethics web page or by writing to: Enel SpA - Audit Function - Code of Ethics. Via Dalmazia, 15 - 00198 Rome, Italy.\n\n(11) In the context of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (Principles 17-21), this term refers to a continuously evolving management system implemented by a company, in accordance with the sector in which it works, its operating contexts, its organizational structure, to ensure it is not involved in human rights violations. This implies \u201cidentifying, preventing, mitigating and reporting\u201d potential negative impacts deriving from the Company\u2019s business activities.\nof our corporate decision-making process thanks to an organizational and corporate governance model that sets out well-defined tasks and responsibilities of the main governance bodies. Namely:\n\n- the Board of Directors, acting through the Control and Risks Committee and the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee which carry out preparatory work aimed at making proposals and providing advice, is responsible for examining the main company rules and procedures of relevance with respect to stakeholders and connected to the Internal Control and Risk Management System. These include our Human Rights Policy, our Code of Ethics, our Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan and our global compliance models. Both committees are in charge of providing recommendations for changes to approval by the Board, if necessary, in order to bring such procedures in line with national and international best practices and with modifications in applicable laws and regulations;\n\n- the Innovability\u00ae Function, and, namely, the Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights unit, is responsible for:\n  - managing the positioning on human rights and ensuring that it is correctly reflected in any internal and external communication activity;\n  - integrating respect of the principles included in our human rights policy in corporate processes and planning and coordinating due diligence activities on the related management system, with the support of other units relevant to the process;\n  - reporting to the Control and Risk Committee and to the Corporate Governance and the Sustainability Committee on the implementation of the due diligence process and on the management of human rights-related activities;\n  - reporting annually within the Group\u2019s Sustainability Report how we respect human rights based on the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework.\nIn line with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ensuing Due diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, we have set up a process that entails the following steps:\n\n1. assessment of risk perceived by key stakeholders, at the individual country level, with regard to labor, local community, and environment-related rights;\n2. gap analysis aimed at assessing our operating and risk monitoring processes and identifying any potential shortfall;\n3. development of improvement plan actions to meet the gaps identified at step 2;\n4. monitoring of the progress in implementing the remedies included in the improvement plan.\n\nThanks to the due diligence on our human rights management system we assess 100% of the policies and operating procedures put in place to identify the risks of our direct and indirect operations along our entire value chain and of our new business relations (e.g. acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, etc.).\n\nThe process runs on three-year cycles and we are now in the 2020-2022 one. Worth noting is that the process was based on the text of the policy in force at the time the cycle started (2013 edition).\n\nHereafter, the outcome of step 1 and 2 for the current cycle:\n\n1. Assessment of the perceived risk\n\nA context analysis was run in 2020 in our countries of operation by consulting relevant stakeholders and experts in several fields, namely civil society, and academic institutions. Specifically, consultations involved direct and indirect workers, representatives of indigenous populations and local communities, trade unions and local institutions.\nConsultation outcomes were then ranked based on the seriousness and the likelihood of a potential violation\\(^{(12)}\\). Hereafter, a summary of the most significant results:\n\n- risks connected to bribery practices and impact on the environment ranked as \u201chigh-priority\u201d;\n- risks connected to labor practices violations (freedom of association and collective bargaining, rejection of forced and child labor, just and favorable working conditions, health and safety in the workplace, diversity, and inclusion) and to potential impacts on local communities ranked as \u201cto be monitored\u201d.\n\nProtection of local communities rights ranked higher in Latin American countries, confirming the results of the previous cycle, given the widespread presence of such groups in that geographical region.\n\n### 2. Gap analysis\n\nPractices and policies adopted to respect human rights across our geographic footprint were then assessed based on the outcome at step 1. This entailed interviewing the Top Management of the Group as well as assessing the value chain against more than 100 indicators.\n\nThe assessment was based on the four parameters of the UNGP operating principles:\n\n- public commitment to protect human rights;\n- adoption of human rights due diligence process;\n- preparation of a plan of action to remedy any gaps identified by the due diligence process;\n- adaptation to match local context and regulations.\n\nBriefly, the results of the due diligence highlighted we have in place a robust set of mechanisms and management systems to protect against possible human rights violations, which translates into an adequate level of management of identified risks.\n\n| Topics                        | Average perceived risk | System to protect human rights | Main policies and procedures to protect human rights | SDG |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| **Labor practices**           |                        |                                |                                                     |     |\n| Freedom of association and collective bargaining | to control | Robust | Enel is committed to respecting the freedom and collective bargaining rights of its workers. In particular, Enel recognizes their right to set up or join organizations formed to defend and promote their interests; it recognizes their right to representation by union organizations or other forms of representation, opposing any action of discrimination in the exercise of this right; it recognizes their right to engage in collective bargaining as the preferred instrument to establish the contractual conditions and to regulate relations between company management and trade unions. | 8   |\n| Rejection of forced labor     | to control             | Robust | The contracts considered overall regulate labor conditions, clearly defining workers\u2019 rights (working hours, remuneration, overtime, indemnity, benefits).

Improvement plans\n\nThe residual risk identified at the previous steps led to the definition of the necessary remedies which were then included in the improvement plan both at country and at global level, therefore ensuring uniformity of processes and policies across the Group\u2019s activities. Hereby a few examples of the actions defined:\n\n- Italy: inclusion of the link to our Human Right Policy in the business development procedures of the country\u2019s Infrastructure and Networks activity;\n- Argentina and Russia: implementation of training and internal communication activities aimed at raising awareness on the importance of respecting the commitments included in the Human Rights Policy;\n- Brazil: definition of an operating instruction to assess management of human rights of partners and sub-tier suppliers;\n- Chile: i) implementation of a communication and awareness-raising campaign on the Human Rights Policy aimed at all relevant stakeholders; ii) making the policy available to all relevant stakeholders, with particular focus on those with no access to digital media (i.e. indigenous populations).\n\nAs for labor practices, the assessment revealed they are perceived as \u201clow risk\u201d given also the compliance of the related control measures and processes with our internal policies and with the main international standards. However, we identified several minor areas of improvement that are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Topics                              | Business Lines                  | Countries                  | Areas of improvement                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Freedom of association and collective bargaining | Sustainability/People and Organization | Greece, Australia, India, Brazil | Development of training programs on human rights aspects, with a special focus on the relationship with social partners and definition of working conditions during bargaining procedures |\n| Rejection of forced labor           | People and Organization/ Sustainability/ Communication | Romania, Brazil            | Integration of control procedures and definition of further remedies in the case of intimidation and threats |\n| Rejection of child labor            | Global Procurement/ Legal and Corporate Affairs | Russia, Chile, Brazil      | Intensification of training and monitoring of the supply chain                        |\n| Diversity(13)                       | Sustainability, People and Organization | Mexico, Romania, Brazil    | Each action plan includes activities on the topic of disability based on the main findings resulting from the Value for Disability project |\n\nThe consolidated improvement plan for the current cycle includes 170 actions, covering 100% of operations and sites, as already anticipated. Implementation started at the beginning of 2021 and at year closing we have achieved 43% of progress.\n\nOnce improvement plans will be fully achieved, we will carry out an assessment of their effectiveness. In 2022, we will also launch application of the human rights due diligence at site level in a few pilot countries.\n\nTraining\n\nTraining is fundamental to raise awareness and understanding of the relevance of respecting human rights while conducting business. That is why each year we carry out specific training on several sustainability topics, including human rights. During 2021, we delivered approximately 1.9 million training hours on sustainability topics (up by 28% compared to the previous year) covering 86.6% of our workers. Specifically, the courses mainly addressed environmental protection, occupational health and safety, diversity and inclusion, relationships with communities, and anticorruption, with an average of 28 hours of training per capita, up from 21.7 hours in 2020. We have also developed a digital training course on human rights to share experience and best practices that place respect of human rights at the core of corporate activities. In 2021, we delivered more than 7 thousand training hours on human rights topics.\n\n(13) Diversity issues also include the assessment of aspects relating to equitable remuneration and non-discrimination.\nSecurity and human rights\n\nWe are committed to conducting security operations while respecting human rights, in line with the voluntary principles on security and human rights.\n\nThat is why we require that private security forces working to protect Group personnel and property in the operating areas act in compliance with the applicable national laws and international rules and standards, while simultaneously encouraging public law enforcement agencies to act in the same manner\u201d (principle 2.2.3 of our Human Rights Policy).\n\nIn general, according to national regulations, security services can be assigned only to public forces, or to private forces in the absence of legislative provisions.\n\nWe entrust security management to a dedicated unit at the holding level as well as to specific units in our countries of operation.\n\nThe main activities concern the collection and analysis of information for identifying potential security risks and how to manage them, in cooperation with all our Business Lines, reference institutions and other critical infrastructure operators.\nEnel is an industrial group whose main activity involves energy generation, distribution and sales. The selection of the countries where the Group operates is guided exclusively on business assessments.\n\n**Tax strategy**\n\nSince 2017 the Enel Group has had a tax strategy, which is understood as a set of principles and guidelines inspired by the values of transparency and legality and that is published online at: www.enel.com.\n\nThe Group\u2019s subsidiaries are required to adopt the tax strategy approved by the Parent Company, thereby assuming the responsibility of ensuring it is acknowledged and applied.\n\n**Tax strategy objectives**\n\nThe Board of Directors of Enel SpA defines the tax strategy of the entire Group, with the objective of ensuring uniform management of taxation for all concerned entities, which is inspired by the following logic:\n\n- correct and timely determination and settlement of taxes due under the law and implementation of the respective obligations;\n- correct management of the tax risk, which is the risk of violating tax regulations or abusing the principles and purposes of the tax law.\n\n**Principles of the tax strategy**\n\nThe principles of the tax strategy represent the guidelines for the Group companies, which inspire Company operations in the management of the tax variable and require the adoption of suitable processes that guarantee their effectiveness and application.\n\n**Values**: in line with its own sustainability strategy, the Group manages its tax assets according to the values of honesty and integrity and is aware that the revenues deriving from levies represent one of the main sources of contribution toward economic and social development of the countries in which it operates.\n\n**Legality**: the Group pursues behavior oriented toward observance of the applicable tax provisions and is committed to interpreting them in order to respect the substance in addition to the form.\n\n**Tone at the top**: the Board of Directors has the role and responsibility of guiding the promotion of a corporate culture that is based on the values of honesty, integrity and the principle of legality.\n\n**Transparency**: the Group maintains collaborative and transparent relations with tax authorities, enabling them \u2013 among other things \u2013 to gain a full understanding of the facts underlying the application of tax rules.\n\n**Shareholder value**: the Group considers tax to be an economic component of business and, as such, believes that it must be managed in compliance with the principle of legality, with the aim of safeguarding the Group\u2019s assets and pursuing the primary interest of creating value for shareholders in the medium to long term.\nGovernance\n\nEnel SpA ensures that the tax strategy is acknowledged and applied within the Company through the governance bodies. Its interpretation is left to the Parent Company, through the Tax unit, which also manages its periodic updates.\n\nCompliance\n\nThe Group entities must respect the principle of legality, by swiftly applying the tax laws of the countries where the Group operates, to ensure that the wording, spirit and purpose of the applicable tax rule or system is respected. Moreover, the Enel Group does not undertake behaviors or domestic or cross-border operations that result in purely artificial constructions, that do not respect the economic reality and from which it is reasonable to expect undue tax advantages, where they conflict with the purpose or spirit of tax provisions or system in question and give rise to double deduction, deduction/non-inclusion or double non-taxation, including as a result of any divergence between the tax systems of different jurisdictions.\n\nIntercompany transactions\n\nAll intercompany transactions follow a transfer pricing policy, which has been adopted by the Enel Group in line with the arm\u2019s length principle, an international standard established by the Model Tax Convention and referred to in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (hereinafter also referred to as the \u201cOECD Guidelines\u201d). Intercompany relations are structured at market prices and conditions, ensuring value creation in the places where the Group conducts its business.\n\nIn line with the applicable regulations, the Enel Group encourages the signing of rulings (Advance Pricing Agreements \u2013 APAs) with local tax authorities on establishing transfer pricing determination methods, on attributing gains and losses to permanent establishments and on applying rules on cross-border flows between Group entities.\n\nFor intercompany financial transactions, the Enel Group has adopted a centralized finance model for its subsidiaries, which requires the Group\u2019s two financial companies, Enel Finance International (EFI) and Enel Finance America (EFA), to centralize part of the treasury activities and access to financial markets, and to act as the primary point of reference for the management of the financial or liquidity needs generated by operating entities.\n\nThe Group has adopted internal policies, in line with the recommendations included in the OECD guidelines, that support the methodology of the application of price comparison \u2013 CUP (criterion that compares the price of goods and/or services transferred in an operation that took place between associated companies with the price applied in transactions with/between independent third parties), which is the most direct and reliable for the purpose of applying the principle of free competition.\n\nLow-tax jurisdictions\n\nThe Group does not invest in \u2013 or through \u2013 countries considered to be tax havens for the sole purpose of reducing its tax burden. Such investments may only be proposed if they are supported by sound economic/strategic reasons and have the aim of developing the activities included in the Group\u2019s corporate purpose.\n\nIf, in circumstantial situations (for example, in the event of company purchases from third-parties) structures were found to have been created for the sole purpose of reducing the tax burden or in areas deemed to be tax havens, the Group \u2013 failing any viable economic/strategic reasons other than mere tax savings \u2013 will commit to removing such structures as quickly as possible.\nTax incentives\n\nTax incentives are a key, development-oriented mechanism for economic policy, which countries use to stimulate growth and attract investment to support the national policy. The use of tax incentives generally determines a reduction in long-term tax payables or only the temporary deferral of the tax payment. Some countries where the Enel Group operates offer various incentives. The Enel Group only uses widely applicable tax incentives for all operators and respects all specific regulations, where the incentives are in line with its industrial and operational objectives and are consistent with the economic substance of its investments.\n\nTax governance, control and risk management\n\nGovernance body\n\nIn Enel\u2019s organisational model, the Holding Company\u2019s Tax Affairs unit is tasked \u2013 among other things \u2013 with developing the Group\u2019s tax strategy, identifying, analyzing and managing the various optimisation initiatives, monitoring the key tax issues and providing its support to the various Business Lines. Alongside the Holding Function, the Tax Affairs units of the various countries \u2013 acting in accordance with the values and principles of the tax strategy set out by the Holding Company \u2013 are responsible for managing compliance, tax planning and tax monitoring at local level.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Enel Group has adopted a set of rules, procedures and standards which are part of the Group\u2019s wider organization and control system and which are considered key points of reference that all parties, depending on their type of relationship with the Group, are required to observe. The various policies and procedures applicable both at Group level and Country level govern the activities, as well as their management procedures and Tax Affairs responsibilities including in relation to other corporate Functions. These documents are published on the company intranet and are accessible to all Enel people; they form the general rules of conduct applicable within the Group when carrying out activities. Specifically in relation to taxation, in addition to the tax strategy there are specific organisational documents \u2013 both at global and local level \u2013 regarding the processes of tax compliance, tax planning, tax monitoring, transfer pricing and tax risk management. The general principle is that the Tax units must be the appropriate size and equipped with the necessary skills to perform the role of a decision-making analysis centre within the governance and business processes, in addition to the role of overseeing performance. For this purpose, specific and ongoing training initiatives on tax issues at both Country and global level are set up, with recurring meetings between all of the Group\u2019s Tax Managers in order to ensure the appropriate alignment.\n\nTax risks\n\nThe Group has a Tax Control Framework (TCF) whose main aim is to provide the Tax units with a single and consistent set of guidance for adopting a correct and effective approach to tax risk management within the Group. The framework sets out guidelines and methodological rules so as to consistently assess, monitor and manage the relevant tax risk for the Group companies, in accordance with the principles and guidelines set out by the tax strategy and Tax Risk Policy, and in the awareness that the Group companies operating in different jurisdictions must adopt the TCF with respect for the specific corporate context and domestic regulations of each country in question.\n\n(14) For example: Code of Ethics; Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan; Enel Global Compliance Program (EGCP), corporate policies, models and procedures; the tax strategy; the Internal Control and Risk Management System; the proxy system; the sanctions system referred to in the applicable CCNL; any other documentation relating to the current control systems; the relevant accounting standards; procedures and IT applications.\nIn this regard, the Group has adopted a Tax Risk Policy whose main objective is to provide unambiguous and consistent guidance to the Tax units when implementing the TCF at a local level.\n\nIn accordance with the established principles and guidelines, the Enel Group aims to proactively manage the tax risk and believes that adopting a TCF can ensure the timely detection, correct measurement and control of the risk tax. The task of the TCF is to identify the sources of tax risk for the purpose of compliance and interpreting tax regulations, while mapping out the respective processes and activities in order to form a network of risk detectors, to be associated with the resulting control measures. In particular, as the set of detectors and control measures identify sources of risk, the TCF can perform a broad spectrum of control. As such, any materialization of the tax risk can be intercepted and managed by each Tax unit in question. The effectiveness and ongoing updates of the TCF are ensured through periodic monitoring of the risk mapping, regular internal audit processes, as well as through the tax authority systems set out under cooperative compliance regimes (where implemented).\n\nThe results from the monitoring of tax risks are periodically brought to the attention of the competent Functions and corporate bodies, including to establish the most appropriate way to mitigate such risks. With regard to significant uncertain tax positions, reference should be made to the information and comments provided in the Annual Financial Report.\n\n**Participation in Cooperative Compliance schemes**\n\nThe Enel Group promotes participation in Cooperative Compliance schemes where they exist in the various countries in which it operates, for companies that met the legal requirements for participation. In particular, Enel participates in the Collaborative Fulfilment scheme in Italy(15), for larger companies, in the equivalent scheme in Spain (C\u00f3digo de Buenas Pr\u00e1cticas Tributarias)(16) and is collaborating with the federal tax authority in Brazil in a pilot project for the creation of a local cooperative compliance model (Projeto CONFIA - Conformidade Cooperativa Fiscal)(17).\n\nIn addition to the following countries, various activities are in progress to be able to potentially adhere to additional cooperative compliance systems (e.g. France, Portugal, South Africa, Russia, etc.).\n\n**Mechanism for stakeholder reports**\n\nFor the Enel Group, tax compliance is considered a key aspect of the Company\u2019s ethical and responsible management. As such, the violations that can be reported through the Company\u2019s internal channels also include those relating to tax. The Group\u2019s Code of Ethics is the framework of \u201cethical management\u201d which Enel operates, also tying in fully with the tax strategy. There are appropriate provisions on Code of Ethics violations to ensure its effective implementation, and these requirements must also be considered to cover the provisions of the tax strategy.\n\n---\n\n(15) https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/web/guest/schede/agevolazioni/regime-di-adempimento-collaborativo/elenco-societa-ammesse-al-regime.\n(16) https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/colaborar-agencia-tributaria/relacion-cooperativa/foro-grandes-empresas/codigo-buenas-practicas-tributarias.html.\n(17) https://www.gov.br/receitafederal/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/acoes-e-programas/confia.\nTransparent relationship with stakeholders\n\nThe constant commitment of the Enel Group to transparency with respect to the tax authorities and all stakeholders concretely underlines the importance it attributes to the tax variable and its role in the sustainable development of the Company.\n\nTherefore, the Group is committed to providing a transparent explanation of the tax issues that can also be of interest to third parties, also on its website, making it an information hub that is easily accessible and understandable for all.\n\nFurthermore, the Enel Group ensures transparency and integrity in its relations with tax authorities, in the event of audits on both the Group companies and third parties. To consolidate this transparency with tax authorities, the Enel Group promotes engagement in co-operative compliance schemes for companies that integrate the requirements of their respective domestic regulations in order to reinforce their relations. It also complies with the transfer pricing documentation provisions in accordance with OECD Guidelines, taking the \u201cthree-tiered approach\u201d which is divided into: Master File, Local File and Country-by-Country Report. Moreover, to avoid double taxation, the Group promotes mutual agreement procedures for the settlement of international disputes (Mutual Agreement Procedure \u2013 MAP), which have the direct involvement of tax authorities from the contracting countries. Lastly, Enel consistently acts with a transparent and collaborative approach with all institutions and associations to support the development of effective tax systems in the various countries where it operates.\n\nIn 2019, Enel joined the European Business Tax Forum (EBTF), an association that aims to open up a public debate on taxation by providing a balanced and comprehensive perspective of the taxes paid by companies. In view of this objective, tax information is provided to the various stakeholders. The Forum has published three studies relating to the EU/EFTA Total Tax Contribution for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020, which are available on the association\u2019s website (https://ebtforum.org) and which report the aggregate data for the various types of taxes paid by the largest European multinational companies by turnover and/or by stock market capitalization, as well as, since 2019, a dedicated section with Country-by-Country Reporting.\n\nFurthermore, in 2021 Enel adhered to the B Team Responsible Tax Principles, that is the principles developed by the B Team for promoting responsible and sustainable tax practices, for a better future.\n\nIn particular, the B Team Responsible Tax Principles were developed by the international B Team organization, which was created by a group of multinationals, with the contribution of civil society, investors and representatives of international institutions for promoting responsible and sustainable tax practices.\n\nReporting\n\nActing with honesty and integrity is one of the main cornerstones of our tax strategy, as is our commitment to transparency.\n\nThe publication of Country-by-Country Reporting integrated with the detail of our overall tax contribution in the main economies in which the Group operates (hereafter also \u201cTax Transparency Report\u201d), underlines the importance that the Group attributes to tax related issues, to their social role and, in general, to transparency as a factor that facilitates sustainable development.\n\nThe approach followed also aims to eliminate potential ambiguities that may derive from complex accounting and tax treatments, while supporting and, at the same, time improving other annual financial information and continuing along a pathway targeted at supplying an increasingly in-depth and clear vision of our tax position.\n\nAs of 2018 (2018-2017), we have adopted a Total Tax Contribution model for the main countries where we operate, providing evidence of taxes paid and of withholding tax deductions.\n\nBeginning 2020, on the other hand, we adopted an integrated model: the Tax Transparency Report. This is pre-\npared consistently with the rules provided for under OECD Country-by-Country Reporting\\(^{(20)}\\) and includes information and data for Total Tax Contributions in the main countries where we are present.\n\nThe integrated model of the Tax Transparency Report is available on our site (https://www.enel.com). The Group believes that this model ensures a broad vision and a detailed measurement of the organization\u2019s contributions to economic and social development in the regions/countries in which it operates.\n\n**Tax Transparency Report \u2013 principles**\n\nThe Tax Transparency Report adopts the *cash criterion* as a general principle for representing tax data, considering it to be the most adequate for disclosing the actual tax contribution. More specifically, the total tax data, as defined and detailed in what follows, is determined through the various taxes paid\\(^{(21)}\\) by all the entities in the scope of each tax jurisdiction in the year subject to reporting, regardless of the tax year to which the taxes refer. As anticipated previously, on applying an approach adopted by the OECD\\(^{(22)}\\), the Tax Transparency Report classifies the different taxes into categories and distinguishes them between those that constitute an expense for the Company (*taxes borne*) and those that the company pays due to rebate mechanisms, substitution, etc. (*taxes collected*); but that, at any rate, are the result of the company\u2019s own economic activities.\n\nSpecifically, taxes, both borne and collected, are classified into the following five macro-categories.\n\n**Profit \u2013 Income taxes:** this category includes taxes on company income that can be both borne (e.g. tax on the income of companies at State or local level, taxes on production, solidarity contributions, tax levied on income deriving from specific activities such as the extraction of natural resources the generation and sale of hydroelectric energy as well as taxes withheld at source) and collected, in the case where they are applied to a third party or to a physical person (e.g. withholding taxes on interest income, royalties, subcontractors and suppliers). Income taxes do not include taxes on dividends paid by Enel Group entities.\n\n**People \u2013 Taxes on labor:** this category generally includes taxes on labor, comprising those on incomes and social welfare contributions. Taxes applied to the employer are considered taxes borne (e.g. social welfare contributions, health insurance, pensions, disability contributions), while income taxes applied to workers are considered as taxes collected (e.g. taxes on incomes of physical persons or social welfare contributions debited to workers that are normally withheld by the employer).\n\n**Products \u2013 Taxes on products and services:** indirect taxes applied on production, sale or use of goods and services, trade and international transactions. This category includes taxes that can be paid by businesses with reference to their own consumption of goods and services, regardless of the fact that they are paid to the supplier of the goods and services rather than directly to the Government. This category includes both taxes borne (e.g., taxes on consumption, turnover taxes; excise duties\\(^{(23)}\\); customs duties; import duties; taxes on insurance contracts, non-deductible VAT) as well as taxes collected (e.g., VAT paid, excise duties\\(^{(24)}\\), taxes on goods and services).\n\n**Property \u2013 Property taxes:** income taxes on property, the use or transfer of tangible or intangible assets. This category includes both taxes borne (e.g. taxes on property and the use of real estate; capital tax applied on the increase of risk capital; taxes on the transfer, purchase or sale of assets; net equity and capital transactions; registration fees; stamp duty for the transfer of real estate; stamp duty for the transfer of shares; taxes on financial transactions that imply loans or borrowings from a foreign source), and taxes collected (e.g. taxes on leases collected by the lessor and paid to the government).\n\n**Planet \u2013 Environmental taxes\\(^{(25)}\\):** these include taxes and duties on energy products (including fuel for vehicles), on motor vehicles and transport services; and on the supply, use or consumption of goods and services considered harmful to the environment, as well as the management of waste, noise, water, land, soil, forests, biodiversity, wild animals and fish stocks to be paid by the entity. Examples of taxes borne: taxes on the value of the generation of elec-\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(20)}\\) Beginning 2018, the Enel Group presented the Country-by-Country Reports for the years 2016-2020. This was by way of transmission thereof to the Italian Agenzia delle Entrate which in turn supplied them to the other States with which an agreement is in force for the exchange of information, in compliance with the indications of Action 13 of the BEPS project, as amended. Action 13 is a project in which the OECD and the countries of the G20 have participated to reply in a coordinated and shared manner to the strategies of aggressive tax planning put in place by multinational companies with a view to \u201cartificially shifting\u201d profits in jurisdictions characterized as tax havens.\n\n\\(^{(21)}\\) The data for taxes paid includes payments on account, taxes for previous years, including after assessments, net of repayments and redemptions obtained. Interest and penalties are not considered.\n\n\\(^{(22)}\\) Working Paper n. 32, \u201cLegal tax liability remittance responsibility and tax incidence\u201d.\n\n\\(^{(23)}\\) With exception of those recorded under environmental taxes (e.g. duties on gas and electric energy).\n\n\\(^{(24)}\\) With exception of those recorded under environmental taxes (e.g. duties on gas and electric energy).\n\n\\(^{(25)}\\) The classification of taxes as environmental is based on the shared definition within the harmonized statistic framework developed jointly, in 1997, by Eurostat, the European Commission, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the International Energy Agency (IEA), according to which environmental taxes \u201care taxes whose tax base is a physical quantity (or the proxy of a physical quantity) of an element that has a proven and specific negative impact on the environment. All energy and transport taxes are included, whereas all taxes on added value are excluded.\u201d Source: https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6437.\ntricity, taxes on the production of nuclear fuels and carbon tax. Examples of taxes collected: taxes on electricity, taxes on hydrocarbons and duties on gas and electric energy. Furthermore, the financial-equity data represented follow the accounting requirements below.\n\nData source: the data represented in the report are expressed on the basis of IFRS-EU accounting principles adopted by the Group and are at stand-alone entity level. Subsequently, these are aggregated by tax jurisdiction. To take account of intercompany relations, the data are represented according to logic of aggregation by tax jurisdiction (that is, the country in which the entities are resident for tax purposes and where they enjoy fiscal autonomy) and not a logic of consolidation.\n\nEntities within the scope: falling within the scope of the report are all those companies consolidated using the full consolidation method or the proportional method (hereafter also \u201centity within the scope\u201d) on the basis of accounting principles used for the drafting of the Consolidated Financial Statements on the part of the Ultimate Parent Entity (Enel SpA).\n\nWith reference to the list of companies in the Group and their activities, please refer to the specific prospectus in the Consolidated Annual Report 2021.\n\nCurrency: the report considers the euro as the currency of reference in that it is the one used by the Parent Company. Since IFRS-EU accounting data are extracted in local currencies, economic data (such as revenues, pre-tax profit, taxes accrued and taxes paid) have been converted into euro at the average exchange rate of the currency, while balance sheet data (tangible fixed assets) have been converted into the euro at the exchange rate in force at year\u2019s end.\n\nThird party revenues: the sum of revenues from third parties accounted for by the entities within the scope in the pertinent tax jurisdiction in the year of reference. The term \u201crevenues\u201d is understood in the broadest possible sense to include all revenues, comprising those from extraordinary operations.\n\nCross-border inter-company revenues: the sum of revenues from transactions carried out between entities within the scope resident in different jurisdictions in the tax year of reference, including income from extraordinary operations and excluding dividends.\n\nProfit (Loss) before income taxes: the sum of Profits (Losses) before income taxes generated in the year of reference and involving all entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction. The Profits (Losses) before income taxes must include all items involving revenues and extraordinary costs.\n\nIncome taxes accrued for companies (current taxes): the sum of current taxes (i.e. for the year in progress) on taxable income in the year of reference of all entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction, independent of whether they have been paid. The data for these does not take account of provisions for tax debts that are not yet certain as regards either their amount or existence, of adjustment of current taxes for previous years and of prepaid and deferred taxes.\n\nTangible assets: the sum of net accountable values of tangible fixed assets resulting from the balance sheet, of all entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction.\n\nNumber of employees and remuneration: the number of employees at the end of the period considering all the entities within the scope; conversely, as regards their remuneration, please see the Sustainability Report as well as the Tax Transparency Report.\n\nCapital: the accounting value of share capital as taken from the Financial Statements of all the entities within the scope.\n\nProfit reserves: this item represents the amount of net profit realized by the entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction over the past years, net of dividends paid and any other reduction due to losses, capital increases, etc.\n\n---\n\n(26) However, the companies consolidated using the equity method are excluded. Furthermore, the data of Permanent Establishments are reported in the jurisdiction of their operations and not in the jurisdiction of associated companies. Therefore, the data of the latter do not include the data of the Permanent Establishment. Finally, all stateless companies of the Enel Group are flow-through entities incorporated in the same country in which income is imputed and is effectively taxed in the partner company (e.g. the United States).\n\n(27) See Assonime circular no. 1/2021. Gli obblighi di trasparenza in materia di tassazione secondo lo standard GRI 207 (Transparency obligations in the matter of taxation in Non-Financial Disclosures according to standard GRI 207), where it is clarified that it is possible to make reference to other sources (known as \u201cincorporation by reference\u201d) such as the Directors\u2019 Report in the Consolidated Financial Statements or in the attachments for the list of Group companies and their main activities, and the Directors\u2019 Report or other sections of the NFD with regard to information already contained therein on uncertain tax positions and on any other information relevant for the purposes of GRI 207.\n\n(28) Specifically, also included are (i) other income, (ii) all extraordinary income (e.g. capital gains from the sale of real estate, unrealized capital gains/capital losses) and (iii) financial income (with the exception of dividends from other companies within the scope) or any extraordinary item. Revenues from income taxes (deriving from deferred tax liabilities or from tax consolidation) are excluded.\n\n(29) Revenues do not include payments received from other entities within the scope that are considered dividends in the tax jurisdiction of the paying subject.\n\n(30) Consistent with the reporting criteria applied to Revenues, Profits (Losses) before income taxes are indicated net of dividends paid by the companies within the scope (as also indicated by the OECD in the report \u201cGuidance on the Implementation of Country-by-Country Reporting\u201d published in 2019 point II.7).\n\n(31) Tangible fixed assets do not include cash and cash equivalents, intangible assets or financial assets.\n\n(32) The introduction of the disclosure related to the \u201cCapital\u201d and \u201cUndistributed profit\u201d items in the Sustainability Report 2021 further enriches the Report content in relation to CBCR OECD. Furthermore, the introduction of this information, in particular that related to \u201cUndistributed profit\u201d supplements the disclosure with what is required by the Directive 2013/34 (modified by the Directive (EU) 2021/2101) on the topic of the publication of income tax information (the so-called public CbCr). This additional information provides the disclosure with this content in advance of what is required in art. 48 octies of the above-mentioned Directive.\nThe total tax contribution has been calculated considering the main countries in which the Group is present. These represent more than 99% of revenues and practically 100% of income taxes paid. For all the other countries the income taxes of the companies have, nonetheless, been indicated in detail. The following countries are included: Italy, Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Guatemala, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama, Romania, Russia, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United States, Canada, Greece, South Africa, India, Portugal, France and Germany.\n\nhttps://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/web/guest/schede/istanze/costituzione-gruppo-iva/scheda-informativa-costituzione-iva.\n\nThis system has introduced a single and autonomous taxpayer with a single VAT no. that is valid for all participating companies in replacement of their individual VAT no.\n\nThe split payment, is a particular system that, in Italy, establishes for some entities that the party responsible for paying VAT is the transferee/client instead, as normally takes place, the transferor/provider. As a result, for operations subject to a split payment, the purchaser does not pay VAT to their supplier in consideration of the fact that it is \u201cpaid\u201d directly to the tax authorities.\n\nPIS \u201cprograma de integra\u00e7\u00e3o Social\u201d and COFINS \u201cContribui\u00e7\u00e3o para financiamento de Seguridade Social\u201d.\n\nThe Total Tax Contribution (TTC), with respect to all the countries in which we operate, was equal to 11,513.6 million euros in 2021.\n\nThere were some extraordinary phenomena in 2021 that influenced the tax contribution. Specifically: 1) in Italy, the Group adhered to an innovative VAT system provided for under local tax regulations that produced significant simplifications intercompany and supplier invoicing mechanisms (so-called Group VAT). The creation of Group VAT has led, with the same amount of tax revenue payable, to a \u201creplacement effect\u201d in the payments of VAT generated by the business activities of Italian companies. More specifically, the VAT Enel previously paid to the tax authority on behalf of suppliers (in application of the so-called \u201csplit payment\u201d) is now paid by Enel to the suppliers, as a payment of their invoices, and then the latter pays them to the tax authorities, all of which does make any change to the overall financial profile for the parties or to the tax revenues paid; 2) in Spain, following a sentence of the Tribunal Supremo regarding the non-retroactivity of an environmental tax called \u201ccanon hidr\u00e1ulico\u201d, extraordinary repayments and redemptions were received in 2021 related to payments made over previous years; 3) in Brazil following a decision of the Federal Supreme Court that changed the methods for the determination of the PIS and Cofins social taxes, the correlated payments were reduced. Overall, these extraordinary effects led to lower payments equal to approximately 3,500 million euros.\n\nNet of the extraordinary phenomena described above, the total contribution would have been equal to 15,013.6 million euros, which is substantially in line with the previous year, confirming the importance of the Group\u2019s tax contribution for the communities in which it operates as support for their stability and resilience, which is an aspect that is even more necessary in order to face the continuation of the needs resulting from Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe distribution of the overall contribution in the various countries in which the Group operates is given in the following table, with 82.8% concentrated in Italy, Spain and Brazil, which represent about 83.0% of Group revenues.\n\n### Total Tax Contribution per country (\u20ac/mil)\n\n| Country       | Total Tax Collected (cash accounting) | Total Tax Contribution (cash accounting) | Total Tax Borne (cash accounting) |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Italy         | 2,974.7                              | 4,455.2                                  | 1,480.5                          |\n| Spain         | 1,455.2                              | 2,519.1                                  | 1,063.9                          |\n| Brazil        | 1,906.1                              | 2,562.2                                  | 656.2                            |\n| Colombia      | 57.3                                 | 422.4                                    | 365.0                            |\n| Chile         | 128.1                                | 282.1                                    | 154                              |\n| Argentina     | 189.0                                | 248.8                                    | 59.8                             |\n| Romania       | 202.8                                | 230.9                                    | 28.1                             |\n| Peru          | 64.7                                 | 187.5                                    | 122.8                            |\n| Portugal      | 149.0                                | 159.9                                    | 10.9                             |\n| USA&Canada    | 45.9                                 | 93.5                                     | 47.6                             |\n| France        | 82.0                                 | 82.5                                     | 0.5                              |\n| Netherlands   | 28.1                                 | 78.4                                     | 50.3                             |\n| Germany       | 59.5                                 | 60.4                                     | 0.9                              |\n| Panama        | 3.5                                  | 32.3                                     | 28.8                             |\n| Mexico        | 19.9                                 | 29.8                                     | 9.9                              |\n| Greece        | 3.8                                  | 27.7                                     | 23.9                             |\n| Russia        | 3.9                                  | 20.8                                     | 16.9                             |\n| Guatemala     | 5.0                                  | 7.9                                      | 2.9                              |\n| Costa Rica    | 2.5                                  | 5.7                                      | 3.2                              |\n| South Africa  | 3.8                                  | 3.8                                      | -                                |\n| India         | 2.2                                  | 2.6                                      | 0.4                              |\n\n**Total**\n\n| Total (\u20ac/mil) | 7,387.1 | 11,513.6 |\n|---------------|---------|----------|\n| 4,126.5       |         |          |\nIn 2021 the Total Tax Borne\\(^{(37)}\\) amounts to 4,126.5 million euros\\(^{(38)}\\) in reduction of the overall 133.5 million euros (-3.1%) with respect to 2020 due to the extraordinary repayments and redemptions of environmental taxes paid on products and services. This was partially offset by an increase in income taxes and property taxes. Net of the cited extraordinary effects (333 million euros) the tax borne would have increased an amount equal to approximately 200 million euros (+5%).\n\nThe payment of environmental taxes is down overall by 313.6 million euros. The most relevant reductions were recorded in Spain (278.2 million euros), Italy (27.5 million euros) and Chile (6.5 million euros) mainly due to the effect of (i) repayments and redemptions received\\(^{(39)}\\) and payment suspension measures for taxes on electricity in Spain and the (ii) decrease in the consumption of coal following the program of progressive decarbonization adopted by the Group. Net of the extraordinary repayment of the water fee in Spain relating to previous financial years, the environmental taxes would have substantially been in line (-11.6 million euros) with previous financial years.\n\nThe reduction in taxes on products and services amounts overall to 56.6 million euros, mainly due to the effect of lower payments in Brazil (41.8 million euros) mainly due to the reduction in the tax basis of PIS (\"programa de integra\u00e7\u00e3o Social\") and COFINS (\"Contribui\u00e7\u00e3o para financiamento de Seguridade Social\") following a decision of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF)\\(^{(40)}\\) and Colombia (15.8 million euros) as greater advanced payments were made in 2020. Net of the extraordinary effect connected to the cited decision of the Brazilian Court, the taxes on products and services would have decreased approximately 25.6 million euros.\n\nThe payment of income taxes increased overall by 199.3 million euros. The most relevant increases were recorded in Spain (301.6 million euros) and Chile (117.4 million euros) due to the effect of (i) lower repayments and redemptions obtained in 2021 as compared to the previous year and (ii) an increase in taxable income in Chile in 2020, the corresponding taxes for which were paid in 2021. This was partially offset by reductions in income taxes in Italy (270.7 million euros), due mainly to fewer advance taxes and bal-\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(37)}\\) Taxes Borne are taxes that constitute a cost for a company.\n\n\\(^{(38)}\\) Taxes Borne include, among income taxes, specific taxes paid related to company revenue (e.g. Corporate Income Tax) for 1,756.0 million euros in 2021 and 1,560.9 million euros in 2020.\n\n\\(^{(39)}\\) The repayment refers to the \"Can\u00f3n Hidr\u00e1ulico\" (water fee) paid during 2013 \u2013 2020. Following a judgement of the Spanish Supreme Court, the fee was repaid as it was declared as non-applicable.\n\n\\(^{(40)}\\) In 2021, the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), with regard to a specific dispute whose initial ruling dates back to 2017, rules regarding the calculation of the PIS (\"programa de integra\u00e7\u00e3o Social\") and COFINS (\"Contribui\u00e7\u00e3o para financiamento de Seguridade Social\") taxes, confirming the argument according to which the ICMS (\"imposto sobre circula\u00e7\u00e3o de mercadorias e servi\u00e7os\" tax, which is a tax similar to VAT) should not be included (illegitimacy) in the tax basis used to calculate PIS and COFINS. This decision resulted in the changes to the mechanisms used for determining and paying the taxes.\nThe payment of property taxes increased overall by 31.9 million euros. The most relevant increases were recorded in Italy (18.4 million euros), following the introduction of the new single property fee\\(^{(42)}\\) in Spain (7.6 million euros) and in the United States of America (4.6 million euros) mainly due to the effect, in both Countries, of the start of operation of new renewable energy systems.\n\n### Tax Collected (\u20ac/mil)\n\n|                | 2021 | 2020 | 2021 \u2260 2020 |\n|----------------|------|------|-------------|\n| Profit taxes   | 1.2  | 0.7  | 0.5 | 72.1% |\n| Property taxes | 4,282.0 | 7,764.3 | -3,482.4 | -44.9% |\n| Employment taxes | 169.2 | 162.5 | 6.7 | 4.1% |\n| Taxes on products and services | 1,028.8 | 1,020.2 | -105.7 | -5.3% |\n| Planet/Environmental taxes | 1,906.0 | 2,011.7 | -105.7 | -5.3% |\n| **Total**      | 7,387.1 | 10,959.3 | -3,572.2 | -32.6% |\n\nTotal Taxes Collected amount to 7,387.1 million euros, down 3,572.2 million euros (\u221232.6%) as compared to 2020. This reduction essentially depends on lower taxes on products and services and lower environmental taxes. Specifically, taxes decreased for products and services by 3,482.4 million euros and environmental taxes decreased 105.7 million euros.\n\nThe most relevant reduction related to taxes on products and services was recorded in Italy (3,165.5 million euros) following the (i) change made to the method of paying VAT on purchases for the creation of the so-called \u201cGroup VAT\u201d in 2021, which made it possible to simplify a series of tax fulfilments\\(^{(43)}\\). One of the indirect effects resulting from the application of the Group VAT was the elimination of the so-called \u201csplit payment\u201d system, which had been applied starting in 2017 and based on which the VAT calculated on the purchase invoices was paid by Enel directly to the tax authorities on behalf of the suppliers and did not pay it to them, thereby causing a greater overall payment by the companies\\(^{(44)}\\). This change did not generate a real impact of a tax nature for the tax authorities, as it was only a \u201creplacement\u201d of the parties obligated to make the final payment of the tax\\(^{(44)}\\) and (ii) lower VAT advances paid in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the effect of the first year of adoption of \u201cGroup VAT\u201d. All of these changes left the actual payment unchanged in terms of VAT paid to the Communities, always generated by Enel\u2019s business. Net of this extraordinary effect, the taxes on products and services would have been equal to 7,449 million euros, with a reduction of 315.4 million euros.\n\nThis reduction in taxes on products and services was recorded in Spain (229.2 million euros) due to the effect of the reduction in the VAT rate and the ancillary expenses.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(41)}\\) In the vast majority of countries where we are present, income taxes are paid for the year of reference based on the historical values of the previous year (the so-called Historical Method). Therefore, the financial effects of the overall value of income taxes for the year of reference are fully recognized only the following year. In the specific case, the advance taxes (calculated with the historical method) and the balances paid in 2021 decreased due to the effect of the reduction in taxable income between 2019 and 2020.\n\n\\(^{(42)}\\) The 2020 Budget Law introduced, as of 2021, a \u201cproperty fee for the concession, authorization or display of advertising\u201d, to combine into a single payment the revenues related to the occupation of public areas and the distribution of advertising messages, which also increased the overall tax burden for these types of taxes.\n\n\\(^{(43)}\\) Also to the benefit of the suppliers of the various companies (e.g. a single VAT no. of reference for the invoices to all Group companies).\n\n\\(^{(44)}\\) Therefore, following this change required by the specific legislation, the value of VAT in question is normally paid to the tax authorities directly by the suppliers who in turn charge this amount in the invoices paid by Enel.\n\n\\(^{(45)}\\) In fact, for Enel, the only change with regard to these values is the recipient (before it was the tax authorities in the form of VAT and then the suppliers as higher amounts of the invoices paid); for the tax authorities, which, with the same revenues, received the payments directly from the various suppliers instead of from Enel in a centralized manner; for the suppliers who paid to the tax authorities the VAT on invoices paid by Enel.\napplied to electricity sales and in Italy (80 million euros) and Russia (93 million euros) due to a general reduction in turnover.\n\nIn contrast, an increase in taxes on products and services was recorded in Brazil (62.9 million euros) mainly due to the effect of an increase in revenues.\n\nFinally, the environmental taxes decreased in Spain (77.0 million euros) due to a reduction in the excise duties on electrical energy and in Italy (21.8 million euros) due to a decrease in turnover.\n\nA representative global and concise index of the Group\u2019s tax contribution from a cash perspective is:\n\n**TTC Rate**\n\n54.8%\n\nThe Total Tax Contribution (TTC rate) index provides a concise and complete measurement of the burden for all taxes that the business has effectively paid and is calculated as a percentage of taxes borne in relation to profit before said taxes. The 2021 TTC rate, of 54.8%, is slightly lower than the average over the past 2 years (57.8%) mainly due to the effect of the reduction in environmental taxes due to the cited extraordinary repayment and redemption of the \u201ccanon hidr\u00e1ulico\u201d in Spain. Net of this effect, the index would have been in line with the two-year average.\n\nAnother concise indicator of the tax contribution for business income is represented by:\n\n**Current income tax rate**\n\n43.35%\n\nAt Group level, in FY2021 the Current Income Tax Rate determined as the ratio between income taxes of mature companies on profits/losses (2.22 billion euros) and profit before income taxes (5.12 billion euros) is 43.3%, greater than the average rate of the member States of the OECD (22.85%) (47).\n\nWith regard to the accrued income taxes of companies on profits/losses and in line with the best practices indicated by the OECD (46), as well as the data for taxes paid by cash the following table also supplies the data for current taxes accounted for on an accrual basis Country by Country. Current taxes represent taxes calculated on the basis of income produced in the year following the tax rules of each country and normally deviate from taxes paid in the same year in so far as the definitive payment of the balance is made in the year following that in which they accrued. The trend of the two values are substantially destined to realign over time. In 2021, the current income taxes on a Group level were equal to 2.22 billion euros, whereas the income taxes paid were equal to 1.76 billion euros. The difference equal to 0.5 billion euros, due mainly to Chile and Italy, will be reabsorbed by 2022 payments.\n\n---\n\n(46) Years 2019 and 2020.\n(47) Source OECD Stat. \u201cTable II.1.

Appendix\n\nMethodological note\nSustainability Statement\nContent Index\n(GRI, SASB, TCFD, WEF, Human Rights)\n\nOther documents\nDisclosure of the proportion of activities considered environmentally sustainable (Article 8, EU Regulation 2020/852)\nGreen Bond Report\nSustainability-Linked Financing Report\nSince 2003, Enel has published the Annual Sustainability Report, in conjunction with the Group\u2019s Consolidated Annual Financial Report.\n\nIn compliance with the requirements of Italian Legislative Decree 254 of December 30, 2016, \u201cImplementation of Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 22, 2014, amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large companies and groups\u201d, Enel has been publishing a Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (NFS) since 2017. The Sustainability Report will constitute Enel\u2019s NFS with effect from the 2019 financial year. Accordingly, from that financial year on, the NFS is no longer published as a separate document. This Report of the Enel Group at December 31, 2021 was therefore drawn up in compliance with Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 and constitutes a separate document from the Annual Report. The document is published in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of the Enel website (www.enel.com).\n\nThe 2021 Sustainability Report is addressed to the Enel Group\u2019s stakeholders and is designed to present the actions taken in pursuit of the Group\u2019s sustainability goals and thus to respond to the legitimate expectations of all stakeholders. The structure of this document has been redefined with respect to the recent past and contains the entire section on the materiality analysis in the first chapter, \u201cOur sustainable progress\u201d. The document also includes an Appendix with a special table linking the issues and information relating to the protection of human rights related to the Group\u2019s Human Rights Policy, with an indication of the specific chapter of the document in which they are considered.\n\nTo the extent necessary to ensure an understanding of the Company\u2019s activities, performance, results and impact, this document covers environmental, social, labor, human rights and active and passive anti-corruption topics that are material to Enel, in view of the Company\u2019s activities and characteristics, according to the process described below (see the section \u201cThe materiality analysis process and the results for 2021\u201d).\n\nThe following table shows the areas required by Italian Legislative Decree 254/16, specifying the document chapter in which they are discussed.\n| Topic of the Report/Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 | Topic of the materiality analysis | Report Chapter | Risks | Policies and management models | Activities and results |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Environment                                         | Decarbonization of the energy mix | The path to Net-Zero chapter | \u201cThe path to Net-Zero\u201d chapter | \u201cThe path to Net-Zero\u201d chapter | \u201cThe path to Net-Zero\u201d chapter |\n| Conservation of ecosystems and environmental management | Towards a \u201cnature-based\u201d model | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cTowards a nature-based model\u201d chapter | \u201cTowards a nature-based model\u201d chapter |\n| Social                                              | Engaging global and local communities | Local and global communities | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cLocal and global communities\u201d chapter | \u201cLocal and global communities\u201d chapter |\n| Sustainable supply chain                            | Suppliers                         | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cSuppliers\u201d chapter | \u201cSuppliers\u201d chapter |\n| Employment and labor-related                        | People management, development and motivation | Enel people | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cEnel people\u201d chapter | \u201cEnel people\u201d chapter |\n| Occupational health and safety                      | Occupational health and safety | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d chapter | \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d chapter |\n| Human rights                                        | Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | Sound governance | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter |\n| People management, development and motivation       | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter |\n| Engaging global and local communities               | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter |\n| Conservation of ecosystems and environmental management | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter |\n| Sustainable supply chain                            | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter |\n| Active and passive fight against corruption          | Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | Sound governance | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter |\n\nMethodological note\nCorporate Reporting Framework\n\nThe Core&More approach of the Enel Group\n\nReport and financial statements of Enel SpA\nThis is prepared in conformity with Article 9, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree 38 of February 28, 2005\n\nSustainability Report\nThis includes the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement pursuant to Legislative Decree 254/2016 and presents Enel\u2019s sustainable business model for creating value for all stakeholders and contributing to achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations\n\nReport on Remuneration Policy\nThis describes the Enel remuneration system, as provided for by Article 123-ter of the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation\n\nReport on Corporate Governance and the Ownership Structure\nThis describes the Enel corporate governance system pursuant to Article 123-bis of the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation and Article 144-decies of the CONSOB Issuers Regulation\nHow this document has been constructed\n\nThe Sustainability Report was prepared in compliance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards set down by GRI in 2016 \u2013 in accordance with the Core option \u2013 and also considering the Electric Utilities Disclosure supplement dedicated to the sector issued in 2013, again by GRI and still applicable today; this document was also prepared in consideration of the following more recently issued GRI standards:\n\n- GRI 403 \u2013 Occupational Health and Safety (applied from 2018);\n- GRI 303 \u2013 Water and Effluents (applied from 2018);\n- GRI 207 \u2013 Tax (applied from 2020);\n- GRI 306 \u2013 Waste (applied from 2020).\n\nOne column of the content index attached to this document shows the transcoding with the indicators provided for by the new GRI Universal Standards 2021, which are being gradually implemented.\n\nMoreover, for comprehensive reporting in relation to the material topics identified following the materiality analysis, the directors deemed it necessary to include several additional disclosures, as more fully specified in this document. In compliance with standard GRI 101, the disclosures in question were subjected to the same technical rigor required by the reporting standard adopted. The reporting standards adopted, as described above, comply with the disclosure obligations pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 art. 1 letter \u201cf\u201d and art. 3, par. 3, which the directors decided to adopt organically in order to fully represent the social and environmental topics \u2013 in compliance with the mentioned decree \u2013 of significance for the Enel Group in consideration of the Group structure, the specific business sectors, and the reference geographical areas.\n\nThe Appendix to the Sustainability Report also contains specific tables of reconciliation with indicators proposed by the WEF white paper \u201cToward Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation\u201d and with the indicators proposed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB \u2013 in relation to Enel\u2019s core business area in the Electric Utilities & Power Generators Sector). Starting from 2021, a specific table is attached, with the topics and information relating to the protection of human rights and the Group\u2019s Human Rights Policy. The 2021 Sustainability Report also complies with the qualitative indicators of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and with the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework.\n\nThe Sustainability Report is part of the Enel system, and the information it provides is more detailed than and supplementary to its constituent documents, as cross-referenced in the Report. The non-financial information to be presented within the various corporate reporting system documents is selected based on the materiality analysis results and considering the approach set down in \u201cReporting on enterprise value\u201d, released in December 2020 by the main reference International organizations (CDP, CDSB, GRI and SASB). In particular, the content definition process is based on the materiality principle, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context and the completeness of the data and information; Enel summarizes the information relating to its performance in specific paragraphs (see the \u201cOur sustainable progress\u201d and \u201cOur performance\u201d chapters) of the Sustainability Report. These chapters also set out the objectives and advancements relating to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with the aim of full disclosure of all significant information in the reference period, as well as reliable estimates for the future. The quality of information reported is assured by proceeding in compliance with the principles of balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity, and verifiability as applicable in this case.\n\nThis Report is also compliant with the principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness set out in AAI000APS (AccountAbility Principles Standard) issued in 2008 by AccountAbility, an international applied research institution focusing on sustainability issues. With regard to the materiality principle, in particular, the depth in which the various subjects are discussed in the Report has been determined according to their incidence in relation to the Group\u2019s goals and strategies and their relevance for stakeholders, identified through a structured materiality analysis process.\n\nFinally, the main UN SDGs are referenced in the various chapters, in accordance with the instructions in \u201cLinking the SDGs and the GRI standards\u201d published by GRI in January 2021, and SDG Compass, the guide published in November 2015 and developed by GRI, UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to help companies align their strategies with the SDGs and measure and manage their contribution to the goals.\nReconciliation of the issues of the materiality analysis and GRI Standards\n\nJoint analysis of the stakeholder and Company dimensions, via its depiction in the priorities\u2019 matrix provided in section \u201cPriorities\u2019 matrix (single materiality)\u201d, makes it possible to assess the degree of \u201calignment\u201d or \u201cmisalignment\u201d between the priority of intervention assigned by stakeholders and the various issues and extent of commitment the Group is taking in that regard. The following table contains the codes for the topics included in the materiality analysis as established in the GRI Standards or the \u201cAspects\u201d of the GRI supplement dedicated to the electric utilities sector (\u201cElectric Utilities Sector Disclosures\u201d) of reference, along with an indication of the context internal and external to the organization and the limitations on the scope.\n\n| ESG categories | Issue of the 2021 materiality assessment | GRI Standard or Electric Utilities Sector Disclosures Aspect | Internal boundary | External boundary | Reporting limitations on

the 2021 Sustainability Report was developed in accordance with the materiality analysis, focusing more closely on the material topics covered in detail in the dedicated chapters. Likewise, the materiality level of the issues \u2013 divided in turn into dedicated sub-issues \u2013 influenced the level of detail with which to treat each subject and report the associated GRI indicators (GRI Standards and Electric Utilities Sector Disclosure) in order to be in accordance (Core option), and also the choice of the most appropriate tools to represent them (2021 Consolidated Annual Report and appended reports), to which reference was made for the treatment or detailed investigation of more specific topics, respectively, of economic performance and governance. The materiality analysis also formed the basis for definition of Enel\u2019s sustainability goals for the 2022-2024 period, as illustrated by the Sustainability Plan (see the \u201cOur sustainable progress\u201d chapter, under \u201cOur strategy for sustainable progress\u201d).\n\nThe GRI Context Index, included in the Appendix, contains references to the 2020 Sustainability Report and the Group\u2019s other reporting instruments. Please also consult the website www.enel.com for further information, for example regarding innovation projects or the activities of Enel\u2019s foundations and the 2021 Informe de Sostenibilidad by Endesa and Enel Am\u00e9ricas for additional details concerning initiatives dedicated to customers and local communities in Spain and Latin America.\n\nDrafting and assurance\n\nThe process of reporting and monitoring the Key Performance Indicators (\u201cKPIs\u201d) relevant to sustainability involves the Holding Company, with regard to transversal issues, and all Group Business Lines, Functions and companies for issues and indicators specific to the various sectors of activity. Those responsible for collecting, verifying and processing the relevant KPIs are identified within the units involved. The Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights unit, which forms part of the Innovation\u00ae Function, is responsible for consolidating information and coordinating the entire 2021 Sustainability Report drafting process.\n\nOn March 30, 2022, the Report was submitted for analysis and evaluation by the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and on April 1 to the Enel Control and Risk Committee. It was approved by the Board of Directors on April 6. The document will then be presented to the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting together with the Group\u2019s Consolidated Annual Report.\n\nThis Report has been subjected to a limited audit by and independent auditing company, KPMG SpA, engaged also to audit the Enel Group\u2019s Consolidated Annual Report. The limited audit was conducted in accordance with international standard ISAE 3000 (Revised) 1 and, accordingly, the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including professional independence and verification of the absence of conflicts of interest that may affect the ethical principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and diligence, confidentiality and professional conduct. As of the 2021 financial year, the audit approach has been extended to include the comprehensive scrutiny of a set of 25 relevant indicators. This activity is aimed at obtaining greater security regarding the selected indicators than on those and other information subject to limited scrutiny. The conclusions of the reasonable assurance activity are set out in the Mixed Audit Report on the Enel Group non-financial statement and on the selection of 25 indicators, issued in accordance with Art. 3, paragraph 10 of Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 in compliance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and in compliance with the provisions of the CONSOB Regulations and the guidelines issued by the professional bodies concerned (i.e. ASSIREVI).

(EU) 852) is also attached, as is the report on its limited scrutiny.\n\nThe GHG Inventory Statements were audited by DNV GL, with a reasonable level of certainty for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, restricted to natural gas sales activities, and with a limited level of certainty for the other Scope 3 emissions included in the scope of application of the inventory. The audit was conducted according to ISO 4064-3 for compliance of greenhouse gas (GHG) in-ventories with the WBCSD/WRI Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol).\nThe information and data presented in the Report refer to Enel SpA and the companies within the scope of line-by-line consolidation at December 31, 2021, in accordance with the Group\u2019s financial consolidation scope. In addition to the line-by-line consolidation scope, the document also includes the data and information regarding the company Asociaci\u00f3n Nuclear Asc\u00f3-Vandell\u00f3s II AIE (ANA CNVII AIE), to which the two Spanish nuclear plants of Asc\u00f3 and Vandell\u00f3s are attributed. The Company, considered to be a joint operation in line with the provisions of accounting standard IFRS 11(1), is included in the Group\u2019s financial scope of consolidation under the proportional method, and is included in this report using the same method to ensure the impacts are adequately represented, given that it is a significant Group entity. The sole exception to the line-by-line consolidation scope are the companies acquired in 2021, for which, on the basis of prevailing practice, as also represented in the CONSOB report of January 19, 2018(2), it was decided to begin consolidation, with regard to some of the areas covered in this document, with effect from 2022, in the light of the reduced acquisition period. The areas of exclusion have been indicated directly in the specific chapters.\n\nIn particular, the main organizational changes affecting the Enel Group in 2020 were:\n\n- sale of 100% of Tynemouth Energy Storage;\n- sale of 100% of Enel Green Power Bulgaria;\n- acquisition by Enel Green Power Italia of 100% of e-Solar Srl, owner of a photovoltaic project with an authorized capacity of 170.11 MW;\n- acquisition by Enel X Srl of 100% of CityPoste Payment SpA, an Italian company that offers consumers broad access to payment services, via both physical and digital channels, and makes it possible to carry out various types of transactions with private individuals and governments;\n- change in scope for the global consolidation of Australian renewable companies previously valued using the equity method as a result of the change in governance in the companies and without the acquisition of additional shares. The Purchase Price Allocation process was completed in December 2021;\n- sale of EGP Solar 1 LLC;\n- acquisition by Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a of 30 renewables companies;\n- completion of the Purchase Price Allocation process of Viva Labs AS, a company acquired by Enel X International.\n\nFor more detailed information on the changes, refer to the 2020 Consolidated Annual Report in the sections \u201cMain changes in the scope of consolidation\u201d and \u201cSignificant events in 2021\u201d.\n\nIf the associated companies (measured at equity in the Consolidated Annual Report) and other entities over which Enel exercises significant influence (including joint ventures) produce substantial impacts, they are included in the data calculation in proportion to Enel\u2019s holding, and referenced in the text. We invite you to refer to the 2021 Consolidated Annual Report for details of the companies included the scope of consolidation.\n\nIn this Statement, the terms \u201cCorporate\u201d, \u201cHolding Company\u201d and \u201cParent Company\u201d refer to Enel SpA, whereas \u201cGroup\u201d, \u201cEnel\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d refer to Enel SpA and its subsidiaries.\n\nVarious deviations from the KPIs and information included in the 2019 Sustainability Report are the result of changes in the Group\u2019s scope of consolidation. The effects of changes in the scope of consolidation, together with any significant changes or limitations of the scope or methods of calculating individual indicators compared with 2020, are expressly indicated in the text and/or the Appendix, along with the effects on the related data. See the notes in the tables in the Appendix for all further details regarding adjustments with respect to already published data, calculation methods, assumptions or significant limitations of indicators.\n\nThe data have been thoroughly calculated on the basis of the results of Enel\u2019s accounting, non-accounting and other information systems, and validated by the persons responsible in each case. Data determined through the use of estimates and related calculation method have been expressly indicated. In the comparison of the data over time, it should be noted that differences between 2021 and 2020, in absolute and percent terms, have been calculated considering decimal places in some cases not visible in the printed document. In the tables containing quantitative data, percent changes in excess of |100%| are indicated by \u201c-\u201c.\n\n---\n\n(1) A \u201cjoint operation\u201d is a joint-control arrangement in which the parties that hold joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities associated with the arrangement.\n\n(2) Illustrative report on the results of the consultation and the consequences for regulation, the activities of companies and operators and the interests of investors and savers.\nPerformance indicators\n\nKey sustainability performance indicators are presented from page 374 to page 417 and form an integral part of this Sustainability Report.\n\nUnits of measure\n\n- ,000 thousands\n- ,000 d thousands of days\n- ,000 h thousands of hours\n- ,000 t thousands of tons\n- % percentage\n- years years\n- cent euros euro cents\n- g/kWh grams per kilowatt hour\n- g/kWh eq grams per equivalent kilowatt hour\n- GBq per unit gigabecquerels per unit\n- dd days\n- GW gigawatts\n- GWh gigawatt hours\n- h hours\n- h/per cap hours per capita\n- r rate\n- kg kilograms\n- km kilometers\n- kWh kilowatt hours\n- kWh eq equivalent kilowatt hours\n- kWh/t kilowatt hours per ton\n- kWp peak kilowatts\n- l/kWh liters per kilowatt hour\n- l/kWh eq liters per equivalent kilowatt hour\n- billions of m\u00b3 billions of cubic meters\n- MJ/kWh eq megajoules per equivalent kilowatt hour\n- ML megaliters\n- mil million\n- mil A4 eq millions of equivalent A4 sheets\n- mil euros millions of euros\n- mil h millions of hours\n- mil l millions of liters\n- mil m\u00b3 millions of cubic meters\n- mil t millions of tons\n- mil t eq millions of equivalent tons\n- min minutes\n- Mtoe millions of tons of oil equivalent\n- MW megawatts\n- MWh megawatt hours\n- no. number\n- sec seconds\n- t tons\n- TBq per unit terabecquerels per unit\n\nAcronyms\n\n- HV High Voltage\n- EIB European Investment Bank\n- BOD Biochemical Oxygen Demand\n- LV Low Voltage\n- CCGT Combined Cycle Gas Turbine\n- BoD Board of Directors\n- CERT Cyber Emergency Readiness Team\n- CSV Creating Shared Value\n- COD Chemical Oxygen Demand\n- CSR Corporate Social Responsibility\n- EBT Earnings Before Tax\n- EBIT Earnings Before Interest and Tax\n- EBITDA Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization\n- ESG Environmental Social & Governance\n- EGP Enel Green Power\n- EPS Earnings per Share\n- RT Remote Training\n- GRI Global Reporting Initiative\n- IPO Initial Public Offering\n- iRAP Imposta Regionale sulle Attivit\u00e0 Produttive (Regional Business Tax)\n- iRES Imposta sul Reddito delle Societ\u00e0 (Corporate Income Tax)\n- LBG London Benchmarking Group\n- MV Medium Voltage\n- PCBs Polychlorinated Biphenyls\n- R&D Research & Development\n- S&P Standard & Poor\u2019s\n- SRI Socially Responsible Investor\n- TSR Total Shareholder Return\n- SCIGR Internal Control and Risk Management System\n- SDG Sustainable Development Goal\n- TCFD Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure\n- UN United Nations\n- WEF World Economic Forum\n\n(3) Corresponding to the sum of electrical energy and heat.\nIndependent auditors\u2019 report\nIndependent auditors\u2019 report on the consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to article 3.10 of Legislative decree no. 254 of 30 December 2016 and article 5 of the Consob Regulation adopted with Resolution no. 20267 of 18 January 2018\n\nTo the board of directors of Enel S.p.A.\n\nPursuant to article 3.10 of Legislative decree no. 254 of 30 December 2016 (the \u201cdecree\u201d) and article 5 of the Consob (the Italian Commission for listed companies and the stock exchange) Regulation adopted with Resolution no. 20267 of 18 January 2018, we have been engaged to perform:\n\na) a limited assurance engagement on the information included in the 2021 consolidated non-financial statement of the Enel Group (the \u201cgroup\u201d) prepared in accordance with article 4 of the decree approved by the board of directors on 8 April 2022 (the \u201cNFS\u201d) other than that specified in point b) (the \u201cinformation subjected to limited assurance engagement\u201d);\n\nb) a reasonable assurance engagement on certain selected indicators (the \u201cselected indicators\u201d) presented in the NFS, identified in the \u201cDrafting and assurance section of the NFS and set out in section \u201cB.

(the \u201cparent\u201d) for the NFS\n\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation of an NFS in accordance with articles 3 and 4 of the decree and the \u201cGlobal Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards\u201d issued by GRI - Global Reporting Initiative (the \u201cGRI Standards\u201d), which they have identified as the reporting standards.\nThe directors are also responsible, within the terms established by the Italian law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of an NFS that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nMoreover, the directors are responsible for the identification of the content of the NFS, considering the aspects indicated in article 3.1 of the decree and the group\u2019s business and characteristics, to the extent necessary to enable an understanding of the group\u2019s business, performance, results and the impacts it generates.\n\nThe directors\u2019 responsibility also includes the design of an internal model for the management and organisation of the group\u2019s activities, as well as, with reference to the aspects identified and disclosed in the NFS, the group\u2019s policies and the identification and management of the risks generated or borne.\n\nThe Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by the Italian law, compliance with the decree\u2019s provisions.\n\n**Auditors\u2019 independence and quality control**\n\nWe are independent in compliance with the independence and all other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our company applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly, maintains a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n**Auditors\u2019 responsibility**\n\n**A. Report on the information subjected to limited assurance engagement**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion, based on the procedures performed, about the compliance of the information subjected to limited assurance engagement with the requirements of the decree and the GRI Standards selected as specified in the \u201cMethodological note\u201d section of the NFS (the \u201cGRI Standards - Core option. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established by \u201cInternational Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u201d (\u201cISAE 3000 revised\u201d), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board applicable to limited assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the information subjected to limited assurance engagement is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement carried out in accordance with ISAE 3000 revised, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nSpecifically, we carried out the following procedures:\n\n1. Analysing the material aspects based on the group\u2019s business and characteristics disclosed as part of the information subjected to limited assurance engagement presented in the NFS, in order to assess the reasonableness of the identification process adopted on the basis of the provisions of article 3 of the decree and taking into account the reporting standards applied.\n2. Analysing and assessing the identification criteria for the reporting scope, in order to check their compliance with the decree.\n\n3. Comparing the financial disclosures included in the information subjected to limited assurance engagement presented in the NFS with those included in the group\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n\n4. Gaining an understanding of the following:\n   - the group\u2019s business management and organisational model, with reference to the management of the aspects set out in article 3 of the decree;\n   - the entity\u2019s policies in connection with the aspects set out in article 3 of the decree, the achieved results and the related key performance indicators;\n   - the main risks generated or borne in connection with the aspects set out in article 3 of the decree.\n\nMoreover, we checked the above against the information subjected to limited assurance engagement presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described in point 5.a).\n\n5. Understanding the processes underlying the generation, recording and management of the significant qualitative and quantitative information subjected to limited assurance engagement disclosed in the NFS.\n\nSpecifically, we held interviews and discussions with the parent\u2019s management personnel. We also performed selected procedures on documentation to gather information on the processes and procedures used to gather, combine, process and transmit non-financial data and information to the office that prepares the information subjected to limited assurance engagement presented in the NFS.\n\nFurthermore, with respect to significant information subjected to limited assurance engagement, considering the group\u2019s business and characteristics:\n   - at group level,\n     a) we held interviews and obtained supporting documentation to check the qualitative information presented in the NFS and, specifically, the business model, the policies applied and main risks for consistency with available evidence.\n     b) we carried out analytical and limited procedures to check, on a sample basis, the correct aggregation of data in the quantitative information;\n   - we held videoconferences with the management of Enel S.p.A., Enel Chile SA, Enel Russia XX and Endesa SA and the Civitavecchia (Italy), San Isidro (Chile), Granadilla (Spain) and Konakovskaya (Russia) sites, which we have selected on the basis of their business, contribution to the key performance indicators at consolidated level and location, to obtain documentary evidence supporting the correct application of the procedures and methods used to calculate the indicators.\nB. Report on the information subjected to reasonable assurance engagement\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion, based on the procedures performed, about the compliance of the information subjected to reasonable assurance engagement with the Decree and the GRI Standards - Core option. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established by ISAE 3000 revised applicable to reasonable assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information subjected to reasonable assurance engagement is free from material misstatement. A reasonable assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence supporting the data and information subjected to such engagement. The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the preparation of the information subjected to reasonable assurance engagement in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group\u2019s internal controls.\n\nThe information subjected to reasonable assurance engagement are as follows:\n\n1. number of fatalities \u2013 Enel;\n2. number of fatalities - contractors;\n3. fatality frequency rate \u2013 Enel;\n4. fatality frequency rate \u2013 contractors;\n5. injury frequency rate for injuries with more than three days\u2019 absence \u2013 Enel;\n6. injury frequency rate for injuries with more than three days\u2019 absence \u2013 contractors;\n7. injury frequency rate with absence from work - Enel;\n8. injury frequency rate with absence from work - contractors;\n9. high potential injury frequency rate \u2013 Enel;\n10. high potential injury frequency rate \u2013 contractors;\n11. total injury frequency rate \u2013 Enel;\n12. total injury frequency rate \u2013 contractors;\n13. life changing injury frequency rate \u2013 Enel;\n14. life changing injury frequency rate \u2013 contractors;\n\nGrid resiliency\n15.

Conclusion on the information subjected to limited assurance engagement\u201d\nBased on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information subjected to limited assurance engagement presented in the 2021 NFS of the Enel Group has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of articles 3 and 4 of the decree and the GRI Standards.\n\n\u201cB. Opinion on the information subjected to reasonable assurance engagement\u201d\nIn our opinion, the information subjected to reasonable assurance engagement presented in 2021 NFS of the Enel Group, identified in the \u201cDrafting and assurance\u201d section of the NFS and in section \u201cB. Report on the information subjected to reasonable assurance engagement\u201d of this report has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI standards.\n\nOur conclusion and opinion set out above do not cover the information set out in the \u201cThe European Taxonomy Regulation\u201d section of the NFS required by article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.\n\nOther matters\n\nThe NFS presents the corresponding figures included in the 2019 consolidated non-financial statement for comparative purposes, on which other auditors performed a limited assurance engagement and expressed an unqualified conclusion on 8 March 2020.\n\nRome, 14 April 2022\n\nKPMG S.p.A.\n\n(signed on the original)\n\nMarco Maffei\nDirector of Audit\nSustainability Statement: performance indicators\n\nThe key sustainability performance indicators are listed below and form an integral part of this Sustainability Report.\n## Our sustainable progress\n\n### EU1 GENERATION\n\n#### Installed capacity\n\n| KPI | December 2021 | December 2020 | December 2019 | 2021-2020 | % | Scope |\n|-----|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|---|-------|\n| **EU1 GENERATION** | | | | | | |\n| **Net efficient generation capacity by primary energy source** | | | | | | |\n| **Thermal net capacity** | (MW) | 33,664 | 35,623 | 38,897 | -1,959 | -5.5 | Enel |\n| Coal | (MW) | 6,910 | 8,903 | 11,695 | -1,793 | -22.4 | Enel |\n| CCGT | (MW) | 15,039 | 15,009 | 14,991 | 30 | 0.2 | Enel |\n| Oil/Gas | (MW) | 11,715 | 11,711 | 12,211 | 4 | -

The resulting value is calculated as the product of the generation of electricity obtained from a renewable or nuclear source and the specific CO2 emissions from the thermoelectric generation of the country in which Enel is present (source: Enerdata \u2013 http://enerdata.net).\n\n(2) This share includes: CO2 emissions from the use of diesel in auxiliary engines; CH4 leak emissions from gas-fired power plants; N2O and CH4 as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels; NF3, SF6, and refrigerant gases expressed as CO2 equivalent. This share also includes biogenic emissions from hydroelectric basins, calculated for 2021, and for the previous two years.\n\n(3) This indicator is calculated as the ratio between total emissions from thermoelectric generation and the total from renewable, nuclear and thermoelectric generation (including the contribution of heat in MWth). The figures for 2020 and 2019 have been recalculated following the recalculation of the Scope 1 emissions value.\n\n(4) \u201cScope 2\u201d \u2013 emissions from energy taken from the grid. Indirect CO2 emissions relating to 2021 due to the consumption of electricity for moving fuel, electricity distribution, property management and electricity purchased from the grid by energy generation plants are calculated as the product of the electricity consumption multiplied by the respective weighted specific CO2 emission coefficients of the whole generation mix of the countries where the Enel Group operates (source: Enerdata \u2013 https://www.enerdata.net/ for location-based calculation and https://www.aib-net.org/facts/european-residual-mix for market-based calculation). Scope 2 is calculated according to the \u201clocation based\u201d method (based on the company\u2019s location). It is the result of the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from electricity generation in the area where the consumption takes place. Scope 2 is calculated according to the \u201cmarket based\u201d method (based on the market where the company operates). For companies operating in European countries, the reference market is the European one (EU). In the event of supply of energy from renewable sources, the electricity\u2019s origin must be certified by \u201ccontractual instruments that meet the minimum quality criteria\u201d. In Europe, the only way to prove the electricity\u2019s origin is the Guarantees of Origin. Companies that use electricity whose origin is not certified by these Guarantees must perform the calculation by referring to the emissions associated with the residual mix (source: Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, 2019). The figures for 2020 and 2021 have been recalculated following a revision of the energy data taken from the grid as part of the Net-Zero project and the year-specific emission coefficients for the same year were included in the calculation.\n\n(5) \u201cScope 3\u201d \u2013 emissions from energy losses from the distribution grid. With its business, the Group covers the entire generation and sales chain in Europe (Italy and Spain) and in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Peru). To calculate emissions, it has been assumed that the vertical chain of activities takes place within the country. The emissions caused by the losses, following a change in methodology, were calculated based on the part of energy fed into the grid that exceeds the share produced in the country in question, so as to avoid any double counting of emissions already included in Scope 1. The emissions are calculated according to a dual perspective, location- and market-based, and the 2020 and 2019 values have been recalculated following the new methodology and with the year-specific emission coefficients.\n\n(6) \u201cScope 3\u201d: indirect CO2 emissions from the use of coal by sea is estimated on the basis of the actual routes taken by the ships. Since 2020, the estimate of the share of emissions for rail freight has no longer been reported as this form of transport is no longer used (the value for 2019, 0.22 mil t, has been included in the calculation).

The category includes: mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, investment and merchant banks, insurance companies.\n(2) Calculated comparing the number of shares held by identified Socially Responsible Investors (SRIs) with the number of shares held by identified institutional investors.\n(3) SRIs are investors who state that they include environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their traditional financial analyses in order to guide their investment decisions (inclusion of at least one ESG criterion and adhesion to the main international principles approved by organizations such as UNPRI, UKSIF, EUROSIF are among the key factors in order to classify an investor as an SRI).\n(4) Calculated as the difference between the valuation on the last open market day of the year and the valuation of the previous year.\n(5) Only requests received have been considered, not the responses provided.\n(6) The number of independent directors pursuant to the Consolidated Law on Finance (TUF) is 8 (including the Chairman). The number of independent directors pursuant to the Corporate Governance Code is 7 because the Code does not allow the Chairman to be considered independent since he/she is a \u201csenior representative\u201d of the company.\n(7) Of these, 11 meetings were held in 2021 on sustainability issues.\n(8) Corruption consists of the abuse of power with the goal of private gain and can be instigated by individuals in the public or private sector. It is interpreted here as including corrupt practices such as bribery, fraud, extortion, collusion, conflicts of interest and money laundering.\n(9) Since 2021, the figures are set out by Countries \u2013 Geographical Areas.\n## GRI Content Index\n\n| GRI Standards | Disclosure | Page number(s) and/or URL(s) | Omission | GRI Universal Standard 2021 |\n|---------------|------------|-----------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|\n| **GRI 101: Foundation 2016** | **General Disclosures** | | | |\n| | **Organizational profile** | | | |\n| | 102-1 Name of the organization | 356 | | GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 2-1 |\n| | 102-2 Activities, brands, products, and services | 15-17 | | GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 2-6 |\n| | 102-3 Location of headquarters | 356 | | GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 2-1 |\n| | 102-4 Location of operations | 15-17 | | GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 2-1 |\n| | 102-5 Ownership and legal form | 15-17; 298; 356; Sustainability Statement, sec.

a report, called \u2018Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism: Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation\u2019 (https://www.weforum.org/reports/measuring-stakeholder-capitalism-towards-common-metrics-and-consistent-reporting-of-sustainable-value-creation), with the aim of defining shared common metrics to measure, report and compare the levels of sustainability, in other words the effectiveness of its actions in pursuing the sustainable development goals indicated by the UN (SDG), in the business model adopted to create value for stakeholders. The metrics are based on existing standards and aim to increase convergence and comparability between the various parameters used in sustainability reports.

             |\n\nContent Index 445\nDisclosure of the proportion of activities considered environmentally sustainable (Article 8, EU Regulation 2020/852)\n\nOur commitment and our position\n\nEnel welcomes the development of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, as it provides a standardized, science-based classification system to identify environmentally sustainable economic activities. The EU Taxonomy Regulation acts as an important enabler to promote sustainable investments and accelerate the decarbonization of the European economy, while at the same time creating security and transparency for investors and supporting companies in planning the Net-Zero transition.\n\nWe are fully committed to reporting on the implementation of Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, and of the Delegated Act which further specifies the content, methodology and presentation of information to be disclosed by both financial and non-financial undertakings. Although the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires companies to declare compliance with it as of January 2022, Enel has taken a leading role by deciding to provide evidence of its adoption thereof in previous publications such as the Sustainability Report 2020 and the Consolidated Annual Report 2020, as well as during Capital Markets Day 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe also welcome the different thresholds defined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the basis of climate and environmental sciences, such as the specific emission limit of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh (taking the whole life cycle into consideration) to measure the substantial contribution to achieving the climate change mitigation objectives established for most power generation technologies, in that it stems from a solid process based on a robust scientific foundation. However, there are some activities that, although not covered under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, are critical to promoting the well-being of European citizens, especially in the short and medium term, while contributing to the sustainable development of Europe in the long term. As regards the energy industry, there are some important sustainability-related issues that the European Commission did not consider when developing the technical screening criteria, as they were outside the main scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. These included energy security, grid reliability and the energy transition, all of which are critical to Europe\u2019s well-being but which are appropriately addressed by other policies, funds and regulations at EU and Member State level.\n\nIn preparing this Disclosure, the Directors have interpreted, integrated and contextualized the provisions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation with the specific activities carried out on the market by the Group, which is operationally organized into Business Lines. The EU Taxonomy Regulation is still in a developmental stage, and a number of important Delegated Acts are still being finalized at the time of publication of this Sustainability Report. These include acts that will detail the criteria for the remaining four objectives (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems), as well as those that will identify economic activities that do not have a significant harmful impact on environmental sustainability and those that do. Completion of the entire regulatory process should ensure that all globally recognized economic activities are considered, thereby reducing current uncertainties regarding implementation of the process itself.\nMethodological note\n\nBelow are described the reporting principles and evaluation criteria adopted in this document. These have been identified by the Directors who have appropriately interpreted and integrated the provisions of Art. 8 of EU Regulation 852/2020 in order to take into account the specific operating and management reality of the Enel Group in its organizational structuring into Business Lines (BL).\n\nWith regard to the identification of eligibility concerning the \u201cClimate change mitigation\u201d objective of the EU Taxonomy Regulation as it applies to the Group\u2019s economic activities, the latter analyzed and assessed by dividing them according to Global Business Lines and not according to NACE codes, since the latter cannot be directly and unambiguously associated with the structure of the Group\u2019s operations.\n\nFollowing this identification, analysis of the substantial contribution to the objective of \u201cClimate change mitigation\u201d in Business Lines was performed using a qualitative-quantitative method aimed at verifying compliance with the above criteria for the achievement of the environmental objective chosen.\n\nThe Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criterion was then verified for the activities considered eligible and aligned in order to ensure that they do not cause significant harm to the other environmental objectives identified in the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn terms of compliance with the Minimum Social Safeguards, the Group has implemented specific procedures in line with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation through the use of the principles and criteria defined by the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the relevant ILO principles. The due diligence process was conducted on the entire value chain and the human rights policy implemented at Group level.\n\nLastly, the financial metrics reported for each business activity eligible and not in the Disclosure are turnover, capital expenditure (Capex), operating expenditure (Opex) and gross operating margin (EBITDA). Specifically, in relation to taxonomy-aligned activities, these metrics were calculated as follows:\n\n- taxonomy-aligned revenue is the result of the proportion of revenue from eligible and aligned activities (numerator) to total revenue (denominator);\n- taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure (Capex) is the result of the proportion of Capex from eligible and aligned activities (numerator) to total Capex (denominator);\n- taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure (Opex) is the result of the proportion of eligible and aligned Opex from non-capitalized direct costs for research and development, building renovation, short-term rental, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenses related to the day-to-day upkeep of property, plant, and equipment (numerator) to total Opex related to the above categories (denominator);\n- taxonomy-aligned ordinary gross operating margin (EBITDA) is the result of the proportion of eligible and aligned gross operating margin activities (numerator) to total EBITDA (denominator).\n\nThe financial information was gathered from the digital accounting system used by the Enel Group or from the management systems in use by the Company\u2019s Business Lines.\nOur implementation process\n\nBy means of a process overseen by the CEO and Top Management, involving the relevant Functions at corporate and Country level, as well as all Business Lines, we initiated a five-step process to analyze the applicability of the EU Taxonomy Regulation throughout the entire value chain and in all countries where we operate.\n\n1. **Identification of eligible economic activities**: we have identified all activities within the Group\u2019s portfolio that have been included in the Climate Delegated Act. The process was conducted by taking into consideration only the climate change mitigation objective, in that it is the most material purpose with respect to the Enel Group\u2019s business model and the sector in which it operates. Therefore, although Enel also carries out activities that could contribute to the objective of adaptation to climate change, these have not been identified in the section \u201cStatement on the alignment of Enel\u2019s business to the European Taxonomy Regulation\u201d, thus avoiding potential double counting in the calculation of financial metrics.\n\n2. **Analysis of substantial contribution**: eligible activities identified in the previous phase have been thoroughly analyzed for their compliance with the specific technical screening criteria established to measure their substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. The analysis was carried out following the criteria in the Climate Delegated Act, namely:\n   a. **Technological analysis for power generation activities**. The threshold of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh measured on a life cycle basis was met according to the following technological approach:\n      - **coal and liquid fossil fuels**: technology excluded from the EU Taxonomy Regulation;\n      - **gas and nuclear**: on February 2, 2022, the European Commission approved in principle a Complementary Climate Delegated Act which includes, under strict conditions, nuclear energy and gas in the list of economic activities covered under the EU Taxonomy Regulation. At the time of publication of this Report, the Complementary Climate Delegated Act is in the process of being approved/rejected by the European Parliament and the Council. In this regard, the legislation is not yet finalized and therefore electricity generated from gas and nuclear energy is considered as \u201cnot eligible\u201d;\n      - **wind, solar and battery storage**: these are exempt from the carbon intensity threshold verification due to their substantial contribution to climate change mitigation;\n      - **hydroelectric power**: the carbon intensity threshold was verified only in power plants with a power density below 5 W/m\u00b2. All power plants with a power density above 5 W/m\u00b2, as well as flowing water plants and pumped storage plants, are exempt from the threshold verification;\n      - **geothermal**: the threshold was verified by carrying out life cycle assessments certified by independent third parties.\n   b. **Analysis at country, region and system level for the transmission and distribution of electricity**. Compliance with the following technical screening criteria was analyzed in all eight countries where Enel distributes electricity:\n      - the Distribution System Operator (DSO) is part of the European interconnected system; or\n      - non-European DSOs belong to countries with more than 67% of newly enabled generation capacity in the system is below the generation threshold value.\nof 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh measured on a life cycle basis in accordance with electricity generation criteria, over period 2016\u20132020 (data made available by national authorities over a rolling five-year period prior to the preparation of the Sustainability Report 2021); or\n\n- the average emission factor of the non-European DSO network is below the threshold value of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh measured on a life cycle basis in accordance with electricity generation criteria, in the period 2016\u20132020.\n\nInfrastructure dedicated to creating a direct connection or expanding an existing direct connection between a substation or network and a power production plant that is more greenhouse gas intensive than 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh measured on a life cycle basis has been identified and excluded from the eligible aligned DSOs activities.\n\nc. Product cluster level analysis for Enel X Business Line. A comprehensive analysis of the Enel X portfolio was performed, classifying eligible activities into the sectors identified in the Climate Delegated Act, such as construction and real estate, transportation, or professional, scientific and technical activities.\n\nd. Sourcing analysis for power retail activities. The quantity of power sold in Italy and Spain by the companies involved in power sales through Certificates of Origin was calculated and considered to be aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation for its correlation with the technical screening criteria established in the Climate Delegated Act for power generation.\n\n3. Assessment of the principle of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to other objectives: an analysis of existing environmental procedures was carried out to verify compliance with the DNSH quality criteria for each type of technology (for power generation), region (for transmission and distribution) and product cluster level (for activities of the Enel X Business Line), adapted to the specific requirements set out for each of the following environmental objectives:\n\n- adaptation to climate change: analysis of global procedures (including emerging and restoration procedures), assessment of physical climate risks and solutions and adaptation plans in place covering all applicable activities related to power generation, transmission and networks and Enel X Business Line;\n\n- sustainable use and protection of waters and marine resources: analysis of water-related procedures, authorizations, environmental impact assessments, national regulations and water management plans. The analysis was limited to power generation activities, as it is not applicable to other Business Lines;\n\n- transition to a circular economy: analysis of waste management plans, procurement requirements and circular economy projects and plans covering all activities applicable to the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and to the products of the Enel X Business Line;\n\n- pollution prevention and control: analysis of global procedures and national regulations concerning all applicable activities from power generation, transmission and networks. In addition, specific pollutants were further analyzed, including electromagnetic radiation and PCBs for transmission and networks, and emissions from power generation activities for air quality;\n\n- protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems: analysis of global procedures and national regulations covering all applicable activities from power generation, transmission and distribution.\n\n4. Assessment of the minimum social safeguards: it has been verified that the Group\u2019s human rights due diligence process covers the entire perimeter of Enel, as it is fully aligned with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Further information on our approach to respecting human rights can be found in chapter \u201cHuman rights management\u201d.\n\n5. Calculation of financial metrics: the corresponding financial metrics were associated with each economic activity according to the classification made in steps 1\u20134, collecting the relevant financial information from the Group\u2019s accounting system. In addition, some proxies have been performed for specific activities when financial information was not available in the accounting system (described in the section on the calculation of financial metrics).\nEligible-aligned: this refers to an economic activity that simultaneously satisfies the following three conditions:\n\u2022 it is explicitly included in the EU Taxonomy Regulation for its substantial contribution to climate change mitigation; and\n\u2022 it meets the specific criteria developed by the EU Taxonomy Regulation for that specific environmental objective; and\n\u2022 it meets all DNSH criteria and minimum social safeguards.\n\nEligible-not aligned: refers to an economic activity that:\n\u2022 is explicitly included in the EU Taxonomy Regulation for its substantial contribution to climate change mitigation or adaptation; but\n\u2022 does not meet the specific criteria developed by the EU Taxonomy Regulation for those specific environmental objectives; or\n\u2022 does not meet at least one of the DNSH and/or the minimum social safeguards.\n\nNot eligible: refers to an economic activity that has not been identified by the EU Taxonomy Regulation as a substantial contributor to climate change mitigation and for which no criteria have therefore been developed. The logic of the European Commission is that these activities might:\n\u2022 not have a significant impact on climate change mitigation or could be integrated into the EU Taxonomy Regulation at a later stage;\n\u2022 cause a very significant impact on climate change mitigation, so they cannot be eligible in any case;\n\u2022 be awaiting a final decision by the European authorities on their classification (nuclear and gas).\n\nConsequently, the existence of this third category makes it impossible to achieve a business model that is fully aligned with the criteria of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, even though these not eligible activities might not cause any harm to the EU\u2019s environmental objectives.\nIn 2021, we updated our eligibility analysis according to the process and the new definition for the three categories described above and pursuant to the final version of the Climate Delegated Act published in the Official Journal of the European Union in December 2021. The following three tables summarize the results of this analysis.\n| Business Line | Activity | Description of the activity (according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation) | Condition aligned with requirements |\n|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Electricity generation from wind power | Electricity generation from wind power (4.3)(i) - Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from wind power. | 100% of the installed capacity is eligible and aligned because:  \n\u2022 it makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation as no specific technical screening criteria are required;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with DNSH criteria for the following applicable objectives: adaptation, circular economy, pollution and biodiversity;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with minimum social safeguards. |\n| Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology | Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology (4.1) - Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity using solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. | 100% of the installed capacity is eligible and aligned because:  \n\u2022 it makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation as no specific technical screening criteria are required;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with DNSH criteria for the following applicable objectives: adaptation, circular economy, pollution and biodiversity;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with minimum social safeguards. |\n| Electricity generation from hydropower | Electricity generation from hydropower (4.5) - Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from hydropower. | 99.5% of the installed capacity is eligible and aligned because:  \n\u2022 it makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, since it includes all flowing water plants, all pumped storage plants, all reservoir plants with a power density above 5 W/m\u00b2 and all reservoir plants below 5 W/m\u00b2 with a life cycle greenhouse gas intensity below 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh as certified by G-RES;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with DNSH criteria for the following applicable objectives: adaptation, water and biodiversity;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with minimum social safeguards. |\n| Electricity generation from geothermal energy | Electricity generation from geothermal energy (4.8) - Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from geothermal energy. | 100% of the installed capacity is eligible and aligned because:  \n\u2022 it makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, as all power plants have a life cycle GHG emission intensity of less than 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh, as verified by an independent third party;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with DNSH criteria for the following applicable objectives: adaptation, water, pollution and biodiversity;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with minimum social safeguards. |\n| Storage of electricity (batteries) | Storage of electricity (4.10) - Construction and operation of facilities that store electricity. | 100% of the installed capacity is eligible and aligned because:  \n\u2022 it makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation as no specific technical screening criteria are required;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with DNSH criteria for the following applicable objectives: adaptation, circular economy, water and biodiversity;  \n\u2022 it complies overall with minimum social safeguards. |\n\n(i) The number reported refers to the code for eligible activities reported in the Climate Delegated Act (climate change mitigation objective) of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n| Business Line | Activity | Description of the activity (according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation) | Condition aligned with requirements |\n|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Infrastructure and networks | Transmission and distribution of electricity | Transmission and distribution of electricity (4.9) - Construction and operation of transmission systems that transport the electricity on the extra high-voltage and high-voltage interconnected system.

Construction and operation of distribution systems that transport electricity on high-voltage, medium-voltage and low-voltage distribution systems. | Infrastructures built during the year and dedicated to the realization of a direct connection or the expansion of an existing direct connection between a substation or grid and a power plant with a greenhouse gas intensity exceeding the threshold of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh measured on a life cycle basis. The DSOs in Argentina have a GHG intensity in excess of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh, and belong to electrical systems where less than 67% of newly installed capacity in the last five years has a life cycle GHG intensity of less than 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh, according to the latest data available from national authorities. |\n| **Market** | Power sales (end customers) | Retail sale of electricity. | All retail power sales of Group companies in Europe are made without Certificates of Origin. The sale of power without associated Certificates of Origin is assumed to mean that, in terms of technology, the source of the power does not meet the technical screening criteria established for electricity generation. In addition, power sales in South America have also been excluded due to the lack of Certificate of Origin systems that allow the origin of power to be traced. These activities refer to those that are not part of the distribution networks in South America, according to the electricity market regulations in force in each country. |\n\n### Not eligible activities\n\n| Business Line | Activity | Description of the activity | Not eligible condition |\n|---------------|----------|----------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Power generation** | Generation of electricity from coal and liquid fossil fuels | Construction and operation of coal-fired and liquid fossil fuel power plants. | The activity has been excluded from the EU Taxonomy Regulation as it is considered very harmful. |\n| **Power generation** | Electricity generation from gas | Construction and operation of natural gas power plants. | The Complementary Climate Delegated Act has not yet been approved by the European Parliament and the European Council. |\n| **Power generation** | Electricity generated by nuclear power plants | Construction and operation of nuclear power plants. | The Complementary Climate Delegated Act has not yet been approved by the European Parliament and the European Council. |\n| **Trading** | Energy sales (wholesale) | Wholesale of power and related activities. | This activity is not considered in the Climate Delegated Act. |\n| **Market** | Gas sales (end customers) | Retail sales of gas by Group companies in Europe. | This activity is not considered in the Climate Delegated Act. |\n| **Enel X** | Other activities | Financial services, hardware and software, insurance policies and other general services. | These activities are not considered in the Climate Delegated Act. |\nProcess for calculating financial metrics\n\nDuring the process of calculating the financial metrics, the following criteria were adopted and the following considerations made.\n\n- The three financial metrics required by the EU Taxonomy Regulation (turnover, capital expenditure \u2013 Capex \u2013 and operating expenditure \u2013 Opex) were calculated according to the eligibility analysis described in the previous section.\n\n- Although not expressly required, Enel also performed an assessment in terms of the ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA) believing that this metric represents the actual financial performance of integrated utilities such as Enel. A metric that considers only turnover is strongly influenced by the business activities with a high volume of revenues (such as the wholesale market \u2013 trading) that do not contribute proportionally to growth in the ordinary gross operating profit to the same extent as other business activities.\n\n- The financial information was gathered from the digital accounting system used by the Enel Group, or from the management systems in use by the Company\u2019s Business Lines. However, some proxies were delegated to provide a more detailed representation of the figures or to exclude specific activities from the overall calculation of eligible alignment (such as not aligned hydroelectric power generation or infrastructure considered eligible but not aligned among eligible and aligned distribution network systems). For example, the following proxies were used:\n  - hydroelectric: eligible not aligned hydroelectric power plants were excluded by considering their output multiplied by the average turnover per unit in the years 2020 and 2021. This approach was also extended to Capex, Opex and EBITDA;\n  - infrastructure and networks: new connections between a substation or grid and a power plant with a greenhouse gas intensity above the threshold of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh were excluded considering their capacity (in MW) multiplied by the average turnover per unit (k\u20ac/MW) for the years 2020 and 2021. This approach was only applied to turnover and Capex.\n\n- Aggregate financial data in the report refer to the \u201csector\u201d level and include items related to third parties and inter-sectorial exchanges.\n\n- Turnover from power sales was calculated considering the quantity of power sold at retail level by Group companies in Italy and Spain using Certificates of Origin (based on data from national authorities), applying the average turnover per unit. This turnover is considered eligible and aligned, as it refers to electricity produced using technologies that meet the technical screening criteria of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. This approach has also been adopted for Capex, Opex and ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA). To avoid double counting, the eligible turnover per sector is net of inter-sectorial exchanges (relations between Enel Green Power, Infrastructure and Networks and Retail).\n\n- The figures for 2020 have been restated based on the new eligibility analysis carried out in 2021 after the publication of the Sustainability Report 2020 and the publication of the Climate Delegated Act in the Official Journal of the European Union. The main differences in each business segment are as follows:\n  - generation of electricity: 100% of installed geothermal capacity is now considered eligible and aligned compared to the 10% in the previous analysis, while an additional 0.5% of installed hydroelectric capacity is now considered eligible (from 99% to 99.5%);\n  - transmission and distribution of electricity: DSOs in Chile, Colombia and Peru are now considered eligible and new infrastructures installed in 2020 to connect power plants with a carbon intensity threshold above 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh were excluded from the financial data of all eligible and aligned DSOs;\n  - Enel X: E-Home and distributed energy solutions are now considered eligible and aligned (previously considered not eligible);\n  - retail electricity sales: retail electricity sales in Italy and Spain using Certificates of Origin are now considered eligible and aligned (previously considered not eligible).\n\n- Absolute turnover/Capex/Opex/EBITDA correspond to the turnover/Capex/Opex/EBITDA (measured in euros) of each specific activity. The share of individual KPIs corresponds to each individual economic activity in the total turnover/Capex/EBITDA of the Group (with the exception of Opex, the total of which refers only to the type of costs required by the taxonomy). The share of turnover/Capex/Opex/EBITDA of each individual economic activity contributes to achieving climate change mitigation targets. This is the only objective of the EU Taxonomy Regulation alignment analysis shown in the table, as it is more relevant than the climate change adaptation objective, while the criteria for the other environmental objectives are not yet available.\nThe 2021-2023 Strategic Plan presented at Capital Markets Day 2020 held in November 2020 stated a range of 80% to 90% of investments aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation for the three-year period due to regulatory uncertainty when the Plan was announced (the Climate Delegated Act had not yet been approved). However, 85.6% of capital expenditure set aside for 2021 in the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan is now considered aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation according to the updated 2021 analysis. The same main changes are considered for the restated 2020 data. In addition, the new 2022-2024 Strategic Plan presented on Capital Markets Day 2021 states that more than 85% of capital expenditure will be allocated to aligned activities in the Plan period.\n\nStatement on the alignment of Enel\u2019s business to the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nOverall results\n\nThe high level of alignment of our economic activities with the EU Taxonomy Regulation in 2021, made possible by their substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective while respecting the principle of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to other environmental objective and observing the minimum social safeguards, is shown below.\n\n- 68.7% of the ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA) relates to business activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, compared to 73.4% in 2020. Considering all retail electricity sales as \u201cnot eligible\u201d, 65.8% of ordinary gross operating profit in 2021 was aligned.\n\nThe EBITDA percentage of taxonomy eligible and aligned businesses decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to changes in revenue (see details below).\n\n(1) Excluding the capital gain on the sale of Open Fiber from ordinary EBITDA, eligible-aligned ordinary EBITDA is equal to 75.6% of total.\n\nDisclosure of the proportion of activities considered environmentally sustainable (Article 8, EU Regulation 2020/852)\n\u2022 39.9% of turnover relates to business activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, compared to 46.2% in 2020. Considering all retail electricity sales as \u201cnot eligible\u201d, 32.6% of turnover in 2021 was aligned.\n\nAlthough revenue related to taxonomy eligible and aligned activities was up in 2021 due to increased renewable energy generation, higher electricity transmission and distribution activity, and greater electricity sales with Certificates of Origin, revenues from not eligible activities also increased due to higher trading operations and higher thermoelectric (gas) generation, and from the sale of gas in the retail market.\n\n(1) Excluding the capital gain on the sale of Open Fiber from turnover, eligible-aligned turnover is equal to 40.8% of total.\n\n\u2022 84.6% of capital expenditure (Capex) relates to business activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, compared to 84.7% in 2020. Considering all retail electricity sales as \u201cnot eligible\u201d, 83.7% of capital expenditure was aligned.\n\nThe percentage of Capex of taxonomy eligible and aligned activities remains unchanged in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nThe actual 2021 Capex for eligible and aligned activities is 1.9% lower than the Capex planned for 2021 in the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan for the same activities. Although, in absolute terms, the final figure is higher than planned (due in particular to the additional investments of 683 million euros compared to those planned to increase the Group\u2019s renewables capacity), additional investments in eligible but not aligned activities and in not eligible activities amounting to 412 million euros were also developed, in particular on activities involving electricity transmission and distribution, sales of energy not certified by Certificates of Origin, and thermoelectric generation (gas).\n64.6% of operating expenses (Opex) relates to business activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, compared to 65.5% in 2020. Considering all retail electricity sales as \u201cnot eligible\u201d, 64.2% of operating expenses are aligned.\n\nThe percentage of Opex of taxonomy eligible and aligned activities was down in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a slight decrease in costs in taxonomy aligned distribution activities and thermal generation (coal) activities.\n\n(1) Only expenses required by the taxonomy.\n###

Accordingly, only the original Italian version is authoritative.)\n\nIndependent auditors\u2019 report on the schedule of environmentally sustainable economic activities (article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852)\n\nTo the board of directors of\nEnel S.p.A.\n\nWe have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on the accompanying 2021 schedule of environmentally sustainable economic activities (article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852), comprising the related notes (the \u201cschedule\u201d) of the Enel Group (the \u201cgroup\u201d).\n\nResponsibilities of the directors of Enel S.p.A. (the \u201cparent\u201d) for the schedule\n\nThe directors are responsible for selecting and defining the basis of preparation of the schedule.\n\nThey are responsible for the preparation of the schedule in accordance with the basis of preparation described in the notes.\n\nThe directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a schedule that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAuditors\u2019 independence and quality control\n\nWe are independent in compliance with the independence and all other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards, the IESBA Code) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our company applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly, maintains a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nAuditors' responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the schedule, based on the procedures performed. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established by \"International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\" (\"ISAE 3000 revised\"), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board applicable to limited assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the report is free from material misstatement.\n\nA limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement carried out in accordance with ISAE 3000 revised, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nThe procedures we performed on the schedule are based on our professional judgement and include inquiries, primarily of the parent's personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the schedule, documental analyses, recalculations and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate.\n\nSpecifically, we carried out the following procedures:\n\n\u2014 analysing and understanding the criteria adopted by the group in order to identify the activities and how they have been associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable;\n\n\u2014 critical analysis of the basis of preparation described in the notes;\n\n\u2014 understanding the process for processing and preparing the quantitative information presented in the schedule and related calculation methods;\n\n\u2014 performing selected procedures, on a sample basis, to check whether the quantitative information presented in the schedule had been prepared in conformity with the basis of preparation indicated by the parent and analysed as per the previous point;\n\n\u2014 comparing the financial disclosures used to calculate the quantitative information presented with those included in the group's consolidated financial statements;\n\n\u2014 obtaining the representation letter from the directors.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 2021 schedule of the Enel Group has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the basis of preparation described in the notes.\n\nRome, 14 April 2022\n\nKPMG S.p.A.\n\n(signed on the original)\n\nMarco Maffei\nDirector of Audit\nGreen Bond Report \u2013 Supporting notes\n\nIntroduction and reporting criteria\n\nEnel Finance International NV, the Group\u2019s financial company controlled by Enel SpA, placed three green bonds on the European market in January 2017 (1.25 billion euros), 2018 (1.25 billion euros) and 2019 (1 billion euros) for a total of 3.50 billion euros. The green bonds are for institutional investors and are guaranteed by Enel SpA. The net issuance proceeds \u2013 carried out under the medium-term bond issue program of Enel and Enel Finance International (Euro Medium-Term Notes Program \u2013 EMTN) \u2013 were used to finance eligible projects according to the \u201cGreen Bond Principles\u201d categories, published by the ICMA (International Capital Market Association). In particular, the proceeds were used to finance:\n\n\u2022 new projects for the development, construction and repowering of generation plants from renewable sources (green bond emission in 2017 and 2019);\n\u2022 new projects for the development, construction, repowering and refinancing of generation plants from renewable sources as well as projects for transmission, networks and smart grids (green bond emission in 2018).\n\nIn order to facilitate the transparency and quality of the green bonds issued, the Enel Group has prepared and published specific \u201cGreen Bond Frameworks\u201d for each year of emission, whose compliance with the reference principles has been confirmed by an external advisor, Vigeo Eiris, who issued the so-called \u201csecond party opinion\u201d.\n\nWithin the frameworks, the categories relating to eligible projects are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN SDG), in particular Goals 7, 9, 11 and 13(1).\n\nThe reference documents for the three emissions are available on the Enel Group\u2019s website (https://www.enel.com/investors/investing/sustainable-finance/green-bonds). The Group is among the first companies in the world having set up a \u201cGreen Bond Committee\u201d with the aim of selecting projects and monitoring the progress of their development. The reporting document hereof, published for the fifth time in 2021, meets Enel\u2019s commitment undertaken at the time of the bond issuance to report annually on the use of proceeds, on the environmental benefits deriving from the projects financed and on further ESG metrics linked to these projects.\n\nThe indicators were determined in accordance with the \u201cGreen Bond Framework\u201d (December 2016, December 2017 and November 2018) principles and shown in the table based on the type of project and the specific year of emission of the green bonds. Furthermore, all of the plant technologies as well as the Infrastructure and Networks activities in Italy for which the proceeds of the green bonds issued in 2017, 2018 and 2019 were allocated are to be considered eligible and aligned activities according to European taxonomy (European Regulation 2020/852).\n\n(1) SDG 7 \u201cAffordable and clean energy\u201d; SDG 9 \u201cIndustry, innovation and infrastructure\u201d; SDG 11 \u201cSustainable cities and communities\u201d; SDG 13 \u201cClimate action.\u201d\nIn order to improve transparency and facilitate understanding of reporting over the years, the report also provides the following information:\n\n- **2017 green bond reporting** with evidence of projects relating to renewable plants. Seven plants also contribute toward the allocation of the proceeds of the 2019 green bond following new investments (Capex) that were made;\n\n- **2018 green bond reporting** with evidence of projects related to:\n  - renewable plants, three of which that contribute toward the allocation of the proceeds of the 2019 green bond due to new investments (Capex) that were made;\n  - \u201crefinancing\u201d of renewable plants due to the replacement of previous credit lines;\n  - investment activities relating to the business area \u201cInfrastructure and Networks\u201d;\n\n- **2019 green bond reporting** with evidence of the projects relating to renewable plants, 10 of which were also subject to reporting for the 2017 and 2018 green bonds, as described previously.\n\nFinally, in agreement with what is required by the cited Green Bond Framework, this document consists of the following indicated below.\n\n- **Summary table of 2017, 2018 and 2019 emissions** with indication of the installed capacity and the cumulative CO\u2082 avoided for all years of Green Bond reporting.\n\n- **Table A \u201cFinancial indicators\u201d**, which reports:\n  - the capacity and amount of the \u201cforeign currency investment\u201d approved by the Board of Directors and/or the Investment Committee, and communicated to the financial market through specific press releases;\n  - the value of the \u201cinvestment in euros\u201d, calculated by considering the average exchange rate for the years 2017-2019 (for projects defined in 2017), the average exchange rate for the years 2018-2020 (for projects defined in 2018) and/or the average exchange rate for the years 2019-2021 (for projects defined in 2019) of Enel\u2019s Industrial Plan;\n  - the share of the green bond proceeds allocated to the project as the difference between the total capitalized costs as at December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and/or December 31, 2019 and the amount of third-party financing associated to the specific project. The amounts of proceeds allocated to the projects in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively were used in the same years;\n\n- **Table B \u201cESG indicators\u201d**, which shows the environmental benefit in terms of actual CO\u2082 avoided. In particular, with reference to:\n  - renewable projects:\n    - the quantity of effective generation (with the exception of the repowering plants whose share of generation cannot be separated from the rest of the plant);\n    - the quantity of actual CO\u2082 avoided, determined by multiplying the effective generation by the emission factor linked to the specific thermoelectric energy generation of the country in which the plant is located (emission factors source: Enerdata - January 13, 2022 release);\n    - in consideration of the entry into operation of almost all of the plants associated with the three green bonds, it was decided to no longer disclose the share of expected generation and the expected CO\u2082 avoided;\n    - the cumulative value of effective generation and the relative CO\u2082 avoided for the entire years of Green Bond reporting;\n\n  - **Infrastructure and Networks projects**, the following indicators are also provided:\n    - the cabling ratio, determined by the ratio between the length of the cable lines and the total length of the lines. The increase in this index over time is due to an increase in the length of the overhead and underground cable line to the detriment of bare conductors; in particular, the main environmental benefits concern the containment of plant cutting activities and a drastic reduction in the risk of electrocution for birds;\n    - network automation, which corresponds to the ratio between RCP (Remote Controlled Point) and medium/low-voltage equipment;\n    - technical network losses, mainly related to the characteristics/functions of the network. These losses are usually calculated using statistical models or benchmarks. A reduction in technical network losses results in a reduction in the energy to be generated and a consequent reduction in emissions and consumption of raw materials;\n    - the elimination of oil equipment with PCB reduces the risk of contamination of a compound no longer in production since the 1980s and classified as ecotoxic and bioaccumulable;\n\n---\n\n(2) If the same company is involved with the implementation of several projects, proceeds are allocated to the specific project based on the capacity.\n\n(3) Only 26 MW of installed capacity remain with the \u201cunder construction\u201d status associated with the 2019 green bond (included in the Italian hydroelectric 40 MW) that refer to repowering plants whose generation share cannot be separated from the rest of the plant.\nthe calculation of CO\u2082 avoided. The energy saving estimation model takes into account: the number of low-loss transformers replacing traditional transformers; operations on the MV network; network upgrading measures; the new transformer rooms, which involve optimizing the grid in terms of reducing low-voltage lines in favor of higher-voltage ones.\n\n- Table C \u201cFurther ESG indicators\u201d, which shows, where possible and appropriate\u2074, as envisaged in the \u201csecond party opinion\u201d\u2075, the following indicators for the renewable projects:\n  - water consumption related to the data reported in the period of construction of the plant or the period following its entry into operation;\n  - projects for protecting biodiversity promoted by Enel in connection to the operation of the plant;\n  - the cases in which the site stopped its operations (plant shutdown) due to environmental management issues and their impact;\n  - fatalities or high consequence (\u201cLife Changing\u201d\u2076) injuries to Enel people;\n  - activities and projects carried out to support local communities in the areas surrounding the plant. The indicator related to the number of beneficiaries of these projects refers to the people involved by such activity or project.\n\nThe above indicators in Table C, with the exception of water consumption and plant shutdown due to environmental issues, also refer to Infrastructure and Networks projects.\n\n- Table D \u201cOverall information\u201d, which provides the criteria, indicators, overall information and approach chosen by Enel to develop the projects financed through the proceeds of the bond.\n\nThe data have been thoroughly calculated on the basis of the results of Enel\u2019s accounting, non-accounting and other information systems, and validated by the persons responsible in each case. The data determined through the use of estimates and related calculation method has been expressly indicated.\n\n### Summary table of 2017, 2018 and 2019 emissions with indication of the installed capacity and the CO\u2082 avoided\n\n| GB emission | Area of investment | GB proceeds allocated (mil euros) | Installed capacity (MW) | Cumulative CO\u2082 avoided (t) |\n|-------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 2017        | Renewables         | 1,238                            | 3,355                   | 20,096,219                |\n| 2018        |                    | 1,240                            |                         |                          |\n| of which new renewable projects | Renewables | 575                              | 1,878                   | 7,796,732                |\n| of which new Infrastructure and Networks projects | I&N | 665                              |                         | 62,457                   |\n| 2019        |                    | 986                              | 638                     | 1,149,296                |\n| of which new projects identified in 2019 | Renewables | 65                               | 638                     | 1,149,296                |\n| of which new Capex for 2018 projects | Renewables | 342                              | n.a.                    | n.a.                     |\n| of which new Capex for 2017 projects | Renewables | 579                              | n.a.                    | n.a.                     |\n\n---\n\n\u2074 Projects relating to renewable plants with a capacity of more than 20 MW are considered to be relevant.\n\u2075 The indicator \u201cMaterial reused/recycled after revamping\u201d is not applicable, as the proceeds of the green bond were not used to finance revamping projects in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\u2076 These are injuries that caused consequences to health that permanently changed a person\u2019s life (for example amputation of limbs, paralysis, neurological damage, etc.).

Our company applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC 1) and, accordingly, maintains a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nAuditors\u2019 responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion, based on the procedures performed, about the compliance of the report with the frameworks described in the \u201cIntroduction and reporting criteria\u201d note to the report. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established by \u201cInternational Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u201d (\u201cISAE 3000 revised\u201d), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board applicable to limited assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the report is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement carried out in accordance with ISAE 3000 revised, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nThe procedures we performed on the report are based on our professional judgement and include inquiries, primarily of the parent\u2019s personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the report, documental analyses, recalculations and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate.\n\nSpecifically, we carried out the following procedures:\n\n1. obtaining and reading the second party opinion;\n2. interviewing relevant staff at corporate and business level responsible for the 2021 Green Bond management and reporting;\n3. understanding the processes underlying the generation, recording and management of the qualitative and quantitative information disclosed in the report;\n4. holding interviews and discussions with the company\u2019s management personnel to obtain information on the processes and procedures used to gather, combine, process and transmit data and information to the office that prepares the report;\n5. performing sample-based documental analysis and analytical procedures to check the indicators included in the report.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 2021 Green Bond Report of Enel S.p.A. has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the frameworks described in the \u201cIntroduction and reporting criteria\u201d note to the report.\n\nOther matters\n\nOther auditors performed a limited assurance engagement on the 2017, 2018 and 2019 figures presented in the 2021 Green Bond Report and expressed their unqualified conclusions on 10 May 2018, 7 May 2019 and 8 April 2020, respectively.\n\nRome, 14 April 2022\n\nKPMG S.p.A.\n\n(signed on the original)\n\nMarco Maffei\nDirector of Audit\nSTATEMENT\n\nDNV Business Assurance (DNV) has been commissioned by the management of ENEL SpA to carry out an independent verification of its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions relative to the 2021 calendar year.\n\n| Greenhouse Gas Emissions                                      | t CO\u2082eq |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Direct (Scope 1) GHG Emissions (*)                           | 51 570 265 |\n| Energy Indirect (Scope 2) GHG Emission (Located Based)       | 4 303 184 |\n| Energy Indirect (Scope 2) GHG Emission (Market Based)        | 7 114 150 |\n| Other Indirect (Scope 3) GHG Emissions                       | 69 149 498 |\n| of which use of natural gas sold in the retail market         | 22 250 950 |\n| CO\u2082 biogenic from biomass combustion (**)                    | 125 878 |\n| (*) it includes CH\u2084 and N\u2082O biogenic emissions from combustion|         |\n| (**) direct CO\u2082 biogenic emissions are reported separately as per \u00a74 of the GHG Protocol |\n\nAssurance Opinion\n\nBased on the verification process conducted by DNV as explained in the annex of this statement:\n\n- we provide a reasonable assurance of Scope 1, Scope 2 and the Scope 3 GHG emissions associated to use of natural gas sold in the retail market of ENEL GHG Inventory as DNV found to be:\n  - materially correct.\n  - a fair representation of GHG emissions information; and\n  - in accordance with the Verification Criteria\n\n- we provide a limited assurance of the remaining Scope 3 GHG Emissions of ENEL GHG Inventory as no evidence was found showing to be:\n  - not materially correct.\n  - not a fair representation of GHG emissions information; and\n  - not in accordance with the Verification Criteria\n\nDNV Business Assurance USA, Inc.\n12 April 2022\n\nLead Verifier\nFrancisco Zamarron\n\nTechnical Reviewer\nShruthi Bachamanda\n\nApprover\nDavid Tellez\n\nThe purpose of the DNV group of companies is to promote safe and sustainable futures.

This compared to the 2019 Plan, which instead envisaged a reduction of GHG Scope 1 emissions per kWh of 70% by 2030 with respect to the 2017 baseline, reaching a carbon intensity of less than 125 gCO\u2082eq/kWh.\n| ISIN          | ISSUER | ISSUANCE DATE | AMOUNT ISSUED | AMOUNT OUTSTANDING | MATURITY | KPI(s)                                      | SPT(s)                                      |\n|--------------|--------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| US29278GAL23 | EFI    | 10/09/2019    | 1,500,000,000 $ | 1,500,000,000 $    | 10/09/2024 | Renewable installed capacity percentage | 55% by 2021                                |\n| XS2066706818 | EFI    | 17/10/2019    | 1,000,000,000 \u20ac | 1,000,000,000 \u20ac    | 17/06/2024 | Renewable installed capacity percentage | 55% by 2021                                |\n| XS2066706909 | EFI    | 17/10/2019    | 1,000,000,000 \u20ac | 1,000,000,000 \u20ac    | 17/06/2027 | Renewable installed capacity percentage | 55% by 2021                                |\n| XS2066706735 | EFI    | 17/10/2019    | 500,000,000 \u20ac   | 500,000,000 \u20ac      | 17/10/2034 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 125 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2033 |\n| XS2244418609 | EFI    | 20/10/2020    | 500,000,000 \u20ac   | 500,000,000 \u20ac      | 20/10/2027 | Renewable installed capacity percentage | 60% by 2022                                |\n| XS2353182020 | EFI    | 17/06/2021    | 1,000,000,000 \u20ac | 1,000,000,000 \u20ac    | 17/06/2027 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2023 |\n| XS2353182293 | EFI    | 17/06/2021    | 1,250,000,000 \u20ac | 1,250,000,000 \u20ac    | 17/06/2030 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2023 |\n| XS2353182376 | EFI    | 17/06/2021    | 1,000,000,000 \u20ac | 1,000,000,000 \u20ac    | 17/06/2036 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2030 |\n| US29278GAM06 | EFI    | 12/07/2021    | 1,250,000,000 $ | 1,250,000,000 $    | 12/07/2026 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2023 |\n| US29278GAN88 | EFI    | 12/07/2021    | 1,000,000,000 $ | 1,000,000,000 $    | 12/07/2028 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2023 |\n| US29278GAP37 | EFI    | 12/07/2021    | 1,000,000,000 $ | 1,000,000,000 $    | 12/07/2031 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2023 |\n| US29278GAQ10 | EFI    | 12/07/2021    | 750,000,000 $   | 750,000,000 $      | 12/07/2041 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2030 |\n| XS2390400633 | EFI    | 28/09/2021    | 1,250,000,000 \u20ac | 1,250,000,000 \u20ac    | 28/05/2026 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2023 |\n| XS2390400716 | EFI    | 28/09/2021    | 1,000,000,000 \u20ac | 1,000,000,000 \u20ac    | 28/05/2029 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2023 |\n| XS2390400807 | EFI    | 28/09/2021    | 1,250,000,000 \u20ac | 1,250,000,000 \u20ac    | 28/09/2034 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2030 |\n| XS2432293673 | EFI    | 17/01/2022    | 1,250,000,000 \u20ac | 1,250,000,000 \u20ac    | 17/11/2025 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2023 |\n| XS2432293756 | EFI    | 17/01/2022    | 750,000,000 \u20ac   | 750,000,000 \u20ac      | 17/01/2031 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 140 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2024 |\n| XS2432293913 | EFI    | 17/01/2022    | 750,000,000 \u20ac   | 750,000,000 \u20ac      | 17/01/2035 | Direct greenhouse gas emissions amount (CO\u2082eq/kWh) | 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2030 |\n2. KPI #1: Direct Greenhouse Gas Emissions Amount (Scope 1)\n\nKPI #1: Direct Greenhouse Gas Emissions Amount (Scope 1)\n\n- Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (measured in grams of CO\u2082 per kWh)\n\n- **Definition and methodology:** Group Scope 1 CO\u2082 equivalent emissions (grams per kWh), as defined and detailed in the documentation of the relevant sustainability-linked transactions.\n\n- **Rationale:** Enel\u2019s carbon footprint is key to measure Enel\u2019s path towards full decarbonization by 2040. Scope 1 intensity in 2021 is equal to: 227 gCO\u2082eq/kWh.\n\n- **Intermediate and long-term goals:** the first GHG Scope 1 emissions reduction target was set in 2015:\n  - GHG Scope 1 emissions per kWh reduction by 25% by 2020 with respect to 2007 baseline, therefore reaching a carbon intensity lower than 350 gCO\u2082eq/kWh. The target was certified by SBTi.\n\n  In 2019 the target was accomplished in advance and two new targets were set within the 2020-2022 Strategic Plan\n  - GHG Scope 1 emissions per kWh equal or less than 254 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2020; and\n  - GHG Scope 1 emissions per kWh equal or less than 220 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2022.\n\n  Furthermore, a new target was announced in 2019:\n  - GHG Scope 1 emissions per kWh reduction by 70% by 2030 with respect to 2017 baseline, reaching a carbon intensity lower than 125 gCO\u2082eq/kWh. The target has been certified by SBTi as compliant with the \u201cWell Below 2 \u00b0C\u201d pathway.\n\n  In October 2020, new targets were announced as part of the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan:\n  - GHG Scope 1 emissions per kWh reduction by 80% by 2030 with respect to the 2017 baseline, reaching a carbon intensity lower than 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh. The target is certified by SBTi as compliant with the 1.5 \u00b0C pathway;\n  - the expected path to 2030 target now also includes a target of GHG Scope 1 emissions per kWh equal or less than 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2023.\n\n  In November 2021, Enel announced the acceleration of its decarbonization plan and brought forward its decarbonization target to 2040, confirming at the same time its 2030 target of GHG Scope 1 emissions per kWh reduction by 80% by 2030 with respect to the 2017\n  - The expected path to 2030 target now also includes a target of GHG Scope 1 emissions per kWh equal or less than 140 gCO\u2082eq/kWh by 2024.\n\n  The ultimate goal is now to reach the full decarbonization of Enel\u2019s energy mix by 2040.\n\n- **Contribution to UN SDGs:** SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\n\n### SPTs on Enel\u2019s KPI #1 Performance\n\n| KPI #1 Performance | 2019 (reported) | 2020 (reported) | 2021 (reported) | 2023 (target) | 2024 (target) | 2030 (target) | 2040 (target) |\n|--------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Gap vs 2023        | 298            | 214            | 227            | 148          | 140          | 82           | 0            |\n| Gap vs 2024        | 150            | 66             | 79             |              |              |              |              |\n| Gap vs 2030        | 216            | 132            | 145            | 66           | 58           |              |              |\n| Gap vs 2040        | 298            | 214            | 227            | 148          | 140          | 82           |              |\n3.
