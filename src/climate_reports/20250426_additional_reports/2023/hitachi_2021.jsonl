From April 2021, the Automotive Systems business (Hitachi Astemo) was made independent from the Smart Life sector, as we undertake business with the goal of creating further value through the six segments.\nAiming to Build a Resilient Company Structure\n\nTo develop Hitachi\u2019s Social Innovation Business, building a resilient company structure is essential. By executing highly effective management and all executives and employees acting as good corporate citizens with the Hitachi Group Code of Conducts, we will fulfill our responsibilities. This will help to address social issues called for in Society 5.0 and SDGs.\nCEO\u2019s Message\n\nCreating New Social Value with a Unique Vision for the Future\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, people\u2019s lives were dramatically impacted everywhere by the COVID-19 pandemic, which made existing social and economic challenges all the more apparent. Meanwhile, efforts to address climate change have accelerated significantly as the world acknowledges the urgency of this issue for sustainability, and glaring human rights issues have also been in the spotlight. It is clear that companies today must provide not only economic value, but also environmental and social value.\n\nAt Hitachi, we have been making the most of our strengths in operational technology (OT), IT, and products (OT \u00d7 IT \u00d7 Products) under our 2021 Mid-term Management Plan. We have sought to improve the quality of life for people everywhere while enhancing value for customers with our Lumada suite of digital solutions, services, and technologies. We are also determined to create new social value with our Social Innovation Business. We are doing this by defining the kind of future value we would like to create. For example, we envision the kind of thriving world we would like to see by 2050 and then backcast from there to determine what we need to do now. As part of this effort, we have defined three areas where Hitachi will focus its growth: Environment, Resilience, and Security & Safety.\n\nIn the area of Environment, we will help build a decarbonized, resource efficient society. In the area of Resilience, we want to promote a society that can handle any disruption to public services and systems caused by a natural disaster or resource shortage. In the area of Security & Safety, we aim to help prepare for an era when the average person will live to be 100 by helping to make it possible for everyone to grow older while enjoying good physical and mental health. At Hitachi, we are committed to developing and providing solutions for social issues in order to help build a world that is sustainable, resilient, secure and safe.\n\nMaximizing human resource value is one of the keys to our Social Innovation Business. We want every Hitachi employee to view social issues as part of their own personal agenda. We are also shifting to job-based human capital management. This ensures the right people are in the right jobs taking into careful account the abilities and motivation of each individual. I want to see the power of each autonomous individual taking the initiative to generate a collective force that drives the growth of the entire Hitachi Group. We are also making a range of efforts to improve workplace environments in a way that will foster more independent thinking by employees. These include asking employees to consider which business fields we want to strengthen and to look at how we can bring products to market over the medium and long term based on next-generation technology trends as well as social changes. These efforts are led by our Future Investment Division. In addition, we hold the \u201cMake a Difference!\u201d in-house idea contest.\n\nI have also been emphasizing dialogue and engagement with shareholders and investors. Fortunately, there have been greater opportunities recently to engage in broad discussions with these stakeholders on environmental issues and human resource development. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) measures are top priorities for corporate management, and these are inherent responsibilities for every good corporate citizen. In the area of human resources management, we will pursue globally optimized deployment of human resources and improve engagement with employees while fostering diversity and inclusion. We also aim to increase the ratios for female and non-Japanese executive and corporate officers to 30% by fiscal 2030.\n\nIn the area of governance, we are preparing to introduce new environmental indicators as part of the package for determining executive compensation evaluation, and we will continue to strengthen our risk management.\n\nHitachi will keep striving to meet the expectations of all stakeholders by practicing openness and transparency. Our goal is to address social issues with a unique vision for an even better future and we do this by considering every perspective including the timeframe, region, and value. I look forward to your continued support going forward.\nA Company That Contributes to Environmental Impact Reductions and the Realization of a Decarbonized Society\n\nHitachi aims to become a Climate Change Innovator helping to support governments\u2019, cities\u2019, and companies\u2019 efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hitachi is proud to be the first Japanese company to join the group of Principal Partners for COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, to be held in Glasgow, the United Kingdom, in November 2021. For over 110 years since the company\u2019s foundation, Hitachi has been putting the Hitachi Mission\u2014\u201cContribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products\u201d\u2014into practice, contributing to the realization of a decarbonized society through our operations. Our aim is to achieve a decarbonized society, a resource efficient society and a harmonized society with nature. Our participation in COP26, I feel, constitutes a major step toward the realization of a decarbonized society.\n\nOur 2021 Mid-term Management Plan places an emphasis on environmental value, and clearly indicates our commitment to focus our efforts on environmental activities. Having taken the post of chief environmental officer in April 2021, I will work to accelerate the pace of our environmental initiatives.\n\nIn 2020 we announced the aim for our business sites (factories and offices) to become carbon neutral by fiscal 2050 compared to 1990. Japan has announced it too shares the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 as well as the realization of a net zero society.\n\nCountries worldwide are currently working to further bolster climate change countermeasures. The European Union has announced updates to its 2020 NDCs (nationally determined contributions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions) of now achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. Japan has announced it too shares the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 as well. In responding to environmental issues, and particularly to climate change, the implementation of specific initiatives has become essential, as has technological development with a medium- to long-term perspective.\n\nHitachi will leverage such new business portfolios to the utmost and utilize the power of our many businesses and digital innovations, particularly in our IT, Energy, Industry, and Mobility sectors in working toward a decarbonized society. Through these efforts I am confident that Hitachi will be able to make contributions to activities such as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and companies\u2019 environmental impacts, as well as the realization of a decarbonized society.\n\n*1 In October 2021, the company\u2019s name was changed to Hitachi Energy, to show a strengthened commitment to sustainable energy in the future.\nEnvironmental Strategy for Achieving a Decarbonized Society\n\nHitachi\u2019s Environmental Strategy\n\nIn fiscal 2016, toward building a low-carbon society, Hitachi set the target of reducing CO\u2082 emissions through its value chain by 80% by fiscal 2050 compared to emissions in fiscal 2010, in order to achieve our long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050. After releasing the targets, the IPCC 1.5\u00b0C Special Report was published in 2018 stating that further measures are needed to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Each country has strengthened its measures when resubmitting NDCs (nationally determined contributions) to reducing greenhouse gas emissions determined by a country/region in 2020. The world is rapidly moving toward a decarbonized society with the EU announcing its goal of achieving climate neutrality in 2050 and reducing GHG emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990, and Japan also announcing its goal of achieving carbon neutrality in 2050.\n\nIn the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, Hitachi has clearly stated its commitment to focusing on the creation of environmental value. In terms of business, we are working to strengthen sectors including our railway business (a means of transportation with a small environmental impact) and our grid solutions business which plays an important role in electrification and decarbonization of the energy sector. We continue to make progress with such efforts, building business portfolios able to further contribute to the achievement of a decarbonized society. Looking forward, Hitachi will remain committed to working together as one and combining innovative products and services to contribute to our customers\u2019 decarbonization as well. In 2021, Hitachi became the first Japanese company to take on the role of a Principal Partner for COP26.\n\nBased on these internal and external changes, Hitachi has promoted aiming for a decarbonized society, one of the long-term environmental targets set out in Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050, with the goal of leading climate change measures committed to achieving a decarbonized society.\n\nWe will implement the following initiatives companywide to achieve our new long-term environmental goals:\n\n1. Achieve carbon neutrality in business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030\n   - We will further improve production efficiency and energy use efficiency during the production by using production technology developed over a long time and the Lumada platform and by adopting and updating highly efficient equipment in our business sites (factories and offices).\n   - We will also acquire renewable energy and adopt equipment for it to effectively promote carbon neutrality at our business sites.\n   - We will encourage use of our Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) system which was introduced to provide incentives for capital investments that contribute to CO\u2082 reductions. HICP is an in-house system to visualize the amount of CO\u2082 reductions from capital investments in factories and offices, and then convert it into costs and apply it to investment decisions.\n\n2. World-class energy efficiency of products\n   - We will promote world-class energy efficiency in our products provided to our customers by considering reductions in environmental impacts from the design stage.\n\n3. Active promotion of projects that contribute to society\u2019s overall shift to carbon neutrality\n   - In order to speed up the shift to carbon-neutral energy systems, we will combine power grids (transmission/distribution networks) that support the expansion of renewable energy with state-of-the-art intelligent control systems which will serve as stronger, more reliable, and more secure energy systems that contribute to a decarbonized society.\n   - We will contribute to popularizing decarbonization mobility by encouraging the spread of highly energy-efficient high-speed railcars and hybrid railcars with storage batteries, providing EV systems to expand the EV market, and creating and enhancing EV value chains to help promote the spread of EVs.\n   - We will contribute to the decarbonized operations of our customers by providing Lumada-powered solution services which help reduce CO\u2082 emissions by advancing the digitalization of society.\n\n4. Develop technology that paves the way for transitioning to a decarbonized society\n   - Hitachi is taking the approach of backcasting from 2050 and promoting research and development that can respond to the rapid changes in society. Hitachi plans to set the amount of R&D investments at \u00a51.5 trillion over a three year period. In the environmental field that includes promoting research and development in areas such as grid control technology that would bring about the mass adoption of renewable energy, electrification/motorization and operation management technology, state-of-the-art materials, and CO\u2082 absorption and utilization and thus contribute to a net zero society.\n\n5. Work with suppliers toward a decarbonized society\n   - As part of the initiatives to promote carbon neutrality in our supply chain, starting in fiscal 2021 we plan to request that 70% of our suppliers (based on the total amount of our transactions and does not include publicly listed subsidiaries) formulate CO\u2082 reduction plans.\n\nToward a Decarbonized Society\n\n- Achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 through the value chain and reduce CO\u2082 emissions by 50% by fiscal 2030 (compared to fiscal 2010)\n- Achieve carbon neutrality in business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030\nHitachi's Mission is to contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products. This Mission has been carefully passed on to generations of employees and stakeholders throughout our 110-year history. Our Values reflect the Hitachi Founding Spirit of Harmony, Sincerity and Pioneering Spirit, which was shaped by the achievements of our predecessors in the company as they worked hard to fulfill the Mission. Our Vision was created based on our Mission and Values. It is an expression of what Hitachi Group aims to become in the future as it advances in its next stage of growth. Our Mission, Values, and Vision combine to form the Hitachi Group Identity. Based on the Hitachi Group Identity, and continuously considering the next generation, we promote corporate activities with a view to the medium and long term informed by sensitivity to the needs of a changing society. The Mid-term Management Plan is our action plan to realize the Hitachi Group Vision; by integrating our management and sustainability strategies, we seek to enhance the effectiveness of this approach. The implementation of the plan is a way for us to fulfill our responsibilities as a good corporate citizen through robust, diverse governance; the Pioneering Spirit and strong ethical stance of our employees; and operations that help address social issues. We operate and pursue our activities in line with the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, the guidelines for ethical behavior and decision-making shared by all executives and employees of the Hitachi Group.\nHitachi practices sustainable management and places sustainability at the center of our business strategy and\u2014in our 2021 Mid-term Management Plan ending in fiscal 2021\u2014setting ourselves the goal of contributing to the realization of a sustainable world as a global leader of our Social Innovation Business. In working toward realization of this goal, Hitachi is focusing efforts on the three key areas of Environment, Resilience, and Security & Safety to contribute to the resolution of social and management issues. We remain committed to improving people\u2019s Quality of Life (QoL), as well as improving the value for customers.\n\nWe will expand our Social Innovation Business through collaborative creation using the knowledge in our business areas and our partners around the world and by providing Lumada, a solution that accelerates digital innovation as a cyber-physical system that allows the cyber and physical spaces to interact.\n\nWe continue to further merge sustainability and business to contribute to the resolution of social issues through initiatives like Society 5.0 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nHitachi\u2019s Business Vision\n\n- Improve Quality of Life\n- Add value for customers\n- Resolve social and management issues by focusing on three key areas\n- Provide OT\u00d7IT\u00d7Products as a Package\nSustainability Strategy Promotion Structure\n\nHitachi, Ltd.\u2019s Executive Sustainability Committee, which is held twice a year, comprises Executive Chairman & CEO Toshiaki Higashihara, and other members of the Senior Executive Committee, along with the CEOs of every business unit. The committee discusses and reaches decisions on important policies and measures related to sustainability, shares progress and results, and finds ways to connect these to further improvements and new initiatives.\n\nSustainability Promotion Meetings hold twice a year that attended by sustainability strategy promotion officers from business units (business promotion division head-class), also established under the committee, formulate long-term corporate strategies focusing on ESG (environmental, social, and governance) to promote specific measures for advancing sustainability, including contribution to achieving the SDGs.\n\nTo review and discuss CSR initiatives, CSR Manager Meetings are regularly held by CSR and social contribution officers from business units and Group companies. Additionally, CSR officers at regional headquarters in the United States, Europe, China, Southeast Asia, India, and Australia, as well as environmental officers in the United States, Europe, and China work daily to cultivate mutual understanding and provide opportunities for general meetings in order to achieve cross-regional information sharing and cooperation.\n\nTo discuss and implement specific measures to achieve long-term environmental targets, the Eco-Management Meetings, whose members are environmental promotion officers from business units and Group companies, work together with Sustainability Promotion Meetings. Global and Regional Environmental Meetings are also held regularly, allowing environmental initiative officers from regional headquarters outside Japan to share common practices and promote environmental initiatives.\n\nAdditionally, starting in fiscal 2021, in order to further accelerate human rights and diversity initiatives, newly established Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) Manager Meetings are held twice yearly to promote human rights due diligence. Also, the Diversity Development Council meets once or twice a year, along with periodic reporting and deliberations by the Executive Sustainability Committee on progress being made toward these efforts. We have worked with business units and key Group companies to strengthen our structure to promote human rights and diversity initiatives.\n\nThe Sustainability Promotion Division holds regular dialogue with stakeholders in each region in cooperation with regional headquarters. Through such dialogues, we endeavor to grasp global social issues promptly, extensively, and deeply, incorporating them into the issues our management deals with. At the same time, this dialogue lets us safeguard our corporate responsibility in a global society and make continued efforts to improve as we strive to achieve sustainable management and a sustainable society.\n\nAs a company that maintains committees, including a Nominating Committee, Hitachi has an Audit Committee that conducts business auditing. The committee is made up of directors selected as Audit Committee members. Yearly reports concerning important matters related to sustainability are made by executive officers in charge, and feedback from the Audit Committee is put to advantageous use in the work of promoting sustainability.\n\nFiscal 2020 Executive Sustainability Committee Agenda Items\n\n| Term       | Agenda Items                                                                 |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| April 2020 | \u2022 Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050                                    |\n|            | - Achieve Carbon Neutrality by 2030 at business sites (factories and offices) |\n|            | - Cooperation with suppliers to promote CO2 reduction in the upstream value chain |\n| November 2020 | \u2022 Reporting and structural enhancements related to the status of plans for achieving Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030 |\n|            | \u2022 Approaches regarding goals for 2030 at the stage of product and service utilization |\nThe Sustainability Strategy Promotion Structure\n\n**Executive Sustainability Committee**\n\n- **Chair**: Executive Chairman & CEO\n- **Members**: Senior Executive Committee members, CEOs of BUs, and corporate division heads\n- **Key roles**: Discuss and implement specific measures for sustainability strategy (including environment, human rights, and diversity and inclusion)\n- **Frequency**: Twice per FY (more than twice per FY from FY2021 on)\n\n**Sustainability Promotion Meetings**\n- **Members**: Business promotion division heads at BUs and key Group companies\n- **Key roles**: Discuss and implement specific measures for sustainability strategy\n- **Frequency**: Twice per FY\n\n**Eco-Management Meetings**\n- **Members**: Environmental promotion division heads at BUs and key Group companies\n- **Key roles**: Discuss and implement concrete measures to achieve long-term environmental targets in sustainability strategy\n- **Frequency**: Twice per FY\n\n**CSR Manager Meetings**\n- **Members**: CSR and social contribution officers from BUs and key Group companies\n- **Key roles**: Discuss and implement CSR initiatives\n- **Frequency**: Once or twice per FY\n\n**HRDD Manager Meetings**\n- **Members**: HRDD officers from BUs and key Group companies\n- **Key roles**: Provide information and knowledge necessary for HRDD implementation, and share status of implementation in BUs and key Group companies\n- **Frequency**: Once or twice per FY\n\n**Diversity Development Council**\n- **Members**: Diversity development officers from BUs and key Group companies\n- **Key roles**: Expand diversity and inclusion development policies and initiatives, and share best practices\n- **Frequency**: Once or twice per FY\n\n**Secretariat**\n- **Sustainability Promotion Division**\n- **CSR and environmental officers from each regional headquarters**\n- **Regional promotion managers and officers**\n\n**Hitachi Sustainability Report 2021**\nBolstering the Environmental Business Promotion Structure\n\nIn April 2021, Hitachi appointed Executive Vice President Alistair Dormer to Chief Environmental Officer, and established the Environment Business Growth Strategy Division. These steps will enable us to accelerate the pace of environmental value creation achieved through business.\n\nIdentifying Priority Initiatives as Strategic Focus Areas\n\nLooking forward to 2030 and what we aim for society and our company to become by then, Hitachi is focusing efforts on value creation in areas we consider to be of key importance. In working to realize Hitachi\u2019s goals of improving people\u2019s QoL and increasing our customers\u2019 corporate value, we have mapped out focus initiatives taking into account the degree of impact for Hitachi and the degree of interest and importance for all our stakeholders in order to make society and Hitachi\u2019s management sustainable. We have identified particularly high-priority initiatives among these as Strategic Focus Areas.\nHitachi Sustainability Report 2021\n\nManagement\n\nCEO\u2019s Message\nMessage from the Chief Environmental Officer\nEnvironmental Strategy for Achieving a Decarbonized Society\nCorporate Credo\nSustainability Management\nEngagement and Initiatives\nExternal Assessments and Awards\n\nHitachi\u2019s mission in the Social Innovation Business is to achieve a sustainable society by taking on the challenges of climate change, a circular economy and the efficient use of resources. In response to climate change, which is a particularly urgent issue, we will expand solutions for targeting decarbonization.\n\nWe have set the targets of achieving carbon neutrality within Hitachi by fiscal 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality through the value chain by fiscal 2050. As a leading company in the creation of environmental value, we will further accelerate our initiatives aimed at realizing these goals.\n\nIn a society characterized by rapid digitalization, urbanization and a growing senior population, it is important that we enable people to enjoy comfortable, energetic lifestyles, within a safe and secure living environment. To do this, Hitachi provides city building solutions that support safe and secure living for people everywhere, as well as optimum healthcare for individuals.\n\nIn the healthcare field, we support a society in which more and more people are living past the age of 100 through the development and provision of solutions that extend from prevention of illnesses in the pre-symptomatic phase to testing, diagnostics, treatment and support for long-term care.\n\nHitachi Integrated Report 2021(P52-69)\nHitachi Integrated Report 2021(P61, 64)\n## Management\n\n### CEO\u2019s Message\n\nHitachi\u2019s Social Innovation Business adds to the vitality of society and people\u2019s lives.

We have significantly contributed to achieving the SDGs through our Social Innovation Business which also serves as a source of sustainable growth for us.\n\nAccordingly, through the provision of innovative solutions and products in our Social Innovation Business, we will strive to create social, environmental, and economic value as part of our management strategy. We will also endeavor to reduce negative social and environmental impacts resulting from our business and seek a deeper understanding of business risks arising from social and environmental changes to ensure greater resilience against negative impacts.\n\nHitachi\u2019s Priority SDG Issues\n\nAt the Executive Sustainability Committee chaired by Executive Chairman & CEO Toshiaki Higashihara, the committee members considered the 17 SDGs and the opportunities and risks they presented. After this, they identified five goals where we can make a particularly significant impact through our key businesses and six goals that we can contribute to through our entire corporate activities. We view the latter six goals as relevant to our entire business and management strategies and that make an impact on corporate sustainability.\n\nBecause we are active in a broad range of business fields, we believe we can contribute extensively to the achievement of SDGs in addition to the 11 goals identified. Understanding that all SDGs are mutually related, we will endeavor to contribute to the achievement of all 17 SDGs both directly and indirectly.\n\nBy proactively responding to social issues, Hitachi contributes to the achievement of all SDGs through its responsible corporate conduct and its Social Innovation Business.\nRoad Map to Achieve Hitachi\u2019s Priority SDG Issues\n\n**Goals**\n\nDeveloping a sustainable society as defined by the SDGs will also lead to sustainable growth for Hitachi. We believe that we are providing value not only to the companies and consumers that are our direct customers but also to society more broadly. This is the essence of our Social Innovation Business. The products and services that we provide are all closely linked to social sustainability. We aim to be a global leader in sustainability through our efforts to help achieve the SDGs.\n\n**Activities**\n\n- Increase understanding through sustainability messages from the CEO, symposiums, workshops, newsletters, etc.\n- Work with planning divisions and other relevant departments at business units and key Group companies to clarify how their businesses are linked to the SDGs in terms of business opportunities and risks.\n\n**Phase 1, 2**\n\nUnderstand sustainability and the SDGs, clarify how key businesses are linked to the SDGs\n\n**FY 2017**\n\n- Incorporate the vision of Hitachi\u2019s future business and growth originating from achieving the SDGs and sustainability (solving social issues) in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan business strategy, based on the knowledge that realizing a sustainable society will make sustainable growth possible for Hitachi.\n\n**Phase 3**\n\nIncorporate sustainability perspectives in our management strategy\n\n**FY 2018**\n\n- Promote management focusing on social, environmental, and economic value.\n- Explore building a framework for assessing the impact of non-financial value created by the five focus sectors set out in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan.\n\n**Phase 3**\n\nExplore new possibilities based on the motives of solving social issues\n\n**FY 2019**\n\n- Expand application to consideration of new businesses and impact evaluation for existing businesses.\n- Promote establishment of a collaborative system with sales divisions to enhance sustainability.\n\n**Phase 4**\n\nSeek to create businesses based on the motives of solving social issues\n\n**FY 2020**\n\n- The measures will be taken in collaboration with business units, major Group companies, corporate-related departments, and global sites (regional strategies).\n\nSpecifying the Social Impacts of the Goals of the SDGs Will Contribute to Hitachi\u2019s Business Strategy\n\nSince fiscal 2019, Hitachi has urged business units and Group companies to promote visualization of social and environmental impacts in order to create the social, environmental, and economic value called for in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan.\n\nSpecifically, after selecting their key businesses, each business unit and Group company chose the relevant items from the list of social and environmental impacts and sorted them by positive and negative impacts. They then identified the stakeholders involved in each impact and summarized them in a logic model.\n\nThis helped not only to visualize what kind of impacts Hitachi and its customers have on society but also enabled them to maximize positive impacts while minimizing negative ones.\nEngagement and Initiatives\n\nStakeholder Engagement  GRI 102-40/102-43\n\nApproaches to Engagement\n\nIn our commitment to promoting our Social Innovation Business, we endeavor to accurately identify the various social issues facing each country and region, and to work toward resolution of these issues through engagement in collaborative creation with a wide range of stakeholders, including customers, governments and municipalities, as well as academic and research institutions. In addition, with the goal of enhancing the value of our human capital, we work to promote activities with an emphasis on maintaining direct dialogues between the management and employees as an essential management resource in the promotion of business. Furthermore, with the recent rise in ESG investment, we actively engage in dialogues with shareholders and investors as well.\n\n| Stakeholders | Main Roles | Main Divisions | Means of Communication (Results in FY 2020) | Pages |\n|--------------|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Customers    | Creation of better products and services, response to complaints, appropriate disclosure of information on products and services | Quality Assurance/Sales | Customer satisfaction activities | Quality and Product Safety Management P137-138 |\n| Shareholders and Investors | Timely and proper information disclosure, obtaining fair recognition and support from capital markets, reflection of shareholder and investor viewpoints in corporate management | Public Relations and IR | Financial results briefings (quarterly) | Information Management P181-182 |\n| Suppliers    | Building fair and sound business relations, smooth information sharing toward better partnerships | Procurement | Procurement activities | Customer Satisfaction P139-140 |\n| Employees    | Proper treatment, promotion of occupational health and safety of human capital | Public Relations/ Human Capital | Intranet, in-house newsletters | Stakeholder Engagement P019-020 |\n| National and Local Governments, Industrial Associations | Compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, policy recommendations, participation in industry-government-academia collaborative projects | Government and External Relations | Academic research for policy recommendations to international organizations and national governments, lobbying activities | Responsible Procurement P132-136 |\n\nHitachi Sustainability Report 2021\nPromoting Engagement\n\nThe outcomes of communication with stakeholders are shared with the respective divisions and actively utilized as valuable insights into our business. Public interest is growing in how corporations are taking in stakeholders' voices to improve their businesses, and we will continue to globally develop and promote ways of capitalizing on the opinions of the members of society with whom we engage with in our business activities.\n\nStakeholder Dialogues\n\nHitachi organizes stakeholder dialogues in countries and regions around the world to invite opinions on social challenges from stakeholders representing specialized knowledge platforms, and it ensures that their insights are reflected in the business activities conducted at each of Hitachi's global businesses and business units.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn March 2021, Hitachi Europe held a two-day online dialogue on the theme of Hitachi's approach toward a zero-carbon society with stakeholders. The event was attended by 29 participants including company management executives, managers involved with sustainability, policy makers, investors and NGOs.\n\nOver the course of the two-day event, the participants engaged in wide-ranging and lively discussions covering everything from sharing issues for the promotion of carbon neutrality with one another from their various perspectives to their expectations of companies from the viewpoint of policy and what information companies are expected to disclose. In addition to this, Alistair Dormer, Hitachi, Ltd.'s executive vice president, expounded on Hitachi's environmental strategy and received a great deal of feedback from the participants.\n\nLooking forward, we will continue to promote active dialogues with stakeholders and work to improve social and environmental value by putting what we learn through this process to advantageous use in the management of the company.\nMain Initiatives and Groups Hitachi Is Involved with\n\nBased on its corporate credo of \"contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products,\" Hitachi has advanced its Social Innovation Business in order to help realize a sustainable society.

In order to contribute to the resolution of social issues on a global scale, Hitachi actively engages in activities with international standardization organizations, including IEC*\u00b9, ISO*\u00b2, and ITU-T*\u00b3.\n\nIn the environmental domain, we are engaged in efforts concerning the circular economy (ISO/TC 323) and the environmental standardization for electrical and electronic products and systems (IEC/TC 111), and, with regard to social issues, Society 5.0 (ISO/WA 39), smart community infrastructures (ISO/TC 268/SC*\u2074 1), and unmanned aircraft systems (ISO/TC 20/SC 16). Additionally, by contributing to international standardization efforts by various consortia and other bodies, and providing solutions consistent with international standards, we support the development of sound global markets and facilitate innovation to resolve social issues. In order to fulfill our duties as a global company, Hitachi actively participates in associations involved with standardization activities in various industries and regions.\n\n*\u00b9 IEC: International Electrotechnical Commission.

The Steering Committee*\u00b9 for the Committee includes chief technology officers of Hitachi business units and key Group companies. The committee is responsible for decisions on cross-departmental and companywide standardization projects.\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nOne of the principal themes selected was Society 5.0, an initiative spearheaded by the Japanese government aimed at the realization of a human-centered, sustainable society. In order to create venues in which discussions can be conducted to attain consensus among various countries and major standardization organizations looking toward realization of Society 5.0, Hitachi has actively engaged in activities related to ISO/IWA 39 (gap analysis for standardization of sustainable and human-centered societies enabled with cyber-physical systems).\nMain Groups in Which Hitachi Participates\n\nAs part of developing Hitachi\u2019s Social Innovation Business on a global scale, we view government institutions and related organizations in Japan and other countries around the world as important partners both as customers and supporters.

By making requests directly as well as proposing solutions through discussions in economic organizations and industrial bodies, we help build a better society.\n\n| Council/Group | Participant | Activities |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|\n| Panel discussion regarding Infrastructure System International Expansion Strategy 2025 (Cabinet Secretariat) | Executive Chairman & CEO Toshiaki Higashihara attended as a private sector member | Proposals regarding appropriate concrete measures to be taken based on the Japanese government\u2019s Infrastructure System International Expansion Strategy 2025 |\n| Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) | Executive Chairman & CEO Toshiaki Higashihara attended as the vice chair | Establishing sustainable capitalism that achieves SDGs through policy recommendations for realizing Society 5.0 for SDGs. |\n| Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) | Executive Chairman & CEO Toshiaki Higashihara attended as the vice chair | Examining and making proposals on the promotion of digital technology, data use, and market creation under the mission to achieve Society 5.0.

To help build a decarbonized society, we aim to achieve carbon neutrality at our business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030 and throughout our value chain by fiscal 2050.\n\n**Environmental Governance**\n\n- Enhancing environmental governance\n- Enhancing environmental management system\n- Reducing environmental burden through \u201cEco-Factories & Offices Select\u201d certification\n- Implementing environmental education for employees\n- Ensuring environmental compliance\n\n**Achievements in Fiscal 2020**\n\n- Registered data from about 1,000 business sites in 63 countries in the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) to estimate environmental load.\n- A total score of 223 GPs in the GREEN 21 evaluation of our Environmental Action Plan.\n- Under \u201cEco-Factories & Offices Select,\u201d of our approximately 1,000 facilities, recorded 13 new certifications, and 57 renewed certifications (total certified facilities: 70).\n- Rolled out Introduction to Sustainability e-learning materials for general education globally.\n- Implementation rate of voluntary environmental audits of business sites outside Japan by business units and Group companies (number of sites audited/number of sites): 34%.\n\n**Policy and promotion structure**\n\nImportant items related to environmental initiatives are deliberated by the Executive Sustainability Committee which is chaired by the executive chairman and CEO of Hitachi, Ltd. and attended by top Hitachi executives, and environmental activities are implemented.\n\n**How we are doing it**\n\n- Achieve carbon neutrality throughout our value chain by fiscal 2050 and reduce CO2 emissions 50% by fiscal 2030 (compared to fiscal 2010)\n- Achieve carbon neutrality at business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030\n\n**Reduction of CO2 emissions**\n\n- Reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit of products and services: 20%\n- Reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit at business sites (factories and offices): 1.4%\nReducing CO2 emissions and achieving carbon neutrality at business sites (factories and offices)\n\nIntroducing the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) framework\n\nIntroducing renewable energy\n\nPromotion of the HICP framework\n\nImplemented investment in energy-saving equipment in 22 cases totaling \u00a5250 million through HICP\n\nIntroduce Renewable Energy\n\nTripled the previous fiscal year\u2019s use of electricity from renewable sources\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nBuilding a water efficient society\n\nResponding to water risks\n\nBuilding a society that uses resources efficiently\n\nTransitioning to a circular economy\n\nWhat\n\nWhat we are doing\n\nHow\n\nHow we are doing it\n\nLong-term environmental targets\n\n- Build a society that uses water and other resources efficiently with customers and society\n- 50% improvement of efficiency in use of water/resources by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010 in the Hitachi Group)\n\nReduction of water use per unit\n\nReduction rate in water use per unit: 24%\n\nRespond to water risks\n\nRevised our Water Risk Guidelines\n\nPromoted measures based on water risk survey results\n\nBuild a society that uses resources efficiently\n\nPromoted recycling activities for each product\n\nReduction of waste and valuables generation per unit\n\nReduction rate in waste and valuables generation per unit: 14%\n\nMinimize impact on natural capital\n\nWhat\n\nWhat we are doing\n\nHow\n\nHow we are doing it\n\nLong-term environmental targets\n\nMinimize impact on natural capital\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nReduce the rate of chemical atmospheric emissions per unit\n\nReduction rate in chemical atmospheric emissions per unit: 33%\n\nManage chemical substances in our products\n\nRevised list of Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances in accordance with Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)\n\nCalculation of positive and negative impact on natural capital\n\nBuilt calculation methods for positive impacts (e.g., benefits of forest conservation activities) and negative impacts into the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) and started to collect data\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\n\nThe Environmental Vision and Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050\n\nHitachi\u2019s Mid-term Management Plan places an emphasis on environmental value clearly indicating the company\u2019s commitment to delivering strong environmental performance. In response to the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in 2016 we established a set of long-term environmental targets under the banner of Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 and have been working toward achieving them. The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C published in 2018 states that greater efforts will be required in order to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. In response, regions and countries around the world, including the European Union and Japan, have been stepping up their commitments. At Hitachi, we had set a long-term environmental target of reducing CO2 emissions by 80% throughout the value chain by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010). However, in consideration of recent trends both internal and external, and in recognition of the corporate social responsibility Hitachi is expected to fulfill, we have now revised our target of achieving carbon neutrality by FY 2050 through the value chain.\n\nHitachi\u2019s environmental initiatives, including the achievement of these long-term environmental targets, are mandated by the short-term Environmental Action Plan which is updated every three years and pursued Group-wide. Implementation of the Environmental Action Plan for 2021, covering fiscal 2019\u20132021 and formulated in line with the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, is currently underway, and we are steadily accumulating achievements as we work to meet the detailed KPIs that the plan includes.\n\nEnvironmental Vision\n\nHitachi will resolve environmental issues and achieve both a higher quality of life and a sustainable society through its Social Innovation Business in collaborative creation with its stakeholders.\n\nThe aim of Hitachi\u2019s environmental management\n\nEnvironmental Vision\n\nDecarbonized Society\nClimate Change Mitigation/Adaptation\n\nResource Efficient Society\nSaving and Recycling Resources\n\nHarmonized Society with Nature\nPreservation of Ecosystems\n\nLong-term Environmental Targets\n\nHitachi\u2019s resolution looking toward 2050 and 2030\n\nHitachi Environmental Innovation 2050\n\nFor a decarbonized society\nAchieve carbon neutrality by FY 2050 through the value chain\nReduce CO2 emissions 50% by FY 2030 (compared to FY 2010)\nAchieve carbon neutrality by FY 2030 at business sites (factories and offices)\n\nFor a resource efficient society\nBuild a society that uses water and other resources efficiently with customers and society\nEfficiency in use of water/resources\nFY 2050 50% improvement (compared to FY 2010)\n\nFor a harmonized society with nature\nImpact on natural capital\nMinimized\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan\n\nSet environmental action items and targets every 3 years in order to achieve the long-term targets\nProgress in Reaching Long-Term Environmental Targets\n\nWe are making progress on major targets, as shown in the table below, and we are generally on track. We will continue increasing our efforts to achieve these long-term targets. Regarding the achievement of our long-term value chain target to help build a decarbonized society, we are developing activities which help to reduce CO2 emissions by providing products with top-tier environmental performance.\n\n### Efforts to Achieve a Decarbonized Society\n\n| Goals | Activities |\n|-------|------------|\n| Reduced CO2 Emissions at Business Sites (Factories and Offices) | |\n| FY 2020 result | FY 2021 target | FY 2030 target | FY 2050 target |\n| Reduction rate of total CO2 emissions (base: FY 2010, Hitachi Group) | 39% | 20% or higher | 100% (carbon neutral) | (Maintain 100%) |\n\n### Efforts to Achieve a Resource Efficient Society\n\n| Goals | Activities |\n|-------|------------|\n| Enhanced Efficiency in the Use of Water at Business Sites (Factories and Offices) | |\n| FY 2020 result | FY 2021 target | FY 2030 target | FY 2050 target |\n| Reduction rate in water use per unit (base: FY 2010, Hitachi Group) | 24% | 26% or higher | \u2014 | 50% |\n\n| Goals | Activities |\n|-------|------------|\n| Enhanced Efficiency in the Use of Waste and Valuable Generation at Business Sites (Factories and Offices) | |\n| FY 2020 result | FY 2021 target | FY 2030 target | FY 2050 target |\n| Reduction rate in Waste and Valuable Generation use per unit (base: FY 2010, Hitachi Group) | 14% | 12% or higher | \u2014 | 50% |\n\nNote: See the referenced pages for details on the figures cited.\nEnvironmental Action Plan\n\nTo achieve its Environmental Vision and the Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 long-term environmental targets, Hitachi draws up an Environmental Action Plan containing indicators and targets for the three-year period covered by the Mid-term Management Plan and promotes its steady implementation.\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 (Fiscal 2019\u20132021)\n\nHitachi is promoting environmental activities under the 2021 Environmental Action Plan (fiscal 2019\u20132021) that are based on the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan. The targets set for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 as well as the actual results for fiscal 2020 are as follows. GREEN 21 is used as a tool for evaluating and managing our achievements made over three-year periods toward the targets set.\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan Achievement Evaluation System: GREEN 21\n\n*1 This is a target for Japan only. Targets in other countries are set on a voluntary basis.\n\nEnvironmental Data\n\nHitachi Sustainability Report 2021\nGREEN 21 is used as a system for evaluating and managing our achievements made over three-year periods toward the targets set in our Environmental Action Plan.\n\nGREEN 21 converts the level of achievement toward the Environmental Action Plan targets at each of the approximately 160 major sites classified as category A into green points (GPs) and then makes an evaluation on a category-by-category basis. A perfect score for any category is 100 GPs. Points are awarded for meeting the Environmental Action Plan\u2019s annual targets and as an added incentive for particularly ambitious activities. Representing progress in terms of GPs shows how much each site has achieved in each category and also enables sites to be compared with each other. The results are also used in the Environmental Action Plan\u2019s PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycles.\n\nThe Sustainability Promotion Division also uses the results of the GREEN 21 evaluation as a condition for awarding its Eco-Factories & Offices Select certification for business sites that promote activities demonstrating a high level of environmental consciousness and produce notable results in that area.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\nThe overall evaluation, which is the sum of the evaluation scores for each category, was 223 GPs which is lower than the reference score of 240 GPs in fiscal 2020. Due to the impact of the COVID-19, business trips outside of Japan were restricted and there was a decrease in production. The scores for enhancing global environmental management and reducing CO\u2082 emissions per unit of business site came in below the targets.\nEnvironmental Governance\n\nFramework for Promoting Environmental Governance\n\nTo achieve our Environmental Vision and reach our long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050, Hitachi, Ltd., is enhancing environmental governance by building a global structure to support environmental decision making and implementation at Hitachi, Ltd. and consolidated subsidiaries (a total of 872 companies as of March 31, 2021).\n\nImportant items related to environmental initiatives in the Hitachi Group are deliberated by the Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the executive chairman and CEO of Hitachi, Ltd., and attended by top Hitachi executives. Members meet twice a year to discuss environment-related policies and measures, including those in response to climate change, water and other resources, and to share progress reports and achievements and set the course for further improvements and new initiatives.\n\nIn April 2021, Hitachi, Ltd. introduced evaluations that take environmental value into account in the executive compensation system with a view to accelerating the creation of environmental value. The targeted environmental value is based on dialogue between the president and each executive officer.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. has adopted a committee system to separate the responsibilities for management oversight from the execution of business operations. Under this system, the Audit Committee of independent directors conducts an audit of sustainability-related operations once a year. Reports on climate change and other environment-related material issues are made to the committee by executive officers of Hitachi, Ltd.\n\nTo develop ways to achieve our long-term environmental targets and reduce environmental compliance risks, the three-year Hitachi Group Environmental Action Plan is formulated in line with the Mid-term Management Plan by environmental promotion division heads from business units of Hitachi, Ltd., and major Group companies participating in Eco-Management Meetings. Targets (and measures to achieve them) in the Environmental Action Plan that affect not only our environmental strategy but also our business strategy\u2014like those to reduce the CO2 emissions of our products and services\u2014are determined jointly by the Eco-Management Meetings and Sustainability Promotion Meetings, attended by business promotion division heads. A progress report concerning important targets in the Environmental Action Plan is made to the Executive Sustainability Committee, and instructions from committee members are reflected in actual environmental activities.\n\nGroup-wide efforts to advance environmental activities are undertaken outside Japan as well. Environmental officers are assigned to China, the rest of Asia, the Americas, and Europe to share information on the state of progress of our environmental activities and on the latest environmental regulations in each country and region. Respective Regional Environmental Meetings are also held once or twice a year.\n\nAchievements in and after Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Executive Sustainability Committee was held in April and November. The discussions included: a report on the status of plans to promote Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030, a measure to accelerate the long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050, and ways to enhance its framework; visualization of environmental value; and the approach to the 2030 objective of the phase of the use of products and services. In June 2021, it was decided to revise one of the long-term environmental targets of Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050, aiming for a decarbonized society, to achieve carbon neutrality by fiscal 2050 through the value chain.\nSustainability Promotion Meetings\n\n- **Members:** Business promotion division heads at BUs and key Group companies\n- **Key roles:** Discuss and implement specific measures for sustainability strategy (including environment, human rights, and diversity and inclusion)\n- **Frequency:** Twice per FY (more than twice per FY from FY2021 on)\n\nEco-Management Meetings\n\n- **Members:** Environmental promotion division heads at BUs and key Group companies\n- **Key roles:** Discuss and implement concrete measures to achieve long-term environmental targets in sustainability strategy\n- **Frequency:** Twice per FY\n\nExecutive Sustainability Committee\n\n- **Chair:** Executive Chairman & CEO\n- **Members:** Senior Executive Committee members, CEOs of BUs, and corporate division heads\n- **Key roles:** Discuss and implement specific measures for sustainability strategy (including environment, human rights, and diversity and inclusion)\n- **Frequency:** Twice per FY (more than twice per FY from FY2021 on)\n\nSecretariat\n\n- **Sustainability Promotion Division**\n- **CSR and environmental officers from each regional headquarters**\nEnvironmental Management System\n\nEnhancing Our Environmental Management System\n\nHitachi has globally applicable criteria for environmental management classification to conduct environmental management properly and efficiently in accordance with the environmental load and compliance risk levels of Group business sites, both large and small. We assign a score for each classification item, such as the amount of power consumed, the volume of waste generated, and whether or not legal restrictions apply. All Group business sites are classified into one of three categories: A, B, and C, and environmental management is then conducted based on the respective level of risk. Of our approximately 1,000 business sites, about 160 major sites are classified as category A. These sites account for more than 90% of the Group\u2019s total environmental load.\n\nThe business units and Group companies that manages A sites participate as members of Eco-Management Meetings to draw up the Environmental Action Plan, which is then disseminated throughout the entire Hitachi Group by environmental strategy officers, chosen from among the heads and general managers of those organizations. These business units and Group companies also formulate their own environmental action plans based on Hitachi Group\u2019s Environmental Action Plan and strive to achieve their targets.\n\nIn addition to adhering to the in-house environmental management system, all our global category A manufacturing sites have acquired third-party certification, such as ISO 14001.\n\nCategories by Criteria for Classification of Environmental Management\n\n| Category | Setting targets based on the Environmental Action Plan and reporting environmental load data to Hitachi, Ltd. headquarters | Reporting environmental load data to environmental strategy officers within their own group | Reporting violations of environmental laws and regulations to Hitachi, Ltd. headquarters and responding to the management classification survey |\n|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Category A | \u25cb                                                                                                               | \u25cb                                                                              | \u25cb                                                                              |\n| Category B | \u2013                                                                                                               | \u25cb                                                                              | \u25cb                                                                              |\n| Category C | \u2013                                                                                                               | \u2013                                                                              | \u2013                                                                              |\n\nCollecting and Monitoring Environmental Load Data to Improve Environmental Practices\n\nTo conduct environmental management efficiently and effectively, Hitachi collects environmental load data using the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS). The system, which is in Japanese, English, and Chinese, monitors and registers items in about 20 categories, ranging from environmental load data on items such as energy use, water use, and waste generation, to whether an item falls under relevant environmental laws and regulations, and environmental accounting. We have also set up an international help desk to support the system\u2019s operation and promote understanding of environmental management.\n\nThe collected data is aggregated and analyzed to implement a PDCA cycle for environmental measures, such as environmental management classification into the categories A, B, and C; identifying environmental management issues; and sharing instructive examples within the Group. GREEN 21 uses the data registered in the system to calculate green points (GPs) for evaluating the level of target achievements. Approximately 160 major sites classified as category A aggregate and analyze data biannually on such key items as energy, water, and waste materials.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, data from about 1,000 business sites in 63 countries, including factories, research laboratories, and offices, was registered in the system to estimate the environmental load of the entire Hitachi Group.\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nApproximately 1.33 million parts and products with chemical substances are registered in A Gree\u2019Net as of March 31, 2021. This is around 10,000 less than the previous fiscal year due to a decrease in the number of Hitachi Group companies as a result of changes in our business portfolios.\n\nWe held 14 briefings via online meeting on regulatory revision trends and chemSHERPA tools, and gave instructions on how to use A Gree\u2019Net to suppliers using the system at Omika Works, Hitachi IE Systems, the Naka area of Hitachi High-Tech, and the Kasado area of Hitachi High-Tech, and Hitachi High-Tech Science between October 2020 and March 2021. The briefings were attended by 916 people and helped to deepen understanding of regulatory revision trends, these tools, and this system.\n\nChemical Substance Management System\n\nTo collect and manage data on chemical substances in materials, parts, and products from our suppliers, Hitachi operates A Gree\u2019Net, a green procurement system compatible with the chemSHERPA*\u00b9 format, to grasp what chemical substances are used in our products\u2014from design and development, procurement, and production to quality assurance and shipping\u2014and to respond to legal and regulatory frameworks at shipping destinations.\n\nTo properly manage chemical substances used in our business operations, we have introduced a database for chemical substance management called CEGNET, which keeps track of the latest laws and regulations and our own voluntary regulations and supports searches for new substance risks. The system also collects and aggregates data on the amount of chemical substances handled, emitted, and transferred in our operations, helping to reduce the volume of chemicals that we handle and emit to the environment.\n\n*\u00b9 chemSHERPA: A shared transmission scheme throughout the supply chain to ensure proper management of chemical substances in products and continuing compliance with the ever-growing requirements of major global laws and regulations like the REACH regulation (EU regulation of Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) and RoHS directive (EU rules restricting the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment).\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\n\nEnvironmental Governance\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nEnvironmental Data\n\nReducing the Environmental Burden Through \u201cEco-Factories & Offices Select\u201d Certification\n\nHitachi has implemented an \u201cEco-Factories & Offices Select\u201d certification program for business sites that promote activities demonstrating a high level of environmental consciousness and produce notable results in that area. This helps raise the environmental awareness of employees and promotes environmentally conscious activities at our business sites.\n\nBased on certification criteria that were developed for our manufacturing (factory) and nonmanufacturing (office) divisions globally, we certify factories that actively engage in improvements to achieve efficient production and offices that have been environmentally designed. Superior policies from certified factories and offices are shared with the entire Group, with other locations encouraged to implement them as well. To maintain and raise the level of environmental awareness through Eco-Factories & Offices Select, certified factories and offices are re-evaluated every fiscal year, and only those that meet the evaluation requirements have their certification renewed.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\nIn fiscal 2020, of our approximately 1,000 facilities, 13 were newly certified, and 57 had their certifications renewed. The total number of certified factories and offices was 70.\n\nEnvironmental Education for Employees\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nHitachi believes that promoting greater environmental awareness and understanding among employees is essential to efforts to energize its environmental activities. Toward that end, we offer general education using e-learning for all Group employees, from new hires to executive officers. We also provide once a year specialized Hitachi Group training on environmental risks and compliance with environment-related laws and regulations for working-level employees in charge of environmental management and internal environmental auditors. Particularly in China, where we have more than 20 category A sites, we provide training on compliance with the country\u2019s increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\nIn fiscal 2020, we created the new e-learning document Introduction to Sustainability for general education with a view to sustainability in line with the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan. It was rolled out globally in July 2020. Hitachi Group training on recent amendments to laws and operational procedures was held in Japan and China in November and September. An environmental management training program to reduce environmental risks and raise the knowledge of working-level employees was held in Shanghai, China, in September.\n\nEnvironmental Education\n\n| Target | Introductory | Beginning | Intermediate | Advanced |\n|--------|--------------|-----------|--------------|----------|\n| All employees | Introductory training for new employees | Online e-learning: Eco-Mind education (General topics: Global environmental issues, environmental law, etc.) | Online e-learning: Eco-Mind education (Hitachi Group topics: Environmental policy, Environmental Action Plan, etc.) | |\n| Working level employees | Basic environmental management courses for working-level employees (Management of waste, air/water quality, and hazardous materials; development and operation of management systems, etc.) | Education for Eco-Factories | Eco-Product development training | ISO 14001 auditor certification training |\n| Middle management | | | Risk communicator training | ISO 14001 auditor certification training |\n| Senior management | | | | |\n\nHitachi Sustainability Report 2021\nEnvironmental Compliance\n\nActivities\n\nIn order to better ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and region and minimize environmental risks, Hitachi sets and monitors compliance with voluntary management criteria that are more stringent than regulatory requirements. If we find a violation or receive a complaint, we take steps to enhance environmental risk management by sharing the causes and countermeasures throughout the Group and to prevent occurrences of similar incidents. As part of our measures to address the pollution of soil and groundwater, we are examining the soil and water for any contamination at business sites where hazardous chemical substances are being or were once used. If contamination is found, we will conduct cleaning and monitoring activities until decontamination is complete.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we continued designating 15 business sites that committed environmental violations in the past three years as high-risk business sites. The relevant business units and Group companies began providing guidance to these sites to strengthen their compliance activities. Through enhanced guidance to these high-risk business sites, compliance management has improved outside Japan. However, our business activities were strongly affected by COVID-19, and the number of relevant legal and regulatory violations increased compared to the previous year due to delays in notifications, contract renewals, and poor maintenance.\n\nImplementation Status of Internal Environmental Audits\n\n| Implementing division | Target | Frequency |\n|-----------------------|--------|-----------|\n| Corporate division of Hitachi, Ltd.

We have accelerated the pace by setting the target of achieving carbon neutrality at our business sites (factories and offices), which covers the production stage of the value chain, by fiscal 2030.\n\nThe majority of our value-chain emissions result from the use of our products and services after they are sold, so reducing these emissions will be crucial to reducing CO\u2082 emissions throughout the value chain.\n\nCO\u2082 emissions from the use of sold products and services are greatly influenced by changes in product sales and business portfolios. We have established an indicator for providing products and services that produce less CO\u2082 emissions per unit to reduce gross CO\u2082 emissions. Specifically, by fiscal 2030, we aim to reduce CO\u2082 emissions per unit by 50% for products and services at the usage stage and expanding our new decarbonization business using digital technologies such as OT and IT.\n\nRatio of CO\u2082 Emissions at Each Stage of Hitachi Value Chain in Fiscal 2020\n\n- Procurement of Raw Materials and Parts: 9.1%\n- Production: 4.6%\n- Transport: 0.1%\n- Use: 0.7%\n- Waste Disposal/Recycling: 2.3%\n- Others (Capital goods, etc.): 83.2%\n\n*Percentages may fluctuate due to changes in our business portfolios.\nEfforts to Reduce CO\u2082 Emissions During the Use of Products and Services\n\nApproach\n\nTo reduce CO\u2082 emissions from the use of our products and services, which make up the largest proportion of emissions in our value chain, we have established target reduction rates of CO\u2082 emissions per unit from products and services while in use. These rates are based on fiscal 2010. Given the unique qualities of the wide range of businesses we engage in, for each product or service subject to this initiative, we calculate the reduction rate of CO\u2082 emissions per unit with CO\u2082 emissions as the numerator and function size*1 as the denominator, and work toward total elimination of CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nWe also have high expectations for specific long-term CO\u2082 reduction countermeasures such as sales of renewable energy systems with zero emissions while in use and the use of technological innovation to replace existing products or services with new versions that provide the same value but emit less CO\u2082 while in use.\n\nThe Guidelines on Calculating CO\u2082 Emission Reductions for Hitachi Group Products and Services*2 specify the following three methods for calculating different types of CO\u2082 emission reductions. Figures considered reductions for products and services while in use under the GHG Protocol, a standard for calculation and reporting of GHG emission, are calculated using method (1). Methods (2) and (3) are for avoided emissions.\n\n(1) Energy-saving feature enhancements\nSet a reduction rate of CO\u2082 emissions per unit (compared to fiscal 2010) based on efficiency enhancements such as energy-saving feature enhancement in products and services. Every year, calculate reductions in CO\u2082 emissions considering the production volume of the relevant year.\n\n(2) Reduction through new systems and solutions based on technological innovation\nCalculate avoided emissions as reductions in CO\u2082 emissions due to the dissemination of new systems and solutions that emit less CO\u2082 while providing equivalent value to existing products, services, and solutions.\n\n(3) Reduction through the deployment of non-fossil energy systems\nCalculate avoided emissions as reductions in CO\u2082 emissions due to the introduction of renewable and other non-fossil energy systems, as compared to existing grid-supplied electricity (using the average emissions factor of the base year, fiscal 2010).\n\n*1 Major functions of products correlated with CO\u2082 emissions, such as their output and volume\n*2 The Guidelines are based on various standards, including the Guidance on Quantifying Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions from the Baseline for Electrical and Electronic Products and Systems (IEC TR62726) issued by the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC), and calculation methods established by governments or industrial associations.\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society Through the Decarbonization Business\n\nExpanding the Decarbonization Business\n\nActivities\n\nTo help achieve a decarbonized society as set out in Hitachi\u2019s Environmental Vision, we are pursuing a decarbonization business that contributes to the reduction of CO2 emissions, leveraging collaborative creation with our partners. This includes a business that provides products and services with enhanced energy-saving features, a business facilitating the introduction of renewable energy, and a business that offers solutions to improve efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions through digitalization, such as by using our Lumada platform. We will expand the decarbonization business by supplying solutions in the six business areas of IT, energy, industry, mobility, smart life, and automotive, thereby helping the world to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\nIn working to achieve a decarbonized society, we will support the electrification of social infrastructure with our OT \u00d7 IT \u00d7 Products approach. In seeking to realize an energy transformation, we will work to expand the transmission/distribution of renewable energy-based electric power using high-voltage direct current (HVDC) technology. Further, as we look to support carbon-free mobility, we will work to provide automobile EV systems and to promote hybridization (with power storage and hydrogen technologies) in the railway business. Also, by working to make energy utilizing digital technologies more visible, we will strive to promote the broader adoption of renewable energy and the efficient use of energy.\n\nExamples of Decarbonization Business: A Hitachi Focus\n\nIT\n- Finance and public-oriented solutions\n  - Promoting digital solutions\n- Data centers\n  - Developing smart data centers\n- Servers/storage\n  - Enhancing energy-saving features of servers and storage\n\nEnergy\n- Power grid solutions\n  - Enhancing efficiency of power transmission/distribution\n- Energy management\n  - Advancing smart energy management to reduce peak electricity demand\n- Power generation\n  - Promoting power generation systems using wind and other non-fossil energy sources\n\nMobility\n- Railways\n  - Enhancing energy-saving features of rolling stock\n  - Developing smart operating systems\n- Elevators\n  - Enhancing energy-saving features of elevators and escalators through replacement\n  - Enhancing energy efficiency through total building solutions\n\nSmart Life\n- Smart cities\n  - Reducing CO2 through comprehensive urban energy management solutions\n- Home appliances\n  - Enhancing energy efficiency of home appliances\n  - Promoting connected home appliances\n- Smart therapies\n  - Enhancing energy-saving features of medical devices\n\nIndustry\n- Smart logistics\n  - Improving energy-saving features through fully IT-enhanced logistics\n- Factory automation\n  - Enhancing energy efficiency through shorter lead times\n- Water business\n  - Enhancing efficiency of water and sewage systems\n- Industrial products\n  - Enhancing efficiency of industrial products\n\nAutomotive business\n- Vehicle electrification\n  - Promoting electrification through electric powertrain systems\n- AD/ADAS (Automatic Driving, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems)\n  - Reducing CO2 by improving operational efficiency through AD/ADAS solutions\nHitachi ABB Power Grids\u2019 Decarbonization Business Initiatives\n\nHitachi ABB Power Grids, which became a member of the Hitachi Group in July 2020, is accelerating the transition toward a carbon-neutral energy future, together with its customers and partners. With pioneering technologies, including high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, it will contribute to the efficient transmission and large-scale integration of renewable energy.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Hitachi ABB Power Grids received an order for HVDC Light*\u00b9 from the Dogger Bank Wind Farm in the United Kingdom, the world\u2019s largest offshore wind farm. This project will enable efficient power transmission and large-scale integration of renewable energy, and will support the United Kingdom\u2019s efforts to expand the use of offshore wind on its journey toward net zero. HVDC Light is also the facilitating technology in the NordLink project which enables the exchange of renewable energy between Norway and Germany. In this project, the world\u2019s longest*\u00b2 HVDC voltage source converter cable and Europe\u2019s longest*\u00b2 HVDC power grid are interconnected. Hitachi ABB Power Grids designed, engineered, and supplied the two converter stations, including control and protection systems at the core of the project, located in Southern Norway and Northern Germany.\n\nAchieving CO\u2082 Emission Reductions During the Use of Products and Services\n\nHitachi set a target for fiscal 2020 of a 20% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions per unit from products and services compared to the base year of fiscal 2010 and achieved a 20% reduction. This was driven by an increase in sales of high energy-saving products, including industrial equipment and equipment used for social infrastructure.\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\n- Reduction in CO\u2082 Emissions per Unit (Hitachi Group)\n\n| Goals | Activities |\n|-------|------------|\n| GRI 305-4/305-5 |\n\nImproving Environmental Performance of Products and Services Through Environmentally Conscious Design Assessments\n\nWe conduct independently developed Environmentally Conscious Design Assessments for all products and services involving a design process to steadily improve environmental performance throughout the Group.

We call this goal \u201cHitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030.\u201d\n\nUnder Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030, we aim to be carbon neutral by effectively reducing CO\u2082 emissions 100% by fiscal 2030 compared to fiscal 2010 instead of the original 50% reduction target.\n\nThe following initiatives will help us achieve the target.\n\n**Major Initiatives for Reducing CO\u2082 Emissions at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)**\n\n| Factories | Offices | Factories and offices |\n|-----------|---------|-----------------------|\n| Improve equipment efficiency by introducing and upgrading to high-efficiency equipment | Build/move to new facilities with high-energy efficiency | Install renewable energy systems |\n| Improve production efficiency and energy use efficiency during the production through the use of the Lumada platform and production technologies cultivated from our long years of experience | Combine and integrate existing facilities | Use electricity from renewable sources |\n| Optimize equipment operations and reduce wasted energy by installing smart meters | Install energy-saving equipment and optimize equipment operations in collaboration with building owners | Adopt the non-fossil fuel energy certificate*1 system |\n| Review product designs and processes | Introduce off-balance-sheet solar power generation for self-consumption | Introduce off-balance-sheet solar power generation for self-consumption |\n| Install energy-saving equipment and optimize equipment operations in collaboration with building owners | Promote investment in carbon-reduction equipment through adoption of the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) framework | Promote investment in carbon-reduction equipment through adoption of the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) framework |\n\n*1 These credits are for electricity that has been certified as having been produced from renewable energy sources. Purchasers of such credits can offset their conventional energy use instead of implementing their own reduction measures.\n\nWe believe that the technologies and experience we have developed through our efforts to achieve our carbon neutrality targets will help us offer business proposals that accurately respond to our customers\u2019 decarbonization needs and will greatly expand our new business opportunities.\n\n**The Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing Framework**\n\nTo promote CO\u2082 reduction at our business sites (factories and offices), in fiscal 2019 we started operating the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing*1 (HICP) framework which provides sites with incentives to invest in necessary new equipment.\n\nThe HICP framework is an internal system that aims to achieve CO\u2082 reductions effectively. It helps visualize CO\u2082 reductions from investment in equipment at factories and offices and encourages investment in new equipment that drives decarbonization through energy-saving and other measures as an extension of the established decision-making process on investment.\n\nSpecifically, with reference to emissions trading and carbon taxes globally, we establish company-internal carbon prices, convert into monetary value the effect of CO\u2082 reductions due to investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization, add this to the value of energy reduction effects, and use the result to evaluate the effect of our investment. By applying incentives like these, we aim to further expand our investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization.\n\nAs the climate change issue deepens, we anticipate risks like increased burdens from carbon taxes and new emissions trading frameworks to emerge. By incorporating those risks into our equipment investment decisions, we can not only make investments in equipment that contributes to decarbonization a higher priority, but also minimize the future risks of climate change and make ourselves more resilient. The introduction of the HICP framework is a key part of this process.\n\n*1 Internal carbon pricing: An in-house tool to assess in monetary terms the amount of carbon generated or reduced in order to voluntarily make investment decisions and conduct risk management.\nValues are closely related to CO2 emissions at each business site (for example, production quantity, output, building floor space, and number of employees).\n\nThe CO2 electrical power conversion factor for total CO2 emissions is market based.\n\nHitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) Framework\n\nAt Hitachi, the achievement of environmental targets for individual business sites (factories and offices) set by the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 is measured by CO2 emissions per unit. Because we conduct business in various sectors, the KPI of CO2 emissions per unit for each business site is calculated using the site\u2019s CO2 emissions as the numerator and its activity amount*1 as the denominator.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit was 1.4% against a target of 8% (compared to the base year of fiscal 2010). Part of the reason for not hitting the target was that decreased production caused by COVID-19 meant facilities were used less efficiently. There were also some business divisions that could not achieve the expected reductions in CO2 emissions per unit due to their failure to promptly respond to reductions in fixed power allocations linked to production.\n\nWe report the total CO2 emissions from our entire Group including CO2 emissions from power plants selling electricity. Total CO2 emissions in fiscal 2020 decreased by approximately 1,078 kt-CO2*\u00b2 compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease in emissions was caused by removing materials companies from the consolidated Hitachi Group, decreased production due to COVID-19, lower emissions thanks to energy saving efforts, and the use of renewable electricity.\n\nInvestment effect in monetary terms\n\nCO2 reduction effects\n\nEnergy reduction effect\n\nBefore introducing HICP framework\n\nAfter introducing HICP framework\n\n- Set internal carbon prices based on future risks such as higher carbon taxes and emissions trading\n- Convert effects of CO2 reductions from investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization into monetary value\n- Evaluate the effect of investments by adding the monetary effect of CO2 reductions to the previously calculated monetary value of the effect of energy reductions through investments\n- Increase the priority of investments in equipment that contribute to decarbonization\n\nRenewable energy\n\nHigh-efficiency equipment\n\nActivities\n\nGRI 302-1/305-4/305-5\n\nAt Hitachi, the achievement of environmental targets for individual business sites (factories and offices) set by the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 is measured by CO2 emissions per unit.

Going forward, we will accelerate these efforts and aim to raise the share of renewable energy in our total electricity consumption to 2% by fiscal 2030.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\nRenewable electricity generation across the Hitachi Group was 22,000MWh in fiscal 2020 which is an increase of 25% compared to fiscal 2019. Renewable energy generated by equipment installed at business sites (factories and offices) accounted for 0.5% of the electricity consumed by the entire Hitachi Group.\n\nIntroducing Renewable Electricity\n\nActivities\nHitachi is adopting renewable electricity as a way to reduce CO2 emissions and achieve carbon neutrality. As part of this, we are also offsetting any CO2 emissions that cannot be reduced through energy saving and renewable electricity generation equipment. Going forward, we plan to reduce the amount of renewable electricity acquired by promoting even greater energy-saving. Renewable electricity used will be based on the standards set by the GHG Protocol.\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\nEnvironmental Governance\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\nEnvironmental Data\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\nThe amount of renewable electricity used by Hitachi factories and offices in fiscal 2020 was 116,211 MWh; this is three times the level in fiscal 2019 and 2.6% of Hitachi\u2019s total power consumption.\n\nAt nine sites in the United States, Europe, and Japan all the electricity used came from renewable sources. Moreover, the three sites of the Hitachi High-Tech Group have achieved carbon neutrality by adopting renewable electricity and promoting energy-saving.\n\nBusiness Sites Fully Powered by Renewable Electricity in Fiscal 2020\n\n| Company                        | Sites | Electricity (MWh) |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------------------|\n| Hitachi Computer Products (America) | 1     | 12,056 (wind power) |\n| Hitachi Rail Italy             | 3     | 27,813 (hydroelectric power, etc.) |\n| Hitachi Astemo (UK and Germany) | 2     | 3,635 (hydroelectric power, etc.) |\n| Hitachi High-Tech Group        | 3     | 11,809 (hydroelectric and wind power) |\n\nReducing Transportation Energy Consumption\n\nAs part of our efforts to reduce energy output during transportation as well as at our business sites (factories and offices), we have established targets for the reduction of transportation energy use per unit for each business unit and Group company in Japan. Outside Japan these targets are voluntary. Our business sites are promoting a modal shift to highly efficient transportation methods by improving truck loading ratios and taking other measures to reduce transportation energy consumption and switching to the use of eco-cars for in-house operations. Considering a modal shift from truck to rail transportation a high priority, we are working toward \u201cEco Rail Mark company\u201d and \u201cEco Rail certified product\u201d certifications from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. Transitioning from truck to railway transportation is expected to reduce CO2 emissions per unit to one-thirteenth of its current level, and we plan to continue expanding our use of railways for long-distance transportation.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\nIn fiscal 2020, CO2 emissions from transportation within Japan for the Hitachi Group were 68.9 kt-CO2 which is 19.5 kt-CO2 less than the previous fiscal year. To reduce CO2 emissions in fiscal 2020, we focused on improving efficiency when loading products for transportation while increasing the use of coordinated transportation. Furthermore, CO2 emissions dropped by more than 20% compared to fiscal 2019 due to factors such as the removal of materials companies from the consolidated Hitachi Group and smaller shipment volumes stemming from decreased production during the pandemic.\nClimate-related Financial Information Disclosure (Based on TCFD Recommendations)\n\nIn June 2018, Hitachi announced its endorsement of the recommendations by the Financial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The following contains key climate-related financial information in line with the TCFD\u2019s recommendations.\n\n**Governance**\n\nHitachi sees climate change and other environmental issues as important management issues.\n\nThe Board of Directors discusses the Group\u2019s sustainability strategy, including climate change measures, as a key component of management strategy. Hitachi\u2019s long-term environmental targets called Environmental Innovation 2050 which include reducing CO2 emissions were established in fiscal 2016. And in fiscal 2021, they were reviewed and approved again by the Board of Directors and shared with the public.\n\nThe Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the executive chairman and CEO and staffed by heads of corporate divisions and business units, meets twice a year to discuss and reach decisions on environment-related policies and measures including those in response to climate change, and it sets the stage for implementing those measures. In addition, the Audit Committee of independent directors conducts an audit of sustainability-related operations once a year, and Hitachi executive officers report on climate-related issues to the committee during the audit.\n\nAs for TCFD initiatives outside the company, in 2019 a Hitachi executive officer participated in the TCFD Study Group on Green Finance and Corporate Disclosures and helped compile its report. The initiative was launched by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. Hitachi also participates in an industry-government-academia initiative called the TCFD Consortium\u2014comprised by 164 companies and other organizations at the time of inauguration\u2014as a member of its Steering Committee and contributed to the formulation of TCFD Guidance 2.0, announced in July 2020.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nWe are responding to climate change by fulfilling our responsibilities as a global company by helping to achieve a decarbonized society. Taking note of the total CO2 reductions required globally under the RCP 2.6*1 and RCP 8.5*2 scenarios of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we established long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 in fiscal 2016 under our Environmental Vision. Moreover, in order to help limit the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C as recommended in the IPCC Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C report, in fiscal 2020 we revised our target to achieve carbon neutrality at Hitachi factories and offices by fiscal 2030. And then in fiscal 2021 we revised our target again to achieve carbon neutrality in our value chain by fiscal 2050. Our aim is to help create a decarbonized society by setting more ambitious targets to realize that goal.\n\n---\n\n*1 A Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario under which, at the end of the 21st century, the increase in global temperatures from preindustrial levels is kept below 2\u00b0C.\n\n*2 An RCP scenario that assumes that emissions will continue to rise resulting in an approximately 4\u00b0C rise in global temperatures compared to preindustrial levels.\nIdentification and Assessment of Climate-related Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe Hitachi Group operates a broad array of businesses around the world with each business having its own set of risks and opportunities. We are responding to the impact of climate change by assessing climate-related risks and opportunities in accordance with TCFD classifications. We make sector-specific assessments of risks and opportunities for important business sectors that have a relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate change. Our assessments are also categorized according to time span, namely short term, medium term, and long term as defined below:\n\n- **Short term**: Over the next three years from fiscal 2019 to 2021\n- **Medium term**: Through fiscal 2030\n- **Long term**: Up to fiscal 2050\n\n**Time Spans for Assessing Climate-related Risks and Opportunities**\n\n| Time span | Reason for adoption |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| Short term | Corresponds to the three-year management period covered by the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 established in line with the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan |\n| Medium term | Time span of our fiscal 2030 long-term environmental targets |\n| Long term | Time span of our fiscal 2050 long-term environmental targets |\n\n**Climate-related Risks (Hitachi Group)**\n\nAs for climate-related business risks, we have followed the TCFD\u2019s classification in considering: (1) risks related to the transition to a decarbonized economy in the 1.5\u00b0C scenario, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change in the 4\u00b0C scenario which assumes that efforts to reduce global CO2 emissions have failed. Previously, we ascertained risks based on a 2\u00b0C scenario, but after considering the importance of helping to realize a decarbonized society, we are now working with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario. Hitachi has already set long-term environmental goals and has been promoting activities accordingly. Moreover, very few of our businesses depend on fossil fuels. Therefore, switching to the 1.5\u00b0C scenario does not have a big impact on the potential climate change-related risks and opportunities for Hitachi.\n\n**Category** | **Major risks** | **Time span** | **Main initiatives** |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| **Policy and legal** | Increased business costs from the introduction of carbon taxes, fuel/energy consumption taxes, emissions trading systems, and other measures | Short to long term | Avoid or mitigate increases in business costs, such as from carbon taxes, by further enhancing production and transport efficiency and promoting the use of non- or low-carbon energy sources |\n| **Technology** | Loss of sales opportunities due to delays in technology development for products and services | Medium to long term | Contribute to reducing CO2 emissions by developing and marketing innovative products and services that lead to the achievement of long-term environmental targets and expanding the decarbonization business |\n| **Market and reputation** | Impact on sales due to changes in market values or assessment of our approach to climate issues | Medium to long term | In light of growing market concerns about climate change and investor expectations for companies to play more active roles, we revised our long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 by setting the goal of becoming carbon neutral by fiscal 2050 throughout our entire value chain |\n\n**Category** | **Major risks** | **Time span** | **Main initiatives** |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| **Acute and chronic physical risks** | Climate-related risks to business continuity including increased severity of typhoons, floods, and droughts (acute risks), as well as rising sea levels and chronic heat waves (chronic risks) | Short to long term | Taking into account the possibility of flood damage when deciding on the location or equipment layout of a new plant.

To achieve the CO\u2082 reduction targets set forth in our long-term environmental targets and 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, it is essential that we reduce emissions during use. Developing and providing products and services that emit zero or very little CO\u2082 during their use will not only satisfy customer needs but also help meet society\u2019s demands for reduced emissions. This represents a business opportunity for us in the short, medium, and long term and constitutes a major pillar of the Social Innovation Business that we are promoting as a management strategy.\n\n| Category                  | Major opportunities                                                                 | Main initiatives                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Products/services and markets | Increased corporate value and revenue from expanded sales of products and services with innovative technology that can contribute to the mitigation and adaptation of climate change | Expand business areas that contribute to decarbonization.                        |\n|                           |                                                                                      | Promote decarbonized solutions and services through collaborative initiatives with customers. |\n|                           |                                                                                      | Focusing on the fields of energy, mobility, and industry, we are promoting greater utilization of digital technology (Green by Digital) and developing products that offer world-class efficiency. |\n| Resilience                | Provision of solutions to address climate-related natural disasters                  | Providing disaster prevention solutions such as high-performance firefighting command systems |\n|                           |                                                                                      | Providing construction equipment that enables quicker recoveries from disasters     |\nResponding to Climate Scenario Risks and Opportunities for Each Business\n\nHitachi operates a broad array of businesses with each business having its own set of risks and opportunities. We therefore selected businesses that have a relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate change and examined the business impact of and responses to the 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios. Under the 1.5\u00b0C scenario, as projected by the IPCC\u2019s RCP 2.6 climate model, we are anticipating a world where stringent measures and regulations will be implemented to help realize a decarbonized society. Therefore, we investigated risks and opportunities on the premise of carbon neutrality by fiscal 2050. Under the latter scenario, we focused on there being increased climate-induced natural disasters as a result of tax regulations as projected by the RCP 8.5 scenario.\n\nIn selecting the businesses that have a relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate change, we took many different factors into account and chose those with (1) relatively high CO\u2082 emissions from the use of products and services, (2) a relatively high need for fossil fuels during the use of products and services, and (3) high sales volume within the Group. The businesses we selected using these criteria were railway systems, power generation and power grids, IT systems, industrial equipment, automotive systems, and construction machinery.\n\nOur assessment of the major climate-related risks and opportunities for these businesses are outlined in the following table:\n\n| The Business Environment, Major Risks and Opportunities, and Strategies under the 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C Scenarios |\n|---|\n| **Note:** This table is divided into the following three pages. |\n\n### Target businesses\n\n| Railway systems | Power generation and power grids | IT systems | Industrial equipment | Automotive systems | Construction machinery |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Risks** | **Opportunities** | **Risks** | **Opportunities** | **Risks** | **Opportunities** |\n| Demand for transport systems that emit less CO\u2082 per distance covered will grow with tighter CO\u2082 emission regulations in each country and region. | Global demand for transport systems that emit less CO\u2082 per distance covered will grow with tighter CO\u2082 emission regulations in each country and region. | Demand for energy-saving, high-efficiency IT solutions will grow with tighter CO\u2082 emission regulations in each country and region. | Global demand for energy-saving industrial equipment will grow with tighter CO\u2082 emission regulations in each country and region. | Demand for electric and no carbon fuel construction machinery will grow with tighter CO\u2082 emission regulations on the use of fossil fuels. | Demand for electric and no carbon fuel construction machinery will grow with tighter CO\u2082 emission regulations on the use of fossil fuels. |\n| Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative emission-reducing technologies including those to improve the efficiency of railway services through digital utilization such as dynamic traffic (flexible operations in response to passenger demand) and new mobility services like MaaS. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative emission-reducing technologies including those to improve the efficiency of railway services through digital utilization such as dynamic traffic (flexible operations in response to passenger demand) and new mobility services like MaaS. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative emission-reducing technologies including those to improve the efficiency of railway services through digital utilization such as dynamic traffic (flexible operations in response to passenger demand) and new mobility services like MaaS. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative emission-reducing technologies including those to improve the efficiency of railway services through digital utilization such as dynamic traffic (flexible operations in response to passenger demand) and new mobility services like MaaS. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative emission-reducing technologies including those to improve the efficiency of railway services through digital utilization such as dynamic traffic (flexible operations in response to passenger demand) and new mobility services like MaaS. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative emission-reducing technologies including those to improve the efficiency of railway services through digital utilization such as dynamic traffic (flexible operations in response to passenger demand) and new mobility services like MaaS. |\n| Demand will grow for railways, which emit less CO\u2082 per distance covered.

The results are tabulated by the Sustainability Promotion Division of Hitachi, Ltd., and their importance is checked at Sustainability Promotion Meetings. Those risks and opportunities perceived as being particularly important for the Group as a whole are deliberated on by the Executive Sustainability Committee which is chaired by the executive chairman and the CEO of Hitachi, Ltd.\n\nOur environmental activities are managed through the Environmental Action Plan toward achieving the Environmental Vision and long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050. Its metrics and targets are updated every three years including those to measure and manage climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nWe use the reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit compared to fiscal 2010 to set targets and monitor progress across our many Group products and services in the value chain. Under the current Environmental Action Plan for 2021 (covering fiscal 2019\u20132021 as well), we have established annual targets and monitor progress for each business unit and Group company.\n\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3) across our value chain are calculated based on GHG Protocol standards, and we have published annual figures since fiscal 2012. Given the nature of our business, most of our CO2 emissions come from the use of sold products in Scope 3.\n\nHowever, CO2 emissions can fluctuate greatly due to changes in sales volumes and our business portfolio. Therefore, to advance CO2 reductions during the use of sold products and services, we set targets and monitor the progress of reducing CO2 emissions per unit. In other words, for products and services featuring equivalent value, we focus on metrics that provide customers and society with those that emit less CO2. At the same time, we will make an effort to not only reduce per unit emissions, but also total CO2 emissions from our business sites (factories and offices).\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\n\nEfforts to Achieve a Resource Efficient Society\n\nThe issues of water and resource scarcity, triggered by rising water demand and population growth\u2014resulting in higher volumes of resources collected, extracted, used, and eventually emitted as waste\u2014are common concerns for the entire world. Hitachi\u2019s business operations will respond to these issues by working with our customers and society to help build a society that uses water and other resources efficiently.\n\nInitiatives in the Value Chain\nIn order to improve the efficiency of water and resource use throughout the product life cycle, we will optimize water use and wastewater treatment in the supply chain, provide water-efficient products and services, push eco-design initiatives, and develop tools, applications, and services to achieve a circular economy.\n\nInitiatives at Business Sites\nWe have set a fiscal 2050 target of improving the usage efficiency of water and other resources by 50% compared to fiscal 2010 levels. We will create higher economic value using less water and other resources and pursue production activities with a low environmental burden.\nBuilding a Water Efficient Society\n\nHitachi\u2019s Approach to Water Risks\n\n**Approach**\n\nGRI 303-1/303-2/303-5\n\nIn recent years, a sense of crisis over water resource depletion and pollution has been growing worldwide. Hitachi is working to enhance the efficiency of water use within the Group and to respond to water risks with a view to achieving a water efficient society.\n\nHitachi operates a variety of businesses worldwide. Since water risks vary by region and the type of business, it is important to identify their respective risks and implement countermeasures tailored to the specific risks identified. To promote these efforts, we have issued Water Risk Guidelines**, which put together policies related to water risk identification and countermeasures, and we strive to better understand water risks faced by some 150 manufacturing sites around the world that are classified as category A in our environmental management classification.\n\nWe identify water risks at each site by using our Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) and such tools, including the European Union\u2019s Flood Hazard Map of the World. We analyze and evaluate the current status of water risks for each business unit and Group company, per country and region, and for the entire Group once a year.\n\nTo promote these efforts, we have issued Water Risk Guidelines**, which put together policies related to water risk identification and countermeasures, and we strive to better understand water risks faced by some 150 manufacturing sites around the world that are classified as category A in our environmental management classification.\n\nWe identify water risks at each site by using our Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) and such globally recognized tools for water risk assessment as the Aqueduct, developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI); the Water Risk Filter, developed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the German development finance institution DEG; and the European Union\u2019s Flood Hazard Map of the World. We analyze and evaluate the current status of water risks for each business unit and Group company, per country and region, and for the entire Group once a year.\n\nIn light of the results, we work to reduce water usage at the 10 business sites is 0.47 million m\u00b3 per person per year, and regions below this level are said to experience water stress.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we issued a revised version of our Water Risk Guidelines reflecting revisions to Aqueduct 3.0 and Water Risk Filter 5.0 and also included case studies. We also revised the checklist for identifying regional and operational water risks. Based on these revisions, we assessed the water risks in each region and identified high regional water risks at a total of 10 business sites operating in China, India, Vietnam, and Thailand out of some 150 manufacturing sites around the world that are classified as category A in our environmental management classification. With these results, we then assessed the operational water risks, which were found to be \u201clow to medium-high\u201d at the 10 business sites identified earlier. For this reason, Hitachi does not consider that any of its business sites face a comprehensively high water risk. The water usage at the 10 business sites is 0.47 million m\u00b3, accounting for about 2% of the 22.11 million m\u00b3 of water used in Hitachi\u2019s manufacturing processes.\n\nAdditionally, we used Aqueduct to ascertain the water stress** levels at 129 suppliers in China and 29 in Thailand, and shared the results within the Group.\n\nIdentification of Water Risks Using the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS)\n\n| Regional water risks | Operational water risks |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Number of evaluation items related to water resources, water quality, water damage, regulations, reputational risk, etc. | Approximately 90 |\n| Risk identification method | Various water risk assessment tools, including Aqueduct, are combined to identify risks based on the address information |\n| Risk assessment | Assessed using a five-level scale** from low to extremely-high |\n| Risk results | High at 10 sites |\n| | Low to medium-high at all sites, including the 10 to the left |\n\nNo business sites are facing a comprehensively high water risk.\n\n---\n\n**1 Prepared with reference to Siting Site Water Targets Informed By Catchment Context created by members of the UN Global Compact, the CEO Water Mandate, the Pacific Institute, WRI, WWF, and other global institutions with the aim of helping companies set effective site water targets.\n\n**2 Water stress occurs when demand for water outpaces availability. The maximum volume of available water supply per capita is used as an index to measure levels of scarcity. The minimum volume of water required for living, agriculture, industry, energy, and the environment is considered to be 1,700 m\u00b3 per person per year, and regions below this level are said to experience water stress.\n\n**3 Five-level scale: low, low-medium, medium-high, high, extremely-high\nHitachi has set a long-term goal of improving efficiency in the use of water, with a view to achieving a water efficient society. We are carrying out activities in pursuit of this goal at some 150 manufacturing sites around the world that are classified as category A in our environmental management classification. The Water Risk Response Working Group (WG), consisting of members of major business units and Group companies, discusses the formulation of water-related plans and their level of achievement. These are then deliberated on and finalized in the Eco-Management Meetings. Important items related to environmental initiatives including water risk are deliberated in the Executive Sustainability Committee.\n\nIn order to conduct water management efficiently and effectively, we operate an Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) that collects environmental load data at all the Hitachi Group\u2019s business sites (approximately 1,000 sites). The collected data is aggregated and analyzed, and used for PDCA management of measures including the identification of water-related issues and the sharing of case studies.\n\nManagement Framework for Water Resources\n\nStructure\n\nHitachi has set a long-term goal of improving efficiency in the use of water, with a view to achieving a water efficient society.

The volume of water used declined by 30.64 million m\u00b3, equivalent to 58% from the base year. Our measures to reduce water usage include more stringent management of water intake using flowmeters, leakage control by installing above-ground water pipes, circular use of cooling water, and reuse of purified waste water.\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\nReduction in Water Usage*\u00b9 per Unit (Hitachi Group)\n\n| Year | FY 2010 (base year) | FY 2020 |\n|------|---------------------|---------|\n| 2016 | 41.34               | 38.54   |\n| 2017 | 38.54               | 35.02   |\n| 2018 | 35.02               | 32.56   |\n| 2019 | 32.56               | 30.04   |\n| 2020 | 30.04               | 27.51   |\n\nReduction in Water Usage*\u00b9 per Unit compared to base year\n\n24% reduction\n\nFY 2020 reduction target rate: 24%\n\n*\u00b9 Amount of water used in the production process.\n\n*\u00b2 Activity amount is a value closely related to water use at each business site (for example, output, sales, and production weight).\n\nCase Studies of Improving Water Use Efficiency\n\nWater Input*\u00b9 (Hitachi Group)\n\n| Region | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Japan  | 1.51 | 1.34 | 1.32 | 1.34 | 1.32 |\n| China  | 4.00 | 4.04 | 4.04 | 4.04 | 4.04 |\n| ASEAN, India, and other Asian regions | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 |\n| North America | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 |\n| Europe | 2.56 | 2.56 | 2.56 | 2.56 | 2.56 |\n| Other regions | 1.92 | 1.92 | 1.92 | 1.92 | 1.92 |\n\nNote: Regional classifications were changed in fiscal 2020, and the past data was recalculated based on this.\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\nEnvironmental Governance\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\nEnvironmental Data\n\nProducts and Services that Contribute to Resolving Water Issues\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi is committed to contributing to the effective use of limited water resources. We will help to solve numerous issues faced by customers that are involved in the water supply and sewerage business by combining our track record and know-how of operational technology (OT) and products cultivated over many years as a comprehensive water service provider with IT which Hitachi possesses abundant experience and knowledge of in diverse fields.\n\nHitachi\u2019s Water-related Products and Services\n\nActivity field | Products or services (implementation to date)\n--- | ---\nCreating water resources | Wastewater recycling systems\n | Seawater desalination systems\n | Water and sewage treatment, etc. (over 200 sites in about 40 countries and regions)\n | Water purification plants (approximately 700 plants in Japan)\nDeveloping water infrastructure | Sewage treatment plants (approximately 900 plants in Japan)\n | Comprehensive digital solutions for water and sewage treatment operators\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nJapan\n\nOptimization from Water Sources to Water Distribution Management Utilizing Digital Technologies\n\nJapan\u2019s waterworks bureau is facing various issues such as aging facilities and skills transfers. In response, Hitachi is strengthening public-private partnerships by providing its Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Support Digital Solution which utilizes the cloud. In fiscal 2018, at a water purification facility Hitachi introduced the O&M Support Digital Solution to support equipment inspections, manage water distribution using machine learning, and predict residual chlorine concentrations using reaction models by linking supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, inspection tablets, and the data center. In fiscal 2020, we verified the functionality and efficient maintenance and management of multiple water processing systems over a wide area, as well as the appropriate water volume and residual chlorine management in water purification plants with different water treatment methods.\n\nThrough the use of verification tests, Hitachi has been able to confirm the efficiency at several plants in Japan. And in fiscal 2021, we expanded the lineup of O&M Support Digital Solutions and started providing new features such as AI-driven equipment diagnostics, water quality predictions, and operation support.\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nConstruction of a Sewage Treatment Plant to Address Hygiene Issues and Protect the Marine Environment\n\nSewage treatment infrastructure was under maintained along the coast of Papua New Guinea\u2019s capital, Port Moresby. Sewage was being released untreated into the ocean, killing coral reefs in coastal waters, and worsening the environment of the local residents.\n\nTo solve this social and environmental issue, Hitachi formed a joint venture with Dai Nippon Construction and began a sewage treatment infrastructure development project. Completed in 2019, the constructed plant has a processing capacity of 18,400 m\u00b3 per day. In fiscal 2020, the target population for sewage treatment was about 92,000 people. In the future, it is planned to increase the processing capacity to 25,700 m\u00b3 per day to cover a projected target population of about 126,000 people along the coast of the city in 2042. This project goes beyond the construction of a sewage treatment plant. Hitachi has requested collaboration on technical support from Kitakyushu, which has been selected as an Environmental Future City, and is working to ensure stable operation of the facility by proposing efficient O&M and developing human resources, such as through water quality analysis training.\nBuilding a Society That Uses Resources Efficiently\n\nHitachi\u2019s Approach to Transitioning to a Circular Economy\n\nTo help build a recycling-oriented society, Hitachi will advance a shift from the conventional linear economy to a circular economy. At the stages of procurement, development, and design we will advance eco-designs. This includes taking into account ease of disassembly, adoption of mono-materials, durability, repairability, and resource saving as well as greater use of recycled materials and environmentally friendly materials. Beyond the issues of the long-term use of products and their reuse, and the repair, refurbishment, repurposing, and remanufacturing of products that are no longer needed, our customers\u2019 needs are changing from goods to experiences or from ownership to leasing. Responding to such a society, we will promote the effective use of resources and assets, such as with leasing, pay-per-use systems, subscriptions, products as a service, reuse, and models for sharing. In the field of technology development to support resource circulation, we will pursue the development of raw materials, products, tools, applications, and services with a view to achieving a circular economy.\n\nEfficient Use of Resources Throughout the Value Chain\n\n- Recycling plastics from home appliances (Japan)\n- Recycling metal materials from automobile casting parts (Japan)\n- Recycling amorphous metal materials (Japan)\n- Refurbishing storage systems (US)\n- Recycling construction machinery components (Japan, China, India, Indonesia, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, US, Zambia)\n- Rebuilding electric components from automobiles (Japan)\n- Disposal: Closed-loop recycling, remanufacturing\n- Procurement: Closed-loop recycling, use of recycled materials\n- Development & Design: Environmentally conscious design, resource saving, long product life\n- Distribution & Sales: Reuse, refurbishing, servicing\n- Production: Closed-loop recycling, effective use of waste\n- Use: Repair, reuse, refurbishing, sharing\n\nGRI 417-1\nHitachi High-Tech has developed a high-speed battery deterioration diagnosis method to instantaneously evaluate the performance deterioration and remaining life of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) at speeds ranging from several seconds to two minutes compared to two to four hours before.

They reused and recycled a total of 251 tons of products in fiscal 2020.\n\n**Construction machinery units**\n\nThe Hitachi Construction Machinery Remanufacturing Business remanufactures used units at recycling plants to offer as high-function, reasonably priced units with functions equivalent to those of new ones. It reduced a total of 6,630 tons of industrial waste in fiscal 2020 with a target of 9,500 tons by fiscal 2022.\n\n**Electric components for automobiles**\n\nAfter collecting malfunctioning components from dealers and repair shops, Hitachi Astemo disassembles, checks, cleans and restores, reassembles, and inspects them, and markets them as having the same performance as new products. Approximately 47.5% of electrical components were collected as malfunctioning parts and reused as refurbished products and about 15,000 malfunctioning components (approximately 100 tons) were serviced in fiscal 2020. It reduced approximately 47.5 tons of industrial waste.\n\n**Home appliances**\n\nHitachi Global Life Solutions works to recycle four categories of end-of-life home appliances (air conditioners, TVs, refrigerators/freezers, and washing machines/dryers) at 19 recycling plants as part of cooperative efforts among five companies*1 in response to the 2001 Act on Recycling of Specified Home Appliances. A total of 91,715 kt of recyclable materials*2 were recovered in fiscal 2020 of which approximately 82,408 kt were recycled. By product type, the recycling rate for refrigerators and freezers was 81%, exceeding the legal requirement of 70% by 11 percentage points, and for washing machines and dryers it was 94%, exceeding the legal requirement of 82% by 12 percentage points.\n\n*1 Hitachi Global Life Solutions; Sharp Corp.; Sony Corp.; Fujitsu General Ltd.; and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.\n\n*2 Parts and materials recovered from four categories of end-of-life home appliances (air conditioners, TVs, refrigerators/freezers, and washing machines/dryers) and recycled through in-house use, selling them, or transferring them free of charge to others who will use them. Data values are aggregated from Hitachi Global Life Solutions and Hitachi-Johnson Controls Air Conditioning.\n\nPlastic Recycling Activities\n\n**Activities**\n\nHitachi Global Life Solutions, whose plastic consumption accounts for around 70% of the Hitachi Group\u2019s total, uses recycled plastic in parts for washing machines and refrigerators and packing materials for ceiling lights. The company procures recycled plastic materials produced within the Hitachi Group using plastic parts recovered from end-of-life home appliances and plastic containers as well as purchasing recycled plastics from materials manufacturers.\n\n**Achievements in Fiscal 2020**\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, a total of 1,784 tons of recycled plastic materials from end-of-life home appliances were used as parts for home appliances and packing materials. While large components in washing machines (such as enclosure bases in the lower parts of units) were previously made with mixtures of new and recycled materials, a substantial increase in the use of recycled plastics compared to fiscal 2019 was achieved with the switch to almost 100% recycled material use in fiscal 2020. The clearing of technical problems and the handling of procurement issues are factors in this achievement.\nManagement of Waste Generated at Business Sites\n\nFor fiscal 2020, we set a target of a 11% reduction (from a base year of fiscal 2010) for waste and valuables*1 generated per unit, and bettered this by achieving a 14% reduction. The amount of waste and valuables generated was reduced by 313 kt or 24% compared to the base year. We strived to reduce waste by installing recycling facilities within our business sites as well as through closed-loop recycling, whereby the by-products and scrap from the production process are reused as resources by other business sites, and repeated use of packing and cushioning materials during transport.\n\nUnder the Zero Emission*2 initiative, which seeks to minimize landfill disposal, 73 business sites out of 162 target business sites achieved their zero waste emissions goal*3 in fiscal 2020.\n\nFor hazardous wastes, we collect environmental load data using the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) to centrally manage the volumes of hazardous wastes generated and exported by type, and to confirm proper disposal within the Group.\n\n*1 Waste and valuables: Materials generated through business activities. Each country has a legal definition of waste, and in Japan, the term refers to refuse, bulky refuse, ashes, sludge, excreta, waste oil, waste acid and alkali, carcasses, and other filthy and unnecessary matter, which are in a solid or liquid state according to the Waste Management and Public Cleansing Law. Valuables, meanwhile, are those materials left over after business activities other than waste, and can be sold or transferred free of charge to other parties as items of value.\n\n*2 Zero emissions: The principles and methods advanced by the United Nations University in 1994 aimed at eliminating waste from human activity as much as possible while maximizing the use of resources and achieving sustainable economic and manufacturing activities.\n\n*3 Zero waste emissions goal: Defined as a final disposal rate (landfill disposal/ waste and valuables) of less than 0.5% in any given fiscal year in the Hitachi Group.\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\nReduction in Waste and Valuables Generation*1 per Unit (Hitachi Group)\n\n| Year | Activity amount | Activity amount*2 | Amount generated | Amount generated*1 |\n|------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| FY 2010 (base year) | 1,322 kt | 1,009 kt | 1,322 kt | 1,009 kt |\n| FY 2020 | 1,336 kt | 1,061 kt | 1,336 kt | 1,061 kt |\n\nReduction in Waste and Valuables Generation per Unit compared to base year\n\n14% reduction\n\nFY 2020 reduction target rate: 11%\n\n*1 Amount of waste and valuables generated from the production process.\n\n*2 Activity amount is a value closely related to waste and valuables generation at each business site (for example, output, sales, and production weight).\n\nCase studies of Efficient Use of Resources\n\nGRI 306-1/306-2/306-3\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nEfforts to Achieve a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nTo adequately preserve the ecosystem and achieve a harmonized society with nature so that we may continue to enjoy nature\u2019s benefits, we have established targets to minimize our impact on natural capital as part of our long-term environmental targets.\n\nWe classify the emission of greenhouse gases and chemical substances into the atmosphere and the generation of waste materials as negative impact activities. Providing products and services that contribute to ecosystem preservation and undertaking social contribution activities to protect the environment through the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems are categorized as positive impact activities. We will strive to minimize the gap between them by 2050.\n\nBy quantifying Hitachi\u2019s positive and negative impact activities across the value chain, we are advancing initiatives to reduce our negative impact and maximize our positive impact.\n\nA Timetable for Minimizing Impacts\n\nInitiatives to Minimize Impacts on Natural Capital\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi has identified and quantified the negative impacts our business activities have on natural capital with the aim of reducing such impacts. In fiscal 2020, we evaluated the impacts using the latest version of an inventory database (IDEA v2*) that is needed for calculating negative impacts. According to our estimates, approximately 30% of our negative impacts in fiscal 2020 were related to climate change, and 20%, respectively, to ecotoxicity (air), urban air pollution, and resource consumption. With regard to climate change, we will accelerate the pace of our efforts to realize a decarbonized society and a resource efficient society as the impact of our raw materials procurement is becoming apparent in impact assessments regarding ecotoxicity (air), urban air pollution, and resource consumption. Also, we found negative impacts were reduced by 8% in fiscal 2020 from fiscal 2019. To further reduce our environmental load to minimize our impact on natural capital, we will enhance a wide range of activities such as increasing the energy efficiency of our products and services, advancing factory efficiency, using resources more effectively, and properly managing chemical substances.\n\nAs for our positive impact activities, we have been advancing social contribution activities like forest conservation and business activities that directly contribute to ecosystem preservation such as building water treatment facilities.\n\n* IDEA v2: One of Japan\u2019s leading inventory databases which is needed for implementing LCAs for calculating negative impacts.\nplants. We are also looking to quantify the impact of these activities.\n\nWe estimate the benefits gained through our forest conservation activities (flood prevention, water impoundment, water purification, soil loss prevention, and carbon fixation) on an ongoing basis using evaluation methods commonly used in forestry-related public works projects.\n\nSigning the Call to Action Statement, Initiated by Business for Nature\n\nIn June 2020, the global Business for Nature coalition issued a Call to Action statement. The aim is to encourage policy makers around the world to adopt policies to \u201cto reverse nature loss in this decade.\u201d Hitachi agrees with this goal and has signed the statement.\n\nThe Call to Action states that healthy societies, resilient economies and thriving businesses rely on nature. It urges governments to adopt policies to reverse the loss of nature, and calls for the protection, restoration, and sustainable use of natural resources.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we started collecting data on forested areas targeted for conservation activities using the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS). These data are needed to evaluate forest conservation efforts.\n\nNegative Impacts on Natural Capital\n\n| Negative Impact on Natural Capital (FY 2020) |\n|---------------------------------------------|\n| Climate change: 28%                        |\n| Land use: 9%                               |\n| Resource consumption: 15%                 |\n| Urban air pollution: 17%                  |\n| Ecotoxicity (air): 21%                     |\n| Other: 10%                                 |\n\nNote: Calculated from version 2 of the Life-cycle Impact Assessment Method based on Endpoint Modeling (LIME2) by using IDEA v2\n\nScope of Negative Impact Calculations\n\nBusiness for Nature\u2019s Call to Action\n\nIn June 2020, the global Business for Nature coalition issued a Call to Action statement.

It urges governments to adopt policies to reverse the loss of nature, and calls for the protection, restoration, and sustainable use of natural resources.\nManaging and Reducing Chemical Substances\n\nManaging Chemical Substances\n\nApproach\n\nHitachi believes that the control and reduction of chemical substances like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the causes of urban air pollution, are important to minimizing our impact on natural capital.\n\nBased on this belief, Hitachi formulated the Regulations for Environmental CSR-Compliant Monozukuri to manage chemical substances at all stages of its operations\u2014from design and development, procurement, and production to quality assurance and shipping. Chemical substances in our products are divided into two categories, prohibited substances and controlled substances, for separate management to respond to legal and regulatory frameworks at shipping destinations. With regard to chemical substances used in our business operations, we reduce risk by assigning three ranks to the use of such substances: prohibited, reduced, and controlled, as well as by educating chemical substance handlers and managers on laws and regulations and on proper risk assessment.\n\nManaging Chemical Substances in Our Products\n\nHitachi designates the chemical substances in our products requiring management as Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances. With the basic principle of taking as our model the standards of the EU, where regulations are stringent, we determine and manage controlled chemical substances extensively, regardless of export destination, type of industry, or purpose of use. Specifically, we distinguish between prohibited substances (Level 1), which are basically illegal to use inside and outside Japan in products (including packaging) but which might be found in products from suppliers, and controlled substances (Level 2), which includes substances we are required to track and manage the use of and substances requiring attention to recycling or appropriate disposal methods. The list of managed substances and levels is revised when necessary based on updates to the EU\u2019s REACH*1 and other regulations, with the aim of adding substances to the list of Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances six months before they are officially regulated.\n\nHitachi\u2019s Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nBecause five substances including phenol isopropylated phosphate (PIP [3:1]) were to be added to the list of restricted substances under the United States\u2019 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA*) in March 2021, we in April 2021 revised them as prohibited substances and controlled substances. As a result, the list of Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances now contains 23 prohibited substance groups and 25 controlled substance groups.\n\nManaging Chemical Substances in Our Business Operations\n\nHitachi has been cutting emissions of chemical substances from its factories and other sites through stricter management, such as by expanding the number and scope of controlled chemical substances.\n\nInformation on our efforts has been translated into English and Chinese and shared globally with Hitachi Group members. We also follow legally prescribed procedures in measuring and managing emissions*1 of sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), whose measurement is required under the laws and regulations of our business site locations, and are advancing efforts to further restrict emissions.\n\nWe comply with Japan\u2019s Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) Law*2 through Groupwide monitoring of chemical substances released into the atmosphere or into public waters, removed outside our plants as waste, or discharged into sewage systems, reporting the results to local governments for each office or plant. Although some substances are exempt from reporting due to their small quantities, our policy is to aggregate and manage data on the handling, emission, and transfer of all PRTR substances totaling 10 kilograms or more per year.\n\n*1 Emissions of SOx and NOx: Calculated from data by business site (measured values, exhaust volume, content rate, etc.).\n*2 PRTR Law: Act on Confirmation, etc. of Release Amounts of Specific Chemical Substances in the Environment and Promotion of Improvements to the Management Thereof.\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\nReduction in Atmospheric Emissions of Chemical Substances per Unit (Hitachi Group)\n\nFY 2010 (base year) 100%  \nEmissions 4,006 t  \nActivity amount  \n\nFY 2020 67%  \nEmissions 2,374 t  \nActivity amount  \n\nReduction in Atmospheric Emissions of Chemical Substances per Unit 33% reduction  \nFY 2020 reduction target rate: 17%  \n\nNotes:  \n1. A value closely related to atmospheric emissions of chemical substances at each business site (for example, substances handled, sales, and output)  \n2. Atmospheric emissions of VOCs and other chemical substances are calculated from the content rate included in the ingredients  \n3. Regional classifications were changed in fiscal 2020, and the past data was recalculated based on this.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, toward the target of reducing atmospheric emissions of chemical substances per unit by 17% from the base year 2010, we were able to achieve a reduction rate of 33%. To reduce the emissions, we are switching from paints containing VOCs to water-soluble and powder paints as well as expanding their use and altering the painting and washing processes.\nPreserving Ecosystems\n\nInitiatives to Preserve Ecosystems\n\nAt Hitachi, we seek to reduce negative impacts on natural capital caused by business activities and to promote positive impacts, such as by undertaking social contribution activities to protect nature and providing products and services that help preserve the ecosystem, thereby minimizing our impact on natural capital by fiscal 2050 and realizing a society in harmony with nature.\n\nHitachi created an Ecosystem Preservation Activities Menu citing the specific activities to be undertaken to promote the preservation of the ecosystem, including not only CO2 emission reductions, resource recycling, and chemical substances management but also activities that are difficult to quantify but are nonetheless important, such as the protection of rare species and efforts to make biodiversity a criterion when making investment decisions. Each business site sets its goals and promotes initiatives based on the Ecosystem Preservation Activities Menu.\n\nEcosystem Preservation Activities Menu\n\n| Category | Activities | No. of menu items |\n|----------|------------|-------------------|\n| Business sites | Production | Reducing use of resources that cannot be reused | 4 |\n| | Transportation | Using packaging that takes ecosystem into consideration | 7 |\n| | Collection, disposal, and recycling | Reducing hazardous materials in products | 2 |\n| | Product planning, development, and design | During R&D, estimating impact on biodiversity during a product\u2019s life cycle and implementing, if needed, mitigation measures | 3 |\n| | Site management | Using native species, setting up biotopes | 17 |\n| | Water use | Using rainwater | 1 |\n| Value chain | Investment and acquisition | Confirming impacts on biodiversity when investing in or acquiring a business, and implementing measures to minimize such impacts | 1 |\n| | Market entry and expansion | Including biodiversity as an investment criterion | 1 |\n| | Business development | Developing products and services to purify water, air, and soil and expanding such businesses | 1 |\n| | Procurement | Preferentially procuring paper and other office supplies that take biodiversity into consideration | 17 |\n| | Transportation | Implementing ballast water measures during marine transportation | 2 |\n| | Sales | Implementing sales expansion of products that take biodiversity into consideration | 9 |\n| | Collection, disposal, and recycling | Raising and recycling components | 7 |\n| | Entire value chain | Promoting the use of renewable energy | 1 |\n| Community | Engagement | Promoting employee activities outside the company | 3 |\n| | Social contribution | Implementing desert greening and afforestation activities | 12 |\n| Water use that takes watershed ecosystems into consideration | Water intake | Observing and collecting biota information (impact on ecosystem depending on intake volume) | 14 |\n| | Water discharge | Setting up biota management indicators and making observations (species and numbers of inhabiting organisms) | 14 |\n\nCase studies of Promoting Ecosystem Preservation\nEnvironmental Data\n\nGHG Emissions Throughout the Value Chain\n\nCalculating GHG Emissions Throughout the Value Chain (Fiscal 2020)\n\nHitachi calculates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the value chain in conformance with GHG Protocol standards. This gives us a good grasp of emission hotspots in our value chain with which we can establish effective targets and reduction measures. CO\u2082 accounts for almost all of Hitachi\u2019s GHG emissions, with there being negligible releases of other gases, making it all the more important to focus on CO\u2082-reduction efforts.\n\nAn extremely high share of our value chain emissions comes from the use of the products and services we sell. We thus believe that we can make a major contribution to decarbonization through our business operations by giving priority to enhancing the efficiency and energy-saving features of our products and services.\n\nSCOPE 1\nDirect emissions from in-house fuel use and industrial processes\n1.22 Mt-CO\u2082e [1.7%]\n\nSCOPE 2\nIndirect emissions from production of electricity and heat purchased by the company\n2.09 Mt-CO\u2082e [2.9%]\n\nSCOPE 3: Down Stream\nOther indirect emissions not covered by Scope 1 and 2 (Emissions by other entities related to the company\u2019s activities)\n60.8 Mt-CO\u2082e [84.0%]\n\nSCOPE 3: Upstream\nOther indirect emissions not covered by Scope 1 and 2 (Emissions by other entities related to the company\u2019s activities)\n8.26 Mt-CO\u2082e [11.4%]\n\nTotal GHG Emissions\n72.4 Mt-CO\u2082e\n\nIn-house: Within the scope of the company\u2019s organizational boundaries.

In the area of authentication platforms, Hitachi is developing an authentication platform to support Society 5.0 such as hands-free authentication technologies using PBI*1 and digital certificate technologies for renewable energy.\n\nIn addition, we are also strengthening research and development in areas such as robotics and electrification technologies to further advance technology platforms supporting key products such as high-speed trains, elevators, particle beam therapy equipment, biochemical/immunological analysis systems, inverters, and air compressors.\n\n*1 PBI: Public Biometrics Infrastructure\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\nIn the area of the environment, Hitachi was awarded the Excellence Award for the development and global standardization of a phthalates detection system for Rohs2, in the 47th Environmental Awards co-sponsored by Japan\u2019s National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) and Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun. Hitachi was also awarded the 52nd \u201cichinura Prize in Industry against Global Warming\u201d for the development of energy-saving industrial motors using amorphous magnetic alloy foil. In addition, Hitachi\u2019s integrated bio authentication platform service that enables hands-free authentication and cashless settlements received the Masuda Award in the 63rd Best 10 New Products Awards (2020) sponsored by Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun. We are actively pursuing initiatives to contribute to the development of society such as the development and provision of services enabling safe and secure personal authentication and financial settlements.\n\nStrategic Positioning to Resolve Future Societal Issues\n\nActivities\nLooking ahead to society of 2050, Hitachi is laying the groundwork to resolve future societal challenges by investing in the development of quantum computers, regenerative medicine, and hydrogen systems.\n\nIn addition to the research pursued at the Hitachi Cambridge Laboratory - a key research sites for quantum computer research; in Japan, a proposal for a large-scale silicon computer led by distinguished researcher Hiroyuki Mizuno in Japan was selected as a Moonshot Research and Development Program project promoted by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japanese government. The project focuses on research and development of large-scale silicon quantum computing technologies powered by silicon semiconductor technologies.\n\nIn the field of regenerative medicine, Hitachi\u2019s automated cell culturing equipment was employed by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. to cultivate iPS cells for the world\u2019s first clinical trial for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, led by physicians at Kyoto University. This is the first time that a commercial cell culturing equipment developed through industry-academia collaboration has been used in a clinical trial, and represents a significant step toward making regenerative medicine available to a wider population.\n\nIn the area of hydrogen systems, we worked with Denyo Kosan Co., Ltd. and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) after receiving the tender for the \u201cSupport Project for Promoting the Introduction of Renewable Energy in Fukushima Prefecture,\u201d and realized improved efficiency of hydrogen/diesel power generation systems.\n\nFor other combinations of a wide range of fuels, Hitachi is pursuing greater efficiency using AI control technology to flexibly respond to changes in composition. For blue hydrogen production systems, we will realize a 30% reduction in water usage compared to conventional systems by employing Hitachi\u2019s unique shift catalysts which are structurally controlled at the atomic level. Trial operations are currently underway since August 2020, at the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)\u2019s Otsuki CoolGen Fu Stage 2. Hitachi will continue its work to realize a sustainable hydrogen value chain through such efforts.\nHitachi\u2019s considers the safety and health of all its stakeholders, including customers, partners, and Hitachi Group employees and their families worldwide as its first priority, and is committed to preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\nIn October 2020, Hitachi used its original computational technology, CMOS annealing, to provide a work shift optimization solution that can draw up work shifts for ten to several hundred employees. CMOS annealing, which is the core technology involved in this solution, is able to quickly solve highly complex largescale computational problems called combinational optimization problems. In the \u201cnew normal\u201d it is expected that society will shift toward a more flexible workstyle that takes advantage of both telecommuting and in-person attendance. Accordingly, this solution is being made available to a wide range of businesses as a Lumada solution that accelerates digital innovation and supports corporate measures for work-life balance and diverse workstyles.\n\nFurther, in November 2020, Hitachi developed the IoT platform \u201cBuilMirai\u201d that provides the high added value of increased management efficiency and greater user comfort that is needed for building management in the \u201cnew normal.\u201d The platform helps to realize a comfortable environment in buildings by alleviating congestion and adjusting temperature settings in accordance with the level of crowding; connecting a facility\u2019s equipment control systems, such as elevators and air-conditioning systems, with the people flow data in each area of the building. Also in November 2020, Hitachi conducted a technological demonstration during a professional baseball game at the Tokyo Dome where images of visitors captured by cameras were replaced by silhouette icons using a \u201chuman flow visualization solution\u201d to ascertain crowding within the stadium while respecting visitor privacy. As a technology that can support measures such as positioning visitor guides to alleviate crowding, it will be applied to prevent the spread of infections in commercial facilities and event venues as well sporting events.\n\nR&D Investment and Fostering Digital Talent\n\nInvesting approximately 4% of revenue in research and development, Hitachi is committed to strengthening business in the five core sectors of our Social Innovation Business, as well as medium- to long-term initiatives for future growth. Corporate-led research and development is focused on co-creation with customers, investing in the development of world-leading technologies and disruptive technologies. We are also enhancing and expanding common digital platforms and research capabilities outside of Japan to achieve an n-fold increase in the Lumada business, our growth engine and to promote global deployment.\n\nFurther, Hitachi is strengthening its workforce of digital experts, including in the AI area, to respond to society\u2019s needs based on the recent advances in digitalization. At the Lumada Data Science Laboratory, we are training and increasing the capabilities of our engineers and consultants in the fields of AI and data analytics through practical business experience. The Research & Development Group is particularly focused on training top-class talent in the field of AI.*\u00b9 At the end of fiscal 2020, there were 356 such talent, and we will continue the focus on talent training in fiscal 2021.\n\n*\u00b9 Top-class researchers who use AI/analytics, and data scientists who received internal certification.\nPrinciples Guiding the Ethical Use of AI\n\nEven as the significance of AI as a source of innovation continues to grow, there are still concerns that its use may negatively impact the lives of people and society as a whole through actions unintended by the developers or malicious intervention by a third party as well as the AI itself unexpectedly contributing to discrimination and increased poverty.\n\nTo develop human-centric AI and implement it into our Social Innovation Business, Hitachi drafted and published its guiding principles for the ethical use of AI.\n\nThe principles comprise of three standards of conduct in planning, societal implementation, and maintenance stages, together with seven items to be observed in all stages, such as safety, privacy, fairness, equality, and the prevention of discrimination.\n\nBy reducing ethical risks hidden in the development of AI, Hitachi hopes to contribute to realizing a higher quality of life (QoL) and a sustainable society through the development and societal implementation of safe and secure, human-centric AI.\n\nPrinciples guiding the ethical use of AI:\n\nStandards of conduct (Excerpt)\n1. Development and use of AI will be planned for the realization of a sustainable society\n2. AI will be societally implemented in society with a human-centric perspective\n3. AI will be maintained and managed to provide long-term value\n\nItems to be addressed (Excerpt)\n1. Safety\n2. Privacy\n3. Fairness, equality, and prevention of discrimination\n4. Proper and responsible development and use\n5. Transparency, explainability\n6. Security\n7. Compliance\n\nBy publishing a white paper on our activities to establish AI ethics, we hope to stimulate discussions in society as a whole. We will continuously review coverage to improve AI ethics and operations by assimilating the diverse perspectives of stakeholders.\nAchievements in and after Fiscal 2020\n\nRegarding solution creation, now that the patent-thons are mostly established, we are beginning to make contributions to the creation of high-quality solutions meant to resolve serious issues. Additionally, awareness of IP solutions, such as protection, utilization, and appropriate handling, is seeing improvement due to efforts we are making, including education within our organization.\n\nRegarding global deployment of the IP we have created, we are working to strengthen PCT applications suited to the business plans of each sector as we engage in consultations with our various business divisions. In particular, the IP departments of both Hitachi, Ltd. and Hitachi ABB Power Grids are engaged in discussions regarding global IP activities.\n\nWith regard to contributions to resolve social issues, Hitachi has announced to open its IP concerning the Mother & Child Health Survey in cooperation with Hokkaido University, the City of Iwamizawa, and Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd. Looking forward, we will continue to consider ways we may be able to contribute to the resolution of social issues utilizing our IP.\n\nIntellectual property (IP) is a key element of Hitachi\u2019s business strategy. Hitachi will promote IP activities to create solutions that enhance social, environmental, and economic value for customers in line with the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, globally deploy the created IP, and contribute to resolving social issues related to the SDGs and Society 5.0 through IP activities.\n\nIP activities support Hitachi\u2019s solution creation from the perspective of intellectual property through the development of issue discovery and ideation methods making use of IP information (Patent-thons), along with the implementation of internal incentive measures, and so on. In particular, looking forward, we will bolster our support of solution creation that is intended to contribute to the enhancement of environmental value for our customers.\n\nRegarding global deployment of the IP we have created, we will contribute to the globalization of Hitachi\u2019s business by strengthening international patent applications (PCT applications) that cover inventions that were developed through open innovation with our customers and partners in addition to inventions from our own R&D activities. We will work to promote further globalization in particular, working in cooperation with new members of the Hitachi Group, including Hitachi ABB Power Grids and Hitachi Astemo, etc.\n\nRegarding helping to solve social issues, in fiscal 2019 Hitachi introduced the \u201cIP for society\u201d concept, in which it promotes the use of IP in certain highly public domains to maintain and evolve social norms. We will work in cooperation with external organizations (national and local governments, universities, organizations in the United Nations, international standards organizations, etc.) through the use of IP to make contributions to businesses aimed at achieving SDGs.\nEnvironment\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we newly established an Environmental IP Enhancement Center within the Intellectual Property Division. With it, we have begun considering policies (solution creation contributing to environmental value realization, construction of IP libraries, etc.) aimed at improving environmental value from the perspective of intellectual property. With regard to the IP libraries in particular, our hope is to link the IP we possess internally with the environmental value the utilization of such IP may bring about to realize visualization of them and promote their use both within the company and externally.\n\nIn addition, Hitachi has registered the technology for the desalination of seawater to resolve water-related issues as well as the technology for a type of ink that detects changes in temperature and then changes color to help tackle food waste issues, with WIPO GREEN a platform for environmental technology operated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).\n\nHitachi\u2019s IP Strategy\n\nUnder the Social Innovation Business, Hitachi has formulated and implemented an IP strategy that consists of three pillars: competitiveness, collaboration, and society.\n\nThe IP strategy for competitiveness is centered on acquiring and utilizing patents and other IP rights. \u201cIP Master Plans\u201d customized for the nature of each business are formulated and implemented to enforce competitiveness.\n\nThe IP strategy for collaboration is a strategy based on collaboration. As opportunities for collaborative creation with our customers and partners increase through the use of our IoT platform, Lumada, we have expanded the scope of our IP activities to include not only copyrights, patents, and trade secrets but also information assets such as data and information, and are using IP to promote partnerships and build ecosystems.\n\nOur activities rooted in Hitachi\u2019s \u201cIP for society\u201d concept work to promote the use of our IP in certain highly public domains to maintain and evolve social norms in order to make contributions to resolving social issues. Through such activities, we will promote the construction of ecosystems and build relationships with like-minded companions to contribute to the improvement of social value.\n\nHitachi\u2019s Environmental Vision\n\nHitachi Environmental Innovation 2050\n\nHigh-speed battery deterioration diagnosis (Hitachi High-Tech)*\u00b9\n\nVisualization of green energy*\u00b2\n\nRealization of SDGs, Society 5.0, and the circular economy\n\nContributing to society\n\nHome appliance recycling (Taiwan)\n\nHigh-efficiency seawater desalination system\n\nAppropriate registration in IP marketplaces\n\nHitachi Group Codes of Conduct: 6.

Furthermore, with the involvement of Hitachi ABB Power Grids, we are accelerating the pace of globalization with our IP activities, adding operation sites in Switzerland and India.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nThe spread of COVID-19 has limited in-person communication. While a variety of issues remain to be solved, Hitachi has been able to maintain a certain level of IP activity because the majority of our internal IP activities have been digitized, along with our proactive use of internally-created online tools. While our global locations in particular experienced challenging circumstances, with lockdowns, travel restrictions, and so on, Hitachi has continued almost the same IP activities as before the pandemic through the adoption of working from home and so on.\n\nReward System for Employee Inventions\n\nWe motivate employees in the R&D field with an ample reward system for new inventions. To make this reward system as fair and transparent as possible, we set standards to evaluate inventions and disclose these standards to employees. We also have a mechanism for receiving inquiries about the rewards, as well as opinions on the reward system.\n\nWe have established a special department within the Intellectual Property Division to plan and operate this system, while an internal Invention Management Committee made up of R&D, legal affairs, personnel management, and IP experts ensures that the system operates effectively across the whole Group.\n\nInternal Rewards for Inventors\n\n- **Invention Information System**: System allowing inventors to check the evaluation standards used to calculate rewards for inventions\n- **Arbitration Committee for Invention Rewards**: Committee to which inventors can appeal if they disagree with the amount they have been awarded\n- **Business Contribution Awards Annual Top 100**: President\u2019s awards to the top 100 inventors based on patent rewards received\n- **Patent Contribution Awards Top 50**: Ranking of the top 50 young inventors (under 35 years of age) based on patent rewards received within five years of their joining Hitachi\n\nAwards for IP\n\nWe are proud of Hitachi\u2019s inclusion in Clarivate Plc\u2019s Derwent Top 100 Global Innovators list for the past 10 years consecutively.\n\n| Year | Organizer | Award | Object of Award |\n|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|\n| FY 2017 | Japan Institute of Invention and Innovation | Imperial Invention Prize (top prize) at the National Commendation for Invention | Inventions concerning particle beam therapy systems |\n| FY 2018 | Japan Institute of Invention and Innovation | The Japan Patent Attorneys Association Chairman Award at the National Commendation for Invention | Inventions concerning x-ray fluoroscopy systems |\n| FY 2019 | Japan Patent Office, Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry | Imperial Invention Prize (top prize) at the National Commendation for Invention | Designs concerning UK high-speed rail vehicles |\n| FY 2020 | Clarivate Plc | Award from Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry at the Intellectual Property Achievement Awards | Excellent company that utilizes the intellectual property rights system |\n| | | Selected for inclusion in Derwent Top 100 Global Innovators (2021) list (for 10th consecutive year) | The most innovative companies and institutions in the world |\n\nProtecting Our Designs and Brand\n\nProtecting Hitachi\u2019s designs and brand is crucial for promoting our Social Innovation Business and supporting our global operations. We take resolute measures against such infringements as making and selling counterfeit goods, copying our designs or carrying the Hitachi brand, and illegally applying for or registering trademarks of such goods.\n\nIn recent years, we are taking action to identify counterfeiting networks, whose manufacturing methods and sales channels have become more sophisticated and diverse. We are also working with e-commerce site operators on countermeasures against online counterfeit sales.\n\nIn 2019, the government of Japan appended the strengthening of countermeasures against counterfeit goods to its action plan regarding SDGs. With the building and improvement of intergovernmental cooperation and relationships, Hitachi is also taking part in joint public-private initiatives, including cooperation with the International Intellectual Property Protection Forum (IIPPF).\nHuman Capital\n\nWhy\n\nIn order to engender innovation and create new value in a global and digital era, Hitachi is working on attracting, retaining, and developing diverse talent and transforming its organization to drive sustainable business growth. With due attention paid to respecting the rights of employees, equality of opportunity, occupational health and safety, and employees well-being, we strive to build good relations between employees and the company including providing work environments where employees can feel proud and happy to work at Hitachi and engaging in active dialogue regarding employee treatment and career advancement.\n\nIn recognition of the \u201cnew normal\u201d in light of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, not only are we promoting diverse working styles as a driver of telecommuting innovation, in order to improve productivity and allow employees to use their abilities to the utmost, we are also implementing job descriptions, performance management, and other systems to clarify the role of, expectations for, and output of each employee\u2019s position and accelerate the pivot to job-based human capital management.\n\nWhat\n\n- Developing global human capital\n- Building job-based HR management\n- Ensuring fair evaluation and compensation\n- Fostering \u201cI will\u201d mindset and corporate culture\n- Supporting new work styles for the post-pandemic new normal\n\nHow\n\n- Policy and promotion structure\n  - The Hitachi Group aims to achieve a high level of employee engagement across its companies worldwide.

The Sustainability Strategy Committee is made up of Hitachi executives, and its role is to determine strategies to implement across the entire Group. We have also established a Diversity Development Council in partnership with the HR departments of group companies from Hitachi, Ltd. and major Group companies.\n\nWe believe that practicing work-life management will enrich employees\u2019 work and private lives, enhance professionalism, and build personal character resulting in both individual and organizational growth over the long term. Based on this philosophy, we have established systems to support work-life reforms and a balance between employees\u2019 work and private lives.\n\nPolicy and promotion structure\n\n- Achievements in Fiscal 2020\n  - Achieved ahead of schedule in April 2021\n  - Achieved in April 2021\n  - Achieved ahead of schedule in October 2020\n\n- Promote diversity among executives\n  - Ratio of female executive and corporate officers: 10.1%\n    - Target: 10% by fiscal 2020, 15% by fiscal 2024, and 30% by fiscal 2030\n  - Ratio of non-Japanese executive and corporate officers: 11.6%\n    - Target: 10% by fiscal 2020, 15% by fiscal 2024, and 30% by fiscal 2030\n\n- Women\u2019s empowerment\n  - Number of female managers at Hitachi, Ltd.: 800 (as of October 2020)\n    - Target: 800 managers by fiscal 2020 (double the number in fiscal 2012)\n\n- Inclusion of people with disabilities\n  - Member of The Valuable 500\u2014an international movement to promote the advancement of people with disabilities.\n  - Employment rate of people with disabilities at Hitachi, Ltd.: 2.37% (Legally required employment rate: 2.3%)\nEstablishing occupational health and safety management systems\nPreventing work-related accidents\nProviding support for staying mentally and physically healthy\n\nPrevent work-related accidents*\nNumber of fatal accidents (Hitachi Group): 3, Number of fatal accidents (Hitachi, Ltd.): 0\nTarget 0\nNumber of lost-time accidents (Hitachi Group): 314; Number of lost-time accidents (Hitachi, Ltd.): 4\nTarget 198 which is half the number recorded in 2019 (Hitachi Group); 3 which is half the number recorded in 2019 (Hitachi, Ltd.)\n\nEmployee health promotion\nPercentage of stress-check participants deemed to have high stress: 11.6%\nSpecific health guidance implementation rate: 27%\n\nThe Hitachi Group Health and Safety Policy is shared with employees worldwide. We make efforts to create safe, secure and healthy workplaces that are accident-free. Hitachi, Ltd. has built an organization in which employees can promote safety activities of their own accord. To support this, we established a Safety Management Division that reports directly to the president. In fiscal 2021, this division was reorganized as the Health and Safety Division. The new organization will help strengthen global Group-wide initiatives and promote integrated management of both occupational safety and health.\n\nThe Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct call for the upholding of the fundamental rights of employees in line with the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. We also actively pursue dialogue with individual labor unions and their representatives in accordance with the laws and regulations in each country and region to deepen mutual understanding of employee working conditions and treatment as well as business conditions.\n\nFreedom of Association and Collective Bargaining\n\nDeepen mutual understanding through dialogue between employees and management\nJapan: Held Hitachi Group management meetings four times (once a quarter)\nChina (Hitachi China): Held management information round-table meetings with labor unions\nEurope (Hitachi Europe): Held annual labor-management meeting\n\n* Data based on calendar years (January to December)\nGlobal Human Capital Management\n\nDeveloping Global Human Capital\n\nApproach\n\nAs an innovation partner in the IoT era, Hitachi is developing its Lumada-based Social Innovation Business worldwide, with the aim of becoming a global leader in this field.\n\nIn order to realize this management strategy, we must secure, assign, and develop the best human resources for the job regardless of their nationality, gender, or age. They must be able to promote global projects together as \u201cOne Hitachi.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, in order to accurately ascertain the challenges faced by society and customers and to propose innovative solutions, we must foster an employee mindset that encourages operating proactively and independently while sharing ideas with society and customers. Fostering a corporate culture to support this is also an issue for the Group\u2019s human capital management.\n\nAs a global human capital management measure, Hitachi is putting a lot of effort into the proper hiring, promotion, and development of global human resources. This can be seen with the launch of a shared worldwide HR evaluation system and a leadership development program.\n\nIn addition, as a way of integrating the various existing measures for the management of global human capital, we have built a platform containing an array of information about the skills, career orientations, and other aspects of our human capital. We use the platform for globally optimized placement, identifying and nurturing management leaders of the future, and strengthening manager employee communication.\n\nHitachi\u2019s 2021 HR Strategy, based on its 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, is designed to allow the company\u2019s diverse global team to grow through their work, feel proud and happy about working at Hitachi, respect diverse values, and contribute to the creation of safe and vibrant workplaces each in their own way. To this end, we are advancing a variety of enhanced measures around the four key concepts of Talent, Culture, Organization, and HR Transformation.\n\nMeanwhile, in anticipation of a new normal in the post-pandemic world, we are accelerating the transition to working from home as a standard workstyle for a wide range of duties. Hitachi will also further diversify its employee workstyles by using work from home as a driver for change.\n\nIn addition, the Hitachi Group has been updating its job descriptions with the aim of fully utilizing the capabilities of employees and further improving overall productivity. We are moving toward job-based HR management by clarifying the role of, expectations for, and output of each employee\u2019s position. This includes the creation of performance evaluation systems.\n\nMain Enhanced Measures of the 2021 HR Strategy\n\nFour Key Concepts of the HR Strategy\n\nTalent\n- Attract, retain, and develop diverse talent to lead business growth\n- Develop digital talent\n- Develop the mindsets and skills to become global leaders\n- Promote diversity and inclusion\n\nCulture\n- Transform organizational culture and employee mindsets to encourage proactivity and individual growth\n- Build Hitachi culture globally\n- Foster a culture of career ownership\n\nOrganization\n- Reform the organization and transform employment policies to adapt to environmental changes; take action on organizational reshuffling\n- Ensure safety, health, and compliance\n- Build job-based HR management\n- Ensure steady integration of Hitachi ABB Power Grids\n\nHR Transformation\n- Execute HR transformation, promote digital HR\n- Implement HR career development and mindset transformation\n\nMain Enhanced Measures Toward Fiscal 2021\n\n- Develop digital talent\n- Develop the mindsets and skills to become global leaders\n- Promote diversity and inclusion\n- Build Hitachi culture globally\n- Foster a culture of career ownership\n- Ensure safety, health, and compliance\n- Build job-based HR management\n- Ensure steady integration of Hitachi ABB Power Grids\n- Execute HR transformation, promote digital HR\n- Implement HR career development and mindset transformation\nIn the past, Hitachi developed separately optimized HR systems and measures for each Group company operating outside Japan. With the aim of creating organizations that can succeed globally, we began building a global human capital management platform in fiscal 2012.\n\nWhile digitizing human resources information for approximately 250,000 Group employees worldwide to get an overall picture, we started by selecting 50 leader candidates from among the Group\u2019s young talented employees who can support Hitachi\u2019s global growth. This launched the \u201cFuture 50\u201d program to develop future leaders. In fiscal 2013, we conducted an employee survey (Hitachi Insights) and rated 50,000 manager positions worldwide as Hitachi Global Grade (HGG). The information was then utilized for the implementation of Global Performance Management (GPM) in fiscal 2014, which links the career goals of individual employees to business areas in the Group. Hitachi University was launched in fiscal 2015 as a management learning system for the entire worldwide Group. Also in fiscal 2015, we introduced a worldwide integrated platform for human capital management as a way to integrate the global human capital management measures already introduced, and its scope is gradually being expanded.\n\nHitachi will continue to enhance its corporate value by improving its human capital management systems and environments, and by utilizing HR technology and data.\n\nWe aim to create an environment that can maximize each employee\u2019s human resource potential.\n\n### Developing Global Human Capital\n\n**Structure**\n\nIn the past, Hitachi developed separately optimized HR systems and measures for each Group company operating outside Japan.

Also in fiscal 2015, we introduced a worldwide integrated platform for human capital management as a way to integrate the global human capital management measures already introduced, and its scope is gradually being expanded.\n\nHitachi will continue to enhance its corporate value by improving its human capital management systems and environments, and by utilizing HR technology and data.\n\n### Global Human Capital Management\n\n**FY 2012**\n\n- **Global Human Capital Database**\n  - Database creation for Approx. 250,000 people\u2019s human capital information\n\n- **Selection/development of global leaders**\n  - Selection/development of around 500 people with top-level global talent\n\n**FY 2013**\n\n- **Hitachi Global Grade (HGG)**\n  - Grading of 50,000 positions worldwide from manager level and above\n\n- **Global Employee Survey (Hitachi Insights)**\n  - Approx. 682 participating companies worldwide\n  - Approx. 177,940 respondents (Response rate: 86%)\n  - Provided in 11 languages\n\n**FY 2014**\n\n- **Global Performance Management (GPM)**\n  - Implementation for 112,000 people (with phased separation of implementation)\n\n- **Amended compensation for manager level and above (Japan [Hitachi, Ltd.])**\n  - Toward job-based compensation\n\n**FY 2015~**\n\n- **Global education platform (Hitachi University)**\n  - Introduced new learning system to 320,000 people\n\n- **Global integrated platform for human capital management**\n  - Phased expansion of linkage between HGG and GPM\n  - Excluding seniority-based portion for manager level and above\n  - Toward job-based compensation\n\n- **FY 2015 Test implementation**\n  - FY 2017 Implementation in Japan\n  - FY 2020 153,000 people\n  - FY 2021 224,000 people\n\nWe aim to create an environment that can maximize each employee\u2019s human resource potential.\n\n### Shared Global Foundation for Group-wide Human Capital Management\n\n- **Global Human Capital Database**\n  - Plan to transfer control of the functions to Global Human Capital Management Integrated Platform from 26 July 2021\n\n- **Hitachi Global Grade (HGG)**\n  - To evaluate the role and responsibilities of each position by the unified standards shared by the entire Group\n\n- **Global Performance Management (GPM)**\n  - To align business and individual objectives and promote sustainable improvement and growth of both individuals and businesses\n\n- **Global Leadership Development**\n  - To clarify human capital requirements for key management positions and identify and develop candidates for management leadership from around the world\n\n- **Hitachi University**\n  - A management learning system shared globally by the entire Group\n\n- **Integrated Platform for Human Capital Management**\n  - An integrated platform for global human capital management and management measures\nHitachi Global Grade (HGG)\nIn order to promote business strategy by utilizing diverse talents, job and task-oriented talent management is needed. Hitachi Global Grade (HGG) is one way to realize this. This system has been adopted for all positions in all our organizations worldwide. The system consists of nine grades, and each position is evaluated based on the global common standards of the entire Hitachi Group.\n\nGlobal Performance Management (GPM)\nGlobal Performance Management (GPM) forms the foundation for business management and performance enhancement with the aim of promoting the sustainable growth of organizations and individuals.\n\nThere are five items that are particularly important for Hitachi to become a global leader in the Social Innovation Business. They have been set as common competencies (behaviors) for the Hitachi Group and are applied to all employees.\n\nSupervisors provide coaching and feedback to their staff to help them achieve their targets. They encourage continuous performance improvements which lead to the medium- and long-term development of employees.\n\nBy clarifying the skills and behaviors that individuals need to demonstrate, while explaining how their actions contribute to the success of the business, we cultivate employee fulfillment at work and encourage employees to take ownership over their work and self-development.\n\nIntegrated Platform for Human Capital Management\nThe Hitachi Group has adopted a worldwide integrated platform for human capital management. In order to consolidate its global human capital management practices and policies, we have accumulated a massive amount of information about our talent, including their professional skills and career preferences, into process and a database.\n\nUp-to-date information about our talents is always available on this cloud-based platform which enables authorized employees to access it from their PCs or smart devices at any time.\n\nThis platform gives us the power to search our talents Group-wide and globally when launching new projects, gathering talent information, as well as utilizing that information to manage the team. Moreover, by having all talent data on one platform, various but correlated processes such as performance management, development planning, and career plans can be efficiently managed together on the same system.\n\nSince the pilot program in fiscal 2015 and full-scale adoption by Hitachi, Ltd. in fiscal 2017, the platform is currently being expanded to Group companies worldwide.\nTransformation to Job-Based HR Management\n\nApproach\n\nIn anticipation of the new normal of a post-pandemic world, in May 2020, Hitachi began promoting new workstyles with telecommuting as a standard option for a wide range of duties. In addition, we announced an accelerated shift to job-based HR management. This involves clarifying the duties and necessary skills and experience and assigning human resources based on their desires and abilities to perform the required duties.\n\nIn order for the Hitachi Group to expand its Social Innovation Business worldwide, we need diverse and self-motivated human resources to fully utilize their unique personal strengths and abilities. Through job-based HR management, Hitachi can assign the right people to the right jobs according to their personal abilities and motivations, regardless of their attributes such as nationality, gender, or age. The aim of our job-based HR management is to make its jobs and human resources more visible.\n\nTo achieve this, Hitachi, Ltd. has been devising ways to make its jobs and human resources more visible. Specifically, in fiscal 2020, we adopted a talent review system to investigate placement and training based on each individual\u2019s aptitude and career goals. In fiscal 2021, we introduced formal job descriptions. While continuing discussions with the labor union, we have also focused on employee communication to help them recognize the need for job-based HR management and to help change their ways of thinking.\n\nAs part of these efforts, Group companies in Japan are undertaking initiatives such as the adoption of formal job descriptions and promoting internal communication to help employees recognize the need for job-based HR management and to help change their ways of thinking.\n\nBy transforming to job-based HR management, Hitachi wants to enhance employee self-motivation, create a stronger sense of unity between the company and its members, and promote both personal and organizational growth.\n\nSystem\n\nEnsuring Fair Evaluation and Compensation\n\nWe believe that a fair global system of employee evaluation and compensation is essential for attracting diverse and highly engaged human capital regardless of nationality. Accordingly, we have established a Global Compensation Philosophy shared by all Group companies based on the principles of ensuring market competitiveness, paying based on performance, and maintaining transparency.\n\nWe have developed a performance-based compensation system for regular employees that is fair and competitive in the context of the labor market for each national or regional industry. Each employee\u2019s compensation is based on an annual performance review. Feedback on this review is also provided as fuel for further development.\n\nWe ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and region in which we operate when determining compensation. In Japan, which accounts for about half of the Group\u2019s regular employees, starting pay for new graduates is roughly 20% higher than the weighted average of Japan\u2019s regional minimum wages (as of April 1, 2021).\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi\u2019s People Analytics initiative involves gathering and analyzing data about regular employee awareness and behavior and putting it to use in human resources and management policy.\n\nQuantifying the effect of human resources initiatives has always been difficult. Evaluations have tended to be based on the experience or intuition of the evaluator. However, with People Analytics, which uses IT such as AI and data analysis, optimal initiatives based on objective indicators and analysis can be promulgated. Not only does this allow human resources departments to follow the development of each and every individual employee, it can also contribute to management by activating human capital.\n\nIn concrete terms, this means conducting a survey based on a unique psychological analysis developed under the academic guidance of the University of Tsukuba and then making use of AI in analyzing the awareness of individuals, job assignments, and behavioral data arising from the survey\u2019s results. This makes it possible to provide individual employees with insights that encourage a change in behavior, streamline human capital placement, and otherwise formulate more effective and precise human resources initiatives.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Hitachi launched this unique survey and its analytics at business divisions in Japan. In addition, we have drawn up a project roadmap and global priority initiative themes to promote People Analytics across the entire Group.\nConducting a Global Employee Survey\n\nEmployee engagement*1 has always been critical to Hitachi\u2019s people practices and thus the Global Annual Survey \u2013 Hitachi Insights is one of the programs that Global HR runs to measure engagement across the Hitachi Group companies. In September 2020, the survey was administered for the eighth time in 14 languages and around 200,000 employees worldwide were invited to participate with 180,000 responding. This response rate of 90% was the highest since its launch in 2013. We continue to see the trend of increases across all the categories with an overall approval rating of 64% (3% higher than last year and 10% higher than 2013). The engagement indicator score was 62% (2% higher than last year and 9% higher than 2013). Hitachi continuously aims for further enhancing the level of engagement by communicating the results and taking concrete actions through the PDCA cycle by senior management and managers.\n\n*1 Employee engagement: Hitachi uses the term \u201cengagement\u201d to refer to employees\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s strategies and policies as well as their job satisfaction and desire to take actions on their own initiative to bring about results.\n\nFostering the \u201cI Will\u201d Mindset as Part of the Corporate Culture (Mindset Reform)\n\nIn order to promote the Social Innovation Business that Hitachi is striving to build, employees need to generate innovation by demonstrating creativity and a desire to take on challenges. Therefore, we need to transform the mindsets of employees so that they will take the initiative to act on their own. Hitachi recognizes the diversity and independence of individual employees. We will create an organizational culture that makes the most of individuality thereby fostering individuals who take the initiative and develop and support individuals who demonstrate career ownership.\n\nEmployee support is being expanded for personal development including customized benefits under the Cafeteria Plan and recommendations relating to materials for self-development. We are also continuing to provide regular education so that each employee can acquire the skills they need.\n\n| Activities | Approach | Activities |\n|------------|----------|------------|\n| Number who took Global Employee Survey | Approx. 180,000 people | Fostering the \u201cI Will\u201d Mindset as Part of the Corporate Culture (Mindset Reform) |\n| Survey response rate | 90% | In order to promote the Social Innovation Business that Hitachi is striving to build, employees need to generate innovation by demonstrating creativity and a desire to take on challenges.

We are also continuing to provide regular education so that each employee can acquire the skills they need.\nHitachi believes that changing the awareness of each and every employee is necessary for achieving the corporate reforms needed to steadfastly uphold our medium- to long-term vision. We therefore launched the \u201cMake a Difference!\u201d idea contest for all employees around the theme of the \u201cI will\u201d mindset. This is designed to encourage participants\u2019 growth not only through a change in perspective as their ideas are linked to real experience in creating new businesses but also by providing an opportunity for employees to think for themselves, make decisions, and see a project through to completion. From prize-winning ideas, actual businesses have been born.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we also used the platform of \u201cMake a Difference!\u201d to gather ideas globally across the Group for new workstyles or ways Hitachi employees could come together as one and contribute to society by helping solve challenges related to the pandemic. This project entitled \u201cChallenge to COVID-19\u201d attracted some 1,430 ideas from around the world.\n\nAfter reviewing the ideas, we summarized the most outstanding ones into 16 themes, and proceeded with investigating how to implement them as a Group-wide activity. For one of the specific social contribution activities, Hitachi provided one million US dollars in loans to small businesses that have been impacted by the pandemic worldwide. This was done through the crowd funding platform Kiva.\n\nPromoting the \u201cMake a Difference!\u201d Idea Contest\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi believes that changing the awareness of each and every employee is necessary for achieving the corporate reforms needed to steadfastly uphold our medium- to long-term vision.

This was done through the crowd funding platform Kiva.\n\nMicrofunds a nonprofit organization in the United States. And to increase the interest in science among children around the world, Hitachi High-Tech launched an initiative to provide new online learning classes. It is based on the science education support activities that the company has been carrying out using its own tabletop scanning electron microscopes. In the area of new workstyles, we have gathered many ideas involving paperless offices, digitization of personal seals, and improvement of the telework environment. These are now being promoted under the SMiLE*\u00b9 for Work Innovation Project formed for the purpose of realizing new ways of working at Hitachi. Specifically, Hitachi has set reduction targets for achieving paperless offices and is revising business processes and establishing document storage rules. Moreover, we are promoting a plan to completely abolish the use of physical name seals for internal purposes by the end of fiscal 2021 and are switching to online document processing systems. We have also been coordinating with external partners to adopt electronic seal systems for documents, and we have started using electronic signature services for sales and procurement operations in the second half of fiscal 2020. To improve the telework environment, we began providing new laptop computers to employees in January 2021. These devices are less likely to cause communication delays and they minimize the risk of data leakage in the event of loss or theft. Full-scale deployment of the computers began in March 2021. Some of the selected innovative ideas involved utilizing the benefits of Hitachi technology and included ideas that we had already started putting into practical use. Examples of these are a solution for being able to walk through buildings operated by touchless systems in order to prevent the spread of infection and a sensor-based solution for reducing infectious disease risks.\n\nGoing forward, Hitachi will continue to foster an \u201cI will\u201d mindset among employees through the activities of the \u201cMake a Difference!\u201d idea contest. We will work to realize new outstanding ideas that contribute to society.\n\n*\u00b9 SMiLE: Styles & Methods Innovation, Lead Enablement\nIn fiscal 2021, the Hitachi Group introduced a social contribution scheme through which donations made by employees in response to disasters, accidents, disease outbreaks, and so on will be matched by the Group in full. This scheme will serve to provide support for employees who proactively engage in social contribution efforts by selecting donation recipients experiencing social issues in multiple numbers and across multiple countries. Participating in social contribution activities together with our employees in this way will serve to increase employee engagement as well as promote the embodiment of the Hitachi Group corporate credo and further solidify the Hitachi Group identity. In fiscal 2021, the Group plans to match donations up to approximately 30 million yen starting with India, where the spread of COVID-19 has become more severe, and expanding to other countries facing a range of different social issues in the future.\n\nNew Workstyle Measures for the New Normal in the Pandemic\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring the health and safety of all employees is our highest priority as supporting and we strive to prevent the spread of the virus. As well as promoting telecommuting for, in principle, all positions except those requiring a physical presence for society to function, we are undertaking initiatives to protect employees from infections and support telecommuting. With the evolving diversity of our employees\u2019 work styles, we are further promoting the creation of a rewarding workplace where each employee can play an active role.\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s impact is global, and our countermeasures in each region are informed by the conditions at regional headquarters. Hitachi Europe asked telecommuting employees what they needed, and developed an action plan to provide it. At Hitachi India, an e-learning course on COVID-19 was created and shared to raise awareness of the virus and how employees can prevent its spread.\n\nHitachi, Ltd.\u2019s Main Measures Supporting New Workstyles for the New Normal\n\n| Support based on immediate risk of infections | Main policies for supporting medium- to long-term telecommuting |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial support for purchases necessary to prevent infections | IT environment improvements |\n| Financial support for the purchase of telecommuting equipment | Development of remote access environments, provision of PCs with advanced data security (volatile memory), and delivery of notebook computers and displays to employee homes, etc. |\n| Establishment of a Novel Coronavirus Countermeasure Allowance | Remote counseling by occupational physicians and other medical staff, provision via intranet of information for staying mentally and physically healthy, etc. |\n| Deployment of Inbound Medical Assistance Services for foreign employees working in Japan | Using Hitachi\u2019s unique Happiness Level, which measures people\u2019s feelings of contentment, to stimulate communication |\n| Financial support for the purchase of IT devices, work desks, chairs, and other equipment for telecommuting | |\n| For employees who work in environments where risk of infection is thought to be high, an allowance of \u00a5500 to \u00a51,000 per day depending on the level of risk | |\n| In addition to a 24-hour year-round call center offering medical assistance in 16 languages for foreign employees and their families in Japan, referrals and appointments to medical facilities and arrangements for emergency transport and hospitalization, translation via telephone, and other services are provided. | |\n\nHitachi Sustainability Report 2021\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the pandemic made it difficult to conduct in-person group training. Therefore, we devised online group training for senior management leaders in different locations and were able to provide continuous training in this way.\n\nThe Global Group Executive Development Course (Global GEC) is for new leaders of Hitachi subsidiaries outside Japan including the executives of the new Group company, Hitachi ABB Power Grids. This e-learning course, attended by 33 people in fiscal 2020, brings a basic understanding of Hitachi's management and provides the latest information for advancing our Social Innovation Business. We are continuously creating new programs to develop talent.\n\nHitachi\u2019s Approach to Talent Development\n\nHitachi has traditionally placed great emphasis on developing talent, including the establishment of the Apprenticeship Training School, a predecessor of today\u2019s Hitachi Industrial Skills Academy, in 1910, the year of Hitachi\u2019s own founding. The pedagogical principles established in 1959 as our Educational Guidelines emphasized the spirit of y\u016beki (guidance through assistance) and jiky\u014d (endeavor through one\u2019s own efforts).\n\nThat spirit has been maintained to the present day. In addition to on-site training through work tasks, we are also expanding training programs globally across the Group to improve individual capabilities, skills, and specialties. We will continue to support the growth of each and every individual employee with the goal of developing employees who can contribute to resolving social issues.\n\nSecuring and Developing Human Resources Who Create Value\n\nBy utilizing People Analytics, Hitachi is expanding the hiring of value-creating human resources. These individuals can solve not only problems given to them but also identify other issues faced by customers and thereby provide added value to them. Once these human resources are hired, we focus on training them to become employees who can take the lead in changing and transforming Hitachi.\n\nManagement-Level Leadership Development\n\nHitachi believes that innovation in talent management to resolve the diverse challenges of global society is essential to increasing social, environmental, and economic value making it vital to develop the management-level leadership who will drive this innovation and change. For this reason, we approach management-level leadership development as a medium- to long-term initiative with top management and the Nominating Committee playing a central role.\n\nWhen developing candidates for appointment in the next and subsequent term to executive positions including CEO, CXO, and division heads several hundred candidates are selected from the Hitachi Group\u2019s human capital around the world and given both on-the-job training (OJT), including stretch assignments, and off-the-job training (Off-JT) such as external training and coaching.\n\nWe also select around 50 outstanding emerging employees as future candidates for management-level leadership as members of the \u201cFuture 50\u201d program. By giving this Future 50 tough assignments and opportunities for direct discussions with independent directors, we accelerate their development with focused educational activities.\n\nGlobal Management Training\n\nWe are globalizing our talent development programs in accordance with our global talent management strategy to develop management-level human capital.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the pandemic made it difficult to conduct in-person group training. Therefore, we devised online group training for senior management leaders in different locations and were able to provide continuous training in this way.\n\nThe Global Group Executive Development Course (Global GEC) is for new leaders of Hitachi subsidiaries outside Japan including the executives of the new Group company, Hitachi ABB Power Grids. This e-learning course, attended by 33 people in fiscal 2020, brings a basic understanding of Hitachi\u2019s management and provides the latest information for advancing our Social Innovation Business. We are continuously creating new programs to develop talent.\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nAiming to further develop and strengthen our digital talent, we consolidated our various training institutes into the Hitachi Academy in April 2019 and are currently constructing a training system for developing human capital to drive digital transformation. In fiscal 2020, we continued to maintain a training system for digital transformation and a range of digital talent skill training programs targeting different positions and focusing on developing digital talent in order to accelerate our Social Innovation Business. We also hold basic training programs on digital transformation throughout the year to raise the level of digital literacy for the entire Hitachi Group in Japan.\n\nThrough a development policy that combines the knowledge and skills obtained by participating in training with OJT, we will strengthen our digital talent development with broader fundamental training and specialist development.\n\nDeveloping Digital Talent\n\nTo accelerate our Social Innovation Business using digital technologies, we are working to develop human capital that can lead a digital transformation (DX). We are increasing the amount of digital talent across the entire Hitachi Group from approximately 30,000 employees in fiscal 2019 to 37,000 in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2020, there were approximately 35,000.\n\nIn April 2021 we achieved ahead of schedule our fiscal 2021 goal of 3,000 data scientists with specialist knowledge of data analysis including AI, IoT, and the utilization of big data. Hitachi will continue to expand its digital solutions globally.\n\nManagement Training Currently Offered Globally\n\n| Program | Description | Participants |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|\n| Global Leadership Acceleration Program for Key Positions (GAP-K) | Selective training is held for three months to accelerate the development of future management candidates.

By ensuring that individuals can fulfill their potential and maximize their creativity, and by linking individual growth to positive outcomes and growth for the organization, we enhance our corporate value. Along with promoting self-understanding and fostering strong individuals with autonomy to think and act for themselves, we are also providing support to create a framework that will capitalize on the engagement and motivation of individuals and enhance mutual understanding as a way of fostering the teamwork needed to enhance organizational strength and performance.\n\nRecognizing the importance of maximizing individual and organizational performance as we seek to become a major global player, we implement Global Performance Management (GPM) grounded in diversity and the individual thereby promoting career development with respect for each employee\u2019s individuality and personal aspirations.\n\nIn concrete terms, based on the idea that the foundation of career development is the work that each employee performs daily in the workplace, we implement a cycle aimed at the growth of each employee through a process in which goals for daily tasks are set and then pursued and followed by evaluation of the results to formulate the next objectives. We established the GPM program which includes the following initiatives.\n\n**Career Development Support in Japan**\n\n**Activities**\n\nHitachi University (Learning Management System)\n\nHitachi University is a global learning platform in which all Hitachi employees and managers can register and take necessary training in a timely manner to develop their business goals and future careers. This platform supports business line managers to grow businesses through the development of talent. In addition, the HR department utilizes training transcripts to implement effective talent development measures.\n\nCareer Development Support in Japan\n\n**Activities**\n\nHitachi has developed a broad range of career development support that focuses on \u201cinternal careers,\u201d namely, employees\u2019 individual values and rewarding activities, as well as their views on the meaning of their work.

We established the GPM program which includes the following initiatives.\n\n**Global Performance Management**\n\n| Performance planning | After consulting with their supervisors to reach a consensus on short-term objectives, employees work with supervisor guidance and support. At the end of the fiscal year, they consult with supervisors on whether these objectives were met and set new ones for the next fiscal year. |\n| Career interview | Regular employees meet with supervisors to discuss medium- and long-term career plans regarding such matters as requests for transfers or overseas postings. |\n\nWe also provide direct support for individual career development through a career development program that supports workplace communication. This program is the Hitachi Career Development Workshop (H-CDW).\n\nThrough self-analysis work, participants consider the direction they should proceed in, their career goals, and their career path, and then engage in self-directed efforts to develop their career and abilities. Around 14,500 people have participated in the program so far (as of March 31, 2021) with a focus on technicians, managers, and researchers in their thirties.\n\nIn addition to those programs, Hitachi also offers programs targeting specific age groups such as career education for young groups and training for middle-aged or older groups to help them prepare for the changes ahead in their careers.\n\nWe also operate a Career Consultation Room as part of our personalized career development support. At the Career Consultation Room, employees can speak with professional counselors about any challenges they have regarding their work, their career, or interpersonal relationships in order to help them find a solution.\nHitachi is a company with global operations, so its skills development programs are implemented primarily by its regional headquarters in keeping with the focus of each region\u2019s business operations and cultural environment. Through these efforts, we seek to identify and nurture the human capital who will become Hitachi\u2019s leaders globally across the Group.\n\nFor employees in the Americas aspiring to become global leaders, Hitachi University\u2019s global learning platform is used alongside a global management training program. HR business partners work with managers at Hitachi Vantara Corp.\u2014the core of Hitachi\u2019s digital solutions\u2014to assess employee skills and capabilities while helping employees set and achieve their personal goals.\n\nA regional program to enhance the knowledge and skills needed to grow Hitachi\u2019s business in Asia is being implemented in addition to making full use of global management training courses and an e-learning platform for general employees. Training roadmaps to develop employee knowledge, skill sets, and competencies are created to achieve optimal work performance.\n\nEmployees across Europe can develop their skills through classroom lectures and online classes enabling them to acquire professional qualifications in cultural awareness, presentation skills, and IT desktop skills. Global management training and other programs bring together Hitachi leaders in Europe which helps to build an important network in support of \u201cOne Hitachi.\u201d\n\nThe L&D Committee consists of senior executives and meets twice a year to discuss training programs. Employees are encouraged to build skill sets by making full use of global management training courses and the e-learning platform for general employees. Along with the adoption of telecommuting as a measure to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, employee training was also moved online. As a result of preparatory learning by participants and follow-up sessions at the office, the training proved to be even more effective than initially anticipated.\n\nThe growth of all employees is promoted through a training system catering to different levels of development which enables workers to develop the specialized and comprehensive skills they need to perform their jobs. In addition to global training through Hitachi University and an e-learning platform for general employees, the company provides specific content to allow employees to acquire the skills and knowledge required for business activities in China.\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nToward Achieving Diversity and Inclusion\n\nAt Hitachi, Diversity and Inclusion matter as they are a crucial component to build innovation, growth, and a long-term sustainable business. The Statement on Diversity and Inclusion was created to demonstrate our commitment.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion Integrated with Business Strategy\n\nHitachi has positioned Diversity and Inclusion as part of its management strategy, and embraces all aspects of Diversity included in the Statement on Diversity and Inclusion. To further accelerate activities at a global level, it is transitioning to integrate Diversity and Inclusion with each business strategy. To exhibit strong commitment by the management, the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer (CDIO) position was established in April 2020, with Lorena Dellagiovanna appointed to lead Diversity and Inclusion globally across the whole Hitachi Group.\n\nAs a first step of this transition, in fiscal 2020, we implemented gap data analysis, external assessments, and interviewed business/function leaders to understand our current situation. Based on the analysis, we determined the Diversity and Inclusion global strategy for the medium to long term.\n\nIn addition, as part of the strategy, Diversity and Inclusion targets were set by business units, corporate functions, and Group companies. The procedure to define the targets included individual meetings with top management and the CDIO, where discussions focused on how Diversity and Inclusion can address issues in the business as Hitachi operates in a variety of industries and markets.\n\nDiversity Management Promotion Framework\n\nTo achieve our aspirations, Hitachi has created a structure to lead global and regional actions. At a global level, Sustainability Strategy Meetings (Diversity and Inclusion sessions) and the Diversity and Inclusion Council are held every six months to promote the Group\u2019s policies and initiatives. From fiscal 2021, Diversity and Inclusion sessions were added to the Sustainability Strategy Meetings with the aim of determining the direction, defining the priorities on initiatives and investments, and sharing experiences within the top management of Group and global companies. The Diversity and Inclusion Council focuses on aligning itself with the global Diversity and Inclusion strategy and conducts discussions on specific actions in partnership with the HR departments of Group companies globally.\n\nRegional Diversity and Inclusion lead positions are created to drive initiatives aligned to local business strategies. Lastly, under the CDIO, the Diversity and Inclusion Development Center supports implementation of global and regional initiatives, and by communicating the Diversity and Inclusion strategy globally it creates value for internal and external stakeholders.\n\nWe also hold regular meetings to exchange opinions with labor unions.\nWith the aim of increasing diversity among executive officers and executive and corporate officers and managers, Hitachi has created two key performance indicators (KPIs). The goal set in November 2017 was to increase the ratio of female executives and corporate officers from 2.5% to 10% by fiscal 2020, and for non-Japanese executives and corporate officers to raise it from 3.5% to 10% in the same period. This goal was achieved in April 2021.\n\nAnother goal was to increase the number of female managers in Hitachi, Ltd. to 800 by fiscal 2020 (double the number at the end of fiscal 2012) which was achieved in October 2020, six months earlier than the target completion date.\n\nFor the next step, we have decided on a new target, based on the Diversity and Inclusion global strategy in April 2021, to achieve 30% for both female and non-Japanese executive officers and corporate officers by fiscal 2030. As a milestone, we have set target of 15% by fiscal 2024.\n\nWith our new goals, we will accelerate our global initiatives.\nDiversity and Inclusion Strategy Execution\n\nIn fiscal 2020, so as to understand the issues throughout Hitachi and to facilitate understanding diversity and inclusion even more, we have increased our activities such as meetings with top management, active communication with employees through events, and we have joined The Valuable 500\u2014an international movement to promote the advancement of people with disabilities. We will continuously implement actions both on global and regional priorities.\n\nFor fiscal 2021, at a global level, the Diversity and Inclusion global strategy is based on the following five pillars. Progress in implementing these five pillars shall be reported on and reviewed in the global structure. Group companies are also advancing diversity management in accordance with their challenges and circumstances at the global level.\n\n| Pillars | Fiscal 2024 target | Fiscal 2021 actions |\n|---------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Overall | Strategic metrics of Diversity and Inclusion are monitored and disclosed | Set policies, guidelines, and strategic metrics (KPIs), base line analysis and continuous data gathering |\n| (1) Leadership Commitment | Vocal leadership team commitments with tracking and accountability globally | Communication strategy and campaigns to be defined based on priorities showing leadership commitment |\n| (2) Culture | Inclusive culture is cultivated: Everyone is recognized to have a fair opportunity and freedom to express their own ideas and opinions | Renewal of internal/external communication globally |\n| (3) Recruitment | Targeted recruiting initiatives and array of channels for diverse communities globally | Accelerate talent exchange globally |\n| (4) Retention | Differentiated benefits companywide and a robust network of employee resource groups (ERGs)* | Set a Group-wide policy to commit to diversity and inclusion in recruiting |\n| (5) Advancement | Diverse talent in decision-level management | Support informal activities of employees including ERGs to expand their networks, broaden their horizons, and have voices advocate inclusivity |\n\n* Employee-led groups, which are based on shared characteristics and experience\n\nActivities\n\nDiversity and Inclusion Actions Based on the Following Five Pillars\n\n| Item | Total | Male | Female | Japanese | Non-Japanese |\n|------|-------|------|--------|----------|--------------|\n| Directors Number | 13 | 11 | 2 | 7 | 6 |\n| % | 100 | 84.6 | 15.4 | 53.8 | 46.2 |\n\nRatio of female executive and corporate officers 10.1%\n\nRatio of non-Japanese executive and corporate officers 11.6%\nFemale Empowerment\n\nActivities\n\nTo ensure an environment where women are able to perform at their best in all layers of the organization, the CDIO participated in Talent Committee sessions and had positive discussions about aspiring, talented future employees. Based on actions determined at the Diversity and Inclusion global strategy and Talent Committee sessions, the CDIO is mentoring female leaders and leader candidates globally.\n\nIn addition, the annual Global Women\u2019s Summit (in fiscal 2020 it was cancelled due to COVID-19) has been held since fiscal 2016 to realize gender equality in the Hitachi Group as well as other dedicated events for female employees that are held in partnership with the business units to encourage all female employees.\n\nActivities related to the empowerment of women are also being developed globally in Group companies, and we are further strengthening the global structure of the Diversity and Inclusion program.\n\nExamples of actions being taken in regions and Group companies include Hitachi Astemo establishing a global organization with the appointment of a global Diversity and Inclusion manager under the leadership of its CEO. With one of the key focus areas being increasing diversity across the entire organization, aspects of Diversity and Inclusion have been integrated in various HR processes including acquiring and managing talented employees with an increased focus on gender diversity and having a variety of different nationalities. All of the initiatives are embedded in a cohesive Diversity and Inclusion statement to build and leverage an inclusive work environment and fully embrace diversity.\n\nHitachi ABB Power Grids (HAPG) launched Diversity 360 as a company strategic priority to ensure diversity and inclusion penetrates all aspects of management practice throughout the Group. One of the four work streams is \u201cFemale acceleration\u201d with a management commitment to increase female representation at three levels of the organization; senior leadership positions, middle managers, and early career hires. The target is supported by a robust and comprehensive plan including Employee Value Proposition (EVP) to reflect the aspiration to hire employees with different ways of thinking, and the Female Talent Development Program in pipeline planning and structural integration to incorporate Diversity and Inclusion into all policies related to the employee lifecycle such as equal pay and flexible working.\n\nIn Japan, actions within the group are being implemented such as Hitachi Japan Group Women\u2019s Career Success Survey which measures the progress of female inclusion activities; it was launched in 2013 and is held every two years. Alongside these efforts, we are implementing actions such as Hitachi Japan Group Women Leaders\u2019 Meeting held every two years to support female employees at the supervisory level and above and career development training for early career female employees. Hitachi, Ltd. provides HR support and communicates with employees to prevent employees having to leave the workforce due to child/nursing care issues (for details see the Work Life Balance page). In addition, we are working to change the mindset of managers and male staff regarding gender parity and examining our working style as a whole with the aim of transforming our corporate culture. Employee compensation is set according to each individual\u2019s role and achievements, with no divisions or differences based on gender or age.\n\nRatio and Number of Female Managers (Hitachi Group)\n\n| Year | Female Managers (people) | Ratio of total female managers (%) |\n|------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 2016 | 6,772                    | 6.7                               |\n| 2017 | 7,305                    | 7.3                               |\n| 2018 | 8,375                    | 8.3                               |\n| 2019 | 8,922                    | 8.9                               |\n| 2020 | 9,541                    | 9.5                               |\n\nNote: The figures are based on the total number of female managers including those dispatched from Hitachi, Ltd. to other companies. Rising numbers of female managers in part reflect improved coverage of our human capital databases.\n\nBasic Salary and Total Individual Compensation for Female and Male Managers (Fiscal 2020)(Hitachi, Ltd.)\n\n| Basic Salary | Total Individual Compensation |\n|--------------|------------------------------|\n| 100,014      | 100,106                      |\n\nNote: Benefits for male and female employees are identical. Differences between male and female employees\u2019 salary and compensation are due to age distribution, grade distribution, etc.\nDisability Inclusion\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi Group joined The Valuable 500, a global CEO community launched at the World Economic Forum to realize the inclusion of people with disabilities through business leadership and opportunities. By joining this worldwide movement, Hitachi accelerates the inclusion of people with disabilities internally and externally.\n\nDisability inclusion actions in regional and Group companies are implemented in compliance with the local laws. In the case of regional Group companies, Hitachi Europe employees and contractors must complete training on \u201cequality and diversity\u201d as part of their induction plan, since disability inclusion is legally protected. Through the training, employees will be able to understand how to contribute to creating an inclusive workplace for all.\n\nHitachi ABB Power Grids ensured it aligned disability inclusion in the HR processes and policies within the group. This includes equal employment opportunity policies, induction programs for on boarding as well as buddy programs as part of retention and support. In addition, Hitachi ABB Power Grids is currently making its website more accessible and will continue to make the application process better for people with disabilities. Hitachi ABB Power Grids has also ensured its recruiting policy is aligned with requirements by conducting a review to create an inclusive workplace for all.\n\nHitachi ABB Power Grids has also ensured its recruiting policy is aligned with requirements by conducting a review to create an inclusive workplace for all.\n\nAs of June 2021, the employment ratio of people with disabilities was 2.37% at Hitachi, Ltd.*\u00b9 and 2.42% for the entire Group in Japan. Both of these figures exceed Japan\u2019s legally required employment ratio of 2.3%.\n\nAs of April 1, 2020, \u201cHitachi You and I,\u201d*\u00b2 which was established by three special subsidiaries, created the Recruitment Retention Support Division. The Division ensures support for the long-term employment of the disabled and develops an environment where the job satisfaction of employees is high. In addition, we have implemented \u201cWorking Together with the Disabled,\u201d an e-learning course, that 168,000 people out of 176,000 (attendance rate 95%) attended for the domestic Hitachi Group and which aims to introduce non-discrimination policies and accommodation designed for the disabled.\n\nHitachi ABB Power Grids ensured it aligned disability inclusion in the HR processes and policies within the group.

Ltd. The company employs around 450 people, of which around 380 have disabilities.\n\nOur approach on B-BBEE in South Africa\n\nAs Hitachi expands its business in South Africa, it pursues activities aligned with the country\u2019s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE)*\u00b9 policy to create employment and economic development. As of 31 March 2021, Hitachi Construction Machinery Southern Africa has achieved a B-BBEE rating of level 4.\n\n*\u00b9 B-BBEE: Companies and organizations in South Africa are scored on their B-BBEE approaches and contributions, and are rated on a scale from level 1 (the highest) to 8, and \u201cnon-compliant.\u201d\nHitachi, Ltd. promotes the companywide work-life reform initiative, Hitachi Work-Life Innovation, to develop workstyles allowing talent from diverse backgrounds to work with enthusiasm and demonstrate strong performance.\n\nToday, approximately 95% of all employees take advantage of our telecommuting and satellite office work programs, including managerial-level employees, flex workers, and career-track regular employees who need to balance work with child care, nursing care, or medical treatment. This provides employees with flexibility concerning where and when they work. The programs do not require the applicants to come into the office for a certain amount of time nor are there any limitations on the number of times for doing so, which allows employees to work from wherever they need to be for child care or nursing care. If posted away from their families, they can work from their family home. We are also rolling out location-free work for managerial-level employees, which allows them to perform their duties from anywhere when approved by the company.\n\nHitachi goes beyond \u201cwork-life balance,\u201d in which employees are simply urged to balance work and private life, to promote \u201cwork-life management\u201d which encourages employees to proactively take charge of improving the quality of both their work and private lives. We believe that practicing work-life management will enrich employees\u2019 work and private lives, enhance professionalism, and build personal character, resulting in both individual and organizational growth over the long term. Based on this philosophy, we have established systems to support work-life reforms and a balance between employees\u2019 work and private lives.\n\n### Work-Life Innovation Initiatives at Hitachi, Ltd.\n\n| Activity | Key components |\n|----------|----------------|\n| Top commitment | Send message within company |\n| Review of operations and processes | Reform administrative operations at headquarters |\n| Strengthening of workplace management | Clarify rules for outgoing email |\n| Promotion of time- and location-independent work practices | Use support tool designed to optimize meeting durations and participant numbers and improve meeting efficiency |\n| Companywide promotional tactics | Increase operational transparency using in-house consultants (experience-oriented approach) |\n| | Improve attendance management system for compliance rule enforcement |\n| | Expand telecommuting program |\n| | Create environments where internal wireless local area networks (LAN) can be accessed safely |\n| | Distribute around 30,000 IT tools to support paperless and online meetings |\n| | Roll out location-independent work for managerial-level employees |\n| | Expand satellite office network (150 sites as of April 2021) |\n| | Reform administration by promoting electronic signatures and paperless systems |\n| | Share on Hitachi\u2019s intranet site |\n| | Share best practices by giving awards |\n\nCoverage of telecommuting and satellite office work programs\n\nApprox. 95%\nEnhancing Work-Life Management Support Systems\n\nHitachi, Ltd. and certain Group companies in Japan are working to create even more supportive workplaces by introducing and expanding various programs to help employees balance work and family life. We have provided an allowance to support child care and work; launched Hokatsu Concierge child-care matching service, an information-providing service for finding nurseries; and provided a child-care matching service in collaboration with company-led nurseries. Through these kinds of support, we offer an environment where work and parenting can be balanced with peace of mind.\n\nHitachi regularly conducts employee awareness and internal fact-finding surveys concerning nursing care. Based on the results of these surveys, we are working to enhance measures to help employees balance their work and home nursing care responsibilities. As Japan\u2019s population ages, the number of regular employees facing the challenge of providing nursing care for elderly family members is growing. Consequently, Hitachi has been offering financial support for these employees by establishing new programs such as Work-caregiving balance support points under the Cafeteria Plan. By also holding seminars on how to balance work and nursing care responsibilities, employees receive useful information which transforms their awareness of the work-life balance. This includes learning about the importance of continuing to work while fulfilling nursing care responsibilities along with expert information on how to achieve this balance.\n\nHitachi has also introduced a service that warmly supports employees dealing with nursing care concerns. In addition to helping employees apply for public programs and find nursing care facilities, the service can also arrange counseling to help employees dealing with nursing care concerns. In addition to continuing to work while fulfilling nursing care responsibilities, employees receive useful information which transforms their awareness of the work-life balance. This includes learning about the importance of continuing to work while fulfilling nursing care responsibilities along with expert information on how to achieve this balance.\n\nHitachi has also introduced a service that warmly supports employees dealing with nursing care concerns.

This service, created with the help of the Cabinet Office\u2019s support program, enables employees who are looking for a nursery for their children to apply for admission to a company-led nursery, thereby expediting an early return to work for employees on maternity or child care leave.\n- Contact point for obtaining consultation and support regarding nursing care concerns\n- To increase financial support\n- To enhance support for creating better home care environments\n\nWork-Life Management Support System at Hitachi, Ltd.\n\nChild-Care Support System\n\n- For women\n  - Fertility treatment leave (1 year total)\n  - Leave for prenatal medical appointments, pregnancy problem leave, etc.\n  - Maternity leave (8 weeks before and 6 weeks after childbirth)\n  - Child-care leave (up to 3 years, until the child completes the first grade of elementary school, can be taken nonsequentially)\n\n- For men\n  - Paternity leave (5 days total)\n  - Child-care leave (up to 3 years, until the child completes the first grade of elementary school)\n\nNursing-Care Support System\n\n- Child-nursing leave\n- Child-care leave\n- Child-care leave (1 year in total, can be taken nonsequentially)\n\nFinancial support\n\n- Work-caring balance support points (5,000 points, 100,000 JPY per person receiving care per year)\n- Work-caring balance support points (3,000 points, 50,000 JPY per person receiving care)\n\nConsultation services and information provision\n\n- Nursing Care Concierge (consultation service)\n- Distribution of Handbook on Balancing Work and Caregiving\n- Holding seminars on how to balance work and nursing care responsibilities\n\nCafeteria Plan (child-care and nursing-care menu)\nIn-House Child-Care Centers\nHitachi, Ltd., in collaboration with its labor union and 17 Group companies, has set up in-house child-care facilities with capacity for approximately 70 children in its Yokohama Office as a way to support employees in balancing work with child care.\n\nSupport Systems and Measures that Meet Diverse Employee Needs\n\nIn the past, these lifestyle support programs and measures have been updated so that they also cover limited-term contract employees. In addition, for those measures that are unsuitable for limited-term contract employees due to the purpose and nature of the program concerned, we provide support to employees regardless of their employment type. This includes the provision of welfare allowances as an alternative measure.\n\nWith regard to retirement benefit programs, Hitachi Group companies in Japan have partially or fully implemented defined benefit corporate pension plans, defined contribution pension plans, and lump-sum retirement allowance plans. These plans respond to the diverse needs of people in old age by providing supplementary benefits in addition to public pensions and play an important role in allowing retired people to live more affluently.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\nIn fiscal 2020, the incentive system to encourage regular employee participation in the stock ownership program was changed at Hitachi, Ltd. and some Group companies in Japan. Under the new system, the stock option incentive rate varies according to the degree of the target achievement under the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan and the number of shares already held by the employee concerned. While raising awareness of the benefits of management participation, we are helping employees to accumulate assets over the medium and long term.\n\nFurthermore, as part of its Cafeteria Plan benefits program, Hitachi, Ltd. has been taking special measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes raising funds to support professionals on the healthcare frontlines, while also subsidizing costs incurred to purchase computer equipment such as monitors and Wi-Fi routers, as well as desks, chairs, and other items they may need to work from home.\nThe Statement on Diversity and Inclusion guides Hitachi\u2019s endeavors to create work environments that allow our diverse range of human capital to work with enthusiasm and to support workstyles that are conducive to each employee achieving their full potential. Region-specific policies are also implemented by our regional headquarters.\n\nInitiatives at Regional Headquarters to Create a Good Working Environment\n\nThe initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion include a mentor program and webinars to share the experiences of employee role models. Of the employees promoted from January to early August 2020, 36% were women and 83% were from minority groups. Nearly 30% of minority employees at Hitachi America hold director or higher positions. New hires during the same span were about one-third women and approximately half were ethnic minorities.\n\nHitachi America, Ltd.\n\nInitiatives to promote diversity and inclusion include a mentor program and webinars to share the experiences of employee role models.

A group of mainly younger employees are asked to introduce their division\u2019s work to workers in other divisions to deepen understanding and encourage collaborative creation across divisions. This activity was held four times in fiscal 2020, twice in Beijing and twice in Shanghai, including online sessions and with a total of 63 employees participating. The network built through these activities has contributed to smoother business operations.\n\nHitachi Europe Ltd.\n\nIn addition to Hitachi Insights, which is conducted across the worldwide Hitachi Group, each region of Hitachi Europe separately surveys those who have chosen to leave the company. The information is analyzed and used to help create workplaces where employees prefer to stay long term. Support is provided to employees\u2019 philanthropic activities, with auctions and sporting events being organized to benefit a charity selected by a vote among employees each year.\n\nHitachi India Pvt. Ltd.\n\nIn India, where the pandemic has been especially severe, this company has been accelerating online measures to improve communication between employees. Sixty participants from Hitachi India and its group companies participated in an online workshop program. By enhancing participant follow-up before and after the program, the activity received high marks from those who took part. As part of other measures to deal with COVID-19, Hitachi India introduced virtual coffee breaks for employees working from home. Also, the company is enhancing efforts to support the mental health of telecommuters including the promotion of online yoga using a mobile app.\nOccupational Health and Safety\n\nThe Basic Principle for Occupational Health and Safety\n\nPolicy\n\n\"Health and Safety Always Comes First,\" is the basic principle underlying the Hitachi Group Health and Safety Policy which is shared by all Hitachi Group companies around the world. Employees work together to create healthy, safe, and secure work environments that aim to be accident free. Moreover, we actively adopt practices to protect our own health and safety and share the belief that all work-related accidents can be prevented. We also strive to build a culture of raising mutual awareness.\n\nEstablishing Occupational Health and Safety Management System\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Safety Management Division promoted the creation of organizations to support independent safety activities by employees. The Health and Productivity Management Promotion Office of the Human Capital Division has been working to improve employee healthcare support to promote even better health management. In April 2021, we established the Safety and Health Management Division to integrate and operate the organizations that manage Occupational Safety and Occupational Health and Productivity Management. The aim is to build a global safety and health management system, strengthen efforts toward zero work-related accidents, and further improve the employee support system both physically and mentally.\n\nHitachi Group Health and Safety Policy\n\n\"Health and Safety Always Comes First\"\n\nIn accordance with our mission, \"Contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products,\" the Hitachi Group will endeavor to ensure safe and healthy workplaces under the principle of \"Health and Safety Always Comes First.\"\n\nTo accomplish this, we will:\n1. Continually be involved in health and safety activities in order to prevent work-related injuries and sickness by designating the health and safety of employees as management's top priority\n2. Comply with the local laws and regulations in each company regarding health and safety\n3. Develop a safe and comfortable work environment by encouraging employees to maintain their own health and taking a proactive stance on health and safety activities in the workplace\n4. Require an understanding of Hitachi's principles and the promotion of health and safety awareness from all business partners*\u00b9 of the Hitachi Group\n5. Contribute to the creation of a safe and pleasant society by emphasizing activities that make health and safety a top priority in all of Hitachi's business activities (Revised November 2013)\n\n*\u00b9 Includes contractors like vendors and suppliers, etc.\nSafety Audits by External Specialist Institutions\n\nFour Hitachi Group sites in Japan underwent safety audits by a third-party organization from January to September 2018. As a result, the following were pointed out as issues to be addressed in order to realize the Group\u2019s health and safety policy which states: \u201cHealth and Safety Always Comes First.\u201d (See \u201cIssues Identified\u201d in the table.)\n\nIn response to these findings in fiscal 2019 and 2020 we promoted activities with a focus on monitoring the current situation and building a foundation for issue resolution. The following specific measures were taken in fiscal 2020.\n\n| Issues Identified | Fiscal 2020 targets | Specific measures taken in fiscal 2020 |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Insufficient Group-wide safety management systems | Continued to strengthen cooperation with each business site and ascertain the actual situations of safety activities | Continued to hold meetings of the Safety Strategy Promotion meeting (once every two months). Changed policy to require the attendance of safety representatives (CHROs of each business unit and officers responsible for safety at each Group company) |\n| Leadership by the organization\u2019s top management has not been fully demonstrated which has led to a decline in the safety awareness of employees | Raised awareness of the need to rebuild a culture of safety | Held top-level discussions between the general manager and deputy general managers of the Safety Management Division and the business unit CEOs and launched safety training for executives |\n| Lack of safety expertise and implementation skills in the workplace | Launched safety education to develop human resources at business units and Group companies | Held safety training for line managers and safety staff as well as instructor training workshops for safety staff |\n| Who is accountable for the performance of safety activities is unclear, and fundamental measures to deal with accidents are inadequate | Analyzed accident causes, improved methods for horizontal initiative deployment, and ensured full-scale implementation of corrective and preventive measures | Analyzed accident data for Tier 1-1 (lost-time accidents) and more severe accidents and reviewed the accident investigations in Japan |\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Hitachi Group promoted infrastructure development that included collecting information for the building of a global health and safety management system. The aim is to rebuild a culture of safety in which all Group employees can think and take safety steps proactively. As an initiative toward eliminating work-related accidents, in July 2020 the frequency of global accident statistics reporting was changed from once every six months to once a month in order to better track accident data. Initiatives directly under the Safety Management Division have been expanded to improve health and safety activities at sites outside Japan where serious accidents have occurred. To further raise awareness of the need to rebuild a culture of safety, the Group has initiated safety training to enhance safety awareness among management as well as leadership training based on the use of external consultants. The Group also conducted safety training for each organizational level such as enhanced safety training for line managers and safety staff on the frontlines. A total of about 320 people participated in these activities.\nInitiatives for Preventing Work-related Accidents\n\nHitachi is developing organizations where employees are self-motivated to maintain safety activities and prevent work-related accidents. We aim to achieve zero fatal accidents by 2021 and halve lost-time accidents compared to 2018 across Group sites worldwide.\n\n2021 Safety Targets (KPI)\n\n| Target | Fatal accidents | Lost-time accidents |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Hitachi Group | Zero accidents | Halved compared to 2018 (253 accidents) |\n| Hitachi, Ltd. | Zero accidents | Halved compared to 2018 (3 accidents) |\n\nIn order to achieve these goals, the Safety Management Division is taking the lead in holding monthly Safety Strategy Promotion Council meetings, interviewing the departments in charge of safety, as well as analyzing accident causes and conducting training. It also implemented various measures in line with five action plans in fiscal 2020.\n\nAction Plans\n\n1. The top management\u2019s commitment to safety and raising awareness of workplace safety\n2. Ensuring full awareness of the need to put safety first and taking actions accordingly\n3. Regular operations, situation recognition, and appropriate responses\n4. Improving expertise and the ability to promote safety activities\n5. Analysis of the causes of accidents and thorough measures to prevent recurrences\n\nHitachi sets and applies its own safety standards to be observed at manufacturing sites globally as well as advancing health and safety measures tailored to the operations of individual companies. In particular, under the Safety Management Division we have worked to improve our safety measures both in terms of our policies by examining and improving our risk assessment frameworks and our protocols by using IT and digital technology to prevent accidents.\n\nAdditionally, because the risk of accidents is higher for workers not yet accustomed to their work or environment, employees and temporary workers receive health and safety training on their work and on-the-job training before work begins to help prevent accidents by ensuring that they understand work procedures and dangers. We are also working to build an education system that meets the requirements of the occupational health and safety management system integrated across the Group\u2019s operations worldwide. At each business site, the system will provide training for safety administrators at each organizational level and safety training for specific hazardous work activities as appropriate for the organizational structure or business type.\n\nWhen business restructuring occurs, we share the details of the health and safety management frameworks and initiatives of the organizations to be merged in advance, and, paying all due respect to the organizational cultures on both sides, we ensure that safety is always preserved during the execution of a smooth business launch.\n\nInitiatives to Prevent Work-related Accidents\n\nEnhancement of Safety Education\n\nIn order to ensure safety awareness among all officers and employees, Hitachi carries out safety training specific to each organizational level. With the aim of changing safety awareness starting at the top, in fiscal 2020, we established new safety training for executives. Over a total of four sessions, 76 executives learned about their roles and responsibilities for safety and then made their own personal safety commitments. After attending the training, we also evaluate the changes in awareness and behavior of the executives through 1-on-1 interviews with external consultants.\n\nCurrent Work-related Accident Situations\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the total number of accidents fell due to the suspension of operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately however, three fatal accidents occurred within the Hitachi Group worldwide. The number of lost-time accidents decreased by about 21% from the previous fiscal year, but there is still considerable room for improvement.\n\nIn 2020, Hitachi, Ltd. and Group companies in Japan had no fatalities and 52 lost time injuries (Hitachi, Ltd.: 4). Globally, in 2019 and 2020, there were multiple fatal accidents caused by electrocution involving both employees and contractors (five out of the eight fatal accidents were electrocutions). We recognize the need to improve workplace environments, which pose risks such as electric shocks, and to build a safety management system that also includes contractors.\n\nIn 2021, Hitachi plans to undertake global risk management concerning serious accidents with the goals of achieving zero fatal accidents while halving lost-time accidents compared to 2018. In the short term, the Group will work on minimizing the risk of electrocutions in all business\ndivisions worldwide and remediate high-risk operations and equipment. This will be done by implementing occupational accident prevention measures that clarify the safety manager at the business site level and by investing in and installing hardware to reduce risks. The initiative is to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021.\n\nIn the medium and long term, Hitachi will build a safety management system covering the Group\u2019s operations worldwide while establishing Group-wide KPIs and making their performance visible. We will provide follow-up safety training for executives, redefine the roles and necessary functions of safety organizations and staff, and increase the number of safety experts.\n\n**Initiatives to Improve Employee Health**\n\nHitachi believes that health is the foundation for employees being able to work energetically and with peace of mind. The basic principle of the Hitachi Group Health and Safety Policy, shared by all Group companies globally, is that \u201cHealth and Safety Always Comes First.\u201d Based on this principle, we strive as one to create working environments that allow workers to do their jobs without anxiety over their mental or physical health.\n\nUntil recently, health measures have been concentrated in Japan and the Health and Productivity Management Promotion Office of the Human Resources and Labor Administration Division, and the Health Insurance Society, BUs, Group companies, and the Occupational Health Division collaborated and were the main body for implementing measures. In order to promote health management as part of organizational management, the Health Management and Productivity Promotion Office and the Safety Management Division have now been integrated. The new Health Management Promotion Department of the Health and Safety Management Promotion Division is working on health measures shared across the worldwide Hitachi Group in collaboration with safety-related personnel.\n\nIn the short term, we will steadily implement health management measures in Japan, strengthen mental health support in accordance with new workstyles, and work to thoroughly prevent lifestyle-related diseases. Over the medium and long term, we will develop a Group-wide health and safety policy after ascertaining the actual conditions of occupational health measures globally, and identifying issues. The necessary initiatives will then be implemented in a unified way.\n\n**Fiscal 2021 Targets for Health Management (KPIs)**\n\n| Percentage of employees with high stress according to the stress-check system | Percentage who have received special health guidance |\n|---|---|\n| Hitachi Group (Japan) | 10% decrease from fiscal 2020 | 40% of employees |\nHealth Support Initiatives in Japan\n\n- Occupational healthcare provided by occupational physicians, nurses, and other occupational healthcare personnel both at health-management centers located at individual business locations and regional health-management centers serving multiple business locations\n- Health maintenance measures provided based on periodic medical exams and other examinations to prevent serious disease\n- Medical interviews and advice to prevent mental and physical disorders among employees working long hours\n- Consultations and guidance by occupational healthcare workers to address employees\u2019 health concerns and encourage regular exercise\n- Proactive implementation of stress checks specified by law at all business sites\u2014even those employing fewer than 50 employees which are only required to make efforts toward compliance\u2014to help prevent mental health issues and revitalize workplaces\n- Qualitative improvement of occupational healthcare activities and the human capital development of occupational healthcare workers through regular meetings, study groups, and training sessions attended by both occupational healthcare workers and human resources officers\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn April 2020, the Health and Productivity Management Promotion Office of the Human Resources and Labor Administration Division was established with the aim of strengthening cooperation with the Occupational Health Promotion Center and the Health Insurance Society. We have been working on mental and physical health measures to deal with the diversification of workstyles and the pandemic situation. Specific measures taken in Japan include the creation of a system for employees to consult the company\u2019s occupational physicians remotely during the pandemic, based on an extraordinary meeting of the occupational physicians. A campaign was also launched to encourage personnel to regularly record their health data such as body temperature and weight to support personal health management. Outside Japan, employee mental health measures were implemented in each region.\n\nAddressing Mental Health\n\nHitachi has established measures addressing mental health to be taken by employees, workplace managers, occupational healthcare workers, and human resources divisions, and it is working to spread basic mental health knowledge and understanding of ways to deal with stress as well as reinforcing the ability of those in positions of authority to respond to these issues. The mental illness incidence rate among employees in fiscal 2020 was lower than in the previous year. Nevertheless, we have developed a proactive approach that anticipates increases in mental strain such as that caused by the changing workstyles and behavioral constraints during the pandemic.\n\n(1) Regular one-on-one interviews\n(2) Expansion of a system for remote consultations with occupational physicians\n(3) Introduction of an EAP*\u00b9 consultation service for Group companies that have not yet adopted it\n(4) Individual interviews with expatriate employees\n(5) Tips for working from home posted on the intranet\n(6) Identification of health issues using a telecommuting survey\n\nAlso, based on the results of the telecommuting survey and the opinions of occupational physicians, we plan to provide even more proactive support for employees who need it. This includes consultations with those who have been diagnosed with elevated stress, looking for warning signs in attendance information, establishing a health consultation service for managers, conducting resilience training, and holding individual health interviews with young employees.\n\n*\u00b9 Employee Assistance Program\nInitiatives Addressing Mental Health at Hitachi\n\n**Preventive management (while healthy)**\n- Health improvement activities (Seminars and health guidance from occupational physicians)\n- Stress-check system specified in law\n- Mental health education\n- Working environment improvement workshops, etc.\n- EAP corporate diagnosis\n- Line care training\n- 360FBP\n\n**Indicator management (while mentally unhealthy)**\n- Mental health consultations during medical exams\n- Health consultations\n- Workplace management\n- Management of those working extensive overtime\n\n**Condition management (at beginning of and during absences and leave)**\n- Regular consultations\n- Leave system\n- Regular consultations\n- Management of employees on leave\n\n**Management to prevent recurrence (from decision to return to after returning to work)**\n- Programs supporting return to work\n- Trial return system\n- Consideration of tasks upon return\n- Programs supporting return to work\n\n**Repetition management (during repetition after return to work)**\n- Regular consultations\n- Collaboration to support return to work\n- Guidance to external facilities supporting return to work\n\n**Human resources division**\n- Promotion of training and education\n- Workplace management guidance\n- Reduction of long working hours\n\n**Line care** (superior)\n- EAP consultations and other consulting services\n- EAP corporate diagnosis\n- Line care training\n- 360FBP\n\n**Self-care** (individual)\n- Stress coping seminars\n- EAP consultations and other consulting services\n- e-learning: \u201cThinking about mental and physical health\u201d versions 1\u20133\n\n**Occupational physicians and occupational healthcare staff**\n- Health improvement activities (Seminars and health guidance from occupational physicians)\n- Stress-check system specified in law\n- Mental health education\n- Working environment improvement workshops, etc.\n- EAP corporate diagnosis\n- Line care training\n- 360FBP\n\nPromoting Collabo-Health*1\n\nAs well as carrying out individual health improvement initiatives according to their own unique characteristics, Group companies in Japan strive to maintain and improve the health of employees by taking full advantage of the services offered by the Health Insurance Society.*\u00b2 Hitachi is also working to ensure that all Group companies are certified under the Health and Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. Health promotion initiatives are also evaluated on an annual basis with recognition of the most accomplished companies and business sites within the Group heightening the motivation among business owners and employees to pursue such activities.\n\n*1 Collabo-Health: A concept involving insurers like the Health Insurance Society proactively working with business owners, with a clear division of labor and a good working environment, to effectively and efficiently improve the health of insured persons (employees and their families), including preventive strategies.\n\n*2 Hitachi Health Insurance Society: Hitachi Group employees and their families are members of this organization which is one of Japan\u2019s largest health insurance associations. As of the end of March 2021, there were 191 participating corporations and 447,153 insured persons (223,007 members and 224,146 dependents).\n\nNumber of Hitachi Health Insurance Society Member Corporations Certified Under the Health and Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program\n\n| Category | FY 2020 | FY 2019 |\n|----------|---------|---------|\n| Large companies | 58 (including 7 with \u201cWhite 500\u201d status) | 45 |\n| small and medium-sized companies | 41 (including 3 with \u201cBright 500\u201d status) | 26 |\nEncouraging Employees to Receive Medical Exams and Quit Smoking\n\nIn Japan, Hitachi has established a system offering financial support for medical exams by the Health Insurance Society and encourages employees aged 35 and over in particular to receive the general physical and other exams specified in law as well as targeted screening based on age in order to promote early diagnosis and treatment such as for lifestyle related diseases and cancers.\n\nFurthermore, as a response to the rise in metabolic syndrome, and in addition to special health guidance made compulsory for the Health Insurance Society, we actively promote policies to prevent and control conditions such as diabetes, cerebral strokes, and myocardial infarctions. Hitachi has also introduced an online quit smoking program so that employees do not need to visit a clinic during the pandemic. This helps employees to stop smoking while working from home. Of the approximately 300 employees who signed up more than 80% have succeeded in stopping smoking.\n\nMedical Exam and Screening Attendance Rates\n\n| Activities | GRI 403-6 |\n|------------|-----------|\n| General physical exam*1 | 93.2% |\n| Breast cancer screening*2 | 92.9% |\n| Uterine cancer screening*3 | 93.2% |\n| Stomach cancer screening*4 | 95.8% |\n| Intestinal cancer screening*4 | 96.8% |\n| Lung cancer screening*5 | 96.8% |\n\n*1 Men and women aged 35 and over\n*2 Women aged 30 and over\n*3 Women aged 25 and over\n*4 Men and women aged 30 and over\n*5 In fiscal 2016\u20132017, men and women aged 50 and over; from fiscal 2018, it changed to men and women aged 35 and over\n\nSmoking Rate Trend\n\n| Activities | GRI 403-6 |\n|------------|-----------|\n| (%) | |\n| 2016 | 32.0% |\n| 2017 | 31.5% |\n| 2018 | 30.9% |\n| 2019 | 29.8% |\n| 2020 | 28.4% |\n\nNote: Employees aged 35 and over (results of specific medical examinations)\n\nMeasures to Prevent Infectious Disease\n\nIn addition to measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we have been vaccinating employees against hepatitis A, tetanus, and cholera to prevent them from contracting infectious diseases during business travel outside Japan.\n\nIn Japan, the Health Insurance Society has established an incentive point system to reward influenza vaccine recipients, including employee family members, with the aim of preventing influenza outbreaks in the workplace. As an initiative to prevent catching influenza, we recommend employees get vaccinated before the flu season gets underway. The program is used by about 120,000 employees and their families every year.\n\nIn fiscal 2019 we introduced an incentive point system in cooperation with the Health Insurance Society to encourage applicable employees to receive an antibody test for and vaccination against measles and rubella\u2014both of which are now free of charge. This is part of our efforts in Japan to target male employees of the generation not covered by the national MR vaccination program as children.\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\nAs a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 while commuting and when in the office, we ask employees to check their temperature and physical condition before leaving for work, and to always stay home if they have a fever or feel unwell. We encourage the full implementation of the government\u2019s infection prevention guidelines. We have implemented full-scale infection prevention measures according to the type of work. This includes providing disinfectant and masks to employees engaged in the maintenance of social infrastructure. Hitachi has taken a whole range of other preventive measures such as mandatory mask wearing at all sites as well as thorough temperature checks and workplace disinfection based on the installation of thermal cameras, non-contact thermometers, and automatic sanitizer dispensers at building entrances. We have also spaced out seating in offices, employee cafeterias, and conference rooms, installed droplet blocking partitions, limited the number of passengers in elevators, suspended the use of smoking rooms and ensured physical distancing in common areas.\n\nHealth Promotion Initiatives for Employees and Their Families\nTo encourage healthy lifestyles among employees and their families, the Hitachi Health Insurance Society has established a portal site for individuals entitled My Health Web. By providing information on health exam results and a system of incentive points allowing employees to receive rewards for entering health-related activities, the site raises health awareness, helps employees understand the state of their own health, and offers a range of support for adopting a healthier lifestyle.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\nIn fiscal 2020, Hitachi added an online service that allows employees and their families to make appointments for medical examinations using My Health Web in order to encourage regular checkups. Further supporting health management during the pandemic, we launched the online \u201cAmabie Campaign\u201d that encouraged employees to record their daily health data such as body temperature and weight. The campaign ran for four months from May to August 2020, and about 30,000 people participated. This initiative continued even after the end of the campaign.\n\nHealth and Safety Considerations for Nuclear Businesses\nSince 2008, Hitachi has been working with the world\u2019s leading nuclear power plant vendors to develop voluntary, private principles of conduct covering the export of nuclear power plants and reactors. The Nuclear Power Plant and Reactor Exporters\u2019 Principles of Conduct were formally revealed on September 15, 2011. They were adopted by all involved in their development, and we have also indicated our adherence to them.\n\nRegarding our employees and other persons employed at nuclear sites under the Hitachi Group umbrella, we perform exposure management based on our internal management systems and perform evaluation of radiation damage (dose management).\n\nFor health management in particular, our management indicators for radiation exposure are stricter than those set by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. We monitor physical and mental health along with exposure doses even for employees of partner companies, and an occupational physician from Hitachi visits sites to perform examinations and offer health advice.\nHelping Employees in Japan Stay Healthy\n\nRemote counseling by occupational physicians\nEstablished remote counseling by occupational physicians and nurses as an early-response measure to address the mental and physical health concerns of long-term telecommuters.\n\nTips on staying healthy while working from home\nThe website provides advice for maintaining physical and mental health as well as contact information for health consultation providers. It provides information on ways to keep mentally and physically fit\u2014such as stress-coping strategies and simple, at-home exercises\u2014and links to career, family-health, and other counseling services.\n\nInbound Medical Assistance Services\nA 24-hour year-round call center offering medical assistance in 16 languages for foreign employees and their families in Japan, including referrals and appointments to medical facilities and arrangements for emergency transport and hospitalization, translation via telephone, and other services.\n\nLooking after infected employees\nMessages delivered by the CEOs of business units giving reassurances to infected individuals and raising awareness among their colleagues.\n\nSupporting the Mental Health of Employees Outside Japan\n\nEurope\n- Establishment of a mental health consultation service\n- EAP consultation services\n- Mental health workshops for managers and employees\n- Health resilience training\n- Providing information on mental health measures through in-house newsletters\n- Virtual sessions on topics such as team leadership while working from home as well as workstyles and work lifestyles to improve productivity, etc.\n\nUSA\n- EAP consultation services\n- Wellness programs (virtual yoga and wellness workshops)\n- Setting recommended dates for taking leave\n\nAsia\n- Virtual engagement activities (dialog between top management and employees, recreation, etc.)\n- Wellbeing programs (build mental resilience)\n- Structured 1-on-1 communications\n- Daily team communication and health status management by managers\n\nHitachi Group\u2019s General Policies in Response to COVID-19\n\nHitachi has been taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the health and safety of employees and their families globally across the Group.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. adopted a sweeping work-from-home policy in March 2020 and maintained a telecommuting rate of 70% during the state of emergencies in Japan. In addition to establishing in-house procedures to deal with infections among employees, we adhere to government guidelines for preventing the spread of infection. Should an employee test positive, we instruct everyone in the same workplace to stay home and monitor their health, and we also disinfect the workplace.\n\nWe are expanding our efforts to address a broad array of mental and physical health concerns among long-term telecommuters. For example, we provide remote healthcare counseling, offer tips on staying healthy while working from home, support foreign employees seeking medical services in Japan, and ensure the human rights of infected employees.\n\nHitachi Group companies outside Japan have also been supporting employee health during the pandemic. Their efforts include holding mental health workshops and providing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) consultation services.\nFreedom of Association and Collective Bargaining\n\nRespecting the Rights of Employees\n\nThe Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct call for the upholding of the fundamental rights of employees in line with the principles of the United Nations Global Compact.\n\nIn Japan, where labor unions are recognized, we espouse the three fundamental rights of labor unions (to organize, to bargain collectively, and to act collectively) as seen in the collective agreement between the CEO of Hitachi, Ltd. and the representative of the Hitachi Workers Union.\n\nThe Hitachi Workers Union membership*\u00b9 rate is approximately 97%, as of February 28, 2021.\n\n*\u00b9 Union members/All employees except managers who are not eligible to join the labor union.\n\nMutual Communication Between Employees and Management\n\nThe relationship between employees and management at Hitachi, Ltd. and Group companies in Japan is stable with healthy ongoing dialogue.\n\nAt Hitachi, Ltd., the Central Management Council, the Business Units Management Council, and the Business Sites Management Council work to enhance mutual communication between employees and management contributing to smooth management and business development and improving working conditions for union members.\n\nWe also hold quarterly Hitachi Group management meetings to share information and exchange views and opinions on Group business conditions among the Federation of Hitachi Group Workers Unions (FHGWU). Group companies outside Japan also actively pursue dialogue with individual labor unions and their representatives in accordance with the laws and regulations in each country and region to deepen mutual understanding of employee working conditions and treatment as well as business conditions.\n\nLabor Management Dialogue at Regional Headquarters in China and Europe\n\nHitachi China\n\nTo maintain good communication with employees, we hold management round-table meetings with labor unions to share information on corporate management conditions and issues. In fiscal 2020, the 21st meeting was held online.\n\nHitachi Europe\n\nSince 1996, our European labor-management meeting has been held every year as a place for senior management and employees to exchange opinions on the Group\u2019s business environment and strategies.\n\nNotification of Work-related Transfers and Reassignments\n\nThe collective agreement between Hitachi, Ltd. and the Hitachi Workers Union states that any transfer or reassignment of an employee for work-related reasons should adequately take into consideration the situation of the employee as well as requiring the company to promptly inform the Hitachi Workers Union of the decision. More specifically, in cases of large-scale transfers, reassignments, or moving the company will consult with the labor union regarding the basic issues involved.\n\nLabor-Management Cooperation toward improving Health and Safety Levels\n\nHitachi, Ltd. and the Hitachi Workers Union are dedicated to improving health and safety levels through employee-management cooperation. This includes signing a collective agreement on the promotion of, among other things, health and safety measures, a health and safety committee, education and training programs, and health checks for employees.\n\nThe committee works to ensure a healthy and safe work environment through their initiatives that include planning and tracking health and safety activities each year, reviewing their measures to prevent work-related injuries, and sharing information on whether employees have received their annual health check-ups.\nHitachi understands that respecting human rights in business activities is not only essential for corporate sustainable development but is also a responsibility that all companies must fulfill. In 2013, to clarify corporate responsibility with respect to human rights, we established the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy based on Hitachi\u2019s Corporate Credo and Group Vision and designated it one of the highest codes governing our internal regulations. Under the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, we pursue initiatives to ensure respect for human rights not just within Hitachi itself but for everyone in our supply chain or otherwise involved with our business activities, products, or services. As well as implementing global training and awareness-raising activities and establishing grievance mechanisms to address employee concerns throughout the Hitachi Group, in recent years we have focused on human rights due diligence (HRDD) working to construct frameworks and systems for recognizing and reducing human rights risks.\n\n**Respect for human rights throughout the value chain**\n\n- Ensuring awareness of Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy\n- Raising human rights awareness among executives and employees\n- Recognizing human rights risks and constructing frameworks and systems for reducing them through human rights due diligence (HRDD)\n- Raise human rights awareness among suppliers including issues involving child labor and forced labor\n\n**Policy and promotion structure**\n\n**Achievements in Fiscal 2020**\n\n- Consolidated general consultation and reporting systems (contact points) for harassment and human rights issues into the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline\n- Distributed a human rights message from the Executive Chairman & CEO on Human Rights Day\n- Carried out executive human rights training using external lecturers\n- Appointed a Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer (CDIO) to promote activities across the entire Hitachi Group\n- Established a project team to promote human rights due diligence (HRDD) at the headquarters of Hitachi, Ltd.\n- Created a priority risk questionnaire to evaluate measures being taken to prevent forced labor and migrant labor (for Hitachi Group companies and suppliers)\n- Conducted online CSR procurement briefing sessions for suppliers in China, Thailand, and other Asian countries.\nRespect for Human Rights Throughout the Value Chain\n\nHitachi Group Human Rights Policy\n\nHitachi believes that respecting human rights is its responsibility as a global company and indispensable in conducting business. To this end, in May 2013 we formulated the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy. The Senior Executive Committee reviewed and approved this policy, designating it one of the highest codes governing our internal regulations. During the formulation of the policy, Hitachi held stakeholder dialogues, and invited representatives from the European Commission, the International Labour Organization (ILO), NGOs, and external companies, as well as lawyers specializing in human rights issues, and the opinions and suggestions of these attendees are reflected in the final policy.\n\nIn the policy, we clarify our understanding of human rights as being, at a minimum, those outlined in the International Bill of Human Rights*1 and the ILO\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This policy shapes Hitachi\u2019s approach to meeting the responsibility to respect human rights including implementing human rights due diligence (HRDD)*2 in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This policy provides appropriate education to employees, adhering to laws and regulations in all the regions and countries where we operate, and seeking to honor the principles of international human rights standards and national laws.\n\nIn accordance with the policy, we use opportunities such as our e-learning program on human rights and messages from our Executive Chairman & CEO (and at that time also our president) Toshiaki Higashihara on Human Rights Day to continuously raise awareness among all employees. The policy is also included in the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines for our suppliers, and we strive, through a range of activities, to promote understanding among suppliers of our approach to human rights and ensure that they act in accordance with it.\n\n*1 International Bill of Human Rights: Collective name for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenants on Human Rights adopted by the United Nations.\n*2 Human rights due diligence (HRDD): An ongoing process to identify and assess potential and actual human rights negative impacts, take appropriate action to prevent or mitigate potential impacts, track the effectiveness of actions to address impacts, and communicate externally.\n\nHitachi Group Human Rights Policy\nDetails of the dialogue with stakeholders during the formulation of the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy\n\nRespect for the Rights of Children\n\nHitachi respects the rights of children as outlined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Children\u2019s Rights and Business Principles developed by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). We strive to eliminate child labor in the Group and its supply chains as specified in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct. We have also set forth in other relevant internal regulations our policy of respecting human rights including the rights of children.\n\nHitachi Group Codes of Conduct\n\nFramework for Human Rights\n\nHitachi, Ltd. has a Corporate Human Rights Promotion Committee to gauge the impact of business activities on human rights and to deliberate on mechanisms and policies for preventing human rights violations, thereby improving Group-wide human rights awareness. The executive officer in charge of human resources chairs this body, whose members include representatives from corporate divisions. From fiscal 2021, the framework changed and the Executive Sustainability Committee composed of Executive Chairman & CEO Higashihara and other members of the Senior Executive Committee and the heads of business units and corporate divisions will also deliberate on global human rights issues including HRDD.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. Framework for Promoting Respect for Human Rights (FY 2020)\nEstablishing a Global Grievance Mechanism\n\nIn April 2020, we consolidated the Hitachi Group\u2019s internal reporting systems into the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline. The hotline is provided through a third-party platform that supports dozens of languages. Consultations are available 24 hours a day through calling or online messaging. We merged the general consultation and reporting systems (contact points) for harassment and human rights issues at the business sites of each business unit and Group company into this hotline in fiscal 2020.\n\nThese efforts will clarify who to consult with on human rights issues, make it easier for employees and those working with us to access these services, and promote the Group-wide effort globally including a grievance mechanism, that helps Hitachi grasp and identify violations of human rights.\n\nRaising Human Rights Awareness Among Executives and Employees\n\nHitachi conducts regular group training and seminars and uses videos to educate employees at each business site and Group company. As of fiscal 2020, the target is for each employee to attend one session every year instead of the previous target of once every three years. In fiscal 2020, the approximate participation rate was 86.3% at Hitachi, Ltd. and 78.3% at Group companies in Japan. Through various other training and awareness-raising activities such as onboarding education for new employees and training for job positions, we are also communicating to our employees the importance of respecting human rights in each of their roles.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nAs part of the fiscal 2020 human rights training for executive officers at Hitachi, Ltd., attorney Yoshikiko Matak\u00e9 of the firm Nagashima Ohno & Tsunematsu gave a lecture entitled \u201cLatest Trends in Legal and Compliance concerning Business and Human Rights.\u201d\n\nIn addition to corporate scandals, which have been frequent in recent years, the guest lecturer talked about the human rights risks faced by global companies, the importance of HRDD as a prevention measure, and the latest trends in human rights legislation, especially in Europe. Mr. Matak\u00e9 suggested that companywide cooperation is necessary to identify inherent business risks and to effectively implement due diligence concerning business partners. He also stressed the necessity for executive-level commitment and leadership.\n\nIn Japan, where a revised labor law designed to prevent power harassment took effect in June 2020, we are raising awareness of the issue of harassment through seminars for executives and workplace discussion sessions for all employees as well as training for different levels and employees transferred abroad.\n\nHuman Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) Initiatives\n\nIn our Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, we pledged to develop mechanisms for and to continue the implementation of HRDD. We are working to improve our business processes. For example, our CSR procurement guidelines reflect the results of HRDD risk assessments performed in our procurement divisions.\n\nWe analyzed and reassessed a wide variety of information including the results of our HRDD to date; human rights issues specified in Hitachi\u2019s codes and guidelines; information, advice, and inquiries from non-governmental organizations, the media, and experts; assessments of corporate efforts concerning international initiatives; and the results of self-checks by suppliers and Group companies. Taking these results into account, we have identified forced labor and migrant labor as a priority risk for the Hitachi Group and this is now being addressed Group-wide. Forced labor and migrant labor are issues of high concern that are increasingly the subject of legislation around the world.\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nDevelopment of Systems to Promote HRDD\n\nThe position of chief diversity & inclusion officer (CDIO) has been established for the Hitachi Group. We have also set up a project team at the Hitachi, Ltd. headquarters to promote HRDD. It is composed of members from the human resources, procurement, and CSR divisions. The project team holds regular meetings to investigate HRDD measures for the Hitachi Group and its suppliers. It also prepares relevant internal manuals, and responds to inquiries from business units and Group companies.\n\nIn order to carry out HRDD specific to each business area of the Hitachi Group, HRDD promotion committees were set up and persons responsible for promoting and implementing HRDD were appointed in each business unit and major Group company. We are developing a system to enhance human rights risk management while taking into account the characteristics of each business and value chain.\n\nResults of HRDD Activities\n\nThe Hitachi Group prepared a priority risk questionnaire (about 30 questions in total) to evaluate the situation within the Group and at its suppliers regarding forced labor and migrant labor which have been defined as Group-wide priority risks. In preparation for this survey, Hitachi obtained a review from a non-governmental organization, The Global Alliance for Sustainable Supply Chain (ASSC). The ASSC also provided advice concerning the questionnaire content and consistency with global industries and international standards such as those of the ILO. The purpose of this questionnaire is not only to ascertain the level of human rights compliance efforts, but also to promote continuous improvement by investigating and implementing corrections and measures based on the evaluation results from each BU or Group company.\n\nHitachi has also created a Human Rights Risk Management Implementation Manual. It complements the guidelines for implementing HRDD prepared in 2014 and enables the guidelines to be applied more effectively in the operations of our business units and Group companies. The manual was reviewed by the nonprofit organization Shift. It provided advice on its consistency with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and on the explanations in the manual for each step of the HRDD process. Shift also delivered lectures to Hitachi business units and Group companies on the latest developments concerning business and human rights, and on the importance of HRDD.\n\nImplementation Status of HRDD\n\n| Initiatives | FY 2013 | FY 2014 | FY 2015 | FY 2016 | FY 2017 | FY 2018 | FY 2019 | FY 2020 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Implemented HRDD pilot programs at certain Group companies and analyzed and evaluated human rights risks in six ASEAN countries with the support of the nonprofit organizations Shift and Business for Social Responsibility (BSR). | | | | | | | | |\n| Developed a document with guidelines for implementing HRDD in collaboration with Shift | | | | | | | | |\n| Initiated HRDD in procurement divisions under the guidance of Shift.

Created a questionnaire on Group-wide priority risks (forced labor and migrant labor) with the support of the nonprofit organization ASSC and used it within the Hitachi Group. Prepared a Human Rights Risk Management Implementation Manual with the help of Shift. | | | | | | | | |\nThe Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct clearly express Hitachi\u2019s firm stance against the use of child labor or forced labor either in Group companies or in our supply chain. Recognizing the growing risks of forced labor amid the ongoing globalization of business, Hitachi also developed an e-learning program for all Group executives and employees on the subject of human rights. The program draws on specific case studies to convey the importance of preventing forced labor and human trafficking problems before they occur.\n\nHitachi\u2019s CSR procurement guidelines for suppliers also clearly forbid the use of child labor or forced labor. As part of our efforts to raise awareness in our supply chain, we distributed these guidelines to tier 1 suppliers and conducted CSR procurement seminars in China and Thailand.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Hitachi Group prepared a questionnaire concerning forced labor and migrant labor, which were defined as Group-wide priority risks. In fiscal 2021, we will use this questionnaire to evaluate the progress of this initiative within the Hitachi Group and we also plan to survey suppliers.\n\n### Addressing the Risks of Child Labor and Forced Labor\n\n#### Activities\n\n- **Human Rights Awareness Initiatives Targeting Suppliers and Procurement Personnel**\n\n| Year | Target | Initiatives |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n| FY 2016 | Employees responsible for procurement and human resources in Southeast Asia | Held a four-part webinar series led by speakers from NGOs and businesses implementing advanced countermeasures |\n| | Suppliers in China | Held CSR procurement seminars to explain the Hitachi Group\u2019s CSR activities and respect for human rights |\n| FY 2017 | Suppliers in Malaysia | Conducted on-site visits and interviews regarding the working and living conditions of migrant laborers, who are considered at high risk of bonded labor and other issues |\n| | Suppliers in China | Held CSR procurement seminars to explain the SDGs and other recent sustainability trends, as well as how environmental and labor issues, including human rights, are linked to business risks |\n| FY 2018 | European Group companies | Procurement personnel from European Group companies formed the Responsible Supply Chain Working Group |\n| | Suppliers in China | Held CSR procurement seminars to explain Hitachi Group CSR policies and activities as well as the severity of human rights risks |\n| FY 2019 | European Group companies | Created a webinar titled \u201cImplementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\u201d for procurement personnel in the working group mentioned above |\n| | Suppliers in Thailand | Held CSR procurement seminars to explain forced labor by providing case studies |\n| FY 2020 | European Group companies | Introduced human rights risk analysis into the selection of suppliers which should receive Supplier Assessment Questionnaires (CSR self-checklists). The above-mentioned working group discussed the self-check results under the guidance of SHR and explained the situation regarding the development of due diligence legislation in Europe |\n| | Suppliers in China, Thailand, and other Asian countries | Used e-learning to explain CSR measures to suppliers in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. For suppliers in other parts of Asia CSR briefing webinars were held. By sharing the results of supplier CSR monitoring activities in the region we raised supplier awareness thereby helping each company to enhance its CSR activities |\nResponse to Technical Intern Training Program\n\nIssues\n\nIn 2018, the Organization for Technical Intern Training, a legal entity whose establishment was approved by competent ministers conducted on-site inspections at Hitachi, Ltd. and 11 Group companies. These inspections identified violations of the Act on Proper Technical Intern Training and Protection of Technical Intern Trainees, and the relevant companies were provided with recommendations for improvement regarding intern training. Additionally, in September 2019, Hitachi, Ltd. received an order for improvement from the Immigration Services Agency of Japan and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare regarding the construction of its systems for carrying out proper technical intern training according to authorized plans.\n\nThe companies subject to the improvement recommendations and orders submitted reports to Japan\u2019s Organization for Technical Intern Training by October 2019. They stated that relevant improvements had been completed, and the reports were accepted. We have taken further strict measures to ensure that no further violation will take place throughout the entire Group. In March 2020, we implemented Group-wide policies, guidelines, and check systems for technical intern training according to authorized plans.\n\nThe companies subject to the improvement recommendations and orders submitted reports to Japan\u2019s Organization for Technical Intern Training by October 2019. They stated that relevant improvements had been completed, and the reports were accepted. We have taken further strict measures to ensure that no further violation will take place throughout the entire Group. In March 2020, we implemented Group-wide policies, guidelines, and check systems for technical intern training according to authorized plans.\n\nWe continue to strive to carry out appropriate technical intern training in accordance with relevant laws and the aims of the Technical Intern Training Program and with due consideration for human rights on the basis of the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy.\n\nResponse to Concerns over Uyghur Labor\n\nIn March 2020, a report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute indicated that one of Hitachi\u2019s suppliers may be using Uyghur forced labor in China.\n\nWe conducted a social compliance review via a third-party based on international standards to review the supplier\u2019s management system, specifically looking at how employees were managed, given the allegations stated in the report. We found nothing to support allegations of forced labor. Through various forms of engagement the Hitachi Group will continue its efforts to respect the human rights of its workers including those employed by suppliers.\nValue Chain Management\n\nWhy\n\nAs businesses become more globalized, procurement risk is also increasing in supply chains. That is why the Hitachi Group is going beyond mere supply chain risk management to pursue sustainable procurement instead. We recognize that we must actively work with our suppliers to improve social, environmental, and economic value for our customers. Specifically, we thoroughly screen new suppliers based on the Hitachi Group Global Procurement Code and implement sustainable procurement by conducting CSR monitoring and audits at suppliers. Going forward, we will be working with suppliers to achieve carbon neutrality throughout our value chain.\n\nHitachi was founded on the principles of \u201cHarmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit.\u201d We ensure product quality and safety by adhering to these principles, along with the basics and ethics, and by putting right and wrong before profit and loss. All employees embrace our policy of making quality and reliability a top priority, and this strengthens our quality assurance activities. By continuing to provide high-quality, thoroughly safe products, Hitachi will maintain the trust of customers and society.\n\nWhat\n\n- Strengthening global partnerships\n- Sharing responsible procurement policies with suppliers\n- Improving support for sustainable procurement including CSR monitoring, audits, and procurement briefings for suppliers\n- Responsible mineral procurement measures\n\nHow\n\nPositioning the Hitachi Group Global Procurement Code as the highest code, Hitachi promotes sustainable procurement based on Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines and other accompanying guidelines. We are also working to ensure sustainable procurement for the entire Hitachi Group. This is done under the guidance of the Hitachi Group CSR/BCP Procurement Committee which is made up of representatives from the business units (BUs), CSR/BCP Procurement Committees at major Group companies, and the Value Integration Division which reports directly to the president. In fiscal 2021, the committee made a new start as the Sustainable Procurement Council.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\n- Continued distributing the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guideline to suppliers\n- Implemented CSR monitoring for suppliers using check sheets (Target: 271 suppliers)\n- Conducted CSR audits in China and other Asian countries (Target: 27 suppliers)\n- Prepared a questionnaire on forced labor and migrant labor to help manage human rights risks\n- Explained Hitachi Group CSR measures using e-learning, and held CSR Seminar for Suppliers (Target: 450 suppliers)\n- Continued surveys on supply chains and the countries of mineral origin using the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT)\n### Quality and Product Safety Management\n\n- Practicing our policy of making quality and reliability a top priority\n- Adhering to basics and ethics, and putting right and wrong before profit and loss\n\n### Customer Satisfaction\n\n- Improving CS by reflecting customers\u2019 voices in our business\n- Digital marketing that is always based on personal information protection rules\n- Promoting advertising activities\n- Providing comprehensive customer support online\n- Improving CS in home appliances\n\n### Policy and promotion structure\n\n#### What we are doing\n\n- We are promoting quality and safety as part of the Hitachi Group Code of Conduct, and our basic quality assurance principles are outlined in the relevant section of the company rules. In order to thoroughly promote quality governance, we are strengthening our promotion structure to put the safety and security of our customers first. This is being achieved by making the quality assurance departments of Hitachi business units and Group companies independent from the business divisions.\n\n#### How we are doing it\n\n| Policy and promotion structure | Achievements in Fiscal 2020 |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                               | Strengthened customer satisfaction (CS) and organizational structure for quality assurance |\n|                               | Carried out technical law compliance activities |\n|                               | Promoted product safety activities |\n|                               | Promoted quality assurance activities globally |\n|                               | Conducted quality and reliability education |\n\n#### Achievements in Fiscal 2020\n\n- Strengthened customer satisfaction (CS) and organizational structure for quality assurance\n- Carried out technical law compliance activities\n- Promoted product safety activities\n- Promoted quality assurance activities globally\n- Conducted quality and reliability education\n\n### Policy and promotion structure\n\n- Dedicated account managers serve as gateways for corporate customers to deal with Hitachi Group companies in Japan. The entire Group works with these managers to build even closer relationships with clients and to improve customer satisfaction (CS).\n\n#### Achievements in Fiscal 2020\n\n- Held seminars and forums to improve CS\n- Promoted communication activities based on our Advertisement Guidelines and Social Media Policy\n- Website inquiries to comprehensive customer support: 5,220\n- Conducted a customer satisfaction survey using the Evaluation Survey for Customer Repair Services (Satisfaction rate: 94.6%)\nResponsible Procurement\n\nBasic Procurement Guidelines\n\nThe Hitachi Group attaches great importance to conduct sustainable business (ESG) for increasing the values of environmental, social, and economic goals. In our value chains, we also believe that developing our business with sustainability will lead to prosperity for suppliers and the Hitachi Group. Amid rising risks as businesses globalize, to proactively avoid risks inherent in the supply chains, we are taking steps to reinforce risk identification and management. In addition, we are addressing the sustainable procurement initiatives with suppliers to increase environmental, social, and economic value.\n\nIn April 2019, Hitachi instituted the Hitachi Group Global Procurement Code. Based on the framework of our sustainable procurement, this is our highest code for procurement activities. It calls on Group companies and suppliers to give due consideration to human rights, labor practices, safety, ethics, quality, and security in the supply chain. All Group companies follow the code, and we share global supply chain issues within the Group as we engage in procurement activities. Suppliers are also selected strictly in accordance with the code\u2019s provisions.\n\nProcurement activities are also carried out according to the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines, which are based on the results of human rights due diligence (HRDD) performed by procurement divisions and globally recognized standards. We reviewed the guidelines in fiscal 2021 and produced a revision retitled the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines.\n\nWe will also revise all our policies and procedures regularly in the future to ensure that they always reflect global demands regarding corporate supply chain management.\n\nSustainable Procurement Management Framework\n\nWith the global expansion of Hitachi\u2019s business, Hitachi places great importance on the promotion of sustainable management (ESG) in order to improve environmental, social, and economic value throughout the supply chain, and it engages in discussions at all procurement conferences and meetings.\n\nCSR supply chain management, responsible minerals procurement, and green procurement policies and initiatives are discussed within Hitachi\u2019s Value Integration Division, which reports directly to the president of Hitachi, Ltd. Policies and initiatives adopted after this discussion are shared throughout the Group through the Hitachi Group CSR/BCP Procurement Committee, which includes CSR/BCP Procurement Committees members from business units and key Group companies.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, in order to strengthen the sustainable procurement management framework, Hitachi, Ltd. decided to rename and redefine the Hitachi Group CSR/BCP Procurement Committee. This was done based on a multi-faceted discussion of the Group\u2019s management system for enhancing sustainable procurement. As of fiscal 2021, the committee has established the Sustainable Procurement Council. The committee members consist of the heads of procurement divisions at business units and major Group companies.\n\nThe members will investigate and share strategies for improving ESG value, while enabling procurement divisions to further improve supply chain management.\nStrengthening Global Partnerships\n\nA key element of the Hitachi Group Vision is to strengthen our partnerships with suppliers. In order to promote procurement based on local production for local consumption in line with our business policy of international expansion, we have appointed procurement officers to oversee local procurement in China, the rest of Asia, Europe, and the Americas. These officers carry out activities such as CSR audits, CSR monitoring (self-checks), and CSR Seminar for Suppliers in their respective regions to strengthen sustainable procurement.\n\nLocal procurement officers in China are also responsible for addressing environmental risks in China. Through the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, an environmental NGO, the officers obtain information about polluting enterprises made public by China\u2019s central and regional government bodies. They use this information not only for screening businesses which have transactions with these enterprises but also for urging the enterprises themselves to make improvements.\n\nSharing Responsible Procurement Policies with Suppliers\n\nTo share procurement policies with the approximately 30,000 suppliers of Hitachi business units and Group companies, Hitachi, Ltd. is undertaking the following initiatives.\n\nDistributing the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines\n\nTo ensure that the guidelines are strictly followed, Hitachi, Ltd. makes them available in Japanese, English, Chinese, and Thai and distributes them to approximately 30,000 suppliers around the world. We also request acknowledgment in writing by suppliers that they understand them. We reviewed the guidelines in fiscal 2021 and produced a revision retitled the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines.\nSharing Our Green Procurement Policies and Related Initiatives\n\nWe distribute guidelines that define our basic position on procuring environmentally friendly parts and products as well as our requirements of suppliers.\n\nThe guidelines set out requirements, such as establishing environmental management and recommending obtaining environmental certificates. They also include environmental conservation\u2014reducing the impact of products supplied to Hitachi, such as conserving resources and energy, recycling, managing chemical substances in products, and fully disclosing related information.\n\nTo address the issue of chemical substances in products, we recommend using chemSHERPA*\u00b9 CI/AI, a standardized format for communicating information on chemical substances in products throughout the supply chain.\n\nAlso, as an initiative aimed at realizing carbon neutrality, we plan to request that 70% of our suppliers (based on the total amount of our transactions and does not include publicly listed subsidiaries) have CO\u2082 reduction plans.\n\n*\u00b9 chemSHERPA: Developed by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to facilitate the management of chemical substances in products by creating a standardized format throughout the supply chain. The chemSHERPA-CI standard is applicable to chemical substances contained in chemical products and chemSHERPA-AI to those contained in molded products.\n\nHitachi considers the development of business with an emphasis on sustainability to be an activity that will lead to mutual prosperity for the Hitachi Group as well as our suppliers. Based on this philosophy, we engage in CSR monitoring, CSR audits, and CSR Seminar for Suppliers to promote and implement sustainable procurement.\n\nCSR Monitoring (Self-Checks)\n\nWe ask key suppliers to conduct CSR monitoring (self-checks) using checklists based on the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines. After collecting and analyzing the results, we provide feedback for related business operations to suppliers, and then work with those involved in the operations to resolve issues related to the suppliers.\n\nWe are also reinforcing our onboarding procedures for new suppliers in Japan, including providing them with the guidelines and asking them to complete a checklist. In fiscal 2020, the Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) Promotion Project Team established at the headquarters of Hitachi, Ltd. created a questionnaire concerning the use of forced labor and immigrant labor. This issue has been defined as a human rights risk that the entire Hitachi Group must address. In fiscal 2021, the Group will require suppliers to take the questionnaire, and will strive to ascertain the actual risk situations at suppliers. We want to help suppliers improve their efforts in this area, including addressing any human rights issues they may have.\n\nImplementation of CSR Audits\n\nHitachi, Ltd. has been auditing the manufacturing bases of its and Group companies\u2019 suppliers in China and the rest of Asia. For these audits, we engaged external evaluators such as the experienced CSR auditing company Intertek Certification.*\u00b9 Our audits are based on the international SA8000 certification standard developed by Social Accountability International (SAI), an American CSR evaluation institution. These audits investigate our workplace practices, and an Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)-recognized auditor checks suppliers\u2019 CSR initiatives from the perspectives of labor and human rights, health and safety, the environment, and ethics. Suppliers needing improvement were requested to submit improvement action plans, and Hitachi, Ltd., together with Group companies, will work with and advise the suppliers until they complete the planned improvements.\n\n*\u00b9 Intertek Certification: With a presence in over 100 countries across the globe, the Intertek Group provides a wide array of certification services in every industrial field.\nResponse to the Conflict Mineral Issue\n\nIn fiscal 2013, Hitachi formulated its Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy, declaring its stance and commitments regarding conflict minerals. The policy was revised in fiscal 2016 to explicitly lay out measures to be implemented to ensure responsible procurement. Expanding the scope of corporate responsibilities for the procurement of minerals is a global trend, with companies increasingly expected to address the overall risks to human rights as well as conflict risks, and recognize responsibilities that extend beyond the countries adjoining the Democratic Republic of the Congo to a wider area where the risks are high. In consideration of this, in fiscal 2021 we revised this policy to formulate the Hitachi Group\u2019s policy the Responsibility Supply Chain of Minerals.\n\nSales divisions, business groups, plants, procurement divisions, and other divisions within individual business units and Hitachi Group companies work together to respond to investigation requests and inquiries relating to conflict minerals. We also strive to grasp developments in conflict\n\n---\n\n**Violations in Fiscal 2020**\n\nIn fiscal 2020, audits were conducted of 27 suppliers in China and the rest of Asia. Though there were no significant violations, the following minor problems were identified with some suppliers, which were accordingly asked to remedy the issues.\n\n- Failure to comply with legal working hours including overtime: 18 suppliers\n- Failure to provide sufficient emergency exits, or to provide or repair exit signage: 27 cases\n- Failure to provide appropriate discharge methods for wastewater/exhaust gases from production processes: 7 suppliers\n\n**Hold CSR Seminar for Suppliers**\n\nIn order to share the philosophy of Hitachi among our suppliers, we provide suppliers directly with information. Specifically, we hold a CSR Seminar for Suppliers for Hitachi Group\u2019s suppliers in China and the rest of Asia.\n\n**Activities in Fiscal 2020**\n\nIn fiscal 2020, in consideration of factors including travel restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we decided to use e-learning to explain the Hitachi Group\u2019s CSR policies to suppliers in China rather than holding a face-to-face seminar. For suppliers elsewhere in Asia, we held a webinar on CSR which was attended by 84 participants from 78 companies. In the webinar, we showed Group-wide CSR procurement activities and CSR-related initiatives and indicated CSR monitoring results (as averages) for suppliers in Asia, separated by category, to raise awareness with the aim of strengthening each company\u2019s CSR activities in the future.\n\nThrough this meeting, we received feedback such as \u201cI would like to share information on CSR policies from companies other than Hitachi,\u201d and \u201cI would like to discuss what we should do to help CSR culture take root in our company.\u201d We believe that the webinar helped participants deepen their understanding of our efforts on CSR and green procurement activities. Also, in a survey we conducted following the webinar, we received an 88% approval rating regarding the online format and a 97% approval rating regarding the content of Hitachi\u2019s CSR monitoring questionnaires.\n\n**Increasing Green Purchasing of Office Supplies**\n\nHitachi is improving our green purchasing rate*\u00b9 by using a Group-wide online procurement system called the E-sourcing Mall. This system has a range of environmentally friendly products and promotes procurement by clearly labeling these products. In fiscal 2020, our green purchasing rate reached 83%.\n\n*\u00b9 Green purchasing rate: The percentage, by monetary value, of products with the Eco Mark among all products purchased subject to the Act on Promoting Green Procurement.\n\n**Response to the Conflict Mineral Issue**\n\nIn fiscal 2013, Hitachi formulated its Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy, declaring its stance and commitments regarding conflict minerals. The policy was revised in fiscal 2016 to explicitly lay out measures to be implemented to ensure responsible procurement. Expanding the scope of corporate responsibilities for the procurement of minerals is a global trend, with companies increasingly expected to address the overall risks to human rights as well as conflict risks, and recognize responsibilities that extend beyond the countries adjoining the Democratic Republic of the Congo to a wider area where the risks are high. In consideration of this, in fiscal 2021 we revised this policy to formulate the Hitachi Group\u2019s policy the Responsibility Supply Chain of Minerals.\n\nSales divisions, business groups, plants, procurement divisions, and other divisions within individual business units and Hitachi Group companies work together to respond to investigation requests and inquiries relating to conflict minerals. We also strive to grasp developments in conflict\nmineral-related laws and regulations in each country and region and what global society demands of enterprises, and work to share information within the Group.\n\nEach Hitachi business unit and Group company investigates its use of conflict minerals and reports the results to customers when requested. Supply chain investigations are carried out with the cooperation of the relevant entities\u2019 sales, procurement, and CSR divisions. In addition, Hitachi, Ltd., a member of the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA)\u2019s Responsible Minerals Trade Working Group, has been addressing the issues of conflict minerals with other members of the association.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we checked on the investigation and reply results on Hitachi, Ltd. and key Group companies through January to December 2019. As a result, we have noticed that Hitachi, Ltd. and three key Group companies (Hitachi Metals, Hitachi High-Technologies, and Hitachi Astemo) performed investigations and replied to a total of 1,645 requests from customers.\n\nHitachi Group\u2019s Policy for the Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals\n\nThe Hitachi Group is committed to responsible procurement activities as its policy to ensure that the procurement of materials containing conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) and cobalt does not encourage the activities of armed groups, human rights violations including child labor, corruption, and environmental destruction in the conflict and high-risk regions.\n\nThe Group also respects the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas and conducts more detailed investigations based on the Guidance while understanding social issues and the expected roles of companies in the regions.\n\nFor its suppliers, the Group will continue to inquire into their minerals\u2019 country of origin and supply chains using the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) issued by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), and request its suppliers to procure minerals from smelters certified under RMI\u2019s Responsible Minerals Assurance Program (RMAP).\nQuality and Product Safety Management\n\nHitachi\u2019s Approach to Quality Assurance Activities\n\n**Approach**\n\nAs stipulated in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, we aim to meet customer needs and specifications when providing products and services. We strive to ensure quality and safety by setting independent standards as necessary, in addition to complying with all relevant laws and standards. The Quality Assurance Standards in our corporate regulations also set out our basic principles for quality assurance. Embracing the Hitachi Founding Spirit of \u201cHarmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit,\u201d we adhere to basics and ethics and put right and wrong before profits and losses, with all employees sharing our policy of prioritizing quality and reliability above all else. We are strengthening the organization and management, technology, and human capital aspects of our quality assurance activities in every process\u2014from planning and development to design, manufacturing, testing, delivery, and maintenance. Furthermore, under our approach of making prevention the duty of quality assurance, we are strengthening beyond reoccurrence prevention and striving toward preventing incidents from occurring in the first place.\n\nOur unique practice of OCHIBO-HIROI, which means \u201cgleaning\u201d in English, involves analyzing and learning from failure to further develop our technologies. When an incident occurs, we not only investigate the technical causes but also thoroughly discuss the process, framework, and motivating factors leading up to the occurrence, along with ways to prevent reoccurrences, in order to improve our product reliability and customer satisfaction.\n\n**Framework for Quality Assurance and Quality Assurance Activities**\n\n**Product Safety Activities**\n\n- Ensure safety by reducing risks through design (fundamental safety design), protective measures (safeguards), and usage information (such as user instruction manuals).\n- Conduct risk assessments from a wide perspective in collaboration with related business units and research laboratories.\n- Make the safety of our customers\u2019 life, health, and property the top priority in product development and verify safety at every step, from development and production to sales and maintenance.\n- Use the Guide for Preparing User Instruction Manuals to improve risk communication with our customers.\n\n**Global Quality Assurance Activities**\n\n- The Hitachi Group is building a worldwide quality assurance system by globally deploying Hitachi\u2019s basic principles of quality assurance along with its Quality Assurance Standards. We are receiving accident reports from Group companies outside Japan, and as in Japan, we are also establishing international quality assurance reporting lines that are independent of the business divisions, as well as practicing OCHIBO-HIROI. Through these activities, we promote the establishment of a global quality assurance framework.\nResponding to Product Incidents\n\nWhen a product incident occurs, the division responsible acts swiftly to resolve the problem. In the case of a severe incident, we report to government agencies in line with legal requirements and disclose information about the incident to customers on our website and through other communication channels. At the same time, we ensure a status report is promptly submitted to top management, ensuring fast and appropriate action at all companies across the Group.\n\nIn the case we determine that retroactive action is necessary, we notify customers via newspaper advertising and websites in order to carry out the necessary repair or replacement program.\n\nQuality and Reliability Education\n\nWe conduct field-specific technical lectures for engineers engaged in MONOZUKURI (craftsmanship) at a range of levels from basic to expert.\n\nEach business unit also conducts specialized technical courses regarding manufacturing, quality assurance, and maintenance at their quality assurance training centers.\nCustomer Satisfaction\n\nStructure for Reflecting Customers\u2019 Voices\n\nThe sales and marketing divisions at Hitachi, Ltd. use customer input in developing management, product, and solution strategies. We identify key customers who will help grow our business, then assign an account manager to each one. These account managers serve as customers\u2019 \u201cportals\u201d into Hitachi Group companies in Japan, and the whole Group works with them to build closer relationships with customers, including the following initiatives for improving customer satisfaction (CS).\n\nDigital Marketing\n\nBased on strict personal information protection rules, Hitachi collects and analyzes customer information acquired from participants in various online seminars and events, and from website browsing history data. Our digital marketing activities are used for product development, improvement of customer service, and sales promotion activities linked with a sales support system (SFA).\n\nInitiatives for Improving CS\n\n| Initiative | Location | Outline |\n|------------|----------|---------|\n| Executive seminars | Headquarters and branches in Japan | Engage in direct dialogue with customers to learn their expectations of Hitachi and opinions about product strategies, and use this knowledge to create sales activity proposals based on customer needs |\n| Hitachi Social Innovation Forum | Global | Accelerate collaborative creation with customers in Hitachi\u2019s Social Innovation Business |\n| Technology Community program | R&D sites in Japan | Create opportunities for researchers to speak directly with customers and contribute to collaborative creation of new businesses based on customer needs and Hitachi technology |\n\nAdvertising Activities\n\nBecause Hitachi, Ltd. believes that advertising activities must show proper consideration for society as a whole as well as complying with laws and regulations, it has established a set of Advertisement Guidelines which are followed and updated in line with social developments.\n\nTo ensure that these guidelines are strictly followed at all business locations globally even where languages and customs may vary an Advertising Material Checklist is included. All items on the checklist are confirmed when creating advertisements.\n\nWhen conducting communications and promotional activities on social media channels, we abide by the Hitachi Social Media Policy to not only protect our brand but also avoid violating the rights of others. It stipulates our policies for social media use and specific promotional methods.\n\nTo raise awareness of this policy among members of the company, we carry out e-learning activities in Japanese, English, and Chinese about the use of social media and addressing associated risks.\n\nProviding Customer Support Online\n\nHitachi offers comprehensive global customer support on its website to respond to customer inquiries, opinions, requests, and complaints.\n\nWe also conduct training courses like our Web Inquiry Responsiveness Improvement Course to improve our...\nhandling of these inquiries. The course has been held since fiscal 2009. Going forward, we will continue to utilize our websites as important ways to communicate with our customers. The Hitachi Group will work to strengthen and improve cooperation among its member companies in order to respond more quickly and accurately.\n\nImproving CS in Home Appliances\n\nThe Home Appliances Customer Satisfaction Division provides services and solutions to improve the quality of life for people of all ages and regions.

Additionally, 39,982 Hitachi Group employees (around 11% of the total, a 54% decrease compared to the previous fiscal year) participated in social contribution activities.\n\nGuided by our vision of \u201cNurturing People, Connecting to the Future,\u201d we are working to develop a wide range of social contribution activities worldwide, including volunteer and pro bono work. In fiscal 2021, we have also introduced a new social contribution scheme in which employees and the company work together to make donations.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nSocial contribution activity funding and number of participating employees\n\nProvide STEAM education\n\nSupport through the Hitachi Foundation\n\nProvide support related to COVID-19\n\nProvided US$1 million to support business owners impacted by COVID-19 through loans by the nonprofit organization Kiva\n\nDonated about 50 million yen to the Japan Committee for UNICEF and charitable institutions in India, and provided 500 oxygen concentrators (worth approx. 30 million yen) to Hitachi Group companies in India.\nSocial Contribution Activities\n\nPolicy on Social Contribution Activities\n\nIn order to achieve the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, Hitachi is committed to creating social and environmental value through the Social Innovation Business. At the same time, we are actively promoting social contribution activities in regions where we operate, conscious of the fact that these activities will help create social and environmental value as well as contributing to the sustainable development of both society and business. In fiscal 2019, we reviewed our policy on social contribution activities based on the belief that we, as a company aiming to resolve social issues through innovation, have an important mission to foster not only our human capital but also those who will contribute to society centered on the field of science and technology. We also provide our employees with opportunities to actively volunteer their time in response to the needs and challenges of local communities, as well as supporting those communities through donations and pro bono activities. We believe this is essential in forging good relationships with local communities and growing together with them as a good corporate citizen.\n\nFunding for Social Contribution Activities\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Hitachi and The Hitachi Global Foundation provided over 1.9 billion yen in funding toward social contribution activities worldwide, including initiatives to cultivate a talented younger generation and financial donations and other support for disaster-struck areas. Additionally, while a cumulative total of 39,982 Hitachi Group employees (around 11% of total employees) participated in social contribution activities, the number amounted to less than half of the previous fiscal year's total due to the worldwide spread of COVID-19.\n\nHitachi Group employees are contributing to society through community-based activities in various forms and areas, such as cleaning up around our business sites, visiting and donating goods to welfare facilities, and participating in charity events. Many employees make full use of their knowledge and skills acquired through work to contribute to society, such as running workshops for schoolchildren on a wide range of themes, from science and the environment to career education, and implementing programs aimed to support non-profit organizations through pro bono activities.\nHitachi promotes human development activities centered on fostering the next-generation of human capital as a priority area for social contribution activities. We are actively working on a wide range of issues at global and local community levels and implementing programs to support development of next-generation leaders and science and engineering human capital.\n\nThe cultivation of talented IT professionals in particular is a global challenge amid the rapid development of IT using AI and big data. In recent years, we have therefore been focusing on activities related to STEAM education, which has gained attention as a tool for fostering human capital capable of utilizing cutting-edge technologies to enhance their creativity, expressivity, and problem-solving skills.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, many social contribution activities were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic while some were moved online. Hitachi also provided support for business owners, researchers, and medical professionals.\n\n### Specific Examples of Social Contribution Activities\n\n#### Activities\n\n- Engineering education to develop future engineers in the United Kingdom\n- Activities to support online science education with electron microscopes in Republic of Singapore\n- Pro bono activities to help create a world free of hunger\n- Online workshop as part of the career education for a junior high school\n- Hitachi scholarship program for the Asian University for Woman\n- Hitachi Young Leaders Initiative\n- Providing lecturers for The Hitachi Global Foundation\u2019s Hitachi Future Innovator Program\n- Providing science workshops for elementary schools as part of the ecosystem\n- Sato-umi activities\n- Support for environmental education programs targeting young people\n\n#### Specific Examples of Social Contributions\n\n- **Hitachi, Ltd.**\n  - Hitachi High-Tech\n  - Hitachi Asia\n  - Hitachi Consulting\n  - Hitachi, Ltd.\n  - Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi Asia Ltd\n  - Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi Group\n  - Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi Construction Machinery Southern Africa\n  - Some Hitachi Group companies\n\n---\n\n**Notes:** The examples include activities that were suspended in 2020 due to the spread of COVID-19 infection.\nIntroducing a New Social Contribution Scheme Enabling Hitachi and Its Employees to Make Donations Together\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the Hitachi Group introduced a social contribution scheme through which donations made by employees in response to disasters, accidents, disease outbreaks and so on will be matched by the Group in full. This scheme will serve to provide support for employees who proactively engage in social contribution efforts by selecting donation recipients experiencing social issues in multiple numbers and across multiple countries. Participating in social contribution activities together with our employees in this way will serve to increase employee engagement as well as promote the embodiment of the Hitachi Group corporate credo and further solidify the Hitachi Group identity. In fiscal 2021, the Group plans to match donations up to approximately 30 million yen starting with India, where the spread of COVID-19 has become more severe, and expanding to other countries facing a range of different social issues in the future.\n\nContributing to Society Through The Hitachi Global Foundation\n\nInheriting the intention of Namihei Odaira, the founder of Hitachi, to contribute to society through business activities, we wholeheartedly embrace the importance of social contributions. Since 1967, we have established five foundations, including one for supporting scientists and employees, and Group company executives. Research grants will be provided by the fund starting fiscal 2021.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nThe issues created by the COVID-19 pandemic have made one of Hitachi\u2019s core areas for social contribution especially relevant, namely, the promotion of academic research, science and technology. Accordingly, the Hitachi Fund Support for Research Related to Infectious Diseases was established in fiscal 2020 based on donations from Hitachi, Ltd., its executives and employees, and Group company executives. Research grants will be provided by the fund starting fiscal 2021.\n\nThe Hitachi Global Foundation\u2019s first Asia Innovation Awards were also held in fiscal 2020, and the research findings of the award winners have been shared publicly.\n\nAs part of Hitachi\u2019s human development efforts, Hitachi Future Innovator Program was provided for elementary schools while implementing physical distancing measures because of the pandemic.

In this way, we contribute both to the company\u2019s own sustainable growth and the development of the economy as a whole.\nCorporate Governance\n\nWhy\nHitachi views the expansion of long-term and overall shareholder returns as an important management objective. Hitachi, Ltd. and Hitachi Group companies maintain good relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, and we recognize that these relationships make up an important part of our overall corporate value. Accordingly, we are striving to establish a system that will facilitate the maintenance of these relationships and improve our corporate value primarily through the implementation of measures focused on promoting constructive dialogue.\n\nWhat\n- Implementing all of the principles of the Corporate Governance Code\n- Conducting board meetings in a way that sustainably enhances corporate value and shareholders\u2019 common interests\n- Approving and dismissing the CEO and formulating a succession plan\n- Determining appropriate compensation for directors and executive officers\n- Implementing internal controls over financial reporting\n- Enhancing collaboration through tripartite audits\n- Building a more effective and efficient auditing system\n\nHow\nHitachi, Ltd. adopted its current committee system in 2003 and has established an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating Committee. Independent directors chair these committees and comprise the majority of the members. The company has also created a system that enables sufficient exercise of supervisory functions by separating the execution and supervision of business management.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n- Analyzed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n- To achieve carbon neutrality at Hitachi business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030, Hitachi, Ltd. reviewed a system of evaluation taking environmental performance into consideration in executive officers\u2019 short-term incentive compensation and decided to introduce it in fiscal 2021.\n- A restricted stock compensation unit system was introduced as compensation for non-Japanese executive officers and corporate officers in fiscal 2020, and the scope of was expanded to executives at some Group companies in fiscal 2021.\nCorporate Governance\n\nHitachi views the expansion of long-term and overall shareholder returns as an important management objective. Hitachi, Ltd. and Hitachi Group companies maintain good relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, and we recognize that these relationships make up an important portion of our overall corporate value. Accordingly, Hitachi are striving to establish a system that will facilitate the maintenance of these relationships and improve our corporate value primarily through the implementation of measures focused on promoting constructive dialogue. To advance these efforts effectively, we are working to improve our corporate governance by ensuring thorough separation between the oversight and execution of management, establishing a swift business execution system, and striving to achieve highly transparent management.\n\nHistory of Hitachi\u2019s Corporate Governance Reform\n\n| Year | Structure | Activities |\n|------|-----------|------------|\n| 1999 | Introduction of Objective Perspective Management Advisory Committees | Practical advice from experts in Japan and overseas |\n| 2003 | Demarcation of Management Oversight and Execution Shifted to a company with committees (currently a company with nominating committee, etc.) | To increase management speed and improve management transparency |\n| 2006 | Enforcement of Revised Companies Act | |\n| 2010 | Enhancement of Interactions with Capital Markets Hitachi IR Day (briefing on business strategy by division) was launched | |\n| 2012 | Acceleration of Global Management Independent directors including foreign directors were increased | Independent directors comprised the majority of directors |\n| 2014 | Development of Guidelines for Strengthening Governance Development of Corporate Governance Guidelines | |\n| 2015 | Development of Stewardship Code | |\n| 2016 | Start of Application of Corporate Governance Code | |\n| 2019 | Acceleration of the Social Innovation Business across 5 Growth Fields Executive vice presidents were placed in 5 sectors ESG briefing session held | An independent director (chair of the Audit Committee) and the CEO shared their remarks |\n\nImplementing All the Principles of the Corporate Governance Code\n\nWe are implementing all the principles of the Corporate Governance Code.\n\nDirector Composition\n\nStructure\n\n- Independence (ratio of Independent directors)\n- Diversity (ratio of non-Japanese and female directors)\n\n- Independent directors: 10 directors (76.9%)\n- Non-Japanese directors: 6 directors (46.2%)\n- 2 female directors (15.4% of overall director total)\n\nDirectors with Abundant Experience\n\nThe Board of Directors applies their abundant experience and knowledge related to the management of global companies, legal affairs, accounting, capital markets, government agencies, and the field of digital technology to facilitate discussions informed by a wide variety of perspectives.\n\nIn June 2021, Helmuth Ludwig joined the Audit Committee and Joe Harlan joined the Compensation Committee, enabling even more diverse discussions.\nHitachi\u2019s Corporate Governance Framework and Its Features\n\nThe Senior Executive Committee is an advisory body to the CEO or the President that conducts multifaceted discussions and makes careful decisions regarding important matters that impact Hitachi, Ltd. or the Hitachi Group. As of July 2021, the Committee consisted of 11 members, including the Executive Chairman & CEO, the President & COO, five executive vice presidents, three senior vice presidents, and one vice president.\n\nGeneral Meeting of Shareholders\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n- 2 executive members\n- 11 non-executive members (including 2 female members)\n\nNominating Committee\n- 4 directors\n\nCompensation Committee\n- 5 directors\n\nAudit Committee\n- 6 directors\n\nSenior Executive Committee\n- Executive Chairman & CEO\n- President & COO\n- Executive Vice Presidents and Executive Officers/Senior Vice Presidents and Executive Officers\n\nInternal Auditing Office\n- Executive Officer\n\nExecutive Officer\n- Department in charge\n\nAudit\n- Accounting Auditors\n\nHitachi\u2019s Corporate Governance Framework and Its Features\n\nPOINT 1 Transparency in Management\n\nWe became a company with committees (currently a company with a nominating committee, etc.) in 2003. We have established the Nominating Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Audit Committee, which are mostly made up of, and are chaired by, independent directors. The system we have in place to ensure transparency in management separates the oversight and execution of management, facilitates the full exercise of supervisory functions, and enables discussions and reports to be conducted appropriately within these three committees.\n\nPOINT 2 Independence of the Board of Directors\n\nWe increased our number of independent directors, including non-Japanese directors, in 2012. Our Board of Directors, which is chaired by an independent director, has 13 members, including 10 independent directors, two directors who are also serving as executive officers, and one director who is not serving as an executive officer. In addition, we have established a system that facilitates the full exercise of supervisory functions by maintaining separation between the oversight and execution of management.\n\nPOINT 3 Enhanced Collaboration through Tripartite Audits\n\nHitachi\u2019s Audit Committee and internal audit section collaborate with third-party accounting auditors to strengthen its \u201cTripartite Auditing,\u201d which aims to increase the effectiveness of internal controls.\nAdministrative Performance of the Board of Directors\n\nStructure\n\nThe Board of Directors approves basic management policy for the Hitachi Group and supervises the execution of the duties of executive officers and directors in order to sustainably enhance corporate value and the shareholders\u2019 common interests. The basic management policy includes the Mid-term Management Plan and annual budget compilation. The Board of Directors focuses on strategic issues related to the basic management policy, as well as other items to be resolved that are provided in laws, regulations, the Articles of Incorporation, and the Board of Directors Regulations. Within the Board of Directors, there are three statutory committees\u2014the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Compensation Committee\u2014with independent directors accounting for the majority of members of each committee. The Board of Directors meetings were held on nine days during fiscal 2020, and the attendance rate of directors at these meetings was 100%. The attendance rates for each independent director were as shown in the table below. To assist with the duties of the Board of Directors and each committee, staff who are not subject to orders and instructions from executive officers are assigned.\n\nAttendance at the Board of Directors meetings held in fiscal 2020\n\n| Name                  | Attendance/Number of days on which the meetings were held* |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Board of Directors    | Nominating Committee | Audit Committee | Compensation Committee |\n| Katsumi Ihara         | 100% | \u2014 | 100% | 100% |\n| Ravi Venkatesan       | 100% | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Cynthia Carroll       | 100% | 100% | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Joe Harlan            | 100% | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| George Buckley        | 100% | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Louise Pentland       | 100% | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Harutumi Mochizuki    | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n| Takatoshi Yamamoto    | 100% | \u2014 | 100% | 100% |\n| Hiroaki Yoshihara     | 100% | 100% | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Helmuth Ludwig        | 100% | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n\n*Number of days during term of office on which the Board of Directors meetings were held: 9; Mr. Venkatesan and Mr. Ludwig: 6\nNumber of days during term of office on which Nominating Committee meetings were held: 8\nNumber of days during term of office on which Audit Committee meetings were held: 17\nNumber of days during term of office on which Compensation Committee meetings were held: 4\n\nDescription of the three committees\u2019 activities\n\nNominating Committee\n\nThe Nominating Committee has the authority to determine proposals submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for the election and dismissal of directors. The Nominating Committee consists of four directors, three of whom are independent directors. It determines director candidates and holds preliminary hearings concerning the appointment and dismissal of executive officers, including the CEO.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Nominating Committee held meetings on eight days.\n\nPrimary Activities\n\nIn addition to deciding upon the contents of the proposal made concerning director appointments at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the Nominating Committee set an upper limit on the total term of office for independent directors and reviewed and confirmed the executive officer system implemented in fiscal 2021. In addition, it promoted committee-related activities including discussions and individual interviews aimed at developing candidates for future management and leadership positions.\n\nAudit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee has the authority to audit the execution of duties of directors and executive officers and to decide on proposals submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for the election and dismissal of accounting auditors. The Audit Committee currently consists of six directors, including five independent directors and one standing Audit Committee member.\n\nHiroaki Yoshihara, the chairman of the Audit Committee, has been involved in accounting and other business practices at the KPMG Group for many years and possesses a considerable breadth of knowledge concerning finance and accounting.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Audit Committee held meetings on 17 days.\n\nPrimary Activities\n\nThe Audit Committee conducted activities that were focused on its priority matters for consideration, which included the strengthening of collaboration and the facilitation of information sharing under a \u201cTripartite Audit\u201d audit by the Audit Committee, internal audit and audit by accounting auditors, and auditing of the establishment and operation of internal control systems from the perspective of risk management and validity of execution of duties. In addition, a standing committee member worked to obtain information as needed in a timely and accurate manner, mainly by collaborating with the Internal Auditing Office, among other departments, and attending important internal meetings such as the Senior Executive Committee, and facilitated information sharing with other committee members.\n\nCompensation Committee\n\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to determine remuneration policies for directors and executive officers and remuneration for individuals (including amounts of remuneration) based on them. Currently composed of five directors, including four independent directors, the committee strives to ensure objectivity, transparency, and fairness in the remuneration determination process.\n\nIn addition, the Compensation Committee verifies and reviews details of the process used for determining remuneration for individuals, including assessments concerning basic remuneration amounts, evaluations of progress made toward individual targets, and performance appraisals that are tied to short-term incentive compensation.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee held meetings on four days.\n\nPrimary Activities\n\nThe Compensation Committee determined remuneration amounts for individual directors and executive officers in accordance with established policies while verifying and reviewing the processes and results of appraisals for performance and individual targets tied to short-term incentive compensation for executive officers. In addition, the committee reviewed the executive compensation system while giving due consideration to compensation granted to managers at global companies and the goal of sharing value with shareholders, and decided upon policies covering remuneration for directors and executive officers in fiscal 2021.\nAnalysis and Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Company evaluates the effectiveness of its Board of Directors each year in a continuous effort to maintain and improve its functions.\n\nFiscal 2020 Evaluation Process\n\n1. Questionnaire-based self-assessment by each director (February\u2013March 2021)\n   - Composition: Diversity on the Board, the number and proportion of Inside and Outside Directors, etc.\n   - Viability of responsibilities and roles of the Board\n   - Meeting operation: Meeting frequency, deliberation time, agenda setting, quality of deliberation, Chairman\u2019s role, etc.\n   - Contribution: Contribution to strategy building and change of company culture, contribution to have constructive discussions, utilization of Director\u2019s knowledge and experience, discussions based on taking the Digital Transformation, etc.\n   - Understanding of the Company: Hitachi Group Identity, risk factors, potential challenges and opportunities.\n   - Three committees: Composition, responsibilities and roles, coordination with the Board, etc.\n   - Supporting system for the Board: Provision of necessary information such as the Board materials, etc.\n\n2. Discussions among independent directors (March 2021)\n   - Independent directors had a meeting and discussed the Board effectiveness there.\n\n3. Discussions at the Board meeting (May 2021)\n   - The Board analyzed and evaluated its effectiveness as a whole and confirmed the policy on approaches to further enhance the Board\u2019s effectiveness based on the results of the preceding process, considering comparison to the evaluation results for fiscal 2018 and measures taken for improving its effectiveness in fiscal 2020.\n\nEvaluation Results and Future Initiatives\n\nOverall evaluation in fiscal 2020\n- The Board assessed that the Board members are diverse and make use of their knowledge and expertise to speak out, having vigorous discussions especially on matters related to business strategies such as the mid-term management plan toward mid/long-term growth of corporate value. The Board, therefore, concluded that the effectiveness of the Board as a whole is maintained.\n\nFuture initiatives\n- Examine the discussion process for strategy discussions based on a mid to long term perspective and establish a time and forum for deepening discussions.\n- Business strategy reports and discussions at Board meetings will continue to be implemented on a Sector by Sector basis, and discussions will focus on strategy, such as a risk matrix based on factors such as the standing of the Company, the status of competitors, technology, talent, finance and Lumada strategy.\n- Risk management, ESG and Investor relations will be submitted as agenda items as important matters for improving long term corporate value.\n- The Board will attempt to strengthen a relationship with the Nominating Committee and further contribute to succession planning of CEO (e.g. enhancement of Nominating Committee\u2019s reports to the Board, one-on-one meeting with CEO successor candidates and next generation leader candidates).\n\nEnhancement of supporting system for the Board and improve practical issues in operations\n- Post COVID-19, restarting to provide Independent Directors with information on opportunities of visiting sites and events of Hitachi Group.\n- Further improve structure and contents of materials for the Board meeting and operation of provision of materials well in advance of the Board meeting.\nCEO Appointment, Dismissal, and Succession Plan\n\nStructure\n\nHitachi\u2019s Board of Directors decides upon the appointment and dismissal of executive officers, including the CEO, with the goal of constructing an optimal business execution system for management. Decisions regarding the appointment or dismissal of executive officers are based on proposals from the Nominating Committee. As stipulated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our basic policy concerning the CEO requires that individuals serving in the position of CEO have extensive experience and achievements in the field of company management. They must also be considered optimally suited for conducting management aimed at achieving Hitachi\u2019s goals of continuously raising its corporate value and further serving the common interests of its shareholders. Decisions regarding the appointment or dismissal of the CEO shall be made based on prior deliberations and proposals by the Nominating Committee.\n\nRegarding our CEO Succession Plan, as the speed of change in the management environment accelerates, we are striving to build a system that enables us to appropriately change in the management environment. We are developing next-generation leaders capable of acting for selected employees while targeting the early development of leadership that will allow us to realize our growth strategies.\n\nWe are also concentrating on providing training for selected employees while targeting the early development of candidates for future management positions. Moreover, we are developing next-generation leaders capable of acting authoritatively and resolutely by establishing forums where participants can discuss what is necessary for Hitachi\u2019s future growth and make recommendations to management.\n\nIn addition, we have identified a group of about 50 employees from around the Hitachi Group with next-generation development potential. People in this \u201cFuture 50\u201d group are selected on merit, regardless of age, gender, or nationality. They are given challenges to help expand their horizons and build their perspectives through tough assignments including different types of work and internal and external training opportunities. The Future 50 group members receive one-on-one mentoring opportunities with independent directors to benefit directly from their extensive business experience and global perspectives. Our aim is to change mindsets so that we can develop people for important positions in the future.\n\nDirector and Executive Officer Compensation\n\nBasic Policy\n\n- Compensation shall be such that it enables the Company to attract necessary personnel to achieve an improvement in corporate value through global business growth.\n- Compensation shall be commensurate with the roles and responsibilities of each Director and Executive Officer.\n- Compensation for Directors shall be such that it enables them to exercise the functions of supervision of management effectively.\n- Compensation for Executive Officers shall be such that it enables them to contribute to sustained improvement in corporate value through the execution of business and employs an appropriate balance between short-term performance and medium- and long-term performance.\n- The level of compensation shall be determined considering compensation levels at other companies as well as economic and market trends.\n- The Compensation Committee utilizes external experts to gain expert advice and an objective viewpoint, if necessary, for considering the details and amounts of compensation.\n\nCompensation Structure\n\n(1) Directors\n\nCompensation for Directors is basic remuneration as fixed pay. The amount of basic remuneration is decided by adjusting a basic amount to reflect full-time or part-time status, committee membership and position, and travel from place of residence, etc. A Director concurrently serving as an Executive Officer is not paid compensation as a Director.\n\n(2) Executive Officers\n\nCompensation for Executive Officers consists of basic remuneration as fixed pay and short-term incentive compensation and medium- and long-term incentive compensation as variable pay. The basic amount of basic remuneration, short-term incentive compensation and medium- and long-term incentive compensation is set based on the ratio of 1:1:1 as the standard, taking into account the composition of executive compensation for major global companies, in order to improve corporate value through the growth of global businesses. The higher position Executive Officer holds, the higher proportion of variable pay is set to the total annual compensation.\n\nAs part of efforts to achieve carbon neutrality at Hitachi business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030, in fiscal 2021, an evaluation system that considers environmental value was introduced into short-term incentive compensation for executive officers. Specifically, targets are set for environmental strategies and solutions to environmental issues based on the divisions and operations handled by each executive officer, and performance is evaluated according to the degree of target achievement.\n\nIf it is found that an executive officer has been engaged in misconduct during his/her term of office, compensation for Executive Officers that has been already paid shall be returned to the Company (clawback provision).\n\nHitachi Sustainability Report 2021\nCompensation to Executive Officers (Fiscal 2021)\n\n1. Basic remuneration\n   Set according to the relevant position by adjusting that amount to reflect financial results and individual performance.\n\n2. Short-term incentive compensation\n   The amount of short-term incentive compensation is decided within the range of 0 to 200% of a basic amount set according to the relevant position by adjusting that amount to reflect financial results and individual performance.\n\n3. Medium- and Long-term incentive compensation\n   Shares of restricted stock were introduced in fiscal 2019 as compensation for Japanese executive officers and corporate officers (the executive positions next to Executive Officers) to propel management from a medium- and long-term perspective and to provide incentives to bring about a sustainable increase in enterprise value by further promoting senior management\u2019s shared values with shareholders through the holding of shares during their term of office. In fiscal 2020, a restricted stock compensation unit system was introduced as compensation for non-Japanese executive officers and corporate officers. In fiscal 2021, the scope of the restricted stock compensation unit system was expanded to executives at some Group companies.\n\nThe shares of restricted stock\n- The restriction on transfer shall be lifted if executive officers resign from all of the positions of the Company\u2019s executive officer, director, and corporate officer.\n- With regard to one-half of the granted shares of restricted stock, the number of shares whose transfer restriction is lifted shall be determined after ex-post evaluation. In the ex-post evaluation, the total shareholder return (TSR) of Hitachi stock over the three years from the beginning of the fiscal year when the medium- and long-term incentive compensation is granted is compared with growth rate of TOPIX over the same period.\n\n| TSR/TOPIX growth rate | Shares for which the transfer restrictions are lifted |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 120% or more           | Transfer restrictions are lifted for all granted shares. |\n| Between 80% or more but less than 120% | Transfer restrictions are lifted for part of granted shares. |\n| Less than 80%          | No granted shares have transfer restrictions lifted. |\n\n1. A system in which restricted stock compensation units are granted to the eligible persons, and over three years from the start of the business year in which the restricted stock compensation units were granted, one-third of the number of restricted stock compensation units granted is paid in each fiscal year that passes, as Hitachi stock or cash.\n2. Number of shares whose transfer restrictions are lifted = Number of granted shares \u00d7 (TSR/TOPIX Growth Rate Ratio \u00d7 1.25) \u2013 0.5\n   Shares whose transfer restrictions are not lifted shall be acquired by Hitachi without consideration.\n\n*1 The rates used for \u201cother executive officers\u201d apply when \u201cexecutive officers forming the Senior Executive Committee\u201d are in charge of sector or business units.\n\n*2 The restriction on transfer shall be lifted if executive officers resign from all of the positions of the Company\u2019s executive officer, director, and corporate officer.\n\n*3 Number of shares whose transfer restrictions are lifted = Number of granted shares \u00d7 (TSR/TOPIX Growth Rate Ratio \u00d7 1.25) \u2013 0.5\n   Shares whose transfer restrictions are not lifted shall be acquired by Hitachi without consideration.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n**Structure**\n\nTo ensure the reliability of its consolidated financial reporting, the Hitachi Group is establishing and implementing relevant internal controls. We evaluate their effectiveness by adhering to standards for the evaluation of internal controls related to financial reporting that are generally accepted as fair and reasonable.\n\nFurthermore, we have established the J-SOX Committee with the goal of raising the effectiveness of these internal controls. This committee evaluates internal control effectiveness and establishes frameworks designed to improve and strengthen them.\n\nEnhanced Collaboration through Tripartite Audits\n\n**Structure**\n\nIn pursuit of sustainable growth in corporate value, Hitachi\u2019s Audit Committee and internal audit section collaborate with third-party accounting auditors to strengthen its \u201cTripartite Auditing,\u201d which aims to increase the effectiveness of internal controls. Our Audit Committee takes the lead in this regard, as the three parties communicate closely to share risk information and assessments concerning risk response while securing transparency and ensuring appropriate checks and balances.\n\nBuilding a More Effective and Efficient Auditing System\n\n**Structure**\n\nOur Audit Committee formulates audit plans in accordance with its risk-based approaches and conducts audits for each consolidated business unit. Audit Committee members meet directly with business unit heads before the internal audit section\u2019s audits are carried out. Then, these members inform the internal audit section about concerns and issues related to the implementation of business strategies aimed at achieving sustainable growth that require attention. At that time, the committee also verifies matters that carry high levels of risk in terms of quality, measuring these risks through employee awareness surveys and thorough implementation of business strategies.\n\nHitachi\u2019s internal audit section performs regular internal audits at each business site and location. This section reports directly to the President and is independent from organizations that are subject to its audits. The internal audit section also formulates audit plans based on past audit records and the most recent business circumstances. In addition, this section performs audits upon receiving direction from the Audit Committee, ensuring their effectiveness. The internal audit section at Hitachi is responsible for confirming the legality and appropriateness of all business operations, including those related to accounting, production management, sales, purchasing, IT systems, compliance, and human resources. Furthermore, acting on behalf of our management team, the internal audit section confirms whether the employees are well versed in the ideas and policies of our management, and their operations are being carried out based on these ideas and policies and if business strategies are being implemented in a way that will efficiently lead to sustainable growth.\n\nTo further raise audit effectiveness, we implemented a...\n\u201cchief auditor system\u201d in each of our five sectors (IT, Energy, Industry, Mobility, Smart Life) in April 2019. Through this action, we built an internal control system spearheaded by chief auditors and enhanced collaboration with the executive vice presidents who manage each sector and with the Audit Committee.\n\nAlthough these chief auditors do not act as legal agents under the Companies Act, they still assume responsibility for governance in each sector. Statutory auditors, which function as legal agents at Hitachi subsidiaries under the Companies Act, also report to these chief auditors and work to improve the effectiveness of Hitachi\u2019s internal control systems.\n\nWhen conducting business audits, we use IT systems to expeditiously search for reference information contained within materials submitted prior to audit in an attempt to improve efficiency. We are currently enhancing a system that will allow our internal audit section to share information with professional accounting auditors using a data lake. When reading audit reports submitted to the President by the internal audit section, the President must be able to quickly understand the issues identified by these reports and make prompt judgments concerning whether immediate action is required.\n\nIn the future, our internal audit section will continue to maintain its transparency and independence while working to improve audit efficiency as one member of our Tripartite Audit system.\n\nOur accounting auditors perform audits that focus on the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements. First, they adopt a risk-based approach in response to the Group\u2019s overall financial status. Applying this approach, they then determine the scope and methods of the audit, formulate an audit plan, and share opinions with the Audit Committee. Next, based on the audit plan, they perform audits on each of the five sectors and the business units that comprise them, enabling effective and efficient understanding of data related to Hitachi\u2019s finance department and each of its business segments. If, during the auditing process, our accounting auditors discover a degree of risk that could impact future financial statements significantly or issues that, even if monetarily small, could have a large qualitative effect, they share related information regarding these risks and issues and the progress on a response from the related divisions with the Audit Committee and internal audit section. They also work to improve and raise the effectiveness of audits by submitting \u201cmanagement letters\u201d containing points of concern and improvement suggestions through the finance department. Recently, they have also been working to raise the efficiency of checks on the accuracy of numerical figures by using some IT systems to investigate all cases rather than performing test-checking through sampling.\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\n- Comply with the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct\n- Establishing and strengthening a compliance framework\n- Instituting and integrating a compliance reporting system\n- Preventing antisocial transactions and money laundering\n- Preventing bribery and corrupt practices\n- Complying with competition laws\n- Carrying out strict export controls\n- Implementing thorough tax compliance\n\nComplying with the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct\n\nFormulated the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance\nHad more than 300,000 executives and employees complete an e-learning program on the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance (provided in 15 languages)\n\nStrengthen compliance\n\nHitachi Group Compliance Conference for working-level employees twice, each was divided among four regions\nHeld interviews and provided improvement guidance for Group companies deemed \u201chigh-risk\u201d in the compliance risk survey\n\nInstitute and integrate a compliance reporting system\n\nLaunched a Group-wide internal reporting system called the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline and worked to integrate internal reporting systems within the Group with it (Total number of Group-wide compliance reports: 639)\n\nImplement prevention of bribery and corrupt practices and compliance with competition law\n\nEstablished the Hitachi Group Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy as well as the associated rules and clarified the standards and procedures concerning entertainment, gifts, and other arrangements provided to or received from public officials and non-public officials alike\nEstablished the Hitachi Group Fair Competition Policy and clarified the participation of departments responsible for compliance in types of conduct other than with cartels (vertical relationships with customers, channel partners, suppliers, and so on)\nHitachi Group Codes of Conduct\n\nHitachi, Ltd. has formulated the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, which all executives and employees across the entire Group pledge to uphold. The Codes of Conduct are translated into 14 languages from Japanese and shared with Hitachi Group executive officers and employees around the world.\n\nIn April 2020, we established the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance. This code supplements the Codes of Conduct and makes clear the ideas on corporate ethics and compliance that must be shared across the entire Hitachi Group.\n\nHitachi's executive officers and employees around the world have diverse cultural and educational backgrounds. To ensure they thoroughly uphold corporate ethics and compliance, all executive officers and employees take an annual e-learning course on corporate ethics. In addition, the Hitachi Group monitors employees' awareness of matters such as business ethics and compliance with an annual survey as part of its efforts to cultivate a healthy corporate culture.\n\nGiven the global reach of Hitachi's business, the growth in possible risks is a concern. The Hitachi Group is working hard to identify and avoid procurement risks throughout the supply chain as much as possible. The third edition of the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines revised by the Hitachi Group in January 2017 is based on version 5.1 of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct as well as the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct established in August 2010. We distribute the guidelines to suppliers and make efforts to raise awareness of them as CSR codes of conduct and standards that we expect suppliers to adhere to.\n\nIn addition, we reviewed the guidelines in fiscal 2021. The revised guidelines have been titled the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines.\n\nHitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance\n\nPromoting Work Practices in Line with International Ethics Codes\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, more than 300,000 executive officers and employees across the Hitachi Group took an e-learning course (provided in 15 languages) on the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance. (The participation rate was over 98%)\n\nWe have revised the Hitachi Group's compliance rules. The three objectives for the revisions are as follows: make codes that are easy for executive officers and employees to understand, and provide substantive reasons when actions are taken; and more clearly share the compliance policy of Hitachi that is aligned with global standards with companies and business divisions that join the Hitachi Group, including through corporate buyouts.\n\nCompliance Framework Structure\n\nBased on the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct and the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance, Hitachi created the Hitachi Group Compliance Program (HGCP) to promote compliance.\n\nTo implement this program we have appointed the Hitachi Group Head of Risk Management and the Hitachi Group Head of Ethics and Compliance to supervise the Head of Ethics and Compliance in business units, key Group companies, and other organizations. Under this system, policies and measures on compliance are shared through communication with these Head of Ethics and Compliance. Head of Ethics and Compliance are assisted by a Compliance Manager who implements practical support measures. Globally, we have also appointed Regional Head of Compliance in 11 regions, responsible for implementing education and sharing information as well as arranging consultation services with outside attorneys.\n\nIssues in the promotion of compliance measures are clarified through individual dialogue with business units and key Group companies, while the internal audit section conducts Group-wide reviews once every four years to verify that each area of compliance is being appropriately conducted. In cases where these reviews identify necessary improvements, corrective measures are swiftly implemented.\n\nIn order to identify various risks, including risks of...\nbribery and corrupt practices, Hitachi conducted risk assessments on Group companies outside Japan in the fiscal years of 2013 and 2017 and on all Group companies in 2019. We will continue to perform regular risk assessments like these and use the results to improve compliance activities in all Group companies.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn the second half of the year, we appointed personnel in the United Kingdom to promote the compliance program and made other efforts to strengthen its structure globally with the aim of driving implementation and optimization of the HGCP across the entire Hitachi Group.\n\nIn May and June 2020, and January 2021, we held a Hitachi Group Compliance Conference for compliance persons in charge at business units and Group companies. The conference was held four times for compliance persons in charge in each of the following four regions: Japan; North, Central, and South America; Asia-Pacific; and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. At the conference in January 2021, the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) personally explained Hitachi\u2019s policies.\n\nInterviews were conducted at Group companies deemed to be high risk based on the compliance risk survey performed in fiscal 2019. The interviews were used to closely examine the situation at those companies and provide guidance on how to improve. Based on the survey results, we will continue to allocate resources to high-risk operations and regions, thereby securing the effectiveness of the program as we strive to take thoroughgoing measures according to risk levels.\nPolicies for Preventing Bribery and Corrupt Practices\n\nPreventing bribery and corrupt practices is a major challenge for any company today. Hitachi established the Hitachi Group Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy along with related regulations as part of the Hitachi Group Compliance Program (HGCP). When providing or accepting entertainment or gifts, or making donations or political contributions, it is important to ensure that these activities are conducted in a transparent and ethical manner.\n\nPrevention of Antisocial Transactions and Money Laundering\n\nTo cut off all relationships with antisocial forces, in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct and the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance, we have laid out provisions stating that we will never engage in antisocial transactions under any circumstances, and will refuse any improper demands and unfair deals. We conduct eligibility checks on new as well as existing business partners and, in Japan, include antisocial force rejection clauses in contracts so that if it is determined that a business partner belongs to an antisocial force, we can promptly void the contract and end the relationship. The entire Hitachi Group acts decisively to eliminate approaches from antisocial forces in partnership with external specialist institutions (the National Center for the Elimination of Boryokudan or the police).\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we revised our established rules, adding provisions on the prevention of money laundering in addition to the prevention of antisocial transactions with a view to clarifying Hitachi\u2019s stance of not tolerating money laundering and to strengthen concrete initiatives to prevent it.\n\nStructure\n\nTo prevent and promptly address illegal or inappropriate activity and enhance its ability to self-regulate, Hitachi has instituted an internal reporting system, a so-called whistleblower system, allowing direct reports to be made regarding actual or suspected compliance violations including the provision of improper benefits to public officials in and outside Japan. This system can be used anonymously, not only by employees within the Hitachi Group but also by temporary staff and business partners, such as suppliers and distributors. The facts related to all reports are subject to thorough investigation and reporters are informed of the investigation results. We make every effort to deal with situations as appropriate, including taking remedial action where necessary. In fiscal 2020, we received 639 reports from all Group companies worldwide.\n\nIn addition, we have implemented the Channel to the Board of Directors system to allow all Hitachi, Ltd. employees to directly report problems anonymously or under their real names to Hitachi directors in cases where they see any illegality or extreme inappropriateness in business conduct by division heads, executive officers, or other management personnel.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, to further strengthen the Group\u2019s governance and compliance, we integrated internal reporting systems within the Group into a Group-wide system called the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline. The harassment consultation service previously under the management of the human capital division and the internal reporting systems independently maintained by Group companies were integrated into the new system. However, the above-mentioned Channel to the Board of Directors was not integrated, as the systems have different purposes. The new system enhances our reporting capacity by offering a service 24 hours a day every day in multiple languages both online and by telephone. In cooperation with business units and relevant departments at Group companies, we strive to promptly investigate, respond to, and take corrective actions regarding reports received through the hotline.\n\nGRI 102-17\n\nPrevention of Antisocial Transactions and Money Laundering\n\nTo cut off all relationships with antisocial forces, in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct and the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance, we have laid out provisions stating that we will never engage in antisocial transactions under any circumstances, and will refuse any improper demands and unfair deals. We conduct eligibility checks on new as well as existing business partners and, in Japan, include antisocial force rejection clauses in contracts so that if it is determined that a business partner belongs to an antisocial force, we can promptly void the contract and end the relationship. The entire Hitachi Group acts decisively to eliminate approaches from antisocial forces in partnership with external specialist institutions (the National Center for the Elimination of Boryokudan or the police).\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we revised our established rules, adding provisions on the prevention of money laundering in addition to the prevention of antisocial transactions with a view to clarifying Hitachi\u2019s stance of not tolerating money laundering and to strengthen concrete initiatives to prevent it.\n\nPolicies for Preventing Bribery and Corrupt Practices\n\nPreventing bribery and corrupt practices is a major challenge for any company today. Hitachi established the Hitachi Group Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy along with related regulations as part of the Hitachi Group Compliance Program (HGCP). When providing or accepting entertainment or gifts, or making donations or political contributions, it is important to ensure that these activities are conducted in a transparent and ethical manner.\ncontributions, executive officers and employees must not exceed the scope of actions permitted by anti-bribery laws and regulations and must comply with Hitachi\u2019s internal rules. These indicate specific spending limits in terms of the monetary value and number of times for entertainment, gifts, and other arrangements to be provided to public officials. We also have policies banning facilitation payments and requiring due diligence procedures for business partners. With anti-corruption regulations growing stricter in recent years around the globe, we also expend great effort ensuring that we are in strict compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and all other relevant laws and regulations in the countries and regions where we do business.\n\nTo ensure awareness of rules and policies concerning prevention of bribery and corruption spelled out in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance, and the Hitachi Group Compliance Program (HGCP), we have developed teaching materials and made them available in several languages for use by Group companies worldwide.\n\n**Educational Activities for Preventing Bribery and Corrupt Practices**\n\n**Employee Engagement**\n\nTo ensure awareness of rules and policies concerning prevention of bribery and corruption, we are developing educational activities globally while at the same time ensuring that we comply with the related rules, business standards, and guidelines. To enhance awareness of ethical principles and practices globally, we created a global version of our standards regarding contact with competitors. We also provide a collection of case studies on competition law and other topics for workplace discussion to Group companies in three languages\u2014Japanese, English, and Chinese\u2014to raise employee awareness.\n\n**Achievements in Fiscal 2020**\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we established the Hitachi Group Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy along with related regulations, clarifying the standards and procedures for entertainment, gifts, travel, and other arrangements provided to and received from others, whether public officials or not.\n\n**Competition Law Compliance Policy**\n\n**Policy**\n\nHitachi engages in business based on the principles of conformance with the law and business ethics and fair and open competition. We included business standards and guidelines related to these principles in the Hitachi Group Compliance Program (HGCP), in addition to the Hitachi Group Fair Competition Policy.\n\n**Preventing Violations of Competition Law**\n\n**Activities**\n\nAs with our initiatives against bribery and corrupt practices, we are developing educational activities globally while at the same time ensuring that we comply with the related rules, business standards, and guidelines. To enhance awareness of ethical principles and practices globally, we created a global version of our standards regarding contact with competitors. We also provide a collection of case studies on competition law and other topics for workplace discussion to Group companies in three languages\u2014Japanese, English, and Chinese\u2014to raise employee awareness.\n\n**Achievements in Fiscal 2020**\n\nIn fiscal 2020, as we reviewed our rules related to compliance, as described above, we established the Hitachi Group Fair Competition Policy, which are rules for complying with competition laws. We also clarified the involvement of compliance departments in types of conduct other than cartels (vertical relationships with customers, channel partners, suppliers, and others).\n\n**Export Controls**\n\n**Policy**\n\nFor basic export control policies, we have adopted the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, which state: \u201cWe will help maintain international peace and security through compliance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning import and export, and will operate appropriately according to our internal rules and policies.\u201d Hitachi, Ltd. has established Corporate Regulations concerning Security Export Control based on this policy to carry out strict export control practices in line with relevant laws and regulations, screening all goods and technologies intended for export against such factors as destination countries and regions as well as intended end use and end users. We provide guidance and educational support for the formulation of regulations and the establishment of frameworks to Hitachi Group companies to ensure that all Group companies follow the same export control policies in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nAt present, as part of our educational program for all Group companies, we operate online courses and e-learning programs on export controls. We operate a basic e-learning program in 14 languages and an e-learning program for staff in Japanese and English. These ongoing efforts help ensure that export controls are thoroughly enforced throughout the Group.\n\n**Hitachi\u2019s Tax Compliance Approach**\n\n**Approach**\n\nHitachi has built a system of tax governance in order to respond to tax risks associated with the globalization of its business such as indications made by the tax authorities and tax-related legal proceedings in each country. Specifically,\nwe established tax-related rules for the purposes listed below. To ensure thorough compliance with the rules, we are striving to raise awareness of them among all employees involved in tax management (filing and paying taxes, handling tax audits, and tax risk management) and the handling of other tax matters.\n\n1. Group companies strictly comply with all relevant laws and implement tax management when pursuing their business activities, bearing in mind such international tax-compliance standards as the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as that body\u2019s Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).\n\n2. Group companies effectively, continually, and proactively manage tax-related issues as socially responsible organizations, while maintaining Hitachi brand value and seeking to maximize shareholder value.\n\n3. Group companies build sincere and positive relations of trust with the tax authorities in the regions where the companies do business, and strive to maintain and develop those relations.\n\nIn accordance with these rules, we have established rules on transfer pricing management for Group companies to identify and mitigate potential taxation risks related to transfer pricing in transactions with foreign affiliated parties, and to help ensure compliance. As stated above, we are striving to raise awareness of these rules and ensure they are followed.\n\n**Tax Compliance Initiatives**\n\n**Activities**\n\nBy following the relevant tax-related rules applicable to the Group as a whole, Hitachi manages tax risks associated with globalization. For example, we strengthen our risk management as well as compliance with laws and regulations by identifying and sharing indications made by the tax authorities and the tax related legal proceedings in each country. The results of our tax filings and tax audits in Japan are reported to the management, and we are continuously working to ensure appropriate tax reporting and prevent fraud. In preparing tax filings, we determine whether anti-tax haven legislation applies, and when it does, we reflect it properly in the tax filing in an effort to make appropriate tax payments.\n\nHitachi follows rules for transfer pricing management and also manages transfer pricing in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the laws and regulations on transfer pricing in each country or region where Group companies are located.\n\nIn the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we paid 188.9 billion yen*\u00b9 in corporate income tax (76% in Japan and 24% outside Japan*\u00b2).\n\n**Violations of Laws and Regulation**\n\nIn fiscal 2020, there were no incidents in which Hitachi was prosecuted or penalized by the authorities regarding bribery, corrupt practices, competition law or export control. Regarding tax compliance, Hitachi acts in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and did not have any significant fines or nonmonetary sanctions for noncompliance with tax laws and regulations.\nSocial issues, including rapid advancements in digitalization and complex changes in political and economic situations occurring worldwide, along with environmental issues, including climate change, resource depletion, and major disasters, are bringing changes to the business environment that are difficult to predict. In this era, the maintenance of our business model will be greatly affected by how we respond to these changes as well. Hitachi understands that, in this context, it will be necessary to identify and analyze opportunities to attain sustainable growth and the risks that it must prepare for and appropriately address them.\n\nGiven the close relationship of our business with social infrastructure, we are enhancing our business continuity plans (BCPs) to ensure that the impact of risks does not disrupt our business and thereby significantly affect society.\n\nMeanwhile, we remain actively engaged in promoting our own sustainable growth while contributing to the realization of a sustainable society by seeking out business opportunities that contribute to the resolution of global issues including those relevant to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Society 5.0. Also regarding climate change, which is an urgent issue worldwide, Hitachi discloses key information and strives to promote responses to climate change based on the proposals of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD).\n\nHitachi launched an Investment Strategy Committee to strengthen the quantitative risk management of its investments. The Executive Sustainability Committee deliberates on the social and environmental impact of our business activities to clarify any negative impact our business has on society and the environment and to identify issues. The company also established the new position of chief risk management officer (CRMO) in April, 2020 and has worked to better understand the risks and opportunities that may affect its business and to strengthen risk management activities.\n\nHitachi Sustainability Report 2021\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\n- Strengthen procurement BCPs\n- Improve the safety of employees sent to dangerous regions\n\nEarthquake drills simulating a major seismic event\nConducted drills to set up an earthquake task force on a remote-work basis\n\nFurther strengthening procurement BCPs\nHitachi Group CSR/BCP Procurement Committee provided supplier diagnostic tools to procurement divisions\n\nContinuously improving the safety of employees sent to dangerous regions\nPosted information from risk consultants internally through our intranet\nProvided medical assistance for Hitachi Group employees outside Japan\n\nTo increase preparedness for major disasters and other risks across the entire Group worldwide, we have issued the Hitachi Group Guidelines for Developing Business Continuity Plans. Also, to minimize the impact of disasters that may occur, the procurement divisions in business units and key Group companies in Japan have created procurement BCPs.\nThe business environment is changing with each passing day, for example, as a result of rapid digitalization and changes in complex political and economic conditions worldwide. Hitachi monitors and analyzes the business environments, and based on factors such as social issues, management resources, and our competitive superiority, undertakes risk management from the perspective of both further growth opportunities and responding to the risks that Hitachi should prepare for, controlling risks while creating profit opportunities. Hitachi established the Investment Strategy Division in fiscal 2017 and the post of Chief Risk Management Officer (CRMO) in April 2020 to better identify the risks and opportunities that could potentially affect Hitachi\u2019s business and to strengthen risk management.\n\nFrom fiscal 2017, as part of efforts to achieve a sustainable society, the Executive Sustainability Committee was established to discuss relations between Hitachi\u2019s business and social/environmental issues and to define the issues that Hitachi should target as business opportunities, the negative impact that business could have on society and the environment, and necessary countermeasures.\n\nAddressing Risks and Opportunities\n\nInvestment Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe business environment is changing with each passing day, for example, as a result of rapid digitalization and changes in complex political and economic conditions worldwide. Hitachi monitors and analyzes the business environments, and based on factors such as social issues, management resources, and our competitive superiority, undertakes risk management from the perspective of both further growth opportunities and responding to the risks that Hitachi should prepare for, controlling risks while creating profit opportunities. Hitachi established the Investment Strategy Division in fiscal 2017 and the post of Chief Risk Management Officer (CRMO) in April 2020 to better identify the risks and opportunities that could potentially affect Hitachi\u2019s business and to strengthen risk management.\n\nFrom fiscal 2017, as part of efforts to achieve a sustainable society, the Executive Sustainability Committee was established to discuss relations between Hitachi\u2019s business and social/environmental issues and to define the issues that Hitachi should target as business opportunities, the negative impact that business could have on society and the environment, and necessary countermeasures.\nInvestment Risks and Opportunities\n\nTo accelerate the global Social Innovation Business amid structural changes and increasing uncertainty in the world economy, it is increasingly important to understand investment risks and opportunities (e.g., M&A and orders for projects) and to take appropriate measures.\n\nAs shown in the flowchart on the right, regarding individual investment decisions (e.g., execution, business plan changes, and disposals), under the ultimate authority of the Board of Directors and depending on the scale and content of the projects, Hitachi delegates authority to the Senior Executive Committee (which, in principle, meets twice per month) and respective business units to facilitate flexible and appropriate decision-making. In addition, regarding important matters to be deliberated by the Senior Executive Committee, prior to deliberations, discussions are held with the Investment Strategy Committee*\u00b9 advisory body to confirm and review not only the perspective of economic value in terms of cash flow and the profitability of projects but also the impact on social value and environmental value. The findings, including project pros and cons, are reported to Senior Executive Committee members, including the President.\n\nAfter making an investment, Hitachi regularly monitors the business objectives and achievement status of the project, considering changes in the external environment. In principle, each business unit ensures flexibility, but the Headquarters is also involved depending on the level of importance. Also, regarding changes in business plans and the disposal or reorganization of important investment targets, discussions are held by the Senior Executive Committee as in the execution stage. For investment targets of which business is not progressing as planned, Hitachi established a framework to deliberate on the pros and cons of continuing business, including withdrawal, to improve capital efficiency.\n\nQuantitative Understanding of Risks\n\nHitachi calculates the maximum risk (Value at Risk) assumed by statistical methods according to the type of assets held on the Group\u2019s consolidated balance sheet.\n\nConsidering total consolidated net assets and other factors, we visualize the surplus capacity of growth investments to monitor growth opportunities and ensure that risks are not excessively unbalanced compared to Hitachi\u2019s consolidated management strength.\n\nIn addition, by analyzing risk conditions in each region and sector and the outlook for future trends, Hitachi gains a quantitative understanding of risk concentrations in specific regions and sectors in comparison with profitability.\n\nResponding to increasingly challenging and complex risks\n\nHitachi conducts business activities in a variety of industries throughout the world and therefore needs to take a multifaceted approach to managing the business risks that prevent the organization from achieving its business objectives. To systematically identify, evaluate, and manage risks, while taking into account the effects of reorganizing the business portfolio, Hitachi is rebuilding group-wide risk management frameworks and putting in place more systematic processes, using global standard practices at Hitachi ABB Power Grids as a reference. By further enhancing risk management, we will strengthen our capability of responding to different risks in each business and at the same time gain a comprehensive and integrated understanding of those risks and put in place...\nmeasures in advance to better achieve the organization's goals.\n\nFollowing is an outline of the main risks and opportunities. This list assumes that the content was reasonable at the time this report was issued.\n\n### Major Risks and Opportunities\n\n| Major risk factors | Details on risks and opportunities | Company

infrastructure, we are enhancing our business continuity plans (BCPs) to ensure that the impact of risks does not disrupt our business and thereby significantly affect society. The Hitachi Group Guidelines for Developing Business Continuity Plans (Overview) and the Hitachi Group Guidelines for Developing Business Continuity Plans (By Department) were issued in Japanese and then translated into English and Chinese for distribution to all Hitachi Group companies to enhance preparedness for major disasters and other risks.\n\nRegarding infectious diseases, we released the Hitachi Group Guidelines for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness in Japanese, English, and Chinese. In fiscal 2020, they served as a useful tool in dealing with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nWe have also appointed personnel with responsibility for risk-response policies at our main overseas bases. Around 300 overseas Group companies prepared BCPs to strengthen their ability to respond to business risks including major disasters, infectious diseases, political instability, social disruption, and acts of terrorism.\n\nBCP Initiatives in Japan\n\n- Creating BCPs for major earthquakes, wind and flood damage, as well as novel strains of influenza as appropriate to each business operation (from fiscal 2011)\n- Conducted earthquake drills simulating a major seismic event (annually)\n- Conducted initial response drills simulating a major earthquake in the suburbs of Tokyo (fiscal 2018)\n- Developed action plans including setting up substitute headquarters in the Kansai region in case our Tokyo headquarters temporarily cease to function (fiscal 2017) and conducted drills to set up the substitute headquarters (fiscal 2019)\n- Conducted drills to set up an earthquake task force on a remote-work basis on the assumption that a major seismic event had occurred on a holiday, shutting down traffic (fiscal 2019)\n- Conducted drills to set up an earthquake task force on a remote-work basis on the assumption that all work is conducted remotely (fiscal 2020)\n\nResponding to COVID-19\n\nA COVID-19 task force led by the president of Hitachi, Ltd. was established at Group headquarters to provide instructions on preventive measures to Group companies worldwide. Similarly, each Group company formed its own task force to secure the safety of its employees and business continuity while helping to maintain the social infrastructure through their business operations. Our regional headquarters around the world gather local information as well as share information on the measures taken by Hitachi Group companies in their respective regions.\nImproving Safety for Employees Sent to Dangerous Regions\n\nThe president of Hitachi, Ltd. strengthened our policy of ensuring the safety of employees sent to countries and areas at high risk of conflicts, terrorism, and other threats. On-site surveys are also conducted by in-house and outside experts beforehand. After employees are dispatched, we conduct additional local surveys every six months to confirm the effectiveness of our safety policies.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. is also contributing to safety measures at other Japanese corporations operating outside Japan. To help enhance collaboration between the private and public sectors in this area, we participate in the Council for Public-Private Cooperation for Overseas Safety organized by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and take part in public-private exercises to counter terrorism and kidnapping.\n\nProcurement BCPs Initiatives\n\nOur procurement divisions are also working to enhance BCPs across Group companies worldwide so that the occurrence of incidents does not disrupt business and have a significant impact on society.\n\nFor example, to minimize the impact of disasters that may occur, the procurement divisions in business units and key Group companies in Japan do the following: (1) standardize and use generic parts to make procurement as flexible as possible; (2) cultivate multiple suppliers; (3) distribute production across several locations; (4) budget inventory strategically; and (5) consider substitute products.\n\nWe held desktop exercises to see whether or not procurement BCPs would be effective against earthquakes and to make further improvements held group discussions about what should be done during and after such disasters.\n\nWe collaborate on these activities with procurement divisions in business units and key Group companies outside Japan as well as reviewing and sharing strategies in an effort to enhance procurement BCPs throughout the Group worldwide.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, all major Group business sites in Japan with production lines (147 sites in total) took steps to strengthen the procurement BCPs. In January 2020, we introduced the Procurement BCPs Management System for our business partners in Japan to efficiently share information among Hitachi Group companies during disasters.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Hitachi Group CSR/BCP Procurement Committee, which includes members from business units and key Group companies, provided a supplier diagnostic tool to procurement divisions in an effort to support suppliers\u2019 BCP initiatives.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\nIn fiscal 2020, with demonstrations occurring around the world and also the COVID-19 pandemic, we endeavored to ensure the safety of our employees working around the globe with a range of safety measures. These included the timely provision of information to employees by alerts we issued and information from outside risk consultants posted on our intranet. In addition, we employed an outside specialist to provide medical assistance to Hitachi Group employees outside Japan.\nAchievements in Fiscal 2020\n\n- Disseminating information security policies\n- Strengthening information management\n- Preventing information leaks\n- Providing education programs on information security\n- Conducting thorough information security audits and inspections\n- Personal information protection\n- Managing customer information\n\nIn addition to ISO/IEC27001, which is an international standard, we are promoting compliance with the U.S. government standard SP800-171 in our Global Information Security Management Regulations to strengthen information security governance globally.\n\nBuilt a cyber monitoring environment that continually adopts the latest technology to defend against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\nHeld e-learning programs on information security and personal information protection (participating employees: around 40,000)\n\nConducted Information security and personal information protection audits at all Group companies and business units (annual)\n\nConducted audits of 153 Hitachi Group companies in Japan including Hitachi, Ltd. in the same manner as at Hitachi, Ltd. and Hitachi, Ltd. confirmed all results\n\nPersonal information leaks: 0\n\nPrivacy protection initiatives by Hitachi\u2019s IT Sector\n- Published opinion surveys on use of consumer data in big data businesses\n- Hitachi initiatives were included in the Guidebook on Corporate Governance for Privacy in Digital Transformation (DX) ver.1.1 released by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry.\nInformation Security\n\nInformation Security Policies\n\nHitachi considers one of its top management priorities to be information security governance to minimize the risk of business disruption such as leaks of information or operational stoppages due to cyberattacks. The Japan Business Federation\u2019s Declaration of Cyber Security Management also places emphasis on cyber security measures as a critical management challenge from the aspects of both value creation and risk management. Hitachi approaches the issue of information security governance based on the same philosophy.\n\nAt the same time, as a global company, we regard cyber security risk as one of our management risks. Accordingly, to enable us to declare both internally and externally Group policies for addressing this risk, we have formulated Information Security Policies in line with our corporate management policies and based on our cyber security risk management.\n\nWe have our data centers and other divisions certified by the ISMS Accreditation Center in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System international standard. This certification has been received by seven divisions of Hitachi, Ltd. and 28 divisions of 23 Group companies.*\u00b9\n\nInformation Security Policies\n\n1. Formulation and continuous improvement of information security management regulations\n2. Protection and continuous management of information assets\n3. Strict observance of laws and standards\n4. Education and training\n5. Incident prevention and management\n6. Assurance of fair business practices within the corporate group\n\nFramework for Promoting Information Security\n\nAt Hitachi, Ltd., the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who is the C-level executive with ultimate authority and responsibility regarding the handling of information security and personal privacy issues oversees the promotion of information security for all Hitachi products, services, and internal facilities.\n\nChaired by the CISO, the Information Security Committee determines all policies and procedures for information security and personal information protection. As a general principle, heads of business units and divisions serve as information security officers. They also establish information security promotion departments, work to implement information security management in each workplace, and provide relevant education to employees.\n\nThis framework is also implemented at Group companies to promote information security across the Group through mutual cooperation.\n\n*\u00b9 As of March 31, 2021.\nPreventing Information Leaks\n\nHitachi takes the following IT steps to prevent information leaks: encrypting devices; using thin clients;\u00b9 employing electronic document access control and expiration processing software; maintaining ID management and access control by building an authentication infrastructure; and filtering e-mails and websites. In response to the recent spate of targeted e-mail attacks and other cyberattacks, we are participating in an initiative to share information between the private sector and the government. We are also enhancing various IT measures such as a defense in depth strategy.\n\nTo prevent leaks from our suppliers, we review their information security measures based on Hitachi\u2019s own standards before allowing them access to confidential information. We also provide tools to suppliers for security education and for checking business information on computers. In addition, we require suppliers to check and remove business information from personal computers.\n\n\u00b9 Threat intelligence: An approach to countering cyberattacks using the latest technology.\n\n\u00b9\u00b9 Thin client: A terminal with the minimum necessary software. Thin client computing significantly enhances cyber security by storing applications and data on the server.\nPersonal Information Protection\n\nPersonal Information Protection Policy\n\nHitachi, Ltd.\u2019s Personal Information Protection Policy sets out its corporate philosophy and principles on personal information protection. The policy is disseminated to all executive officers and employees as well as being publicly available.\n\nA personal information protection management system based on the policy has also been established. Through the rollout of the system, as well as the safe handling of personal information, programs for all employees, and periodic audits we are ensuring protection of personal information.\n\nPrivacyMark*\u00b9 Certification\n\nHitachi, Ltd. has received PrivacyMark certification. The entire Hitachi Group is committed to personal information protection with 39 Hitachi Group companies having received the PrivacyMark as of March 31, 2021.\n\nHitachi also strives to safeguard personal information globally at Group companies outside Japan based on each company\u2019s personal information protection policy and ensures that they comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country and region as well as the expectations of society at large.\n\nThere were no cases of personal information leakage during fiscal 2020.\n\n*\u00b9 PrivacyMark: A third-party certification established in April 1998 that is granted by the assessment body the Japan Information Processing Development Corporation to businesses that have taken appropriate security management and protection measures related to personal information.\n\nResponding to Personal Data Protection Laws Around the World\n\nWith the increasing risk of privacy violations in recent years due to the advent of the digital age following advances in IT and the globalization of socio-economic activities, lawmakers are actively seeking to create and modify relevant laws and legislation in countries and regions around the world. Hitachi pays close attention to relevant laws and legislation on a global basis including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and makes efforts to comply with them across the Group. We also monitor relevant legislation and social trends and take action when necessary.\n\nManagement Framework for Customer Information\n\nHitachi has deployed customer relations management (CRM) systems at approximately 200 Group companies, which allow us to collect and accurately manage customer and transaction information, in addition to using it as a marketing tool. This covers more than 80% of the orders received across the whole Group with the database enabling us to formulate more effective sales strategies and offer collaborative solutions by multiple businesses.\n\nPrivacy Protection Initiatives by Hitachi\u2019s IT Sector\n\nWe are taking proactive steps to protect privacy to ensure that personal data is used safely and securely. In our IT sector, which leads our digital business, we have assigned a personal data manager responsible for privacy protection and established a privacy protection advisory committee to support risk assessments and develop countermeasures based on its knowledge and expertise of privacy protection. In accordance with the policies set by the committee, our employees implement privacy impact assessments for processes where personal data will be handled and take measures to prevent privacy violations. In fiscal 2020, the number of cases where personal data was handled increased because of our measures against COVID-19. The committee has issued guidance on privacy protection items of this sort and is putting measures in place based on this guidance.\n\nFurthermore, we regularly conduct consumer opinion surveys on the use of consumer data in big data businesses. The 2020 survey revealed trends thought to be attributable to the current social climate such as expectations for measures using personal data to help counter the spread of COVID-19. Initiatives to regularly survey consumer opinions and then use this information to assess and improve measures are\nregarded as important and are taken up as examples in the Guidebook on Corporate Governance for Privacy in Digital Transformation (DX) ver.1.1 published by Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) and the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry.\n## Governance Data\n\n### Corporate Governance\n\n#### Leadership Demographics\n\n| Unit | Gender | Nationality |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n|      | Total  | Male | Female | Japanese | Non-Japanese |\n| Directors*1 | 13 | 11 | 2 | 7 | 6 |\n| Executive officers*1 | 32 | 31 | 1 | 28 | 4 |\n| Executive officers and corporate officers*1*3 | 69 | 62 | 7 | 61 | 8 |\n\nRatios of female and non-Japanese executive officers and corporate officers:\n\n- Female: 10.1%\n- Non-Japanese: 11.6%\n\n---\n\n*1 As of June 2021\n*2 Including 10 independent directors (four from Japan and six from outside Japan)\n*3 Including fellows\n## Compliance\n\n### Compliance Reporting System\n\n| Reporting Boundary | FY 2016 | FY 2017 | FY 2018 | FY 2019 | FY 2020 |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Hitachi Group      | \u2014       | \u2014       | \u2014       | 459     | 639     |\n\n*1 Disclosures began in fiscal 2019.\nTo enhance the reliability of the data disclosed in the Hitachi Sustainability Report 2021, we have received independent assurance of key environmental and social performance indicators by KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd.
