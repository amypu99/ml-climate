These challenges serve as a stark reminder of our call to action for securing a \u2018sustainable future.\u2019\n\nIn this context, we drastically strengthened our sustainability governance to highlight that \u2018sustainability\u2019 remains our top priority in our business operations and to embed this priority in every aspect of the organization.\n\nIn addition to establishing the Sustainability Management Office within each business unit and elevating the existing company-wide function as the Corporate Sustainability Center, we expanded the Governance Committee under the Board of Directors as the Sustainability Committee in 2021 to reinforce the Board\u2019s oversight of sustainability activities. We also placed the Sustainability Council, an executive-level consultative body, under the direct leadership of the CEO in 2022.\n\nThese changes have perfected a virtuous cycle where the pursuit of sustainability leads to advanced products and enhanced business competitiveness.\n\nOur sustainability governance serves as a momentum in identifying new drivers for sustainable growth, strengthening our future competitiveness, and fulfilling our corporate responsibility.\n\nOur eco-conscious advances, including low-power semiconductors, the SmartThings Energy service designed to reduce energy consumption using AI-based energy-saving features on smart appliances, the SolarCell Remote Control charged by sunlight or indoor lighting, and smartphone models made with materials recycled from discarded fishing nets, are the proud results of our continued pursuit of sustainability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and intensifying international conflicts once again remind us that cooperation with diverse stakeholders is imperative in ensuring success as a global company. We will continue to mutually grow and advance with communities we serve by capitalizing on our rich legacy, expertise, and wealth of resources.\n\nWe will expand our corporate citizenship activities centered on nurturing the technological prowess of the younger generations, while reinforcing and launching forward-looking initiatives to narrow the technological gap amid the transition to a digital society, including support for SMEs through the smart factory system. We will provide tailored training and consulting for our partner companies and related smart factory support to assist them with the green transition.\n\nTo achieve meaningful progress and have material impact, we believe it is critical to communicate and work together with all stakeholders. In this context, we joined the United Nations Global Compact, an initiative to encourage businesses to adopt sustainable policies, earlier this year. We will continue to seek opportunities to reach out to and cooperate with our diverse stakeholders to catalyze more meaningful changes to the environment and communities by engaging in partnerships with other industrial sectors, civil society groups, and international organizations.\n\nThe world is currently facing many tough challenges \u2013 political, economic and social. There are even skepticisms about whether a sustainable future for our planet is possible. However, we firmly believe that our competitiveness and sustainable growth goes hand in hand with harnessing our technological solutions to preserve the environment and contribute to building a better world.\n\nWe look forward to your continued interest and support in our journey to achieving a sustainable future.\n\nThank you.\nCompany Overview\n\nWe aim to make a positive contribution to people\u2019s everyday lives by offering products and services of great quality built with our innovative technology by our talented workforce. The Global Code of Conduct articulates our commitment to helping the world move forward based on our five Key Values. We will uphold the Key Values and achieve the goals of the Global Code of Conduct by challenging the status quo.\n\nAbout Our Organization\n\nSamsung Electronics is divided into two main divisions\u2014DX (Device eXperience) and DS (Device Solutions)\u2014and we ensure that each division is operated independently. DX took a new leap forward with the integration of the CE Division (responsible for TVs, monitors, air conditioners, refrigerators, etc) and the IM Division (responsible for mobile devices, network systems, computers, etc) in 2021. This integration is aimed at reflecting more differentiated products and services to optimize consumer experiences. The DS division consists of Memory, System LSI, Foundry businesses, etc.\n\n* Sales and Operating Profit above are based on 2021 figures, excluding SDC and Harman.\nGlobal Network\n\nAs of the end of 2021, our global business network consists of more than 230 production sites, sales offices, R&D centers, and design centers. We have 15 regional offices around the world, including our global headquarters in Korea, as well as in North America, Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa, and other regions.\n\n| Regions | Regional Offices | Sales Offices | Production Sites | R&D Centers | Design Centers | Others |\n|---------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|--------|\n| Total   | 15              | 54            | 32               | 39          | 7              | 83     |\n\n1) Regional classification is based on Samsung Electronics\u2019 internal management criteria\n2) Sales Branches, Service Centers, Distribution Bases, etc.\nCorporate Governance\n\nOur Board of Directors welcomed new members appointed at the general shareholders meeting in March 2022. The heads of all major business divisions, including DX and DS, are now executive directors on the Board, with the goal of achieving responsible management. Additionally, outside experts in a range of fields are serving as independent directors to help maintain accountability. A former global investment expert was appointed as an independent director to help us better identify the needs and views of global investors, and to enhance diversity and inclusion, we appointed additional non-Korean director. In July 2021, the Governance Committee was replaced by the Sustainability Committee to better promote sustainability management while enhancing shareholder value.\n\nBoard Composition\n\nThe Board consists of no less than three and no more than 14 members pursuant to Article 24 of the Articles of Incorporation. Although Article 383 of the Commercial Act simply mandates that a board of directors shall have no less than three members, we internally set the maximum number at 14 considering our corporate scale and the operational and decision-making efficiency of the Board. At the general shareholders meeting held in March 2022, three independent directors and four executive directors were newly appointed, thus bringing the total number of directors to 11 (six independent directors and five executive directors). With Independent Directors Han Wha-jin and Park Byung-gook resigning from the Board on April 20, 2022 and May 17, 2022, respectively, the two posts will be filled at the next general shareholders meeting pursuant to Article 542-8 (3) of the Commercial Act. As of the end of May 2022, the Board consists of nine members, including four independent directors.\n\nIndependence and Transparency of the Board\n\nTo ensure independence and transparency in the operation of the Board, we prohibited holding the concurrent positions of the Chairman of the Board and the CEO in 2018. We also appointed one of the independent directors as the Chairman, a first in the Company\u2019s history, and we did so again in March 2020. The Chairman remains open to the opinions and suggestions of the executive and independent directors and serves as a mediator to ensure that the Board oversees our corporate management in a more objective manner. The independent directors hold separate meetings to seek ways to deliver leadership results across all aspects of our business operations, including the creation of shareholder value.\n\nDirector Appointment and Term of Office\n\nDirectors are appointed by the resolution of shareholders at the general shareholders meeting in accordance with Article 382 of the Commercial Act. Executive directors are selected among the candidates recommended by the Board, while independent directors are selected among the candidates recommended by the Independent Director Recommendation Committee pursuant to Article 542-8 of the Commercial Act. The same Article stipulates that the majority of an independent director recommendation committee must be composed of independent directors. Our Independent Director Recommendation Committee consists only of independent directors and strictly abides by the preset candidate recommendation procedures. Each director\u2019s term of office is three years. A director may be reappointed through the general shareholders meeting after the end of his/her term. However, an independent director\u2019s total term is restricted to six years pursuant to the Commercial Act.\n\nExpertise and Diversity of the Board\n\nThe fast-changing business environment requires that the Board be equipped with expertise and diversity to help our company take forward-looking, strategic steps. We take extra care to ensure diversity on the Board in terms of nationality, gender, religion etc. Independent directors, in particular, are selected among experts in finance, law, IT, public sector, ESG, and other fields. They bring diverse perspectives to find optimal solutions and offer objective and professional oversight and advice to the executive management.\n\nBoard Values\n\nThose responsible for our everyday business affairs, our largest shareholders and other important stakeholders, and those who have experience working for our company within the last two years are not eligible to be appointed as an independent director.\n\nExecutive directors shall be appointed from among the candidates recommended by the Board, and candidates for independent directors shall be recommended by the Independent Director Candidate Recommendation Committee composed of all independent directors.\n\nIndependent directors are selected among those equipped with rich knowledge and experience in business management, economy, accounting, law, technology, and sustainability management.\n\nTo ensure diversity in the Board, we do not limit independent director candidates by nationality, gender, place of birth, religion, area of expertise, etc.\n\nBoard Composition\n\n| Position                  | Name                  | Area of Specialty                  | Career Highlights                                                                 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Chairman and Independent director | Kim Han-jo*          | Finance and CSR                    | Chairman, Hana Nanum Foundation/ Former Vice Chairman, Hana Financial Group        |\n| Executive directors      | Han Jong-hee          | DX                                 | CEO and Vice Chairman, Samsung Electronics/ Head, DX Division and Visual Display Business, Samsung Electronics |\n|                          | Kyung Kye-hyun*       | DS                                 | CEO and President, Samsung Electronics/ Head, DS Division, Samsung Electronics      |\n|                          | Roh Tae-moon*         | MX                                 | President and Head, MX Business, Samsung Electronics/ Former Head, Development Office, Mobile Division, Samsung Electronics |\n|                          | Park Hark-kyu*        | Corporate Management               | President and Head, Corporate Management Office, DX Division, Samsung Electronics/ Former Head, Corporate Management Office, DS Division, Samsung Electronics |\n|                          | Lee Jung-bae*         | Memory Business                    | President and Head, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics/ Former Head, DRAM Development Office, Memory Business, Samsung Electronics |\n| Independent directors    | Kim Sun-uk            | Law and Human Rights               | Professor Emeritus, School of Law, Ewha Womans University/ Former Minister, Ministry of Government Legislation/ Former member, Policy Advisory Committee, National Human Rights Commission of Korea |\n|                          | Kim Jeong-hun         | IT and Business Operation          | Executive Chairman, Kiswe Mobile/ Former President, Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs       |\n|                          | Kim Jun-sung*         | Finance and Investment             | CIO, Endowment Fund, National University of Singapore/ Former Managing Director, Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) |\n\n* Directors newly appointed or reappointed at the general shareholders meeting in March 2022\n** Independent Directors Han Wha-jin and Park Byung-gook resigned from the Board on April 20, 2022 and May 17, 2022, respectively. Their posts will be filled by the resolution of the next general shareholders meeting.\nOperation\nWe hold seven ordinary Board of Directors meetings each year for the quarterly approval of financial statements and the regular convocation of the general shareholders meeting. Beyond regular meetings, the Board of Directors hold special meetings whenever the need arises.\n\nBoard Convocation\nTo convene a Board meeting, the Chairman notifies each director of the date, time, venue, and agenda at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, pursuant to Article 30 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 8 of the Board of Directors Regulations. Individual directors are entitled to request the Chairman to convene a Board meeting, with the agenda and reasons clearly defined, if deemed necessary. If the Chairman fails to uphold this responsibility without justifiable reason, the respective director may convene a Board meeting.\n\nBoard Resolution\nPursuant to Article 31 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 9 of the Board of Directors Regulations, an agenda item is deemed to have been resolved with the attendance of a majority of the directors and a majority vote of the attendees unless otherwise prescribed in relevant laws. As specified in Article 391 of the Commercial Act, all directors may participate in a Board meeting digitally using remote telecommunications devices capable of simultaneous voice transmission and reception. We systematically avoid potential conflicts of interest by restricting the voting rights of those directors with special interests in certain agenda items pursuant to Article 9 of the Board of Directors Regulations.\n\nCommittees under the Board\nThe Board delegates its authorities to six affiliated committees pursuant to Article 28-2 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 11-2 of the Board of Directors Regulations to ensure greater efficiency. The Management Committee comprises five executive directors entrusted with relevant authorities to resolve general management matters in a timely manner. The other five committees consist of only independent directors to reinforce independence. The composition, operation, and authorities of each committee are specified in the individual committee regulations enacted by the resolution of the Board. Matters resolved by the committees are notified to all directors within two days. Directors may request the Chairman of the Board to convene a Board meeting if deemed necessary, and the Board may reconsider and revote on the decisions made by each committee. However, the Audit Committee\u2019s decisions are not subject to revote to ensure its independence.\n\nEvaluation of Independent Directors\nIndependent directors are evaluated on all of their Board activities based on our internal criteria. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted by considering their meeting attendance rates, performance as individual committee members, level of expertise, understanding of material issues, and endeavors to ensure independence. Evaluation results are used as reference to innovate Board operations and enhance the efficiency and composition of the Board and its affiliated committees.\n\n\u201cWith sustainability continually growing in importance as a key driver of corporate growth, the roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors continue to expand in both breadth and depth. As an extension of our efforts to effectively address ESG issues and improve our ESG performance, we reconfigured the Governance Committee into the Sustainability Committee in July 2021. The Board will strive to ensure the integrity and transparency of the Board and help our company march forward as a responsible corporate citizen.\u201d\n\n- Kim Han-jo, Chairman of the Board of Directors -\nCompliance and Ethics\n\nPrinciples of Compliance and Ethics\nAt Samsung Electronics, compliance with laws and ethical standards is the top priority among our Business Principles. We disclose our Business Principles to external stakeholders, including partners, customers, and investors, via our website.\n\nTo achieve sustainable growth as a leading global company, we continually work to ensure compliance and ethics across all aspects of business. Through our commitment to compliance and ethics, we strive to conduct our business in compliance with laws and ethical standards, and build a sound corporate culture that is free from illegal and unfair practices.\n\nManagement of Compliance and Ethics\nWe operate the Compliance Team, which directly reports to the CEO, and the Chief Compliance Officer attends all Board meetings and the Management Committee\u2019s meetings to ensure lawful decision-making. The Compliance Team implemented the Compliance Program Management System (CPMS), an IT system that enables efficient management of Compliance and Ethics, while also managing potential risks in the focused areas of management (anti-corruption, fair trade, intellectual property rights, privacy protection, labor and human rights, environment and safety, etc.)\n\nFocused Areas of Management\n\n| Anti-corruption | Fair Trade |\n|-----------------|------------|\n| Intellectual Property Rights | Consumer Protection |\n| Privacy Protection | Trade |\n| Labor and Human Rights | Environment and Safety |\n| Subcontracting |\n\nIn order to uphold a fair corporate culture, we post \u2018Employees Business Conduct Guidelines\u2019 on our intranet system to encourage our employees to practice ethical management in their daily activities. For our partner companies, we post Samsung Electronics Business Guidelines, which detail prohibited business practices, on the websites they use.\n\nCompliance and Ethics Program\nWe are operating an effective Compliance and Ethics Program aimed at promoting compliance and ethical management through the three stages of prevention, monitoring, and response.\n\nPrevention\nWe provide employees with detailed compliance policies and guidelines via CPMS for reference when performing their tasks. To minimize legal risks, we also identify the latest regulatory trends and provide training programs for employees. If employees have questions or require assistance determining the legality of specific matters based on the guidelines, they can seek one-on-one consultation with experts at the help desk on CPMS.\n\nMonitoring\nCompliance and ethics audits are conducted annually by the organizational units and staff members in charge. The results are reported to the Board of Directors at least once a year. Whistleblowing channels have been established to facilitate the reporting of legal violations committed by our company or individual employees. We ensure whistleblower confidentiality and protect whistleblowers from discriminatory and retaliatory actions.\n\nResponse\nWe devise ways to prevent recurrences of compliance violations by improving the process based on audit results as well as responses to submitted reports. If any violations are detected, disciplinary and remedial actions are taken pursuant to our internal standards based on the gravity of the specific incident. We also operate compliance and ethics programs along with annual legal risk assessment. We evaluate the effectiveness of our compliance control system, including compliance and ethics programs, and report the results to the Board of Directors once a year.\n\nCompliance and Ethics Program\n\nCompliance and Ethics Training\nWe operate a wide range of compliance and ethics training programs to minimize risk and prevent any illegalities that may occur during everyday business activities.\n\nTraining for Top Management\nBased on our strong belief that the leadership of top management plays an instrumental role in reinforcing compliance and ethical management, we provide compliance training targeted to our executive management. In June 2021, the Chief Compliance Officer conducted training for the CEOs and top executives on precautions to take while performing their duties.\n\nEmployee Training on Ethical Standards and Compliance\nWe conduct training on ethical standards in various formats for all of our employees at least once a year. Additionally, we conduct annual mandatory compliance training (including anti-corruption training) to highlight our focus on compliance and ethical management. In 2021, we offered job-specific training courses to allow employees to receive training aligned with their specific jobs and tasks.\n\n1) Refer to the Ethics training and Compliance training in Facts and Figures section.\nAudits and Whistleblowing\nWe are equipped with organizational units and members dedicated to performing compliance and ethics audits, operating whistleblowing channels, and handling whistleblowing investigations.\n\nCompliance and Ethics Audits\nWe perform both regular and special audits of ethical standards and compliance on our business sites in Korea and abroad and report the results to the Board of Directors at least once a year. We identify points of improvement based on the results and reflect them in our business activities to ensure company-wide compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\n\nIn 2021, we monitored our domestic business sites for compliance with the mandates in the Occupational Safety and Health Act and conducted online checks of the operation status of the compliance program at our overseas business sites. We also investigated whether our business sites were in compliance with our external sponsorship review process at our overseas business sites. We also investigated whether our business sites were in compliance with our external sponsorship and internal transactions review processes built to ensure the prevention of risks in relation to corruption and unfair internal transactions. The results showed that our performance was satisfactory overall, and we implemented remedies in areas deemed capable of further improvement pursuant to our internal standards.\n\nCompliance and Ethics Whistleblowing\nIn addition to the existing in-house whistleblowing channel targeting our employees, we opened a new whistleblowing channel for external stakeholders on our website (Samsung.com > Ethics&Compliance Management https://sec-compliance.net) in 2020. Contact information including the email address, telephone number, and fax number is posted online to help whistleblowers submit reports easily.\n\nWe protect the confidentiality of whistleblowers\u2019 identities and reports based on our internal regulations, and all of our whistleblowing channels guarantee anonymity. All reports submitted are handled in accordance with our internal standards for the entire whistleblowing process, from reporting to investigation and remedial action. The opening of new whistleblowing channels has led to a steady increase in the number of reports from 2020 onwards. We conduct investigations on reports to verify their facts and take corrective measures. In 2021, we took disciplinary action against those who violated our internal processes and also against their managers. In accordance with internal guidelines, we discipline those verified to have committed infractions based on the severity of each incident and report the results to the Audit Committee twice a year.\n\n1) Refer to the status of Compliance whistleblowing and Ethics whistleblowing in facts and figures section.\n\nMajor Improvements for Compliance and Ethical Management\n\nAnti-Corruption Policy and Guidelines\nWe provide employees with our revised Global Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy in 2020 to highlight our unwavering commitment to compliance with domestic and international anti-corruption laws and ethical business practices. The Policy and detailed guidelines are posted on CPMS.\n\nDetails of the Global Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy\n\nI Preface\nThe purpose of this Policy is to offer our employees a clearly defined set of criteria for discerning and preventing corrupt practices.\n\nII Basic Principles\nWe abide by all anti-corruption laws and policies including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of the US, the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act of Korea. Engagement in providing money and valuables in exchange for unfair gains and soliciting public officials for illegal acts or abuse of power is prohibited.\n\nIII Gifts, Hospitality, and Other Benefits\nGifts and hospitality provided must conform to all applicable laws and the policies of a recipient\u2019s organization, serve a legitimate business purpose, and be deemed reasonable in terms of price and frequency. The provision of benefits with any intent for unfair gains or the exercise of leverage is prohibited. Receiving gifts and hospitality, provided by partner companies with the expectation of reciprocity is prohibited.\n\nIV Donations, Contributions, and Sponsorships\nIllegal political donations from our assets are prohibited. Charity donations, contributions, and sponsorships must be made in compliance with our internal process without any intent for unfair gains and/or the exercise of leverage.\n\nV Third-Party Agents\nThe use of a third-party agent to evade anti-corruption laws is prohibited. Proper measures shall be taken when a third-party agent violates this Policy and/or relevant laws.\n\nVI Books and Records\nAll expenses must be recorded in accounting books and related documents and be preserved. Disclosing false information is strictly prohibited.\n\nVII Policy Implementation\nAnti-corruption compliance programs must be operated and continually improved to ensure effective implementation of this Policy. The head of the Corporate Compliance Team is vested with independent authority and responsibility for prevention of corruption and bribery.\nProcess for Anti-Corruption\nWe have strengthened the review process for external sponsorship expenditures in order to prevent potential corruption. The External Sponsorship Council, formed in 2017, conducts prior review of external sponsorships of KRW 10 million or above, and review results are reported to the Audit Committee. Approval of the Board of Directors is required for external sponsorship of KRW 1 billion or above.\n\nIn 2020, the Council\u2019s operations were strengthened by appointing the Chief Compliance Officer as its chairperson and expanding the review targets to encompass overseas subsidiaries. The anti-corruption review process was also established to conduct a necessary review and attain the Compliance Team\u2019s approval prior to vendor registration and contract conclusion.\n\nImprovements for Compliance-Oriented Culture\nTo foster a culture of compliance, we increased the weight of compliance-related factors in the executive evaluation in 2020 and added compliance-related factors to the organizational performance evaluation in 2021 as well. In 2020, we also implemented the SEC Annual Awards, presented by the CEO, which acknowledge the achievements of employee or organization in compliance management.\n\nSamsung Compliance Committee\nPurpose and Composition\nThe Samsung Compliance Committee (the Committee) was launched on February 5, 2020 under the aim of practicing integrity-based management, which is one of our key values, by reinforcing compliance monitoring and control over the seven major member companies of Samsung Group.\n\nThe Committee is an external organization with its independence and autonomy guaranteed. It comprises six external members, including the chairperson and one internal member. Lee Chan-hee, a former president of the Korean Bar Association, is currently serving as the second chairperson following the first chairperson, Kim Ji-hyung, a former justice of the Supreme Court of Korea. The Committee\u2019s external members are selected from experts equipped with knowledge and experience in diverse fields related to compliance monitoring (law, accounting, economy, public administration, etc.).\n\nKey Activities of the Committee\nThe Committee communicates with the Chief Compliance Officers of member companies through monthly meetings as well as special meetings. The Committee reviews reports from member companies regarding their external sponsorship and internal transactions, and it issues recommendations as an independent body. It also operates separate whistleblowing channels of its own to collect reports about compliance violations of the member companies via post, email, and external organizations. The details of its meetings with the member companies and the statements it releases are disclosed on its website.\n\nThe Committee held a conference with executive management, including the CEOs of the member companies, in January 2021 and met with the labor-management relations advisory group in April and November 2021. The Committee members actively promoted compliance by providing training for the member companies\u2019 executives in July and August 2021. It also held a seminar with outside experts in January 2022 to discuss the current status and points of improvement of compliance issues.\n\nImplementation of the Committee\u2019s Recommendations\nThe Committee delivers recommendations for a range of issues to improve the compliance management practices of member companies. We have faithfully crafted and implemented measures to ensure such recommendations are followed.\n\nFor the recommendation to establish measures to prevent recurring labor compliance risks, we formed a labor-management relations advisory group of outside experts under the Board of Directors and realigned all of our labor-related regulations to ensure the protection of the three primary labor rights. Regarding suggestion to enhance communication with civil society organizations, we have engaged in a range of activities to earn greater trust, such as staging a conference between senior members of civil society organizations and our executive management.\n\nFor the recommendations to include and expand compliance-related items in the evaluations of executives, we updated our internal regulations and increased the weight of compliance-related factors. We also established a quarterly council of the Chief Compliance Officers to enable them to discuss ways to reinforce the compliance monitoring activities of relevant organizational units at the member companies.\n\nWe will work in collaboration with the committee to establish an advanced monitoring program and compliance system and carefully manage the legal risks of the company and the management, implementing Integrity Management and building trust and respect from the public.\nAPPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY\n\nBusiness Sustainability 11\nSustainability Highlights of Major Products 13\nSustainability Achievements 16\nRecognition & Awards 17\nSustainability Governance 18\nStakeholder Engagement 19\nJoining UN Global Compact 20\nBusiness Model of Sustainability Management 21\nBusiness Sustainability\n\nDX | Device eXperience Division\n\nSustainability is a core value and key driver of our operations, and we strive to embed it in every product and service that we offer.

The council, which consists of environment-related executives, works to establish sustainability-related plans and review their outcomes.\n\nCorporate Environment Management Council\n\n- **Sustainability Committee**: Sets company-wide climate change response strategies and goals, identifies major risks and opportunities, and makes decisions on relevant agenda items.\n- **Sustainability Council**: Discusses company-wide climate change response strategies and goals, major risks and opportunities, and implementation performance.\n- **Environment Management Task Force**: Outlines tasks for for climate actions & resource circulation and monitors their implementation.\n- **EHS Councils (DS/DX divisions)**: Supervises and monitors each business site\u2019s climate actions and efforts to mitigate GHG emissions.\n- **Eco-Council**: Seeks ways to facilitate the development of eco-conscious products.\n\nThe Environment Management Task Force outlines the tasks required to accomplish such plans and monitors their implementation. Each division operates the EHS Council to monitor its business sites and find solutions to their environmental challenges, including issues resulting from climate change. The Eco-Council seeks ways to facilitate the development of eco-conscious products and monitors the results. The Global EHS Center, Global CS Center, and Environment and Safety Center are also in place to help business sites mitigate GHG emissions and reduce the environmental footprint of our products.\n\n**Management Systems**\n\nOur business sites are required to meet international standards for environmental management and energy management systems. As of 2021, all of our business sites have attained ISO 14001 (environmental management system) and ISO 50001 (energy management system) certifications and implemented strategies and tasks within these frameworks across all stages of operations, from purchasing to development, manufacturing, distribution, and recycling.\n\nWe also include GHG mitigation levels and other environmental indicators in the performance assessment of each division and business.\n\nIn order to raise our employees\u2019 awareness on the importance of eco-conscious management and eliminate environmental risks, we conduct environmental training for all employees at least once a year as well as special job-specific training.\n\n**Risk Management**\n\nRisks and opportunities related to climate change, waste generation, water resources, and other environmental factors have a serious impact on our products, services, manufacturing processes, supply chains, R&D, and sales. We closely monitor our business sites around the world to identify potential risks pursuant to our risk management processes and manuals for environment and safety, climate change and energy, and compliance.\n\nAt the same time, we strive to develop products with high energy efficiency, reduce GHG emissions from our manufacturing sites, minimize landfill waste, and preserve water resources.\n\n**CASE**\n\n**Semiconductor Environmental Performance Index (SEPI)**\n\nAs semiconductors are being implemented in a growing number of products, achieving eco-conscious semiconductor manufacturing has become a major issue with far-reaching impacts on many industries around the world. To transparently share our performance and practices, we developed environmental management guidelines tailored to the traits of the semiconductor industry and the Semiconductor Environmental Performance Index (SEPI), our internal semiconductor-related environmental management index disclosed on our website. Consisting of 32 indicators within six themes, SEPI is used to evaluate outcomes in four categories: contributions to eco-conscious semiconductor manufacturing, environmental management of partner companies, environmental performance of individual business sites, and environmental benefits for users. We aim to more accurately and efficiently communicate with diverse stakeholders by disclosing our performance systematically assessed through SEPI.\n\n1) Semiconductor Environmental Performance Index\n\n**The SEPI 5 principles**\n\n- Assess progress of environmental management areas\n- Assess the main environmental factors\n- Assess contribution to cleantech\n- Develop a characteristics index\n- Consult disclosed annual data\n- From systems to the whole value chain\n- Greenhouse gases, industrial water, waste and chemicals\n- Low-power, high-performance semiconductor supply\n- Technological standard and PFC emissions\n- Sustainability reports, annual reports, etc.\nEco-Conscious Activities along the Value Chain\n\nWe have pushed ahead with diverse environmental initiatives at different stages of the value chain to minimize our environmental footprint across the entire product life cycle, from development to purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, use, and disposal. Improvement plans and tasks for these priorities are established for climate action and resource circularity, the two areas requiring extensive concerted efforts at the global level. Their implementation status is closely monitored on a continuous basis.\nClimate Change Risk Management Process\n\nIdentification and Assessment of Risks\n\n- EHS, marketing, sales, and compliance organizational units regularly assess risks in relation to business operations, product planning, and external trends based on ISO 14001, ISO 50001, and other international standards for energy management systems.\n\nManagement of Risks and Opportunities\n\n- Energy consumption, GHG emissions, renewable energy use, and impacts of climate change are monitored by organizational units dedicated to EHS.\n- Relevant issues affecting global business sites are discussed and managed by regularly convened councils such as the EHS Council.\n- The Sustainability Council discusses and makes necessary decisions regarding climate change risks and opportunities.\n- The Eco-Council examines business opportunities, shares the results with relevant businesses and organizational units, and implements action plans.\n\nIntegration of Climate Risks and Opportunities into the Company-Wide Risk Management Process\n\n- Climate change-related regulatory risks are managed through the company-wide risk management system in an integrated manner.\n- Risks include region-specific risks and global regulatory and market changes that may adversely affect our business and reputation.\n\nClimate Change Risks and Opportunities\n\nWe identify the substantive financial and strategic impacts of climate change risks, establish response measures in accordance with the magnitude and extent of such impacts, and reflect them in our business. These risks include changes in the global climate system, region-specific regulatory reinforcement, market trends, stakeholder needs, the changing physical environment, and more. In the short term, we view emissions permit price increases, extreme weather events, and the requirement to introduce high-efficiency technologies as potential risks, and emissions permit purchasing and reduced energy costs as opportunities. We project changing consumption patterns and expanded renewable energy use as mid-term opportunities and the physical impacts such as climate change and water stress as long-term risks. We establish response measures for long-term risks based on the country-specific emissions mitigation plans pursuant to the Paris Agreement, emissions scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and Energy Technology Perspectives of the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nGHG Management\n\nWe closely monitor the GHGs generated at all of our business sites around the world. We require each business site to enter GHG data in relation to electricity use, fossil fuel use, and gas use in semiconductor manufacturing into the EHS System. This allows us to identify and analyze the causes of fluctuations in GHG levels at individual sites on a monthly basis. The organizational unit in charge keeps GHG emissions from domestic and overseas sites under control based on the findings of the analysis. The credibility and alignment of the data are verified through the annual third-party audit.\n\nClimate Change to Climate Change\n\nClimate change is one of the most serious threats facing humanity and a challenge that significantly affects our business. As such we have set up a climate change response strategy centered on the expansion of renewable energy use, reduction of gases used in semiconductor manufacturing, and improvement of energy efficiency across the entire manufacturing process.\n\nWe are also moving forward with a wide range of programs to mitigate GHG emissions in all stages of our value chain, from product development to manufacturing and logistics. The GHGs emitted outside our business sites, as well as those emitted directly by our business sites, are subject to such programs.\n\nOur Response to Climate Change by Stage\n\n- GHG emissions reduction at business sites\n  - Operating equipment for the abatement of fluorinated gases in semiconductor manufacturing\n  - Implementing projects to improve energy efficiency throughout the manufacturing process\n  - Expanding the use of renewable energy\n\n- GHG emissions reduction in the stage of product use\n  - Mitigating GHG emissions from product use through the development of products with high energy efficiency\n  - Developing low-energy semiconductors with power efficiency improved by over 10% compared to the previous generation\n\n- GHG emissions reduction in other value chain stages\n  - Controlling GHG emissions from suppliers, logistics companies, business trips of employees, etc.\n\n- GHG emissions reduction based on cooperation with external partners\n  - Securing emissions permits through carbon reduction projects with external partners, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)\nRisks and Opportunity Analysis\n\n### Climate Change Risks and Opportunities\n\n1. **GHG emissions trading**\n   - **Short-term**\n     - Increased costs due to the rise in GHG emissions permit prices and reinforced pollutant discharge regulations\n     - Refer to the Annual Business Report\n\n2. **Adoption of high-efficiency technologies**\n   - **Short-term**\n     - Increased investment in high-efficiency equipment, GHG emissions reduction equipment, and water resource recycling equipment\n     - Increased R&D investment to develop advanced emissions reduction technologies\n\n3. **Changes in customer behavior**\n   - **Mid-term**\n     - Increased costs for attaining high-efficiency and eco-conscious product certifications\n     - Reduced sales of products with low energy efficiency ratings\n     - Increased R&D costs for high-efficiency and eco-conscious products\n\n4. **Expansion of renewable energy use**\n   - **Mid-term**\n     - Increased production costs due to the rise in short-term energy costs\n     - Reduced B2B sales due to customer demand for renewable energy use\n\n5. **Natural disasters such as typhoons and floods**\n   - **Short-term**\n     - Increased investment costs for the installation of environmental/safety/emergency facilities for natural disaster prevention\n     - Increased costs for business restoration and lost business opportunities in the event of a natural disaster\n\n6. **Global temperature rise and yellow dust**\n   - **Long-term**\n     - Increased business site operating costs due to cooling and heating device installation, etc.\n     - Increased investment costs for air pollution prevention equipment installation\n\n### Financial Impacts of Climate Change Risks\n\n- Purchase of permits minimized through GHG emissions reduction activities\n- Easing of price sensitivity by attaining permits through projects in cooperation with outside partners\n\n### Financial Impacts of Climate Change Opportunities\n\n- Reduction of GHG emissions and energy costs of business sites\n- Creation of business opportunities such as energy management systems\n- Release of high-efficiency and eco-conscious products\n- Leading to increased sales and brand awareness\n- Energy cost reduction by sourcing renewable energy and participation in renewable power generation projects\n- Decreased insurance costs through investment in natural disaster response facilities\n- New business opportunities such as the launch of the National Disaster and Safety Network\n- Increased sales from the expansion of high-efficiency air conditioner, air purifier, and dryer businesses\nGHG Reduction Activities\n\nWe prioritize finding solutions for the eco-conscious treatment of gases used for semiconductor manufacturing, expansion of renewable energy use, and conservation of energy. With the recent expansion of facilities and increase in production, our business sites are working hard to minimize the increase in GHG emissions by enhancing manufacturing process efficiency and reducing energy consumption. For semiconductor manufacturing sites, we established the Decarbonization Committee to monitor their mitigation of GHG emissions every quarter based on our roadmap for the mitigation of GHG emissions. Each site is required to project its GHG emissions, identify tasks for the mitigation of GHG emissions in manufacturing processes, and implement action plans on a yearly basis. In 2021, we reduced GHG emissions by a total of 6.41 million tonnes through 476 projects including improving gas treatment equipment efficiency, installing high-efficiency equipment, and enhancing manufacturing efficiency.\n\nEnergy Conservation in the Manufacturing Process\n\n**IoT-Based Infrastructure** We monitor our energy consumption through IoT and AI-based HVAC system for better efficiency and control. Operation data from the central air conditioning system and individual air conditioning units is analyzed every minute to set the optimal control value, which is adjusted based on algorithms. This solution was applied to business sites in Korea, Vietnam, and the US and worked to reduce energy consumption by 11-13% per year. We plan to apply it in Europe, Southwest Asia, and Central and South America as well and are reviewing the possibility of sharing it with our partner companies.\n\n**Energy Reduction in Semiconductor Manufacturing** To reduce energy consumption across all stages of semiconductor manufacturing, we strive to innovate the process, reduce main equipment testing time through operation optimization, improve auxiliary equipment operation temperature conditions, install high-efficiency equipment, and neutralize the wet scrubber (harmful gas processing device). To reduce LNG use, we introduced the Regenerative Catalytic System (RCS) for heat sources on a pilot basis, while also collecting waste heat through the coolant system and heat exchanger and adjusting the air temperature and air flow of outdoor air control units. We plan to expand the implementation of the RCS depending on the results of on-site testing.\n\n**Energy Consumption Monitoring** We analyze our energy consumption in real time based on energy data, the operating status of major facilities, and product manufacturing information collected through IoT modules and sensors and display the findings on the monitoring system. We ran a pilot test of this system at our Vietnam business site in 2021 and plan to apply it to more sites, starting with those with greater energy consumption. The energy consumption monitoring system is capable of real-time energy consumption monitoring, target management, consumption management in accordance with production, and energy consumption pattern analysis for different time periods.\n\n**Reduction of Semiconductor Process Gases**\n\n**Improvement of Treatment Efficiency for Semiconductor Process Gases** To improve the efficiency and utilization of gas treatment facilities, we are expanding the installation of the Regenerative Catalytic System (RCS). In July 2020, we developed a new catalyst for GHG emissions reduction equipment through three years of joint R&D with our partner companies and raised the gas treatment rate to 95%.\n\n**Reduction in the Use of Semiconductor Process Gases** We are striving to minimize the use of semiconductor process gases while enhancing efficiency in gas treatment. To this end, we have pushed ahead with a project to optimize the processing time, stages, and recipes for individual processes and continue to monitor our performance on a monthly basis.\n\n**Development of Alternative Gases** We remain committed to developing and applying alternatives to replace gases with high global warming potential (GWP). Since 2018, we have used G\u2083 in lieu of C\u2084F\u2088 for some of the processes. We will continue to actively engage in R&D on alternatives for C\u2083F\u2086, CHF\u2083, C\u2082F\u2086, and SF\u2086.\n\n---\n\n**CASE**\n\n**Decarbonization Committee Operations**\n\nThe Decarbonization Committee oversees the operation of GHG emissions mitigation activities at our semiconductor manufacturing sites and secures technologies to address different emitters. The committee is chaired by the Head of Global Manufacturing and Infra Technology and comprises relevant organizational units including the EHS Center, Infrastructure Technology Center, and Manufacturing Technology Center. The committee establishes roadmaps for the reduction of emissions for different sources of GHGs, from semiconductor process gases to fossil fuels, electricity, and renewable energy. It also monitors the outcomes of GHG emissions mitigation activities on a quarterly basis.\nExpansion of Renewable Energy Use\n\nMid-to-Long-Term Renewable Energy Plan\n\nWe are expanding the use of renewable energy at our business sites around the world. The legal systems and infrastructure conditions, which vary by region, require region-specific transition plans. The business sites in the US, Europe, and China were converted to 100% renewable energy sources in 2020 and are in the process of replacing their REC system with the PPA system.\n\nThe rate of renewable energy in Brazil and Mexico increased to 94% and 71% in 2021, respectively. We expect to be able to attain 100% renewable energy in Latin America and Southwest Asia by 2025. These regions are considered more advantageous as PPA and Green Pricing are common practice.\n\nWe will actively expand the use of renewable energy in areas where the use of renewable is relatively low such as Southeast Asia and Africa, considering the legal system and infrastructure of respective countries.\n\nStatus of Major Business Sites\n\nKorea The Suwon and Gheung business sites are equipped with 19MW and 15MW-capacity photovoltaic power generators, respectively. The Pyeongtaek business site is equipped with a 0.4MW-capacity photovoltaic power generator and 200RT-capacity geothermal power generator. We installed a 0.08MW-capacity photovoltaic power generator at the Onyang business site in 2021. We plan to install an additional 0.2MW-capacity photovoltaic power generator at the Onyang business site and a 0.15MW-capacity photovoltaic power generator at the Gumi business site. We also purchased 490GWh of renewable energy using the Green Premium implemented in 2021. We will continually expand the use of photovoltaic and geothermal power generators, and the Green Premium, at our domestic business sites.\n\nCentral and South America The business site in Campinas, Brazil, completed its conversion to 100% renewable energy in 2021 by signing power supply contracts with local wind power, photovoltaic power, and hydropower stations. The business site in Manaus, Brazil, is currently powered by 92% renewable energy sourced from Green Pricing. The site plans to use 100% renewable energy by 2025. The business site in Mexico increased its share of renewable energy to 71% in 2021, up from 4% in 2020, through contracts including REC purchases. This site is seeking to further expand its renewable energy suppliers and achieve conversion to 100% renewable energy by 2025.\n\nSouthwest Asia The business site in Chennai, India, achieved 53% conversion to renewable energy by sourcing electricity from local photovoltaic power, wind power, and biomass power stations. The business site in Noida, India, installed photovoltaic power generators with a total capacity of 0.7MW in parking lots and pedestrian passages and is seeking to expand its network of renewable energy suppliers.\n\nMid-to-Long-Term Roadmap for Renewable Energy Usage\n\n| Year | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| 2018 | Declaration to expand the use of renewable energy |\n| 2020 | Business sites in the US, Europe, and China powered with 100% renewable energy |\n| 2025 | Business sites in Central and South America and Southwest Asia powered with 100% renewable energy |\n\nRenewable Energy Use (Unit: GWh)\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| 2019 | 3,220 | 4,030 | 5,278 |\n\nRenewable Energy Use in Major Regions with Operations (Unit: %)\n\n| Region | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|--------|------|------|------|\n| US     | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Europe | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| China  | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Brazil | 93   | 94   | 96   |\n| Mexico | 3.8  | 4.3  | 71   |\n| India  | 14   | 28   | 23   |\n\n1) In 2021, the rate of renewable energy use in India decreased, due to the increase in power consumption.\nProduct Energy Efficiency\n\nWe closely monitor the latest developments in environmental regulations and technologies to reduce energy consumption via the company-wide Eco-Council consisting of specialists in the field and each business unit\u2019s consultative body of working-level staff members. To mitigate GHG emissions in the product use phase, we continually develop and implement energy efficiency measures for new products. In 2021, the annual energy consumption of our products was reduced by an average of 33% compared to 2009 through the implementation of the high-efficiency heat exchangers for air conditioners, enhanced cleaning power for washers, and high-efficiency driver ICs for TVs.\n\nGHG Emissions Reduced in the Product Use Phase\n\n| Year | Amount (Unit: million tonnes CO2e) |\n|------|-----------------------------------|\n| 2019 | 270                               |\n| 2020 | 301                               |\n| 2021 | 334                               |\n\nHome Appliances\n\nSmartThings Energy is our AI-based solution that allows more energy-efficient use of connected home appliances. The solution monitors the energy consumption of smart home appliances, including refrigerators, washers, dryers, and air conditioners. It also offers a smart energy-saving mode.\n\nPCs\n\nWe enhanced the energy efficiency of our laptops by adding circuits designed to reduce the electricity loss of the OLED panel and optimized the energy consumption of chargers by eliminating standby power.\n\nFeature Story\n\nOur eco-conscious efforts for the planet, SolarCell Remote\n\nWhile seeking ways to produce more eco-conscious remote controls, we noted that existing remote controls all use disposable batteries. This means that each household discards 14 batteries throughout the typical life cycle of a TV, which is about seven years, by changing the disposable batteries once a year. To eliminate the use of disposable batteries, we developed the low-power SolarCell Remote that can charge itself with sunlight as well as indoor lighting. We plan to apply SolarCell Remote to all of our TV products released from 2022 onwards. Based on the estimated sales of TVs around the world, we expect to reduce the use of 200 million disposable batteries in 2022 alone.\n\n\u201cAs remote controls remain stationary most of the time and lights stay on after dark until bedtime, it is quite easy to charge them with indoor lighting. We can reduce GHG emissions by approximately 12,960 tonnes by replacing the disposable batteries in remote controls with solar cells considering the life cycle of TVs.\u201d\n\n- Kim Kwanyoung (Visual Display Engineer) -\nLife Cycle Assessment Process for Semiconductors\n\nWe went beyond attaining carbon footprint certification for some of our leading products and established the life cycle assessment (LCA) process for all of our products. We plan to develop assessment methods optimized for different product categories and ensure the credibility of the established process through third-party auditing. This is expected to more effectively deliver carbon emissions data to our corporate customers aiming to achieve carbon neutrality. It will also enhance transparency in information disclosure regarding semiconductor manufacturing. We will strive to further reduce our products\u2019 environmental impact across their life cycle stages.\n\nCASE\n\nLife Cycle Assessment Process for Semiconductors\n\nWe went beyond attaining carbon footprint certification for some of our leading products and established the life cycle assessment (LCA) process for all of our products.

This is expected to more effectively deliver carbon emissions data to our corporate customers aiming to achieve carbon neutrality. It will also enhance transparency in information disclosure regarding semiconductor manufacturing. We will strive to further reduce our products\u2019 environmental impact across their life cycle stages.\n\nLeadership in Process Technology\n\nWe developed advanced processing and design technologies to deliver high-performance semiconductors that consume less energy. For Exynos, our system-on-chip (SoC) series, we have continually enhanced the energy efficiency of the major cores of CPU, GPU, and NPU. At the same time, we have also installed AMIGO (Advanced Multi-IP Governor), our exclusive solution, to reduce battery consumption when activating high-definition and graphically demanding games and programs. For image sensors, we pioneered ultra-fine pixel technologies to deliver ultra-high resolution and minimize energy consumption during previews. For DTV, the SoC has been integrated with the high-resolution upscaling IC, while the previously separated two TCONs for 8K TVs have been integrated into one to minimize energy consumption. Our efforts to improve energy efficiency in all areas, from design to manufacturing and everyday use, are expected to reduce not only the battery charging time for smart devices, but also the energy consumption of other electronic products, thereby contributing to the mitigation of carbon emissions.\n\nGreen Technology Certification\n\nOur technological innovations aimed at achieving greater energy efficiency are certified as Green Technology by the Korean government. Since the inception of this system in 2010, we have attained certifications for a range of technologies. As of 2021, we hold ten Green Technologies, and 136 products featuring these technologies are confirmed as Green Technology Products.\n\nGreen Technology Certification Status\n\n| Product categories | Green Technologies                                                                 | Cases |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Home Appliances    | Dryers equipped with a high-efficiency heat pump and heat exchanger, energy efficiency improvement technology, etc. | 7     |\n| Monitors           | Monitors equipped with standby power reduction technology                           | 1     |\n| Laptops            | Laptops powered by high-efficiency power conversion technology                      | 1     |\n\n*Sleep-mode energy consumption reduction technology for printers (1 case)\nReducing GHG Emissions in Other Areas\n\nSupplier Management and Support\nWe joined the Supply Chain Program of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2019 to monitor the GHG emissions of our major suppliers and provide incentives to encourage renewable energy use.\n\nImproving Logistics Efficiency\nWe are engaging in measures to optimize transport routes, improve loading efficiency, and reinforce transport management to ensure greater logistics efficiency. As a result, we reduced a total of 16.6 million tonnes of GHG emissions in 2021 alone. Emissions from our logistics activities in Korea in 2021 decreased by 5% compared to 2020.\n\nMinimizing Business Trips\nIn 2021, business trips were restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and GHG emissions from business trips decreased by 38% compared to 2020. We promoted the use of video conferencing, and a total of 220,000 meetings were held online throughout 2021 (616 per day on average). This marks a 10% increase from 2020. We plan to further improve the accessibility and convenience of the video conference system.\n\nReplacing Corporate Vehicles with Zero-Emission Vehicles\nWe plan to replace all of the corporate vehicles, including passenger cars, shuttle buses, and trucks, used at our domestic business sites with electric vehicles by 2030. We will also install additional electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nCollaboration to Address Climate Actions\n\nObtaining Emissions Permits\nWe operate the Clean Development Mechanism projects in Kenya and India. In Kenya, we have provided low-carbon cooking stoves fueled by bioethanol to refugee camps since 2017. In India, we have distributed high-efficiency refrigerators tailored to local lifestyles since 2013. As the operator of these projects, we are entitled to emissions permits in accordance with our yearly GHG emissions reduction performance as approved by the United Nations. In Korea, we purchase emissions permits through landfill gas treatment at large landfills and N2O reduction activities in nitric acid production processes.\n\nCASE\n\nSmartphone Recycling\nAs an extension of our efforts to combat climate change, we operate a range of programs to recycle used smartphones. For example, we developed and launched the Samsung Knox-based app to enable African Clean Energy, a B Corp-certified company that distributes solar-biomass hybrid energy systems in developing countries, to connect used Galaxy phones to solar-powered cooking stoves distributed to households in Africa and measure data regarding their use.\n\nGHG Emissions\nOur total GHG emissions in 2021 stand at 17.4 million tonnes CO2e, a 17% increase from the previous year. While we made efforts to decrease the amount of GHGs generated and increase the percentage of renewable energy used at each business site, our total GHG emissions increased due to the installation and activation of the new semiconductor manufacturing lines. We plan to continually make efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by expanding the use of renewable energy, improving process gas treatment efficiency, developing alternative gases, replacing high-efficiency facilities, etc. To this end, we are developing a plan to predict our mid- to long-term greenhouse gas emissions and reduce greenhouse gas emissions continuously.\n\n| Year | Direct emissions (Scope 1) | Indirect emissions (Scope 2) |\n|------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2019 | 5,067                     | 8,733                       |\n| 2020 | 5,726                     | 9,079                       |\n| 2021 | 7,604                     | 9,796                       |\n\n1) Market-based GHG emissions that reflect renewable energy use / Location-based GHG emissions that do not reflect renewable energy use: 16,065 thousand tonnes CO2e in 2019, 17,405 thousand tonnes CO2e in 2020, and 20,173 thousand tonnes CO2e in 2021\nMaximizing Resource Circularity\n\nWe are striving to shift toward a circular economy where resources are reused and recycled efficiently from the linear economy that follows a \u201ctake-make-dispose\u201d paradigm. To this end, we have established our own circular economy principles and have engaged in a range of activities across all product life cycle stages such as development of circular products, improvement of repairability, take-back of e-waste, etc.\n\nCircular Economy Principles\n\nEfficient Use of Resources\n\nRecycled Materials\n\nWe are expanding the application of recycled plastic across a range of product categories including refrigerator, washer, air conditioner, vacuum cleaner, TV, monitor, smartphone, and PC. In 2021 alone, we used 33,000 tonnes of recycled plastic from discarded electronic goods, fishing nets, and plastic bottles, reaching a cumulative sum of 310,000 tonnes from 2009.\n\nEco-Package\n\nWe are replacing plastic and vinyl materials with paper and recycled materials to reduce the environmental impact of our product packaging. We are also reducing the volume and weight of packaging to mitigate GHG emissions in the transportation and shipping process. We use sustainably sourced paper and recycled paper.\n\nDisplays and Home Appliances\n\nWe use recycled expandable polystyrene (EPS) cushions in the packaging for our major TV models and plan to include them in the packaging for all of our products from 2022 onwards. In 2020, we introduced TV packaging designed to be upcycled into a range of objects for pets or small pieces of furniture based on ideas from consumers around the world. This Eco-Packaging was used for all TV models and some home appliances including air purifiers.\n\nMobile Devices\n\nThe packaging for Galaxy S22, Galaxy Tab S8, and other flagship models are made with 100% recycled paper, while film screen protectors are made with 100% recycled PET bottles. We are replacing the plastic materials used for DLC bands and APS covers with paper to achieve plastic-free packaging by 2025.\n\nSemiconductors\n\nAll paper packaging for our products is made with 100% sustainably sourced paper, and we are working to apply paper packaging to more products. We first replaced the plastic tray packaging of our portable consumer SSDs with paper packaging in 2020, and now three of our consumer SSDs come with plastic-free paper packaging.\n\nModular Design\n\nThe modular design of our customizable BESPOKE refrigerator line-up enables users to update the design of their product by simply replacing the door panels. The BESPOKE Cube Air Purifier is stackable as a modular unit. If greater capacity is required, additional units can be purchased and stacked on the existing unit, thereby saving resources and space.\n\nCASE\n\nRecycled Ocean-Bound Plastic in Our Products\n\nWe strive to increase the use of sustainable materials in smartphones and tablets. To that end, we have developed innovative technologies to recycle waste fishing nets to reduce ocean plastic pollution. The Galaxy S22 series smartphones and Galaxy Tab S8 series tablets are built with parts that contain ocean-bound plastic. We plan to apply recycled plastic to the entire Galaxy series.\n\nRecycled Ocean-Bound Plastic in Our Products\n\nWe strive to increase the use of sustainable materials in smartphones and tablets.

The Asan Recycling Center, Korea\u2019s very first recycling center for electronic goods, has been in operation since 1998 and is connected to our logistics centers in various regions for e-waste collection. Our overseas subsidiaries take back and recycle discarded electronic goods in collaboration with local recycling organizations and service providers. Collected electronic goods are sorted, pre-processed, and pressed to be reused as materials for new product manufacturing. We also operate internal Requirements for Recycling Service Partners that specify EHS-related laws and regulations, supplier management, the prohibition of illegal waste export, etc.\n\nTake-Back and Recycling Achievements\n\nWe collected a total of 5.07 million tonnes of e-waste from around the world from 2009 to 2021. In Korea, the Asan Recycling Center recovered 32,731 tonnes of valuable resources such as copper, aluminum, iron, and plastic in 2021 alone. We used 5,587 tonnes of plastic materials recycled from discarded products in the manufacturing of new products, thereby minimizing plastic waste generation and the use of petrochemical materials in the production process.\n\nGlobal E-Waste Take-Back and Recycling Status\n\n| Region                  | Activities                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe                  | Operating the take-back and recycling system in 37 countries                |\n| China                   | Operating the take-back and recycling system                                |\n| Vietnam                 | Installing voluntary return boxes for customers at Service Centers         |\n| Singapore               | Operating the take-back and recycling system                                |\n| South Africa            | Operating voluntary return boxes at Service Centers                        |\n| Korea                   | Operating a take-back network of dealers and logistics centers              |\n|                        | Operating the Asan Recycling Center                                         |\n|                        | Offering free door-to-door take-back service                                |\n| Turkey, Israel, Russia, | Participating in the take-back and recycling system                         |\n| Belarus, and Georgia    |                                                                             |\n| US                      | Operating the voluntary return program in 50 states                         |\n|                        | Partnering with uBREAKiFIX, a mobile device repair specialist, to take back electronic goods discarded at its 500 branches (2020 onwards) |\n| Australia               | Operating the TV, PC, and printer take-back and recycling system            |\n|                        | Participating in the voluntary mobile phone return program                  |\n| Colombia, Peru, Costa   | Operating the voluntary return program                                      |\n| Rica, and Brazil        |                                                                             |\n\nAmount of Collected E-Waste (Unit: 10,000 tonnes)\n\n| Year | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| 2019 | 403    |\n| 2020 | 454    |\n| 2021 | 507    |\n\n* Cumulative amount collected in previous years\n* Amount collected in the calendar year\n* Cumulative from 2009\nWaste Management\n\nTo minimize waste generation, we design our products with a focus on resource efficiency and continually improve our manufacturing processes. All of our global business sites review the amount of waste generated and recycled each month and seek ways to further enhance the recycling rate by examining their waste disposal methods.\n\nWaste Management Activities\n\n- **Product Development**\n  - Operating the eco-conscious design assessment process\n  - Assessing eco-friendliness in the development stage (resource efficiency, environmental impact, and energy efficiency)\n\n- **Waste Disposal**\n  - Setting waste recycling targets\n  - Developing waste disposal technologies\n  - Expanding measures to mitigate environmental impact (low-toxic substance and alternative development, neutralization, etc.)\n\n- **Waste Transportation**\n  - Complying with the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal\n  - Monitoring the travel routes of waste transportation vehicles\n\n- **Waste Disposal**\n  - Ensuring the compliance of waste treatment service provider Conducting eco-friendliness assessments of waste disposal companies on a yearly basis (operating capacity, environmental management, etc.)\n\nWaste Recycling Improvement\n\nWe achieved a waste recycling rate of 96% in 2021. Our semiconductor business sites established the goal to further improve the recycling rate to reach 99.5% by 2025 and reduce non-recyclable waste to less than 6,000 tonnes. To this end, they continue to advance the circular economy by discovering added value in waste and developing recycling technologies. Our semiconductor business sites succeeded in accomplishing Zero-Waste to Landfill for the first time in the industry in 2021. We will strive to have all of our global business sites attain zero waste to landfill certification in the near future.\n\nWaste Treatment Technology Development and Process Innovation\n\nWe are developing waste treatment technologies and reinforcing our system to separate recyclable waste to achieve zero waste to landfill and promote resource circulation.\n\nReduction of Waste for Landfill, Incineration, and Neutralization\n\nWe have recycled approximately 2,000 tonnes of waste generated from our semiconductor business sites. In the past, wooden parts and outdoor air conditioning unit filters consisting of composite materials had to be incinerated. However, we succeeded in developing technologies to separate and recycle these materials. Consumables used to polish wafers were previously incinerated due to harmful substances. They are now cleaned and recycled to reduce incinerated waste.\n\nWe also achieved zero waste to landfill by succeeding in recycling epoxy molding compound (EMC), which was previously buried, and clean vacuum (CV) dust. We are now able to extract and utilize a new plastic material from EMC waste and valuable metals such as gold and tungsten from CV dust.\n\n1) A material applied in the last stage of packaging in semiconductor manufacturing to protect semiconductor circuits from external shock\n2) Dust generated and captured from semiconductor manufacturing equipment\n\nFinding Added Value in Waste\n\nThe main type of waste generated from semiconductor manufacturing is sewage sludge. In order to raise the added value of waste, we recycle copper extracted from the sludge and have succeeded in producing an alternative substance to fluorspar, which is needed for steelmaking, in cooperation with Hyundai Steel.\n\nAttaining Recycled Resource Quality Marker Certification\n\nIn 2020, the eight-inch wafer box and IC tray from the Onyang business site attained Recycled Resource Quality Marker Certification from the Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute for the first time in the domestic industry. In 2021, the eight-inch wafer box of the Giheung business site and three nonferrous metals from the Giheung, Hwaseong, and Pyeongtaek business sites were additionally certified. These certified items are no longer categorized as waste and are directly supplied to recycling companies. This contributed to reducing the amount of generated waste by 1,903 tonnes per year.\n\nWaste Reduced through Recycled Resource Quality Marker Certification\n\n| Year | Approximately (eight-inch wafer box and IC tray) | Approximately (three nonferrous metals) |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 2020 | 1,213                                         |                                        |\n| 2021 | 1,903                                         |                                        |\nPracticing Resource Circularity\n\nRefraining from the Use of Disposable Products To minimize the use of disposable products at all of our semiconductor business sites, we distributed reusable bags to all employees and promote the use of reusable cups and spoon set. This has contributed to reducing the waste of 65,000 disposable plastic bags and 52,000 disposable cups and plates, thereby decreasing the total amount of waste by 230 tonnes.\n\nReinforcing Recyclable Waste Separation We reinforced our recyclable waste separation system to more effectively recycle the waste from daily activities at work and expanded the separation categories from six to ten in 2021. We conducted the Eco-Office Campaign to ensure that our employees remove the labels and lids of all recyclable containers before recycling them. We promoted the campaign through training and an introductory webtoon. We also distributed toilet paper made from milk cartons and blankets made with fabric recycled from plastic bottles to the underprivileged in the local communities we serve. We will continue to focus on practicing resource circulation to preserve the planet.\n\nWater Risk Assessment\n\nWe assess each year whether any business sites are located in regions affected by water stress or water scarcity and develop countermeasures for different risks. We employ the water management tool developed by the Food and Agricultural Organization to identify regions facing water stress or water risks, while also utilizing the tools developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, World Wildlife Fund for Nature, and World Resources Institute to assess the water stress and ten-year water risks of the water basins near our business sites. We also use CDP\u2019s water security guidance to establish response measures for water risks.\n\nStrategy to Tackle Water-Risk by Region\n\nCDP Water Report\n\nWater Resource Management\n\nWater resources are indispensable for product manufacturing and business site operations. They are also affected by natural disaster risks such as floods and droughts, and their use and disposal have a critical impact on biodiversity in the communities where we operate. Therefore, it is imperative to closely communicate and work with local communities. We regularly discuss relevant issues through the EHS Council of each business site and submit them to the Sustainability Council and the Board of Directors if deemed necessary.\n\nWater Resource Policy\n\nCASE\n\nAll Semiconductor Business Sites Attaining Zero-Waste to Landfill Certification\n\nAs of 2021, our semiconductor business sites at eight locations have attained Zero Waste to Landfill certification from Underwriters Laboratories (UL). The Giheung, Hwaseong, and Pyeongtaek sites in Korea and Xian and Suzhou sites in China received the highest rating of Platinum, while the Onyang and Cheonan sites in Korea and Austin site in the US were rated Gold. The Giheung, Hwaseong, Pyeongtaek, and Suzhou sites were upgraded to Platinum in 2021 after having been rated Gold in 2020. In order to exceed the 99% resource recycling rate mark for the Platinum rating, we developed new technology to recycle EMC and CV dust that had previously been buried.\n\n1) Five in Korea (Giheung, Hwaseong, Pyeongtaek, Onyang, and Cheonan), one in the US (Austin), and two in China (Xian and Suzhou)\n2) An index designed to assess the resource circulation efforts of corporations and provide four ratings in accordance with the rate of manufacturing waste recycled as resources\n\nWater Stress Map\n\nStatus of Business Sites with Water Risks (as of the end of 2021)\n\n| Category | Number of business sites | Water intake (1,000 tonnes) | Outflow (1,000 tonnes) |\n|----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n| Total    | 34                       | 163,660                     | 130,935                |\n| In regions with water risks | 13 1) | 121,807 | 98,018 |\n\n1) 10 in Korea, 1 in India, 1 in Poland, and 1 in Egypt\n**CASE**\n\n**Response to Water Stress Affecting Our Semiconductor Sites**\n\nFor the semiconductor sites that require large amounts of water for manufacturing, we analyze their region-specific water stress and offer optimized management.\n\nThe Xi\u2019an site\\(^1\\), China is located in a region with extremely-high water stress (80% or higher). We classify wastewater into acidic wastewater, alkaline wastewater, and fluoric wastewater and properly treat each for reuse. We also employ a range of treatment technologies including activated carbon filtering, acid-base neutralization, coagulating sedimentation, and reverse osmosis, to purify wastewater and use it for cooling towers, gas treatment facilities, and landscaping. To reduce water consumption, we also use recycled water as a coolant for all devices.\n\nThe semiconductor sites in Korea are located in regions with medium-high water stress (20-40%). We classify used water into six types based on our internal standards, and use purification techniques specialized for each type.\n\nContaminants are removed through biological treatment, chemical treatment, and filtering step by step, and the purified water is collected in a tank for discharge. The quality of water to be discharged is assessed in real time and reported to the government prior to discharge.\n\n\\(^1\\) China\u2019s Xi\u2019an site was classified as low water stress according to our company\u2019s management standards, but according to WRI water stress analysis, it was classified as extremely high.\n\n**Water Management Process**\n\nWe minimize water consumption and purify used water for reuse to ensure water use efficiency. To increase water reuse in the manufacturing process, we classify water resources into the four categories of sewage, wastewater, industrial water, and ultra-pure water and ensure that individual sites track the reuse amount for each category on a monthly basis and enter the data into the G-EHS System. We prevent underground water pollution through advanced facilities installed at our business sites and thoroughly process wastewater through off-site and on-site treatment facilities before discharge. We apply our internal regulations that are more stringent than the legal requirements to wastewater directly discharged into rivers through on-site treatment facilities.\n\n**Water Conservation and Reuse Efforts**\n\nWe strive to maximize water reuse through everyday activities such as optimizing site operations, replacing outdated equipment, and updating operating standards in combination with structural improvements related to manufacturing processes and recycling systems. Our semiconductor sites, which typically require large amounts of water, succeeded in reducing water consumption by 6,857 tonnes per day through control value changes, wastewater treatment method changes, and operation optimization. As a result, we reused 93,949,000 tonnes of water in 2021, a 34% increase from the previous year. We plan to further improve our water reuse rate and seek ways to reuse water discharged from public wastewater treatment plants.\n\n**World Water Day**\n\nEvery year our manufacturing sites around the world carry out river and marine ecosystem conservation campaigns together with local governments, civil organizations, nearby schools, and partner companies in celebration of World Water Day. Our activities in 2021 were focused on environmental cleanup in areas near our business sites and contact-free programs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 20 sites participated in water resource-related exhibitions, idea contests, and environmental protection training.\nPreserving the Health of Freshwater Ecosystems\n\nOur domestic business sites periodically measure the water quality of rivers into which used water is discharged based on preset indicators (chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, acidity, etc.) and monitor their impact on the neighboring ecosystems. They also monitor fish diversity and bird diversity in the surrounding areas and make improvements accordingly.\n\n**Freshwater Ecosystem Monitoring and Improvement** In order to protect the biodiversity of rivers near our business sites, we monitor the latest developments in their ecosystems, toxicity, weather conditions, and precipitation on a regular basis pursuant to the Guidelines on Freshwater Ecosystem Status Research and Quality Control. We also monitor the fish and birds inhabiting nearby areas to make improvements.\n\n**CASE**\n\n**Osan Stream Biodiversity Conservation Activities**\n\nWe discharge 45,000 tonnes of purified effluent water per day into Osan Stream, which has contributed to improving the local ecosystem. As evidence of these improvements, wildlife, including otters, now inhabit the area. We conducted campaigns to plant irises known for their water-purifying capacity, supply effective microorganisms to remove pollutants, and release indigenous fish species. We also funded a project to create the Osan Stream Butterfly Path aimed at protecting the endangered dragon swallowtail.\n\n**Wildlife near Osan Stream Wastewater Outlet**\n\nOtter  Wildcat  Elk\n\n---\n\n**Water Pollution Control**\n\nWe ensure that all chemicals and water polluting substances used at our business sites are thoroughly filtered from wastewater before they are discharged into rivers and strive to minimize adverse impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Our internal regulations related to pollutant concentration, water temperatures, toxicity, and other hazards are far more stringent than the legal requirements.\n\n**Minimizing Pollutant Discharge** In pursuit of minimizing pollutant discharge from all of our semiconductor sites, we have reduced the use of chemicals, developed alternatives for harmful substances, and enhanced wastewater disposal efficiency. In addition, we are effectively reducing the use of sulfuric acid, chlorine, and fluorine through chemical filter development, process innovation, and crystallization technology development.\n\n**Multi-Faceted Defense against Water Pollution** We are taking active measures to reduce the discharge of pollutants and remain prepared for possible accidents at our wastewater disposal facilities at the same time. We installed triple-tier interlocks across the three stages of crystallization technology development.\n\n---\n\n**Feature Story**\n\n**The development of a microplastics-reducing washing machine**\n\nOcean-bound microplastics have emerged as a critical environmental issue. It is estimated that tiny plastic particles shed from clothes and textiles during the washing cycle account for 35% of microplastic pollution in the oceans.\n\nTo address this issue, we have launched a project to develop a washer that reduces microplastics in wastewater.\n\n*Microplastics reach the oceans.  Plankton eat the plastic particles.  Fish eat the plankton.  People eat the fish.*\n\nThis project is being developed in collaboration with Patagonia, a global outdoor clothing brand.\n\n\"Microplastics generated during laundry are tiny plastic fragments shed by synthetic textiles. These microfibers eventually reach the oceans via wastewater. The key to reducing these microplastics is to prevent microfiber shedding due to agitation in the washer. We are seeking ways to reduce microfiber pollution while also ensuring high-quality cleaning.\"\n\n\u2013Bang Eun-sook (Researcher for washer development)\u2013\n\n\"As a washer developer, I have studied how microplastics enter our oceans through wastewater from washers. We are striving to develop technology to filter microplastics from the wastewater after each wash and enable users to easily remove or discard the microplastics collected in the filter. I believe it is both imperative and worthwhile to design a washer that helps consumers reduce microplastics generated in the laundry cycle.\"\n\n\u2013Suh Dong-pil (Researcher for washer development)\u2013\nChemical Management\n\nWe strive to minimize the negative impacts of hazardous substances that may enter our products, as well as chemicals used in the frontlines of manufacturing on the health of our customers and employees. Our internal regulations are established and stringently managed based on global standards, including the EU\u2019s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). Standards for the Control of Substances Used in Products\n\nREACH Declaration for Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC)\n\nStrictly Managing Harmful Substances in our Products\n\nWe are equipped with a rigorous pre-inspection and follow-up management system for parts and raw materials to prevent hazardous substances from entering our products. We set the Standards for the Control of Substances Used in Products based on global standards and voluntarily establish reduction plans for the use of potentially hazardous substances, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), beryllium, and antimony, as well as legally regulated substances.\n\nManaging Hazardous Substances in the Supply Chain\n\nOur supply chain review and management systems are designed to help our suppliers actively engage in eco-conscious management practices. All of our product and parts suppliers are subject to Eco-Partner Certification evaluations. Each supplier is required to submit data obtained from its raw material providers and production environment reports that guarantee the credibility of hazardous substance information. We provide certifications to those companies evaluated to have complied with the Standards for the Control of Substances Used in Products. We also provide certifications to companies equipped with an advanced environment and quality management system. Only companies with these certifications are included in our supply chain.\n\nEco-Life Lab for the Analysis related Health and Hygiene\n\nWe opened the Environmental Analysis Lab in 2004, which initially monitored the six substances regulated by the EU\u2019s RoHS. We have continued to expand potentially hazardous substances subject to monitoring each year to prevent hazardous substances from entering our products. The Environmental Analysis Lab was expanded to the Eco-Life Lab in 2020, and additional test chambers and advanced equipment for microorganisms were introduced. We also expanded the scope of research to identify fundamental causes of odors and appropriate solutions. The Eco-Life Lab\u2019s expertise and credibility have been recognized by attaining certifications from Korea Laboratory Accreditation Scheme (KOLAS) and T\u00dcV Rheinland, Germany\u2019s renowned testing service provider.\n\nSamsung Electronics\u2019 Chemical Substances Management History\n\nChemicals Used for Manufacturing\n\nThe chemicals used at all of our business sites are stringently controlled pursuant to country-specific laws and our internal List of Regulated Substances for Manufacturing. To ensure that our partner companies use chemicals under the safest possible conditions, we perform regular on-site audits and support work environment improvements. We conduct regular training for staff members handling chemicals and inspections of relevant facilities, while also establishing safety measures for relevant facilities based on the assessments of EHS experts. Additionally, we operate a three-tier chemical reduction program (alternative development, concentration reduction, and prohibition of use).\n\nList of Regulated Substances for Manufacturing\n\nChemical Management Process\n\nTo ensure safety, we systematically monitor and manage the entire chemical-related process, from purchase to disposal. Staff members handling chemicals at business sites request the expert group to perform evaluations of all chemicals prior to purchasing and purchase only those chemicals evaluated to be appropriate for use. In 2021, 7,563 prior evaluations were performed in Korea and abroad. Once the purchased chemicals are delivered to each site, the inventory is thoroughly monitored until they are safely discarded through a separate process.\n\nReinforcing Chemical Control at Semiconductor Sites\n\nTo minimize damage from potential accidents, all facilities and buildings on the premises of our semiconductor sites have been reinforced. We implemented physical measures, such as the installation of an automated chemical injection system, disaster prevention and firefighting equipment, and discharge wall, while also upgrading the overall process from facility-specific inspections to the early detection of leakage. In addition, we installed a system to detect and respond to leakage at different points including building interiors and exteriors, rainwater drainage pipes, and outer fences around the business sites. We improved our research on chemical compound risks to prevent related accidents, established a system to prevent chemical mixing, and continue to update relevant construction and job regulations.\n\nImproving Preparedness for Overseas Chemical Regulations\n\nAs chemical regulations and standards vary by country and continue to be updated, we are required to take a more systematic approach to effectively manage chemicals. We review the relevant laws of the 15 countries in which we have business sites, including China, Vietnam, and India, and reflect the findings in our chemical management standards and database to minimize risks.\nEMPOWERING COMMUNITIES\n\nWe remain committed to fulfilling our corporate social responsibility to create a better world for all. Based on Samsung\u2019s core values of \u2018People First\u2019 and \u2018Co-prosperity\u2019, our CSR activities aim to help individuals reach their full potential.\n\nCorporate Citizenship 42\nSME\u00b7Startup Support 46\nFuture Technology Cultivation Initiative 48\n\nTotal employee volunteer hours\n9,903,186\n* Cumulative sum, 2012-2021\n\nNumber of beneficiaries of our CSR activities\n22,150,865\n* Cumulative sum, 2012-2021\n\nNumber of beneficiaries of the Smart Factory Support Program\n2,812\n* Cumulative sum, 2015-2021\nCorporate Citizenship\n\nOur CSR Activities\n\nWe have re-established our CSR vision and theme in line with Samsung\u2019s business philosophy and core values.

Companies need talented people who are equipped with expertise and collaboration skills that can be readily deployed to business frontiers. SSAFY provides robust theoretical and hands-on training through projects that simulate real-world tasks to cater to this need.\n\nSamsung SW Academy for Youth Program Manager\n\n\u201cYouth unemployment was a major social issue in 2018. Another challenge was the critical shortage of quality developers needed in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. SSAFY was established to train both IT majors and non-IT majors into convergent talents and provide optimal solutions for the problems facing the industry. It has been five years since SSAFY was launched, and many of the programs developed as graduation projects have been praised by the judges for exceeding expectations and being ready to be deployed to business frontiers immediately. In recognition of our efforts to equip our trainees with the capabilities required on the front lines of the industry, over 100 companies are giving preference to SSAFY\u2019s graduates in recruitment, and more and more companies are proposing to hold recruitment presentations. I hope that the SSAFY\u2019s graduates will continue to strengthen their presence as competent troubleshooters in different corners of the communities we serve.\u201d\n\n- Kang Dae-beom (CSR Manager, Samsung SW Academy for Youth) -\nSamsung Dream Class\n\nSamsung Dream Class, which originally started as a combination of after-school classes and a vacation camp, was revamped into Samsung Dream Class 2.0 in 2021.

Launched in April 2021, it is comprised of experts from Samsung Research and the Compliance Team. The very first project was the creation of the model cards and data cards that contain information about our AI-based models and their data. Transparent recording of AI models is the first step toward AI ethics, and we are also adopting the form in line with global trends. Previously, such records were kept by our developers in non-standardized manner. The new templates have helped our developers archive information more systematically and with a greater focus on ethical matters.\n\n\"Our company offers a wide range of products and services. An AI-based feature developed by one team can be incorporated into a product developed by another or one AI-based feature can be applied into multiple products. In order to better realize such AI-based features in accordance with the traits and conditions of individual products and services, it is essential to facilitate the transparent sharing of AI-based model information among planners and developers.\"\n\n\u2013 Lyu Dug-in (Model Card and Data Card Planner) \u2013\n\nThe model cards and data cards have been introduced to developers through our AI ethics training program. With the continued expansion of AI-based products and services, the council identified the need for developer training on AI ethics and designed the curriculum. The training program deals with the latest global trends in AI regulation, the Principles of AI Ethics, and the Guidelines on AI Ethics, in addition to the use of the model cards and data cards.\n\n\"As AI regulations are being reinforced around the world and issues concerning AI ethics continue to emerge, we thought AI ethics training was necessary. We focused on helping trainees more effectively incorporate AI ethics into their everyday business activities.\"\n\n\u2013 Kim Hyeon-wu (Training Planner) \u2013\n\n\"With greater AI technology comes greater responsibility. I hope this online training program will provide momentum for our AI researchers to become more aware of AI ethics issues.\"\n\n\u2013 Kim Su-jin (Training Planner) \u2013\n\n\"Although we developers are aware of AI ethics and share the latest changes among ourselves, we need more systematic exposure to such matters. This training program offers us much-anticipated opportunities to prepare ourselves for handling ethical issues.\"\n\n\u2013 Lee Sang-ho (Trainee) \u2013\n\nThe council has also worked to collect and share the opinions and ideas of both the government and industry through in-depth discussions with various government agencies and organizations. However, even in the company, AI ethics is still a concern. We face more and more challenges as AI is being implemented to a wider range of products.\n\n\"It is never easy to deal with the complexity of AI ethics in product planning and development. For example, it may be considered safer to block the recognition of children's speech for certain products and services. However, it may also be viewed as an act of discrimination. AI ethics is not mathematics, and there is no single correct answer for each issue.\"\n\n\u2013 Kim Tae-hyung (Software Quality Engineering Manager, SE Team) \u2013\n\nVice President Lee Ju-hyeong, who heads the council, says that we have just begun our journey to understand AI and AI ethics.\n\n\"AI is demonstrating rapid growth and increasingly far-reaching impacts, but it also poses many risks. We must remain alert and strive to find ways to prevent technological development from adversely affecting individuals and society using AI ethics as our foundation.\"\n\n\u2013 Lee Ju-hyeong (Vice President and Head of the AI Ethics Council) \u2013\n\nThe council plans to step up its efforts to further nurture a corporate culture centered on AI ethics and widely promote best practices.\nAccessibility\n\nWe strive to design our products and services with a commitment to embracing diversity and respecting differences.

Based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), we designed the following labor and human rights framework to identify, prevent and mitigate human rights risk factors and violations across all aspects of our business operations. We also require our partner companies to ensure the protection of their employees\u2019 labor and human rights as stringently as our own business sites.\n\nLabor and Human Rights Framework\n\nOur labor and human rights policies and guidelines are based on international standards and are continually updated in line with the latest changes. We developed an Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy and published it on our global website in March 2022.\n\n1) The International Bill of Human Rights consists of the UDHR; International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n2) International Labour Organization\n3) The eight ILO Core Conventions are the Forced Labor Convention, Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, Equal Remuneration Convention, Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, Minimum Age Convention, and Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention.\n\nAnti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy\n\nWe respect all individuals\u2019 right to work in an environment free of discrimination and harassment. In 2018, we released the Anti-Harassment Guidelines in association with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), an organization of sustainable business experts. In 2021, we supplemented the anti-discrimination principles specified in these guidelines and realigned them into the Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy. This policy stipulates relevant conventions adopted by international human rights frameworks (UDHR and UNGPs) and the ILO and reaffirms our dedication to complying with them. We pledge to remain committed to fostering a workplace where our employees are valued and treated, given equal opportunities, and motivated to demonstrate their competence to the fullest.\n\nGlobal Code of Conduct\n\nOur Global Code of Conduct, established based on the Samsung Business Principles as the embodiment of our determination to operate within the spirit of laws and ethics as a responsible corporate citizen, serves as a yardstick for judgment in every action and decision. The Global Code of Conduct clearly reflects our focus on protecting the three basic rights of workers by specifying that \u201cwe respect our employees\u2019 freedom of association and right to collective bargaining and collective action under the aim of nurturing and maintaining cooperative labor-management relations based on mutual trust and understanding.\u201d It also clarifies our detailed principles on \u201cwork environment,\u201d \u201cemployment conditions,\u201d \u201cgrievance handling,\u201d \u201cequality and diversity,\u201d \u201cchild labor and forced labor,\u201d and other areas to help our employees execute their day-to-day tasks in a manner that ensures the protection of human rights. Through the Guidelines on the Global Code of Conduct, we ban any involvement in or imposition of coerced or exploitative labor, such as modern slavery and human trafficking, in support of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.\n\nLabor and Human Rights Training\n\nIt is imperative for our employees to understand both the importance of human rights and ways to protect them across all aspects of corporate management. In this context, we conduct yearly labor and human rights training tailored to different target groups to ensure compliance with our labor and human rights policies and raise employee awareness.\n\nHuman Rights Training Framework\n\nWe have conducted labor and human rights training for our employees since 2018, and the curriculum was developed in collaboration with BSR. In 2021, we adopted a system that provides tailored content in accordance with individual employees\u2019 training progress to more effectively improve their understanding of relevant issues. The common courses deal with the basic concept of human rights, importance of the protection of labor and human rights, and ways to practice human rights management. To minimize the risk of human rights violations in day-to-day business operations, we operate a specialized course for those responsible for jobs deemed likely to impact the human rights of others.\nHuman Rights Training Framework\n\n**Common courses**\n\n1. **Level 1: Basic concept of human rights**\n   - Human rights principles, laws and international standards, our human rights policies and framework, access to remedy, and basics of human rights management\n\n2. **Level 2: Labor and human rights**\n   - Concept of labor and human rights, human rights due diligence management, case studies, and focus on access to remedy\n\n3. **Level 3: Business and human rights**\n   - In-depth review of human rights including frameworks of human rights management, latest legislation developments, and case studies\n\n**Specialized courses for different groups**\n\n- General employees\n- Those in charge of jobs that may impact the human rights of others\n- Those responsible for human rights protection at work\n- Culture centered on mutual respect\n- Human rights issues related to respective jobs\n- Cultivation of Human Rights Champions\n\n**Operation of Labor and Human Rights Training**\n\nWe provide labor and human rights training for all employees. In 2020, the training was provided online for all connected business sites in Korea and beyond in response to the spread of the pandemic, thereby reaching 95% of those subject to training. In 2021, a combination of small-scale offline training and online training was offered for overseas subsidiaries that had to postpone their training efforts due to the pandemic, enabling 92% of the target employees to complete the training. To ensure better understanding of the training content, training was conducted with the local language especially in production sites.\n\nSpecialized online training was conducted for 91% of staff members engaging in jobs with greater human rights risks around the world, such as those related to personnel, security, general affairs, and purchasing, around the world. All employees at our domestic business sites completed training on mutual respect at work conducted from July to December 2021.\n\nIn order to further highlight the importance of human rights protection and share best practices, we have designated over 50 employees at overseas subsidiaries, mainly personnel, labor-management relations, and training staff members, as Human Rights Champions to further integrate a human rights lens into our business activities and serve as human rights trainers at their respective subsidiaries. In 2021, we helped strengthen their expertise in human rights through regular webinars dealing with a range of themes including forced labor prevention, freedom of association, impacts of the pandemic on human rights grievance resolution, and diversity and inclusion.\n\n**INTERVIEW**\n\n**Human Resources and Purchasing Staff Members on Human Rights Training**\n\nHuman rights training allows purchasing staff members to keep up with the latest developments in international human rights requirements and our relevant policies and thereby more effectively identify and prevent human rights risks. As the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and rapid technological progress continuously pose threats to human rights, the international community is increasingly calling for and driving measures to ensure human rights protection in a more binding manner than simply appealing for voluntary engagement. Regular training is required for purchasing staff members to update their human rights knowledge and comply with the preset purchasing procedures to ensure human rights protection in day-to-day business activities.\n\n- **Nguyen Thi Binh Minh**\n  (Purchase Team, Samsung Electronics Vietnam)\n\nThrough this training, I learned that a bias-free corporate culture is a prerequisite for human rights protection and that inclusion and diversity are the driving forces behind sustainability. It also clearly highlighted the need for the international community to take action to promote human rights. In this context, we will continually strive to practice human rights management within the spirit of laws and ethics through various measures such as training and inspections throughout the future.\n\n- **Cecilia Perez**\n  (HR Team, Samsung Electronics Mexico)\n\nEnsuring respect for human rights at work directly and indirectly impacts employees\u2019 satisfaction and a company\u2019s sustainability, and thus it is essential to conduct human rights training to improve our employees\u2019 understanding of human rights protection and prevent human rights violations in daily business activities. In particular, it is imperative to train higher-ranking employees on a continued basis to create and disperse best practices and build a corporate culture centered on respect for human rights.\n\n- **Shubheshu Bajpai**\n  (Purchase Team, Samsung Electronics Noida-India)\n\nThe importance of human rights protection cannot be stressed enough, and personnel affairs always entail human rights risks. Our company\u2019s human rights training reminds us of the need to comply with internal standards and principles and thus is highly effective in preventing potential human rights violations. Our company\u2019s human rights training motivates us to remain sensitive to the potential influence of our business operations on the human rights of both the local communities we serve and our employees.\n\n- **Laszlo Szollosi**\n  (HR Team, Samsung Electronics Hungary)\nHuman Rights Due Diligence\n\nWe established a sustainable due diligence system to accommodate social, geopolitical, and environmental changes, such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also engage in a range of activities including third-party audits and human rights impact assessments.\n\nThird-Party Assessment by Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)\n\nIn 2021, third-party assessments were conducted on nine business sites in Korea, Brazil, India, and China using the Validated Assessment Program (VAP) of RBA. All nine business sites received the highest rating. We take remedial action against any gaps detected through VAP and implement long-term measures for issues that require an extended period of time for remedies to be implemented.\n\nOur Brazil subsidiary was evaluated by an external auditor as \u201can exemplary corporation worthy of introduction to other companies for its human rights policies, improve relevant processes, and provide employee training and take remediation action in order to address identified gaps and risks.\n\nHuman Rights Impact Assessment\n\nWe perform human rights impact assessments in collaboration with an external expert organization to pro-actively assess the direct and indirect impacts of our business operations on human rights in alignment with the Corporate Responsibility to respect and pro-actively identify risks as outlined within the UNGPs. We enact and amend human rights policies, improve relevant processes, and provide employee training and take remediation action in order to address identified gaps and risks.\n\nAssessment Procedures\n\n1. Planning: Defining the covered target and scope, defining stakeholders, and conducting basic research.\n2. Research: Creating checklists for each area subject to assessment and conducting in-depth research on vulnerable areas.\n3. Communication with stakeholders: Government institutions, press organizations, NGOs, labor organizations, local residents, employees, and partner companies.\n4. Impact analyses: Identifying risks, establishing improvement plans, and making internal reports.\n5. Remedial action: Monitoring the implementation and results of tasks and analyzing their effects.\n6. Information disclosure: Sharing our performance through the Sustainability Report.\n\nWe conducted our very first human rights impact assessment at our Vietnam subsidiary from 2018 to 2019, followed by our newly established Turkey production site in 2021. We established action plans for improvement areas detected during the assessments in order of priority considering the number of affected people, the extent of impacts, severity regarding the possibility of recovery, and risk of occurrence. Also, we closely monitor the implementation status each quarter and carefully carry out the remedial action plans.\n\nHuman Rights Saliency Analysis at Our Turkey Production Site in 2021\n\n- Purpose: To identify and address human rights risks prior to the opening of a new business site.\n- Scope: Potentially affected rights of future Samsung employees, supply chain workers, and surrounding communities in the macro-context of Turkey\u2019s human rights track record.\n- Conducted by: Enact and twentyfifty\n- Period: April-July, 2021\n- Outcomes:\n  - Salient Risks: Labor and human rights, health and safety rights, stakeholders\u2019 rights to know, and workers\u2019 rights in supply chain.\n  - Improvement progress: 12 completed and 10 being carried out among 22 tasks in the following 4 areas.\n  1) Labor and human rights protection: Establishing human rights governance and the process to identify relevant risks, reinforcing grievance resolution and remediation systems, and offering labor and human rights training.\n  2) Occupational health and safety: Establishing relevant policies and conducting training for employees.\n  3) Stakeholder engagement: Ensuring regular communication with external organizations and groups.\n  4) Supply chain management: Helping reinforce the compliance of partner companies in our supply chains and conducting on-site audits.\n\nWe will strive to proactively identify and assess human rights risks to prevent and minimize any adverse impacts of our business operations.\n\nLiving Wage\n\nAlthough universal consensus on the definition and calculation method of a living wage has yet to be reached, the term is generally understood as the minimum income required to address the basic living needs of a worker and his/her family.\n\nWe have been cooperating with BSR, an organization of sustainable business experts, to calculate living wage. In 2018, the company for the first time conducted research to estimate the living wage in countries in which we have production sites. We adjusted them in 2022 reflecting economic growth rates and consumer prices so that those don\u2019t interfere with the basic living conditions of the employees with economic recession and inflation due to pandemic.\n\nTo ensure estimation accuracy, we employed the widely accepted Anker methodology and identified diverse items such as household food and non-food expenses and the number of workers and dependent family members within each household by referring to economic indicators released by credible organizations such as the OECD, UN, and Eurostat and performing on-site surveys.\n\nWe will continually update our internal wage policy to better support the basic living needs of our employees and their families. We also plan to closely cooperate with related expert organizations in the future to take part in the international community\u2019s effort to implement living wage.\nRespect for and Protection of Migrant Workers\u2019 Rights\n\nWe closely monitor and manage all of our subsidiaries that employ migrant workers. In 2020, we revised our Migrant Worker Policy to better protect the rights of migrant workers and distributed internal guidelines that detail principles, case studies, and implementation steps for policy compliance to our HR employees and recruiting agency members in charge of migrant worker management. These guidelines, consisting of 14 steps from recruitment to employment contract termination, were created based on the widely recognized industry guidelines of the RBA, BSR, and IHRB.\n\nWe also ensured that COVID-19-related healthcare and financial support equivalent to that of local employees is available for migrant workers. Through this support, migrant workers who tested positive for COVID-19 are given infection control and prevention supplies regularly as well as paid leave for additional testing and quarantine. At some business sites, vaccination services are provided at individual workers\u2019 request in collaboration with respective government authorities.\n\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nWe remain committed to ensuring open and active communication with our stakeholders based on mutual trust. To this end, we operate a range of communication channels tailored to our employees, suppliers, customers, and investors, as well as government bodies, international organizations, and NGOs, to share our activities and collect and reflect their voices in our measures. We also actively communicate with employee representative bodies as an extension of our efforts to improve respect for human rights and working conditions.\n\nStakeholder Forum\n\nStarting from 2018, we have been staging an annual Stakeholder Forum at the Vietnam Complex to better interact with our stakeholders and seek greater synergy through cooperation. The forum has now firmly taken root as a regular event. We held our fourth Stakeholder Forum in 2021 in collaboration with the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) and Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL) both online and offline in consideration of the pandemic. The number of attendees increased by more than 50% compared to the previous year, with 414 representatives from government institutions, NGOs, corporations, labor organizations, and media present.\n\nThe 2021 forum, held under the theme \u201cCooperation to Reinforce Workers\u2019 Competence in Preparation for the Upcoming Digital Economy in Vietnam,\u201d featured research presentations by VCCI and VGCL as well as the introduction of our competence-building programs for both internal and external stakeholders including the Online Learning Platform, In-House College, and Manufacturing Technology Training for Partner Companies.\n\nThe attendees gave high evaluations for our endeavors to provide a regular platform that brings multiple NGOs together and build stronger bonds with our stakeholders. The forum also highlighted the wide range of our talent cultivation programs.\n\nThe theme for the 2022 forum will be set based on the input of our stakeholders, and the event will be designed to elevate our interaction with them to new heights.\n\nCommunication with Global Investors\n\nWe have held a regular ESG Roadshows since 2019 to reach out to global investors and share our relevant major activities including the amendment and implementation of labor and human rights policies and human rights impact assessments.\n\nWe had a Roadshow in February 2022, and addressed inquiries about ways to respond to expanding diversity and inclusion requirements and supply chain management needs in accordance with the human-rights due diligence legislation of different countries. We will continually expand communication with our investors through new channels and actively reflect their needs in our human rights management.\n\nCommunication with Employee Representative Bodies\n\nLabor Unions\n\nWe have 32 labor unions representing our business sites around the world. We negotiate employment conditions with them and conclude collective agreements accordingly pursuant to the laws of the respective countries.\n\nWork Councils\n\nWe operate 40 Work Councils at our business sites around the world in accordance with the respective countries\u2019 laws and individual business sites\u2019 conditions. Our employees elect their own representatives through direct and secret ballot voting.\n\nGrievance Resolution\n\nA grievance is a perceived injustice evoking an individual\u2019s or a group\u2019s sense of entitlement as defined by the UNGPs. Grievances also encompass complaints, demands, and suggestions related to work environments submitted by our employees, partner companies, or external stakeholders. An overview of the grievance channels and processes is included in the annual human rights training for employees to help them more effectively and promptly respond to any incidents they may face.\n\nGrievance Channels and Status\n\nWe operate various grievance channels, including hotlines, online, offline, and employee representative bodies, tailored to the conditions of individual business sites.\n\nSeparate channels are open for our employees with different responsibilities, from HR to labor relations, compliance, and audit, as well as our external stakeholders, including investors, customers, and partner companies, to ensure efficient grievance resolution. All of our grievance channels allow anonymous disclosure, and any retaliation against whistleblowers is explicitly prohibited by the Guidelines on the Global Code of Conduct aligned with the UNPGs. We also offer grievance-related introduction materials in different languages for migrant workers to enhance accessibility.\n\nFiled grievances are handled promptly in accordance with the preset procedures, and follow-up actions, such as training and policy amendments, are carried out to address root causes. Based on interviews with whistleblowers and victims, we investigate if their grievances have been properly resolved in line with the eight UNGP effectiveness criteria and monitor if remedial actions have been taken. We make sure to prevent recurrence by establishing relevant preventive measures and correct business practices that may trigger potential risks.\nProtection of the Three Basic Rights of Workers in Korea\n\nWe engage in various activities to protect the three basic rights of workers guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of Korea.\n\n1) Right to organize, right to collective bargaining, and right to collective action\n\nOperation of the Labor-Management Advisory Committee\n\nWe established the Labor-Management Advisory Committee under the Board of Directors in August 2020 to ensure sustainability management of the organization and build mutually beneficial labor-management relations. It is composed of four outside experts who identify and examine relevant issues through meetings with the executive management and the Compliance Committee and consult with executives in charge of personnel affairs to make mid-to-long-term recommendations.\n\nGrievance Channel Improvement at Samsung Electronics Vietnam\n\nSamsung Electronics Vietnam joined hands with CSR Europe in 2020 to assess the procedures and operation of its grievance resolution channels and identified improvement areas such as its hotline infrastructure that was lacking efficiency. Based on the findings, a call center was established in 2021 to integrate the existing 34 and 14 hotlines at its two business sites and enhance accessibility for its employees. This instantly led to an increase in the number of filed grievances.\n\nThe grievance report center proved effective in helping employees conveniently file their grievances and the company readily handle them, especially in the wake of the outbreak of the pandemic. The majority of the filed grievances concerned on-site conditions (workplace infection control and quarantine requirements pertaining to the pandemic among others) and infrastructure (including dormitories, cafeterias, and commuter shuttles). All grievances were resolved in line with the internal procedures and timeline.\n\nCommunication with Labor Unions\n\nWe frequently hold meetings and communicate with employee labor unions to identify their needs, make related improvements, and thereby reinforce sound labor-management relations. We post links to different labor unions on our intranet, provide offline office spaces, and ensure access to our online bulletin and email system to support their activities.\n\nLatest Developments in Collective Bargaining\n\nThrough collective bargaining with the joint bargaining group formed by the labor unions, we agreed on 95 items and successfully concluded a collective agreement at our Korean business site in August 2021 without any dispute. At the collective agreement conclusion ceremony, the Joint Statement on Labor-Management Cooperation was announced to highlight our focus on building forward-looking relations.\n\nWe invited labor law experts to give special lectures for our company\u2019s leadership on topics such as the changing labor-management environment and newly enacted and amended labor laws as an extension of our efforts to ensure compliance management. We also organized special lectures on ways to realize mutually beneficial labor-management relations for staff members responsible for labor-management relations affairs to achieve forward-looking relations between our employees and company.\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nAn unwavering commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workplace is necessary for true innovation and progress. We strive to nurture a corporate culture that brings together talented people from different backgrounds and perspectives and encourages them to engage with each other. We do not discriminate against gender, race, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or any other group identity, while, at the same time, promoting practices that drive greater diversity and equality.\n\nOur company-wide and country-specific policies and programs are aligned with our pursuit of a more diverse and inclusive corporate culture. We also strive to ensure that diversity and inclusion are represented throughout the entire lifecycle of our products and services. We remain sensitive to the voices of our stakeholders\u2014including our customers, shareholders, and investors\u2014and reflect them in all levels of decision-making.\n\nCertifications and Recognition\n\nIn recognition of our continuous pursuit of diversity and inclusion, we have been selected as a family-friendly company by the Korean Ministry of Gender Equality and Family for nine consecutive years from 2013. Our US subsidiary received a perfect score in the Corporate Equality Index operated by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for three consecutive years from 2019 for its inclusive policies for LGBTQ+ employees. It was also included in the Best Employers for Veterans 2020 and 2021 by Forbes. Our scores on the diversity and inclusion items in the Samsung Culture Index rated by our overseas employees have also continued to rise each year.\n\nCASE\n\nChange the Face Alliance\n\nWe are a founding member of the #ChangeTheFace Alliance with the aim of driving diversity and inclusion in the IT industry. We continue to take action to accelerate changes with our stakeholders in collaboration with a collective of like-minded industry leaders such as Vodafone, the company that first launched this initiative.\n\nPolicies and Programs\n\nWe pursue a horizontal organizational culture that respects individual experiences and perspectives and ensures freedom of speech for employees of all ranks. To this end, we eliminated the use of honorific titles in 2017 and introduced the practice of addressing one another by name with \u201cpro\u201d (short for \u201cprofessional\u201d) or by adding the honorific suffix \u201cnim\u201d in Korea.\n\nIn 2021, we made it a rule for all employees, regardless of rank, to conduct the SCI survey. Our team members value and treat one another respectfully.\n\nReinforcement of Anti-Discrimination Principles\n\nWe strive to go beyond simply adhering to social and legal requirements in a passive manner and uphold the value of diversity to set ourselves apart from our competitors. We regularly review and update our internal policies to ensure compliance with newly enacted and amended laws and regulations, globally. This enables us to prevent discrimination of our partner companies as well as our employees. As an extension of such efforts, we supplemented and updated the anti-discrimination principles specified in the Global Code of Conduct and Guidelines on the Prevention of Harassment to more extensively deal with diversity issues concerning race, gender, religion, language, and other group identities. The new Anti-Discrimination and Harassment Policy was published in March 2022.\n\nEqual Pay Policy\n\nPursuant to the ILO Equal Remuneration Convention (No. 100), we are committed to a policy of equal pay for work of equal value for all employees with similar experience and performance, regardless of gender. Driven by this initiative, our gender pay gap in Korea improved by 3.1% in 2021 compared to 2019.\n\nFemale employees\u2019 compensation rate compared to male employees at different career levels (Korea, 2021)\n\n| Career Level | CL1 | CL2 | CL3 | CL4 | Executives |\n|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------------|\n| Percentage   | 107%| 100%| 100%| 99% | 101%       |\n\n* Percentage of base pay and incentives paid to female employees compared to male employees (calculated based on new employees who joined or were promoted to each career level (CL)).\n\n1) Female employee\u2019s compensation seems relatively high because numerous male employees belonged to organizations with lower incentives.\nWomen\n\nFostering Female Leaders As part of our focus on building a culture centered on diversity and inclusion, we strive to inspire excellence and help our employees reach their full potential through access to equal opportunities. We operate a range of programs and policies to ensure gender equality in recruiting new hires and to help our female employees return to work and successfully build their career after taking leave for pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nIn Korea, we were one of the earliest adopters of parental leave, fertility treatment leave, extended childcare leave, and reduced working hours for childcare. The length of each of these programs also extends beyond the legal requirements. In 2021, the number of our in-house daycare centers reached 15, with a total capacity of over 3,300 children. We maintained a high-quality childcare environment by regulating the ratio of daycare staff to children even more stringently than the legal requirements.\n\nWe have also mandated the installation of lounges for pregnant women and new mothers at our overseas production sites to ensure maternal and child health. Our Vietnam subsidiary operates a Mommy Room at 21 locations and has obstetrics and gynecology specialists stationed at their business sites.\n\nWe also plan to introduce a Re-boarding program in 2022, which offers training, mentoring, and remote work opportunities for employees returning to work from maternity leave to help them adjust gradually.\n\nThe DX Division has been offering leadership training and a networking program for female executives and executive candidates since 2021.\n\nEmployees with Disabilities\n\nSupport at Work We strive to create an environment that inspires and encourages our employees with disabilities to reach their full potential. Their preferences and competence are taken into full consideration before deciding on their position and role. Regular meetings are held to identify their challenges and needs.\n\nIn order to minimize possible inconveniences in their daily activities, we continue to improve our workplace accessibility. Since 2011, we have regularly conducted inspections on buildings and facilities at our domestic business sites to examine whether they meet the Samsung Barrier Free (SBF) standards and have introduced and expanded accessibility elevators, accessibility restrooms, low-floor buses, and other accessibility features, based on our findings.\n\nWe also value the voices of our employees with disabilities in the development of accessibility-related features. Based on their opinions and suggestions, we embedded a series of features for enhanced accessibility in our products, including the remote control with Braille buttons, Focused Zoom for enlarging the text of certain menu items (channel, volume, etc.), and Screen reader, in our TVs and other home appliances.\n\nCross-Generational Communication\n\nWe operate various channels that facilitate communication between our Millennial and Gen Z employees and executive management to promote mutual understanding that better reflects the perspectives of younger generations in our business activities.\n\nGlobal Marketing Center Through the Future Generation Lab, which is comprised of talented and passionate staff members in their 20s from around the world, we plan and launch brands and product marketing strategies that target younger generations.\n\nVisual Display Business The Gen Z and Millennial Board was established to deliver the needs, perspectives, and experiences of those in their 20s and 30s directly to the head of Visual Display. Through this system, they are able to share their thoughts on our products, customer trends, and trending topics on social networking services.\n\nMX Business The head of MX and executive management remain attentive to the voices of Millennial and Gen Z customers and employees, and reflect them in the actions and decisions of MX through the operation of Gen Z Lab. More than 100 Millennial and Gen Z staff members are involved in Gen Z Lab, through which they discuss the latest trends and give their suggestions on our products, services, and issues of major concern to the head of the business and executive management.\n\nDigital Appliances Business Millennial and Gen Z staff members with diverse backgrounds came together and formed MZ Crew. They regularly meet to share their concerns and interests, and propose innovative ideas about our home appliances and services as well as other activities of Digital Appliances Business.\n\nWe also ensure interaction between our Millennial and Gen Z employees and executive management through regular events such as Pride in Memory in our Memory Business and town hall meetings in our Foundry Business.\nFuture Generation Lab\n\n\u201cWhat is trending amongst the MZ generation?\u201d\n\nFuture Generation Lab has the answer to this question. Comprised of those in their 20s working at our global subsidiaries, we set up Future Generation Lab to more effectively reflect the opinions of our Gen Z employees in our business operations and attract more Gen Z customers. Members of the lab help plan brands and products targeted at younger generations based on the opinions and diverse perspectives of Gen Z employees and customers collected from around the world.\n\nThe activities of the Future Generation Lab were spotlighted at CES 2022 in January. During the keynote speech by Samsung Electronics, Future Generation Lab members took the mic following Vice Chairman Han Jong-hee to introduce our products and services from a Gen Z viewpoint. They prepared the presentation materials and designed the stage themselves. The presentation became widely discussed as it was rare for young, working-level employees to present on a stage dedicated to keynote speeches by corporations. In February 2022, we launched a social campaign entitled #Frameityourway on TikTok, one of Gen Z\u2019s preferred social media platforms, under the leadership of Future Generation Lab. This campaign was designed to challenge users to replace their old TVs with our new products in partnership with young influencers. The series of 30-second shorts received rave reviews by Gen Z customers around the globe, recording 13 million views in total within a short period of time (January 31-February 19).\n\nFuture Generation Lab members continue to actively interact with Gen Z outside of our company through a Gen Z External Advisor program comprising influencers and college students in their 20s. As a result, Future Generation Lab is able to provide our executive management and employees with objective perspectives and balanced insights that have led to tailored marketing for The Freestyle, the release of Cooking Service 2.0, and collaborations for Galaxy accessories.\n\nFuture Generation Lab participates in our new product and service reviews, as well as other projects. It is the embodiment of our focus on attracting and retaining Gen Z customers.\n\nWe will remain committed to listening to their voices and reflecting their opinions in the development of our products and services, and our marketing strategies, to reach a wider base of Gen Z customers.\n\n\u201cIn addition to utilizing content produced by Future Generation Lab members, we also worked with influencers popular among Gen Z fans and that were viewed as a perfect fit with our company. We gave them creative freedom to create content and deliver our overarching message. After all, they are the experts in communication with younger generations.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Andrew Georgiou (Future Generation Lab) \u2013\n\n\u201cI believe the campaign was able to draw such extensive attention because it was thoroughly planned and prepared to meet the needs of Gen Z.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Chrissie Moncrieffe (Future Generation Lab) \u2013\nEmployee Resource Groups\n\nEmployee Resource Groups\n\nOur employees are our most valuable sources of innovation. We strive to create a work environment that fosters belonging, ensures equal access to opportunities, and helps our employees achieve both personal and professional growth.\n\nOur Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are voluntarily organized and operated by employees around themes related to diversity and inclusion such as women, persons with disabilities, generation, race, and veterans. Currently, over 3,700 employees in North America, Central and South America, Europe, and Southwest Asia are participating in about 30 ERGs\\(^1\\), which offer networking opportunities, mentoring, volunteer services, and employee training.\n\nLogos of ERGs at Samsung Electronics America\n\n\\(^1\\) 15 ERGs for women, one for LGBTQ+, three for race, two for veterans, four for generation, two for working parents, one for persons with disabilities, and three for culture\n\nOur ERG Activities\n\nWomen\n\nA total of 15 women-related ERGs are in operation, with multiple ERGs kicking off in North America, Europe, Central and South America, and Southwest Asia in 2021. These ERGs offer various programs that support networking and career development for our female employees. At our UK subsidiary, the Samsung Pioneer initiative was created to promote gender equality and bring positive workplace changes to the IT industry through open forums, surveys, and media promotions.\n\nRace\n\nA total of three race-related ERGs are operating in the US and UK. In particular, Galaxy of Black Professionals (GBP) in the US has STEM in a wide range of internal and external CSR activities. They also formed a new partnership with an organization dedicated to fostering technical skills in women and youth.\n\nUNIDOS, established to support Hispanics in the US, held a panel discussion to enable support for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) to secure talent in STEM.\n\nBP@S (Black Professionals @ Samsung) of the UK works to reduce racial gaps in recruitment and the workforce pipeline. In 2021, BP@S produced a series of video interviews with black colleagues at Samsung Electronics UK in commemoration of Black History Month as an extension of its efforts to raise awareness on racial discrimination.\n\nLGBTQ+\n\nSince its inception in 2017, the Samsung Equality Alliance, an LGBTQ+ ERG at our US subsidiary, has conducted a diverse range of campaigns and programs every year to support LGBTQ+ communities and improve the public\u2019s awareness of LGBTQ+ issues. In recognition of its continued commitment, it obtained a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index for two consecutive years. Additionally, our US subsidiary was included in the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality.\n\nIn June 2021, the alliance held a lecture on the history of gender equality, inviting outside experts in celebration of PRIDE Month. It has also formed a partnership with Out in Tech, which is the world\u2019s largest community of LGBTQ+ developers.\n\nVeterans\n\nOur two subsidiaries in the US have ERGs established to support veterans and their families. The Samsung Veterans Community and the Military Appreciation Group continue to engage in a range of activities in cooperation with relevant national associations and civil society groups.\n\nIn 2021, they hosted a walking race to raise funds for veterans and paramedics in celebration of Veterans Day in the US, and raised USD 7,000. They also contribute to the advancement of local communities through volunteer work in collaboration with private organizations that support veterans.\n\nAwareness-Raising Training and Campaigns\n\nTo embed diversity and inclusion in our corporate DNA, we ensure that all of our employees, from executive management to new hires, accurately understand and practice these values at all times. To this end, we have included courses to promote an understanding of diversity and inclusion in our programs to train new hires in Korea and abroad since 2018. Over 6,000 employees have completed these courses upon joining our company.\n\nWe also added diversity and inclusion content to the training curriculum for global personnel managers and subsidiary heads, as well as for employees scheduled to be dispatched to overseas subsidiaries. Our US subsidiary independently developed 11 programs on topics such as unconscious bias, inclusive leadership, and racial equality, which were completed by over 1,000 employees.\n\nWe developed a training program aimed at motivating substantive actions to create an inclusive workplace in collaboration with the non-profit Lean In. We also continue to update our inclusive language guidelines across the four categories of gender, disabilities, culture, and age, to root out the use of discriminatory terms at work.\nHealth and Safety\n\nWorkplace Safety\n\nTo achieve world-class safety at all our business sites, we ensure that each site is equipped with tailored health and safety management systems, and we continually identify and analyze potential hazards and risks. The head of the Global EHS Center and head of Global Manufacturing & Infra Technology serve as Chief Safety Officer (CSO) in the DX Division and DS Division, respectively, to supervise the operation of workplace safety management indicators, the implementation of safety standards assessments, the establishment of a safe work environment, and the reinforcement of safety-related practices.\n\nHealth and Safety Management System Certification\n\nOur business operations are centered on our stringent health and safety management system. It is mandatory for all our production sites to attain ISO 45001 which is a standard of occupational health and safety management systems. As of 2021, 100% of our production sites around the world have obtained certification.\n\nCreation of a Safe Workplace\n\nIntegrated Diagnosis We perform workplace safety reviews each year to identify risk factors for disasters and assess our compliance with relevant laws and facility management practices. In 2022, we established an integrated workplace safety diagnostic system at all of the DS Division\u2019s global business sites in partnership with outside experts.\n\nIncident Prevention Process\n\n| Incident Prevention Process |\n|----------------------------|\n| **Identifying Risk Factors** |\n| - Outdated equipment |\n| - Safety regulation compliance failure |\n| - Inadequate on-site management |\n| **Establishing countermeasures** |\n| - Equipment life span projection |\n| - Safety regulation compliance measures |\n| - On-site management system |\n| **Taking remedial action** |\n| - Equipment monitoring |\n| - Safety training |\n| - On-site investigations |\n| **Monitoring** |\n| - Performance management |\n| - Process improvement |\n\nSafety Management System Upgrades To ensure the daily safety management and work efficiency of all employees, we upgraded our safety management system in nine areas including the management of machinery with hazardous risks, lab inspections, and safety monitoring. In particular, we empowered our employees in the field by enabling those in organizational units handling machinery with hazardous risks to independently perform internal verification and user management.\n\nPotential Hazard Identification and Elimination We provide full support for our employees to proactively identify and eliminate potential hazards on business sites. Best practices for the proactive elimination of serious potential hazards are rewarded and widely shared with other business sites. Our semiconductor business sites are subject to advance risk assessments prior to each and every production without exception. Based on the findings from such risk assessments, on-site safety management measures are implemented. Automated and unmanned systems have been introduced for tasks deemed particularly hazardous, such as work dealing with chemical substances or performed at heights, to prevent the risk at its source.\n\nReinforced Fire and Explosion Precautions We conducted thorough inspections and offered consulting for our business sites with greater fire and explosion risks in collaboration with expert organizations such as the Samsung Global Loss Control Center of Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance. Inspections of local ventilation performance, firefighting equipment, and high-pressure gas use were conducted at domestic business sites.\n\nAt overseas business sites, fire risks related to foam processing and high-pressure tanks as well as emergency evacuation preparedness were assessed and remedied. We also established the fire emergency monitoring system to track the firefighting status of overseas business sites in real time and take prompt actions where necessary.\n\nCASE\n\nIECEx CSF Certification\n\nThe DS Division established a safety management system to prevent explosions, which may lead to serious disasters.\n\nWe formed a dedicated organizational unit to conduct quality control and regular inspections of explosion proof facilities, while also fostering 15 explosion based on our IECEx\u00aeCoPC\u00ae certification. In recognition of such efforts, our Giheung and Hwaseong became our first domestic production sites to attain IECEx CSF\u00ae certification in February 2022. This certification ensures the site meets international explosion proof and safety standards. We will continually focus on enhancing the explosion proof capacity of all relevant business sites.\n\n1) International Electrotechnical commission Certification System for Explosive Atmospheres\n2) Certificate of Personal Competency\n3) Certified Service Facility\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment Development and Introduction\n\nWe convene the Personal Protective Equipment Council every month to discuss protective equipment criteria and enhance the safety and convenience of such equipment. In 2021, we developed a chemical protective clothing with improved wearability, air-permeability, and performance, by upgrading the existing fabric. The flame-resistant helmets and gloves used by electricians were made more lightweight, while hearing protection equipment was improved to more effectively block hazardous noise and facilitate on-site communication.\nWorkplace Traffic Safety Assessment\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive workplace traffic safety assessment in cooperation with expert organizations, including the Samsung Traffic Safety Research Institute of Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance, to ensure the safety of both pedestrians and vehicles and prevent accidents on all of our premises. An on-site assessment of major traffic accident risks, pedestrian safety in blind spots, traffic safety measures of new buildings, and more, was performed at business sites with heavier traffic. Based on the findings, we installed facilities to provide guidance on right-of-way at crossroads without traffic lights, set up speed-reduction systems at speed control sections, and reorganized lanes and installed safety facilities at sections where vehicles frequently make illegal U-turns and drive in reverse.\n\nSafety Capacity Reinforcement\n\nSafety Training for Employees\n\nWe conduct regular firefighting training to prevent accidents. Our employees practice response to fires, earthquakes, chemical leakage, and other emergencies. In 2021, 6,246 emergency training sessions were performed, and each employee underwent an average of 1.6 training sessions and 17 hours of education.\n\nWorkplace Safety Training for Employees\n\n| Training Target | Details | Achievements in 2021 |\n|-----------------|---------|----------------------|\n| Employees       | Introductory training, legally required basic training, and safety leadership training for executives | 1,705,901 hours of training completed by 230,386 employees |\n| Staff members in charge of environment and safety (domestic business sites) | Internal inspector course, licensed specialist course (master mechanics, technicians, etc.), legal compensation course, etc. | 54,555 hours of training completed by 6,875 employees |\n| Staff members in charge of environment and safety (overseas business sites) | Global EHS Conference, Invitational key leader course for overseas staff members, and independent safety and environment training of individual overseas business sites | 1,547,250 hours of training completed by 277,331 employees |\n\nContact-Free Training and Education\n\nThroughout 2021, we conducted contact-free workplace safety education and emergency training due to the pandemic. All training sessions for our employees were held online, with quiz contests and pedestrian and vehicle safety campaigns held to maximize effectiveness. Regular training was replaced with tabletop exercises\\(^1\\) to verify the effectiveness of incident-specific emergency response scenarios.\n\n1) Training sessions where members discuss their roles and responses to emergency situations.\n\nRisk Assessment Specialist Program\n\nWe operate a risk assessment specialist program to enhance the risk assessment capabilities of our employees. This program consists of the two courses of Job Safety Analysis and Process Hazards Analysis. In 2021, we developed 1,405 risk assessment specialists in the DS Division (1,118 from our company and 287 from our partner companies). We also offered focused training for the identification of complex hazards for 375 outstanding graduates from the previous year\u2019s program.\n\nProgram Details\n\n| Courses | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| Job Safety Analysis | Job Safety Analysis methodology theory and practical training based on work procedure such as finding for hazard and review of safety devices |\n| Process Hazards Analysis | Process Hazard Analysis methodology theory and case studies about representative process facility |\n\nSafety Supporters\n\nOur Safety Supporters work to motivate our employees to build a safety-centered culture with a strong foundation. They identify hazard risk factors and offer advice on how to eliminate them. In 2021, 1,170 employees in the DS Division served as Safety Supporters.\n\nWorkplace Safety Innovation Day\n\nEvery year we celebrate Workplace Safety Innovation Day, with different events held across each of our business units. Recently, we expanded to celebrate Global Manufacturing and Workplace Safety Innovation Day to share workplace safety risk analysis results and case studies of safety improvements for manufacturing processes and infrastructure. In 2021, the DX Division held an online celebration, bringing together three Korean business sites and 21 overseas business sites. The celebration consisted of presentations and discussions on ways to preemptively address external risks, reinforce operating efficiency, share workplace safety and manufacturing innovation practices, and promote new technologies and smart factory establishment.\n\nThe DS Division set up the Parts Suppliers\u2019 Workplace Safety Secretariat under the leadership of the five key member companies\\(^1\\) to more effectively pursue relevant activities. The secretariat comprises three divisions responsible for serious disaster prevention, eco-conscious practices, and competitiveness in future technology. It focuses on defining 35 tasks to be executed at the division level, from water resources management to risk assessment infrastructure establishment. In 2021, 64 new tasks (integrated control system construction for critical incident prevention, resource circulation, etc.) were identified, and the roadmap for their execution was developed. In 2021, the division held a contact Workplace Safety Innovation Day ceremony to join in the efforts to curb the spread of the pandemic. Best innovation practices and knowledge were shared with all of the employees of our parts suppliers through our internal online broadcasting service.\n\n\\(^1\\) Samsung Electronics, Samsung Display, Samsung SDI, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, and Samsung Biologics\nEmployee Healthcare\n\nWe are equipped with a company-wide organizational unit, as well as units at individual business sites, dedicated to promoting our employees\u2019 health, improving work environments, and preventing disease. Since 2010, the DS Division has operated the Samsung Health Research Institute (SHRI), Korea\u2019s very first corporate research institute specializing in occupational disease prevention and healthcare for frontline workers. The DX Division operates the Health Management Secretariat.\n\nWe also provide healthcare support by operating clinics, physical therapy centers, pharmacies, Oriental medicine clinics, the Mental Health Clinic, the Life Coaching Center, musculoskeletal exercise centers, and fitness centers on our premises.\n\nHealthcare System\n\n- Health promotion facilities: Medical facilities (in-house clinics, Mental Health Clinic, etc.), fitness centers, and musculoskeletal exercise centers\n- Health promotion programs: Smoking cessation and alcohol abstinence campaigns, stair climbing campaign, healthy meal plans, etc.\n- Work environment improvement\n  - Monitoring of potential hazards at work\n  - Research and elimination of harmful factors for the musculoskeletal system\n  - Elimination of odor, dust, and noise\n- Disease prevention\n  - Medical checkup, infection monitoring, and guidance on requirements for infection prevention\n  - Vaccination Services on a regular basis: Influenza, typhoid, hepatitis, etc.\n  - Healthcare for those traveling to other countries for business: Updating of travel-restricted and travel-prohibited countries, provision of essential medications, etc.\n\nHealth Promotion Activities (Korea)\n\nMedical Checkup and Follow-Up Management We offer a medical checkup service for all of our employees each year. They undergo a comprehensive checkup or general checkup depending on their age. A specialized checkup is performed for those handling chemical substances pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. One-on-one physician counseling and healthcare programs are provided to employees diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, and other diseases.\n\nSwitch On The Switch On program was launched in partnership with Kangbuk Samsung Hospital to ensure employee healthcare amid the prolonged pandemic. It is composed of five weeks of dietary therapy and exercise therapy as well as weekly body composition analysis and personalized feedback. The program was evaluated to have significantly contributed to the improvement of our employees\u2019 health.\n\nCASE\n\nEmployee Protection against COVID-19\n\nWe strive to protect our employees around the globe against the threat of COVID-19. We mandated mask-wearing both indoors and outdoors at all of our business sites, prohibited symptomatic employees from coming to work, and required on-site social distancing, while also ensuring compliance with country-specific infection control guidelines. We also recommend remote working for all employees and require high-risk groups, such as pregnant employees and those with preexisting medical conditions, to work from home. For those who are unable to work from home and those whose physical presence on site is critical, we perform fever checks prior to their entry with their consent. We also provide free diagnostic testing and respiratory examination services for symptomatic employees via in-house clinics at some large-scale business sites. If cases of positive test results, manufacturing workers are allowed to take paid leave, while office workers are placed under self-isolation.\n\nSmart Diabetes Management Since 2021, we have distributed blood glucose monitors with an attachable sensor to employees with a high risk of diabetes. Based on the monitoring results, physicians and clinical dietitians provide an eight-week personalized healthcare service with guidelines for daily routines, meal plans, and medication.\n\nEffects\n\n- Glycated hemoglobin decreased by 37% on average (11.2% \u2192 7.1%)\n- Fasting blood sugar decreased by 48% on average (235 \u2192 123mg/dL)\n\nObesity Management We offered online personal coaching, at-home training support, healthcare information, and protein powder products for 500 employees with a BMI of 30 or higher and helped them drastically lower their BMI.\n\nTrilateral Care This healthcare system is based on trilateral cooperation among the units to which employees belong, units responsible for workplace safety, and units in charge of personnel affairs. Each employee is allocated a physician to monitor his or her conditions and given opportunities to adjust the workload and work environment through interviews with the heads of the units.\n\nHealthcare Campaigns We continually stage walking campaigns and smoking cessation campaigns using the Samsung Health app. We also invite outside experts to give healthcare lectures and inspire proactive health management.\nWork Environment Improvement\n\nMusculoskeletal Disorder Prevention Exercise Center (Korea)\n\nSince 2010, we have operated a Musculoskeletal Disorder Prevention Exercise Center to help our employees maintain their musculoskeletal health. The center offers examinations on basic body composition, sense of balance, and core muscle strength as well as somatotype measurement. Healthcare specialists then recommend exercise programs based on one-on-one counseling. The center specializes in remedial exercise therapy and post-therapy rehabilitation programs for scoliosis, text neck, and other common symptoms found in today\u2019s workers.\n\nIn 2021, contact-free musculoskeletal health promotion programs were provided due to the pandemic, and were used 20,661 times. Personalized one-on-one exercise plans are also offered annually to those performing jobs that are likely to strain the musculoskeletal system.\n\nTo help prevent the onset of musculoskeletal disorders for manufacturing line workers, we analyzed and made improvements to the work environment in 2021. As a result, we developed an ergonomic chair tailored to their needs, with reduced load on the musculoskeletal system and enhanced comfort. This new ergonomic chair is now being distributed to production sites.\n\nSome organizational units also offer a standing desk for those suffering from musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nErgonomic Line Certification\n\nWe make continuous improvements to our work environment for manufacturing processes to optimize ergonomics.\n\nWe operate the ergonomic line certification system based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA), which analyzes each manufacturing process from an ergonomics-centric perspective and executes quantitative evaluation. In 2021, we developed the automatic ergonomic analysis tool to automatically analyze the video recorded motions of workers and distributed it to all of our overseas business sites. This significantly reduced ergonomic analysis time and enhanced credibility.\n\nWe identified 220 points of improvement (incorrect posture, repetitive jobs, excessive strain, etc.) through the analysis of 549 manufacturing lines and implemented improvements accordingly.\n\n1) Rapid Entire Body Assessment\n\n| Improvement Cases in Overseas Business Sites (Unit: Number of cases) |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Improvements by Types**                                      |\n| Total | Incorrect Posture | Repetitive Jobs | Work Environment | Excessive Strain | Contact Stress |\n|-------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| 220   | 84                | 68              | 37               | 26              | 5              |\nHuman Resources Development\n\nWe provide comprehensive support for our employees to develop their skills and reach their full potential based on our corporate value of \u201cPeople First.\u201d\n\nCompetence-Building Programs\n\nWe operate programs designed to foster creativity, a healthy dissatisfaction with the status quo, leadership, and expertise in our employees. We perform systematic leadership assessments each year and provide leadership training. We also help our employees plan for the future in preparation of retirement and longer life expectancies.\n\nCareer Development Training\n\nAll of our employees are given opportunities to design their career development path under the guidance of the heads of their respective organizational units and select corresponding career development programs. For software developers, for example, we provide training on AI/Data, algorithms, software architecture, and code review as well as lectures and training from outside experts and partners.\n\nSales & marketing employees undergo trainings on developing a customer-centric mindset and business acumen, digital literacy, and collaboration in addition to Samsung sales and marketing fundamentals. Samsung Marketing Academy, our global sales and marketing training channel, also offers curated learning programs encompassing a diverse range of topics (B2C sales, online sales, product marketing, Integrated marketing communication, etc.) for those who wish to develop their sales and marketing career.\n\nExternal Fostering & In-house School\n\nWe provide opportunities for our employees to participate in outside programs\u2014including MBA programs, master\u2019s courses in personnel and finance, and academic training programs in Korea and abroad\u2014based on their career level and needs.\n\nThe Samsung Institute of Technology (SSIT), originally launched in 1989 as an in-house semiconductor technology college to build the competence of on-site workers, was accredited as a regular university in 2001 and offers four-year bachelor\u2019s courses in equipment, infrastructure, and display. We also established the Semiconductor Display Engineering Department and DMC Engineering Department at Sungkyunkwan University as our in-house graduate school courses to nurture next-generation tech leaders. As of February 2022, 1,045 bachelor degree holders, 769 master\u2019s degree holders, and 89 doctoral degree holders have graduated from SSIT and our in-house graduate school.\n\nOpportunities to Change Jobs\n\nJob Posting is our in-house program that gives employees an opportunity to pursue a new career path. Over the past three years, 2,119 employees have successfully changed positions. This has proven to be mutually beneficial for both individual employees and their respective organizational units. We also ensure a soft landing for those changing jobs through mindset training, mentoring, and job skill training.\n\nRegional Expert Program\n\nThe Regional Expert Program was introduced in 1990 to help our employees go global. It is an overseas training program that allows employees with at least three years of experience at our company to go overseas and learn the local language and familiarize themselves with the local culture for a period of one to two years. Over 3,500 regional experts from 80 countries have been cultivated through this program to date.\n\nTalent Cultivation System\n\n| Operating Objective | Core Program | Leadership Program | Expertise Program | Key Areas |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Curriculum          | Instilling Samsung\u2019s vision, value, and culture in employees | Foster core global leaders | Develop top experts by job category | Samsung MBA |\n|                     | Onboarding education for new hires, and annual presentation of strategic direction to all employees | Leadership based on Samsung\u2019s leadership model | Job-specific training provided by specialized organizational units | Regional Expert Program |\n|                     |                                                          |                                 |                                 | Academic training |\n|                     |                                                          |                                 |                                 | In-house graduate program in Technology |\n\n1) Some of the figures in the 2021 Sustainability Report require correction. As of February 2021, the number of those who have attained undergraduate, master\u2019s, and doctoral degrees at SSIT and our in-house graduate school stands at 1,020 (not 1,002), 728 (not 1,150), and 84 (not 177).\n\n1) R&D, marketing, sales, service, logistics, procurement, manufacturing, and management administration\n2) Samsung Advanced Technology Training Institute (R&D), Samsung Marketing Academy (sales and marketing), Global CS Center (quality and service), Partners Collaboration Center (procurement), Corporate Design Center (design), and Global Technology Research (manufacturing and production engineering)\nOrganizational Culture\n\nWe strive to build a sound and forward-looking organizational culture grounded in the three values of \u201cWork Smart\u201d, \u201cThink Hard\u201d, and \u201cBuild Trust\u201d.\n\nOur organizational culture is aimed at encouraging our employees to grow and share innovative ideas, and we reflect them extensively in our products, systems, and processes to generate the desired results.\n\n01. Idea Generation\nBrainstorming innovative ideas\n\n02. Communication\nSharing and promoting them through active communication\n\n03. Execution\nReflecting them in our products, systems, and processes\n\n04. Output\nGenerating the desired results\n\nTo this end, we focus on creating a horizontal workplace that facilitates communication. In consideration of the ongoing pandemic, we have implemented a range of programs to ensure greater work efficiency, work-life balance, and employee satisfaction.\n\nHorizontal Structure\n\nIn 2017, we streamlined the previous seven career levels into four and replaced honorific titles with the honorific suffixes \u201cnim\u201d and \u201cpro\u201d (short for \u201cprofessional\u201d) in pursuit of a more flexible and inclusive organizational culture in Korea. In 2022, we made it a rule to use the honorific form of language at work at all times regardless of position, title, length of service, and age and have campaigned extensively to help implement this policy. Beginning in February 2022, we also removed positions and employee identification numbers to help implement this policy. The meetings have become an effective channel to share the executive management\u2019s goals, principles, and major business issues, as well as provide prompt answers to employees\u2019 questions.\n\nInternal Communication\n\nTo build mutual trust between our executive management and employees, we seek and maintain diverse communication channels suited to the needs of employees of all ranks. Our town hall meetings, held regularly under the leadership of division and business heads, have received positive responses from employees. The meetings have become an effective channel to share the executive management\u2019s goals, principles, and major business issues, as well as provide prompt answers to employees\u2019 questions.\n\nThe team heads and group heads reinforce their bonds with employees through the monthly meeting and events aimed at energizing the organization. They strive to listen to their staff members\u2019 voices through one-on-one interviews and frequent conferences, and provide prompt solutions on site to help build mutual trust.\n\nWe have been operating an in-house communication platform since 2009 to create a transparent and active communication culture of our employees. In December 2020, we newly opened our bulletin \u201cSamsung Electronics NOW\u201d with a shake-up. On our bulletin, which guarantees anonymity, an average of 300-400 messages are posted every day, testifying to its significance for internal communication.\n\nPrograms to Ensure a Healthier Work-Life Balance\n\nWe continually evolve our work system by adopting flexible and efficient programs tailored to individual jobs. We allow our employees to customize their working hours and annual leave and have more control over their schedule to truly achieve a \u201cWork Smart\u201d environment.\n\nBeginning in 2016 in Korea, we designated our monthly payday as Family Day to encourage all employees to leave work by five and spend more time with family. Some organizational units further expanded this program and allow their staff members to leave work early once a week or every other week.\n\nTo build a healthier work-life balance, we also offer remote working options. In the wake of the outbreak of the pandemic, the percentage of those working remotely has continued to increase. As of March 2022, 39% of sales and research institute employees overseas are working from home.\n\nWe have also operated the family care leave1) program since 2020 to assist our employees facing the loss of childcare options due to the pandemic. In 2021, a total of 4,322 employees benefited from this program.\n\n1) Leave allowed for up to ten days a year (Korea) for those who need to care for family members (grandparents, parents, spouses, spouses\u2019 parents, children, and grandchildren) related to disease, injury, old age, etc.\nTo revitalize the overall organization during the pandemic, we held online town hall meetings, photo contests, and other contact-free events. We also organized health programs, such as the at-home training challenge and power walking competition, to improve the work-life balance of our employees as well as their workplace satisfaction.\n\nWelfare Benefits\n\nWe strive to ensure a better quality of life, enhance employee satisfaction, raise morale, and maximize employee engagement by operating a range of welfare programs. We help our employees remain prepared for their post-retirement life through personal pension support, while also providing educational and healthcare expenses for their family members. We also offer medical checkups and group insurance services to promote employee health and safety, as well as an array of elective welfare benefit programs that can be selected based on individual needs.\n\nWelfare Benefits (Korea)\n\n- Healthcare\n  - Medical expenses for employees and their spouses and children / Medical checkups / Medical expenses for disabilities and critical illnesses / Operation of in-house clinics\n- Support for Congratulations and Condolences\n  - Paid leave and financial support for related events\n  - Provision of funeral supplies and support services\n- Support for Education\n  - Support for preschool expenses / Support for educational expenses for elementary, middle, and high school and college / Leave for training and self-development\n- Entertainment and Recharging\n  - Company resorts / Waterparks / Fitness centers\n- Others\n  - Support for purchasing our company\u2019s products / Compensation for damage due to fire and other disasters / Elective welfare benefit programs / Leave for long-serving employees\n\nWork Efficiency Improvement\n\nWe strive to create a work environment that ensures greater employee engagement and generates the desired results. We revamped our offices to provide space for cooperation and engagement. We also offer single-person meeting rooms to meet the growing demand for video conferences due to the pandemic.\n\nMental Health Promotion Programs for Employees\n\nWe operate an in-house Life Coaching Center at 15 locations, and a Mental Health Clinic at 11 locations in Korea. We also promote mental health at 21 overseas subsidiaries with 20 Life Coaching Center locations and 11 overseas research institutes with Mental Health Clinic locations.\n\nThe Life Coaching Center is equipped with certified counseling professionals. It offers programs to reduce and control daily stress, such as tension relief, meditation, color therapy, and pain relief. Psychiatrists are stationed at the Mental Health Clinic to provide one-on-one counseling, medication, and mental health treatment, for a diverse range of issues including workplace relationships, grievances, stress release, and family affairs. Confidentiality is guaranteed for all information obtained through counseling and physician examinations pursuant to the code of ethics for counselors and the Medical Service Act.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the pandemic, we have ensured unrestricted access to psychological counseling by operating online programs and channels (video, telephone, and messenger counseling) on a permanent basis in Korea. Our production site and research institute in India operates hotlines to effectively resolve any grievances and difficulties of their staff members.\n\n1) Those subsidiaries and research institutes without an in-house Life Coaching Center utilize an external employee assistance program.\n\nSamsung Culture Index Survey\n\nWe conduct the global Samsung Culture Index (SCI) survey each year to identify our strengths and points of improvement, and gauge employee satisfaction with our work environment. The survey is centered on the three key values of our corporate culture: \u201cWork Smart\u201d, \u201cThink Hard\u201d, and \u201cBuild Trust\u201d. In 2021, over 240,000 employees at 126 business sites around the globe participated in the survey. The comprehensive satisfaction level has continued to rise since the introduction of the survey in 2012. The SCI score for overseas employees in 2021 was 90 points, marking a one-point increase from 2019.\n\nWe offer organizational culture consulting for units with lower SCI scores to help identify points of improvement and discover solutions. We engage professional consultants if deemed necessary and develop and implement improvement plans in cooperation with all members of the respective unit. We also identify additional weak points through post-consulting surveys to continually reinvent the way we work.\n\n1) The year 2020 was omitted due to the inability of some of our production sites to conduct the SCI survey that year.\nSUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nWe seek to foster a responsible, eco-conscious supply chain to achieve mutual growth with our suppliers and reinforce supply chain sustainability. We offer a range of programs designed to help our suppliers enhance their global competitiveness. We strive to ensure labor and human rights protection, environment preservation, and workers\u2019 health and safety throughout our supply chain, while also minimizing the negative impacts that may be incurred by the mineral mining process.\n\n| Responsible Supply Chain | 77 |\n|--------------------------|----|\n| Mutual Growth Throughout the Supply Chain | 81 |\n| Sustainable Supply Chain | 82 |\n| Transparent Management of Responsible Minerals | 83 |\n\nWin-Win Index\n\nHighest Index Rating for 10 Consecutive Years\n\n*Evaluation of large corporations\u2019 efforts to achieve mutual growth by the Korea Commission for Corporate Partnership based on their SME support history and surveys\n\nCDP Supply Chain Program\n\nOperated for 3 years\n\n* Program designed to help suppliers effectively respond to risks and opportunities through GHG management\n\nManagement of Responsible Minerals in the Supply Chain\n\n100% of smelters and refiners are validated by the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process of the Responsible Minerals Initiative\n\n* Using only minerals mined in a socially responsible manner that ensures human rights protection and environmental preservation across the entire supply chain\nResponsible Supply Chain\n\nWe strive to ensure strict adherence to global laws and proactive fulfillment of social responsibilities across all aspects of our supply chain. We also strive to reinforce the competitiveness of our supply chain with the aim of establishing a sustainable business ecosystem.\n\nSupplier Management System\n\nWe are equipped with an organizational unit dedicated to comprehensive supply chain management and operate an integrated purchase system based on the Global Purchasing Code of Conduct. We require our suppliers to follow the Supplier Code of Conduct and strive to build a robust and sound supply chain through rigorous supplier evaluations.\n\nOperating System\n\nGlobal Purchasing Code of Conduct All employees responsible for purchasing are required to comply with the Global Purchasing Code of Conduct encompassing purchasing standards, purchasing ethics criteria, and socially responsible purchasing.\n\nIntegrated Purchase System We have established an integrated purchase system (G-SRM) to manage our suppliers and supply chain; share information; conduct evaluations and supplier registration; ensure risk readiness, compliance management, and integrated work environment management; and share the codes of conduct and self-evaluation checklist.\n\nWe have automated the submission of requests for the supply of parts to our suppliers. The system automatically sets the delivery date based on the lead time agreed to by the two parties in advance. As such, we cannot reset the deadline unless we consult with the respective supplier and gain its prior approval for readjustment.\n\nSupply Chain Risk Management\n\nIn order to minimize the risks related to business continuity, we operate a system which can obtain disaster information in connection with disaster-specialized institutions and automatically analyze and respond to the impact of the supply chain.\n\nDedicated Organizational Unit\n\nWe are equipped with an organizational unit dedicated to managing the work environment and monitoring and supporting our suppliers. We operate various support programs for our suppliers\u2019 R&D, employee training, and competitiveness enhancement.\n\nComprehensive Supplier Evaluations\n\nWe perform comprehensive annual evaluations on our suppliers based on transaction data and materials submitted by each supplier to ensure the competitiveness of our supply chain. Major evaluation items include technology, quality, response, delivery, cost, environment and safety, finance, and corporate ethics. The results are reflected in the following year\u2019s purchasing policy to encourage our suppliers to improve their capabilities. In 2021, we added ESG risk diagnosis items to the evaluation to more effectively evaluate our suppliers\u2019 environment and social responsibility performance.\n\nThe 2021 comprehensive evaluations for those companies that have been in our supply chain for more than one year were conducted on 93% of our suppliers. The results showed that 68% were rated outstanding and 2.3% required improvement. For the DX Division, those suppliers rated outstanding are given priority in supply volume allocation for the following year and for the DS Division, those suppliers are given incentives such as extra points for the selection of exemplary innovation cases, the opportunity to tour our semiconductor business sites, and the deferment of the following year\u2019s comprehensive evaluation.\n\nSelection of New Suppliers\n\nWhen selecting new suppliers, we prioritize five areas: purchase quality, environment/safety, labor/human rights, eco-friendliness, and finance. Especially, we thoroughly review each candidate\u2019s environment/safety and labor/human rights status using the internal checklist based on the criteria of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). In 2021, the prohibitions on forced labor, inhumane treatment, and discrimination were incorporated as essential items to more rigorously verify each candidate\u2019s human rights status and protect vulnerable groups. Surveys and interviews to eradicate the forced labor of vulnerable workers were also added to thoroughly investigate how they were recruited, whether recruitment fees were paid, and whether they experienced any discrimination as well as their company dormitory conditions and working hours.\n\nTo ensure greater accuracy in new supplier evaluations, our in-house professionals in different areas visit each company to conduct on-site audits, while outside specialists are commissioned to evaluate the company\u2019s financial status (credit rating). In 2021, we performed registration evaluations on 82 companies. Among them, 76 were selected as new suppliers, and the other six were eliminated due to failure to meet essential labor and human rights criteria.\n\nMajor evaluation items for registration of new suppliers\n\nOpen Sourcing\n\nCompanies wishing to partner with us are able to submit proposals for parts and materials applicable to the products through our Open Sourcing program. We invite them to join us as partners once their competitiveness and other qualifications are verified to meet our internal standards. A total of 459 proposals were reviewed in 2021, 84 of which were integrated into our products.\n\nGo to Open Sourcing (business cooperation proposal)\n\nStandard Supplier Contract\n\nOur standard supplier contract includes corporate social responsibility requirements, such as compliance with internationally accepted human rights protection standards and labor practices and our company\u2019s workplace safety standards and codes of conduct.\nIntegrated Work Environment Management Process\n\nWe require all of our suppliers to comply with the local laws of their respective country as well as the Supplier Code of Conduct created based on the RBA Code of Conduct in relation to human rights, environment, health and safety, and ethics. To ensure compliance, we operate an integrated work environment management process consisting of self-assessments, on-site audits, and third-party audits. The findings from self-assessments, on-site audits, and third-party audits are reflected in the annual comprehensive evaluations, and those suppliers rated outstanding are recognized as exemplary innovation cases.\n\nOur first-tier suppliers are required to manage the work environments of their subcontractors in compliance with our internal work environment policy. For subcontractors with issues deemed to be of serious concern, we monitor whether remedial actions have been successfully implemented and the desired results have been achieved via our first-tier suppliers.\n\nSupplier Code of Conduct\n\nWe update our Supplier Code of Conduct to reflect revisions of the RBA Code of Conduct and other global norms, and require our suppliers to comply with it. We ensure that provisions regarding compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct are incorporated in every contract and require suppliers to sign a separate written agreement committing to compliance of our code. The Supplier Code of Conduct Guide help suppliers more effectively and easily follow the Supplier Code of Conduct and practice compliance management.\n\nSelf-Assessment\n\nBased on RBA\u2019s criteria, we developed a self-assessment tool that consists of 85 items and is used by all of our suppliers to perform annual self-assessments. In 2022, we reflected RBA\u2019s updated criteria in this tool to facilitate self-assessment. The updated criteria place greater weight on items of priority, such as forced labor, child labor, and industrial accidents, in order to preemptively identify potential risks of our suppliers. We encourage our suppliers to obtain certification related to international standards in corporate social responsibility (such as SA8000) and have included this as one of the self-assessment items.\n\nOn-Site Audit\n\nOur dedicated organizational unit conducts on-site audits on our suppliers. To more thoroughly and accurately audit their work environments, we first identify their issues and points of improvement based on the opinions and comments of their employees. The points of improvement are registered on the integrated purchase system, and the respective suppliers are required to establish and implement improvement measures accordingly. Some problems are remedied immediately, while the implementation of remedial action for other problems is verified within three months from the registration of the points of improvement. Facility installation, certification, and other matters that require an extended period of time and significant expenses to be resolved are monitored over a longer term based on the respective supplier\u2019s improvement plan. In 2021, we performed on-site audits on all 367 high-risk suppliers. As a result of implementing remedial action, the average on-site audit compliance rate reached 94%.\n\nWe demand prompt remedial action for any violations related to our top priorities, such as the prohibitions of child labor and forced labor, and impose rating penalties on those suppliers found to have committed violations in the comprehensive evaluations.\n\n1) High-risk supplier screening criteria: Companies with geopolitical risks in relation to labor and human rights or with significant impacts on our company (including companies surpassing a certain level in transaction amount and volume, companies recording low scores in the self-assessment, and companies affected by work environment issues raised by NGOs)\n\nCASE\n\nSpecial Audits to Eradicate Child Labor\n\nWe maintain zero tolerance for child labor for our suppliers and perform special audits of their recruitment practices every year to eliminate child labor. Based on our 2021 audits of 141 suppliers, none were found to have recruited child workers. However, some of the audited suppliers failed to implement recruitment practices, such as collecting written identity authentication pledges and including age limit information in their job opening notices. We took immediate action to have the respective suppliers remedy these issues.\nCASE\nSupport through the Child Protection Program\nIn August 2021, through the third-party audit of one of our first-tier suppliers located in East Asia was found to have partnered with a subcontractor that hired a child worker. Pursuant to our principle of zero tolerance for child labor, we immediately had the supplier sever all business connections with the subcontractor and implemented the child protection program based on Samsung Supplier Code of Conduct. Furthermore, we took action to immediately remove the child from the business site, met with the child\u2019s parents to pay all wages, and arranged to support the child to stay in school until reaching legal working age. The respective supplier was given the lowest rating for failure to properly manage its subcontractors and given a strict warning that its partnership with us would be terminated in the case of any recurrence of the use of child labor.\n\nRemedial Action for Overtime Work of Juvenile Workers\nWe prohibit juvenile workers from engaging in overtime work, night shifts, and hazardous work. Through on-site audits in January 2021, we identified a young worker engaging in overtime work at one of our first-tier suppliers in Central and South America. The findings from follow-up investigations showed that the supplier lacked sufficient understanding of local laws and the Supplier Code of Conduct. As a result, a mandatory pre-recruitment age verification process was adopted, and we performed recruitment-related training for the supplier\u2019s staff members in charge of personnel.\n\nSupplier Support for Local Legal Requirements and Amendments\nWe require our suppliers to comply with all local laws as well as the Supplier Code of Conduct. To ensure compliance, we closely monitor any changes made to such laws that may impact their operations. In July 2021, Mexico amended its outsourcing laws that companies can\u2019t hire outsourcers located in East Asia was found to have partnered with a subcontractor that hired a child worker. Pursuant to our principle of zero tolerance for child labor, we immediately had the supplier sever all business connections with the subcontractor and implemented the child protection program based on Samsung Supplier Code of Conduct. Furthermore, we took action to immediately remove the child from the business site, met with the child\u2019s parents to pay all wages, and arranged to support the child to stay in school until reaching legal working age. The respective supplier was given the lowest rating for failure to properly manage its subcontractors and given a strict warning that its partnership with us would be terminated in the case of any recurrence of the use of child labor.\n\nCompliance Improvement Activities\nWe help our suppliers identify their vulnerabilities and implement improvement activities. We provide training for our suppliers\u2019 executive management and working-level staff and operate a separate grievance resolution channel for those in our supply chains.\n\nCompliance and Human Rights Training\nSince 2015, we have hosted a range of workshops and training programs related to compliance management every year for the heads and working-level staff of our suppliers. We also provide human rights training on mutual respect, humane treatment, and discrimination elimination based on the Supplier Code of Conduct, as well as industrial safety training for the protection of pregnant and nursing employees. We also share global and local legal revisions, audit results and best practices of our suppliers, and environment and safety-related trends of different regions. We conduct training on the safe handling of chemicals and award suppliers with outstanding performance in labor/human rights and environment/safety. In 2021, 342 suppliers around the world received our training. We encourage participating suppliers to actively share the details of our training and provisions of the Supplier Code of Conduct with their subcontractors.\n\nFair Transaction Training\nTo eradicate unfair transactions and promote technology protection for subcontractors, we provide training for our suppliers on Korea\u2019s Fair Transactions in Subcontracting Act and Act on the Promotion of Mutually Beneficial Cooperation between Large Enterprises and SMEs. In 2021, training was provided for 1,007 employees of 598 first-tier and second-tier suppliers (four courses).\nMigrant Worker Recruitment Process Training\n\nWe prohibit forced labor and the collection of recruitment fees from our suppliers\u2019 migrant workers through the Supplier Code of Conduct. Based on this policy, a total of USD 389,921 was reimbursed to 1,199 migrant workers from nine countries recruited by our suppliers from 2017 to 2021. In 2021, we established the Responsible Recruitment Procedure training course to improve our suppliers\u2019 understanding of the procedure, help them eliminate relevant risks, and offer a self-diagnosis tool.\n\nWe also performed training on diverse subjects including recruitment criteria, risk recognition and assessment, improvement and risk prevention and mitigation targeting 143 labor and human rights managers at 75 suppliers in local languages such as English, Chinese, Thai, and Malaysian. We plan to expand the training program to improve the labor and human rights of migrant workers in more suppliers and countries that are hiring migrant workers from 2022.\n\nWe performed training on diverse subjects including recruitment criteria, risk recognition and assessment, improvement and risk prevention and mitigation targeting 143 labor and human rights managers at 75 suppliers in local languages such as English, Chinese, Thai, and Malaysian. We plan to expand the training program to improve the labor and human rights of migrant workers in more suppliers and countries that are hiring migrant workers from 2022.\n\nGrievance Handling\n\nWe support suppliers in establishing and operating an internal grievance resolution process to facilitate communication between the management and employees. As an extension of this effort, we have been operating a direct hotline for all suppliers since 2013 to receive reports on suppliers\u2019 work environment or workers\u2019 rights grievances via telephone, email, or mobile phone to complement on-site audits.\n\nWe strictly guarantee informants\u2019 confidentiality in all processes of grievances so that suppliers\u2019 employees can report without any fear for retaliation. Posters offering guidance on how to use the hotline are produced in different local languages and posted in offices, production sites, corridors, dormitories, and cafeterias.\n\nOur organizational unit dedicated to grievance management verifies the factual grounds of all reports within one week, notifies informants of the findings and steps to be taken, and monitors respective suppliers to ensure that they take remedial actions. In 2021, grievances related to the misconduct of superiors and wages accounted for the largest share of cases. We implemented measures to prevent recurrence, provided communication improvement training for the respective suppliers, and confirmed that all grievances were remedied.\n\nIn addition, in order to establish a more reliable grievance handling system, we are collecting opinions on the improvement of the hotline system from suppliers through interviews with workers during on-site audits, and compliance management workshops. As a result, we have been conducting a survey on the satisfaction of informants since 2020, and we have confirmed that all measures have been satisfactorily handled in an environment where informants\u2019 confidentiality is guaranteed. We will strive to ensure the continued improvement of the system in collaboration with our suppliers.\n\nCASE\n\nGrievance Resolution Cases\n\n1. A grievance regarding improper monitoring and disciplinary action committed by a superior was submitted from one of our suppliers in Central and South America. Based on the findings from subsequent investigations and interviews for fact-finding, the victim was relocated to a new position, and the superior was banned from physically approaching or taking retaliatory action against the victim. We conducted monitoring for three months to prevent the occurrence of any similar incidents.\n\n2. An employee at one of our suppliers in Southeast Asia submitted a grievance about the hygiene of bedding and food provided by the company. After investigating the dormitory and restaurant environment in cooperation with the supplier, the supplier immediately remedied the situation and conducts monthly employee surveys to make continued improvements.\n\n3. There was a case that an employee\u2019s wage was deducted at one of our suppliers in Europe to repair a cleaning tool kit that he damaged. We explained to the employee first that wage deduction is not a permitted form of disciplinary action based on the Supplier Code of Conduct, and verified it through an interview of the supplier\u2019s manager and other evidential documents. The deducted amount was immediately reimbursed to the employee on the date of submitting the grievance. The employee was satisfied with the results, and the case was closed.\nMutual Growth throughout the Supply Chain\n\nWe aim to achieve mutual growth and progress with our suppliers across all aspects of our supply chain based on our vision statement \u201cWe Buy Value, We Pay Trust.\u201d\n\nPartner Collaboration\nWe operate diverse partner collaboration programs for our suppliers in areas such as production cost, manufacturing and quality, technology innovation support, human resources training, and financial support as an extension of our efforts to reinforce the competitiveness of our supply chain and achieve mutual growth. In recognition of such efforts, we received the highest index rating for ten consecutive years for the first time in the industry on the Win-Win Index, which is a combination of the comprehensive mutual growth assessment and fair-trade agreement implementation assessment.\n\nInnovation Support\nProduction Cost Innovation To more effectively help our suppliers achieve innovation, we operate the Consulting Center staffed with specialists in manufacturing, quality assurance, development, and purchasing. We select about 20 suppliers each year and support their activities to maximize productivity by sharing our extensive pool of innovation cases and offering cost reduction ideas. In 2021, we supported 26 suppliers.\n\nManufacturing and Quality Innovation We help our suppliers improve challenging problems and vulnerabilities such as degrading productivity and defects and achieve factory optimization and production stability.\n\nTechnology Innovation We stage the \u2018Advanced Technology Trans Fair\u2019 to introduce technologies developed by domestic universities and public institutions and the \u2018Biz Technology Trans Fair\u2019 to promote innovations that can be commercialized. Since 2013, we have funded the \u2018Technology Development Based on Private-Public Joint Investment\u2019 led by the Korean Ministry of SMEs & Startups and provided approximately KRW 20 billion for 32 companies through 2021. In addition, we have shared our patents for use by both our suppliers and non-partner SMEs and ventures since 2015 as an extension of our efforts to reinforce their technological competitiveness and transferred roughly 1,800 patents (cumulative sum as of 2021) free of charge through our patent-related consulting program.\n\nHuman Resource Recruitment and Training\nRecruitment Support We operate the Youth Job Center dedicated to assisting our suppliers in finding the talents they need. This center succeeded in matching our suppliers with 1,033 employees in 2021 through locating jobseekers with profiles that specifically cater to their needs, staging Samsung supplier job fairs, and collaborating with online recruitment sites.\n\nTraining Support Our Partner Collaboration Academy offers over 500 free employee training courses for our suppliers lacking training infrastructure. The academy, spanning a total floor area of nearly 10,000m\u00b2, is designed to provide position-specific training for employees of different ranks, from newcomers to next-generation leaders and future executives, as well as job-specific training for different areas including finance, manufacturing, purchasing, and marketing. A total of 18,725 completed training at the academy in 2021.\n\nFund Support\nWin-Win Fund The Win-Win Fund is designed to help businesses maintain stability by providing low-interest loans of up to KRW 9 billion for facility investment and technological development. We first started this fund in 2010 with KRW 1 trillion for first and second-tier suppliers. In 2018, we expanded to third-tier suppliers with the addition of KRW 400 billion.\n\nPayment Support Fund The Payment Support Fund provides interest-free loans for our suppliers to help them make payments for goods supplied by their sub-suppliers in cash within 30 days. We started this fund with KRW 500 billion in 2017 under the aim of improving payment conditions between first-tier and second-tier suppliers. In 2018, the fund was expanded with an additional KRW 300 billion, bringing the total to KRW 800 billion, to benefit transactions between second and third-tier suppliers as well.\n\nIncentives for Resident Suppliers Since 2010, we have offered productivity and safety incentives for employees of outstanding suppliers based on the results of the annual evaluation of resident companies at our semiconductor business sites. We provided KRW 89.3 billion in 2021 alone, with the program providing a cumulative sum of KRW 514.7 billion.\n\nSemiconductor Technology and Business Consulting\nProduct Performance Evaluations We operate an R&D support system through which the technological performance and applicability of products developed by domestic materials, parts, and equipment companies are assessed and accredited by our mass production line. We conducted 119 performance evaluations from 2007 to 2021.\n\nPatterned Wafers Patterned wafers manufactured with our equipment are provided to domestic materials, parts, and equipment companies and research institutes to help enhance their technological prowess. Cumulative 7,190 wafers support (From 2015 to 2021)\n\nSemiconductor Business Consulting We provide manufacturing and product quality consulting for semiconductor equipment and parts suppliers. A total of six suppliers have benefited from this service to date. We also offer sector-specific business consulting through our business consulting panel consisting of our executive-level consultants. In 2021, 27 suppliers benefited from this service.\n\nPrecision Plumbing Academy\nWe have operated the Precision Plumbing Academy since 2018 to more systematically foster plumbing specialists. In addition to the existing courses for new plumber cultivation, floor plan and technical accreditation, and pipe removal training, in 2021 we provided support for the development and operation of eight contact-free online courses to respond to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, a total of 448 trainees, completed the Academy\u2019s curriculum, marking a 9% increase from the previous year.\n\nOccupational Health and Safety Management System\nWe strive to ensure that our suppliers have robust occupational health and safety management systems in place by encouraging them to attain certification for international standards such as ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 and reflect related outcomes in the comprehensive supplier evaluations. For our suppliers with semiconductor business sites, we provide our expert consulting service for attaining KOSHA 18001 certification (Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency standard). Total of 197 suppliers benefited from this service from 2013 through 2021.\nSustainable Supply Chain\n\nWe are well aware of the need to manage and support our supply chain in a responsible manner to ensure the development of eco-conscious products and eco-conscious manufacturing processes. We plan to further expand our efforts and cooperation with our suppliers to reduce their environmental impact, mitigate the use of harmful substances, and improve occupational health and safety.\n\nMitigation of the Environmental Impact of Our Suppliers\n\nMitigation of GHG Emissions\n\nAs an extension of our efforts to mitigate our suppliers\u2019 environmental impact, we joined the CDP Supply Chain program in 2019. We provide incentives such as additional points in the comprehensive supplier evaluations for those companies that submit information in compliance with CDP\u2019s criteria and successfully meet GHG emissions mitigation targets. We also organize regular seminars jointly with CDP to improve our suppliers\u2019 understanding of this issue. Powered by these efforts, the participation rate, which hovered at 60% in the initial year, rose to 71% in 2020, and reached 77% with the participation of 203 suppliers in 2021. The number of suppliers receiving high ratings in the CDP evaluation also continues to increase. In the future, we plan to expand our training offerings and strengthen programs to increase the use of renewable energy to engage more suppliers in the CDP Supply Chain program.\n\nHarmful Substance Control\n\nTo effectively control harmful substances in supplied products and parts, we operate the Eco-Partner Certification program for all of our suppliers. We issue certification based on the results of the review of their adherence to the Harmful Substance Operating Rules and harmful substance data. We also visit their manufacturing sites to accurately verify the information detailed in the submitted documents. Our suppliers undergo the Eco-Partner Certification review every two years to maintain their status, and those evaluated to have failed to meet our criteria are subject to transaction restrictions.\n\nSafe Use of Chemicals in Manufacturing\n\nWe have implemented a variety of programs to ensure the safe use of chemicals throughout the manufacturing process by our suppliers. We perform on-site audits to monitor whether suppliers meeting preset conditions, offer consulting on handling regulated substances and improving related control systems, and support the upgrading of local ventilation equipment, chemical storage facilities, and chemical leak prevention equipment. In 2021, as a result of our on-site audits and consulting for all of our suppliers that handle chemicals, four companies adopted safer chemicals, and 12 companies upgraded their local ventilation equipment.\n\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety Improvement\n\nConsulting and Training\n\nWe have established an organizational unit dedicated to supporting our suppliers\u2019 environment and safety management and operate a range of programs to foster EHS model suppliers, provide environment and safety consulting, and improve the work environment of suppliers that handle highly toxic chemicals. In 2021, we conducted our regular environment and safety audits of our 500 primary suppliers and implemented 2,548 improvement tasks including toxic exposure management, health and safety management for hazardous processes, and firefighting equipment and electric facility management, raising their environment and safety standards. The DS Division established the Environment and Safety Academy for the DS Division\u2019s suppliers in 2019. In 2021 alone, the academy provided specialized training for approximately 160,000 employees of our suppliers.\n\nCourses offered by the Environment and Safety Academy\n\n(For the DS Division\u2019s Suppliers)\n\n| Category                  | Number of Courses | Details                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Legally required training | 2                 | Entry into business sites permitted after completing legally required training on four essential safety rules for the industrial frontiers and harmful chemicals |\n| Accreditation training    | 21                | Specialists for suppliers fostered by expanding the environment/safety accreditation courses in relation to dealing with hazardous and inflammable substances |\n\n* The safety and health management and safety leadership courses were suspended in 2021 due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBuilding a Culture of Proactive Safety Management\n\nWe strive to build a safety-centered corporate culture by taking preemptive accident prevention measures. In this context, we conduct risk prediction training for our suppliers and hold an annual risk prediction contest for the DS Division\u2019s suppliers. In 2021, 49,134 employees within our supply chain completed the training. We also adopted measures to facilitate risk-related grievance reporting by frontline workers and help them ensure safety at work. We held policy presentations and training for all of the employees of our suppliers to educate them on their right to safety and related processes. Follow-up monitoring was performed on all 3,864 requests for the protection of the right to suspend work submitted in 2021.\n\nCASE\n\nVoC Improvement in the DS Division\n\nIn order to improve the work environment of resident suppliers, the DS Division operates a range of communication channels, including the new website opened in April 2021 and offline meetings with on-site managers, to identify their complaints and difficulties and jointly seek solutions.\n\nMajor Improvements\n\n1. We took measures to prevent accidents by renovating on-site facilities and removing elements of risk (including leveling damaged parts of the line floor and installing banisters, lifts for heavy articles, and awnings at entries for carrying in goods).\n2. We enhanced the work environment for resident suppliers by upgrading their noise-proofing and air-conditioning systems, replacing outdated equipment and fixtures, and installing extra lounges.\n3. We included the coverage of additional expenses for enhanced environment and safety management of our suppliers in our contracts. We also realigned our supervision criteria with work procedures and improved work efficiency by streamlining documentation.\n\nNumber of improvements made in different VoC areas\n\n(By the DS Division, in 2021)\n\n| Category                  | Number of cases |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| Work environment          | 217             |\n| Internal issues           | 203             |\n| Operation management      | 128             |\n| Environment and safety    | 118             |\n| Reports, complaints, inquiries, etc. | 24             |\nTransparent Management of Responsible Minerals\n\nWe strive to minimize any possible negative social effects of mineral mining, including human rights abuses, child labor exploitation, sexual violence, and environmental destruction. We take human rights and environmental issues related to mineral mining in conflict-affected and high-risk areas, such as Africa, very seriously. To address these risks, we make sure to use only responsible minerals in strict compliance with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.\n\nResponsible Minerals Management System\n\nWe focus on raising awareness of responsible minerals issues, conducting investigations on the status of responsible minerals use, and identifying and remedying risk factors in relation to all mass-produced materials suppliers based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. We block the inflow of materials sourced in a manner not in compliance with our responsible minerals policy from the initial point of purchase. Additionally, we regularly disclose our responsible minerals management activities via our website and Sustainability Report and publish the Samsung Electronics Responsible Minerals Management System to more effectively accommodate to the diversifying needs of global stakeholders. All of our suppliers are obligated to fully comply with our responsible minerals policy. We only accept minerals supplied by smelters and refiners accredited with RMAP certification. As a result, we are able to screen out conflict minerals mined and sourced in an illegal manner from conflict-affected areas, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and only handle minerals supplied by internationally accredited smelters and refiners.\n\nIn addition to conflict minerals, we also monitor high-risk minerals that raise concerns over environmental damage and human rights abuses to ensure more rigorous management of our supply chain. We continually update the list of controversial minerals to readily respond to related issues together with our global counterparts. We will remain committed to sourcing minerals mined in a socially responsible manner with respect for human rights and the wellbeing of the planet and ensure that our supply chains are free from controversial minerals sustaining armed violence, human rights abuses, and environmental degradation.\n\nExternal Cooperation\n\nTo minimize any adverse social and environmental impacts of our supply chain, and ensure we source minerals in a responsible manner, we have established a responsible minerals management system and standardized smelter accreditation by joining a number of campaigns, such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM). We also undertook the Cobalt for Development project in collaboration with Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), Samsung SDI, BMW Group, and BASF, to contribute to resolving human rights abuses to ensure more rigorous management of our supply chain. We continually update the list of controversial minerals to readily respond to related issues together with our global counterparts. We will remain committed to sourcing minerals mined in a socially responsible manner with respect for human rights and the wellbeing of the planet and ensure that our supply chains are free from controversial minerals sustaining armed violence, human rights abuses, and environmental degradation.\n\nThis project was initiated to seek solutions for improving the work environments of small cobalt mines and the living conditions of local mining communities. In 2020, Volkswagen joined the project as a new partner. As of December 2021, the project has supported 14 artisanal mining cooperatives through safety training and protective gears. The project also conducted agricultural and financial training for local residents and supported the foundation of 72 microbusinesses.\n\nFor more information on responsible minerals, refer to Samsung Electronics\u2019 Responsible Minerals Report.\n\n| RMAP certified smelters (Conflict Minerals) | 2021 | 100% |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| 2017                                      | 255/100% |\n| 2018                                      | 258/100% |\n| 2019                                      | 261/100% |\n| 2020                                      | 240/100% |\n| 2021                                      | 240/100% |\n\n*Number of cobalt refiners: 35 (as of 2021)\n\n| Cases of On-site Inspections | 2021 | 493 |\n|------------------------------|------|-----|\n| 2017                         | 252  |\n| 2018                         | 244  |\n| 2019                         | 225  |\n| 2020                         | 427  |\n| 2021                         | 493  |\nSUSTAINABILITY FOUNDATION\n\nMateriality Assessment  85\nAlignment with UN SDGs  86\nSustainability Value Creation  88\nMateriality Assessment\n\nWe conduct materiality assessment annually to identify key interests of stakeholders and significant issues related to the business. We disclose those issues through our sustainability report for transparent communication with the stakeholders.\n\nThe Sustainability Report 2022 presents the notable findings from the double materiality assessment. Double materiality is a concept identified in the EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Various sustainability-related global standards, including GRI, have reinforced their reporting requirements based on this concept.\n\nFor the double materiality assessment, we first pool all of the major materiality issues, analyze the findings related to social and environmental materiality and financial materiality, and prioritize the issues accordingly.\n\nSocial and environmental impact refers to the degree of a company\u2019s business activities on society and the environment, and it is assessed by analyzing media reports in Korea and abroad as well as our scores on various global ESG standards. Financial impact refers to a company\u2019s ESG risks and opportunities, and possible degree of positive and negative impacts on its sustainability risks and opportunities and the degree of positive and negative impact that can have on the value of a company. It is assessed by identifying shareholders\u2019 and investors\u2019 concerns, analyzing costs and profits, and considering the opinions of investment and assessment institutions.\n\nSocial and environmental impact\n\n- Climate action and energy management\n- Human rights management\n- Sustainable supply chain\n- Talent development and work-life balance\n- Circular economy\n- Corporate governance\n- Compliance and Ethics\n- Occupational safety and health\n\nFinancial impact\n\n- Compliance and ethics\n- Corporate governance\n- Climate action and energy management, circular economy, water resource management, and waste management\n- Community development and corporate citizenship and stakeholder engagement\n- Privacy protection and data security and freedom of speech\n- Human rights management, diversity and inclusion, talent development and work-life balance of employees, and occupational safety and health\n- Responsible sourcing and partner companies\u2019 labor practices\n\nMaterial issues\n\n- Compliance and ethics\n- Corporate governance\n- Climate action and energy management, circular economy, water resource management, and waste management\n- Community development and corporate citizenship and stakeholder engagement\n- Privacy protection and data security and freedom of speech\n- Human rights management, diversity and inclusion, talent development and work-life balance of employees, and occupational safety and health\n- Responsible sourcing and partner companies\u2019 labor practices\n\nMajor activities\n\n- Placed the Compliance Team directly under the CEO to reinforce its independence\n- Operated the Samsung Compliance Committee, an independent external monitoring organization\n- Ensured the independence and diversity of the Board of Directors\n- Expanded the use of renewable energy\n- Developed high energy-efficiency products\n- Assessed and reduced water resource risks\n- Introduced eco-conscious packaging for more products, designed products with higher reparability, and strived for zero waste to landfill\n- Operated youth training programs to help foster creative problem-solving skills and capabilities in relation to future technologies\n- Provided support for SMEs to build smart factories\n- Enhanced privacy protection measures and operated the Samsung Privacy Site\n- Updated our security development process and mobile security\n- Reinforced internal policies and employee training on labor and human rights\n- Expanded our vision, policies, and programs concerning diversity\n- Provided consulting for our partner companies on work environment monitoring and improvement and supported their EHS improvement activities\n\nSections for reference\n\n- Our Company (Compliance and Ethics)\n- Our Company (Corporate Governance)\n- Environment\n- Empowering Communities\n- Digital Responsibility\n- Our Employee\n- Sustainable Supply Chain\n\nDouble Materiality Matrix\n\n- Climate action and energy management\n- Human rights management\n- Sustainable supply chain\n- Talent development and work-life balance\n- Circular economy\n- Corporate governance\n- Compliance and Ethics\n- Occupational safety and health\n\n- Waste management\n- Community development and corporate citizenship\n- Water resource management\n- Diversity and inclusion\n- Privacy protection / data security and freedom of speech\n- Product safety and quality\n- Responsible marketing and customer relations management\n\n- Harmful substance management\n- Accessibility\n- Stakeholder engagement\n- Transparent information disclosure\n- Responsible technology use\n- Air pollution control\n- Responsible Procurement\nAlignment with UN SDGs\n\nAdopted at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to mobilize the international community\u2019s efforts to establish a sustainable world by engaging in community outreach, environmental preservation, and inclusive economic growth activities. The program began in earnest in 2016 and with the aim of achieving the goals by 2030. As a responsible corporate citizen, we have strived to help advance the achievement of the SDGs through our business operations.

To convert our sustainable value creation activities to monetary value, we reviewed and selected measurement indices. Our sustainability value is composed of 1) financial, 2) socio-economic and 3) environmental values and each are expressed in positive (+) or negative (-) numerical values.\n\nValue Assessment Methods\n\n| Categories                  | Types       | Assessment Methods\u00b9 |\n|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Financial value             | Benefits    | Net income created over the past year |\n| Socio-economic value        | Benefits    | Dividends and interest paid to shareholders, investors, and creditors |\n| Investor value              | Benefits    | Funding for the Win-Win Fund |\n| Supplier support            | Benefits    | Donations to resolve local community issues |\n| Local Community Development | Benefits    | ROI (118%) of investments in training projects\u00b9\u00b9 |\n| Environmental value         | Costs       | Social costs of GHG emissions\u00b9\u00b2 |\n| GHG emissions from business sites | Costs       | Social costs of air pollutants (NOx, SOx, and PM) emission\u00b9\u00b3 |\n| Impact on the air environment | Costs       | Social costs of water use based on the level of water scarcity of regions where our business sites are located\u00b9\u2074 |\n| Impact on the water environment | Costs       | Social costs of waste landfill, incineration, and recycling\u00b9\u2075 |\n\n\u00b9) The exchange rate is KRW 1,186 per USD and KRW 1,342 per euro as of December 31, 2021.\n\u00b2) G.

Among them, the financial value stands at KRW 39.91 trillion, a 34% increase from 2020 due to the rise in net income. We continually pursue the creation of socioeconomic and environmental values through diverse activities. We promote the development of local communities by providing training for future generations and support for SMEs and startups. We fully converted our business sites in the US, Europe, and China to 100% renewable energy use, while steadily expanding renewable energy use in Brazil, Mexico, etc. As a result, our socioeconomic and environmental values in 2021 are calculated to reach KRW 9.22 trillion.\n\nOur Sustainability Management Values in 2021 (Unit: KRW trillion)\n\n| Financial value | Socio-economic value | Environmental value |\n|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Investor value  | Supplier support     | Local community development |\n| 10.24           | 0.97                 | 0.44                |\n| -1.76           | -0.003               | -0.67               |\n| 3991            |                      |                     |\n| 49.13           |                      |                     |\n\n\u00b9) Sustainability Value was calculated based on the figures in the Free Cash Flow Statements. 2021 Special dividends (KRW10.7 trillion) are not included in the investor values, since they were reflected in our Sustainability Values for 2020.\n\nAs an extension of our efforts to more accurately assess the values created by our sustainability activities, we have monitored the latest developments in research on social and environmental value assessment around the world. In this context, we plan to include wages and taxes in the assessment from 2023 onwards considering the significance of these two items and global trends.\n\n\u2192 Including wages and taxes, we estimate our sustainability values for 2021 at approximately KRW 98 trillion.\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\n| Category                        | Page |\n|---------------------------------|------|\n| Economic

It is the responsibility of the management to prepare the Report, and it is our responsibility to perform a limited assurance engagement and issue a statement based on the information collected.\n\nResponsibilities of the Company and Ernst & Young Han Young\n\nThe Company is responsible for collecting and presenting the data within the Report. This responsibility involves structuring, implementing, and maintaining the relevant corporate system so that there is no critical misstatement due to fraud or error. Our responsibility, in line with the contract, is to perform a \u2018limited level\u2019 of assurance regarding the selected quantitative and qualitative performance stated in the Report. We shall hold no responsibility whatsoever to any other purpose, individual or organization in respect to the result of the limited assurance performed. The decision made by the third party based on the Report is the sole responsibility of the third party.\n\nScope and context\n\nThe limited assurance was performed based on the following information.\n\nGRI index: p101~p103\nFacts&Figures: p90~p97\n\nDescription of procedures performed\n\nWe conducted the assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE3000 developed by IAASB.\n\nThe following procedures were performed to reach our conclusion on the Report:\n- Identified the Company\u2019s processes for stakeholder engagement\n- Identified the Company\u2019s processes for determining material issues of key stakeholders\n- Examined media coverage of the Company\u2019s environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues during the reporting period\n- Analyzed recently reported ESG issues of the Company\u2019s global competitors\n- Conducted interviews with respective personnel regarding the Company\u2019s ESG activities and reporting Process during the reporting period\n- Inspected data regarding the Company\u2019s ESG performance, supporting evidence for assertions, and intranet source data\n- Identified the Company\u2019s process for collecting and consolidating ESG performance data\n- Reviewed whether the financial performance data has been appropriately extracted from the Company\u2019s audited financial statements.\n\nLevel of assurance\n\nWe conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000. Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than in a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nConclusion on limited assurance\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the standard adopted by the Company.\n\nIndependence\n\nWe comply with the Code of Ethics issued by the International Federation of Accountants.\n\nOur engagement team\n\nThis engagement was performed by an assurance team of extensive experience and expertise in the ESG sector.\n\n17 June, 2022\nErnst & Young Han Young\nVerification Statement on 2021 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Greenhouse Gas Emission\n\nIntroduction\nKorean Foundation for Quality (hereinafter \u2018KFQ\u2019) has been engaged by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (hereinafter the \u2018Company\u2019) to independently verify its 2021 Greenhouse Gas Emission Report of domestic corporations and 24 overseas subsidiaries. It is the responsibility of the Company to compile the Greenhouse Gas Emission Report according to the \u2018Guidelines for GHG emission reporting and certification of GHG emission trading scheme (Notification No. 2021-278 of Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy)\u2019, GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance\u2019 and \u2018ISO 14064-1:2006\u2019 and KFQ has responsibility to conduct verification based on \u2018ISO 14064-3:2006\u2019 to provide verification opinion on compliance of the Report against verification criteria.\n\nVerification Scope\nIn this verification, domestic corporations and 24 overseas subsidiaries under operational control of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and reported emission is including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission.\n\nVerification Procedure\nThe Verification has been planned and conducted by the \u201cGreenhouse Gas and Energy Target Management Scheme\u201d, and to reach reasonable level of assurance.\n\nLimitations of verification\nAccuracy and completeness of emission data reported in the \u2018GHG Inventory\u2019 are subject to inherent limitations due to their nature and the methodology used in determining, calculating and estimating such data.\n\nConclusion/Opinion\nThrough the verification process according to the \u2018ISO 14064-3:2006\u2019 KFQ could obtain reasonable basis to express following conclusion on the Greenhouse Gas Emission Report\n\n1) 2021 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Greenhouse Gas Emission Report was prepared against \u2018Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guideline\u2019 developed based on the \u2018Guidelines for GHG emission reporting and certification of GHG emission trading scheme\u2019, GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance\u2019 and \u2018ISO 14064-1:2006\u2019\n\n2) As a result of materiality assessment on 2021 domestic Greenhouse Gas Emission, material discrepancy is less than the criteria of 2.0% for the organization which emits more than 5,000,000 tCO2-eq/year in accordance with the requirements of the \u2018Guidelines of verification for Greenhouse gas emission trading scheme\u2019.\n\n3) For the 24 overseas subsidiaries, document review was conducted for entire 24 subsidiaries as well as Company self-assessment. The result of material discrepancy is less than 2.0%.\n\n4) As reported Greenhouse Gas Emission purchased electricity, process emission by fluorinated gas use and LNG consumption take more than 99% of total emission. Activity data of these emission sources were checked through the objective evidence provided by supplier therefore KFQ could confirm that these activity data is valid itself.\n\n5) The efficiency of process emission reduction technology that affects the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions has to reflect the values guaranteed by the government and third parties. However, the efficiency was calculated based on the Company\u2019s own methodology, and errors are not included in the verification opinion. For the overseas subsidiaries, each national net calorific value and electricity emission factor were preferentially used but net calorific value and electricity emission factor were adopted from IPCC Guidelines or Korean Energy Law Enforcement Regulation in any change of these parameters or factors. Also, in case of buying credits (ex. RECs) in the market, the offset credit is applied to evaluate the emission and record separately in market base section.\n\n6) Except unconsidered emission source in the \u2018Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guideline\u2019, material error, omission or insignificant issues was not found in 2021 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Greenhouse Gas Emission Report.\n\n2021 Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to share our track record of climate action with our stakeholders.\n\n| TCFD Recommendation | Related Contents | Page/ Reference |\n|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Governance          | a) Describe the board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. | Regulatory and supervisory developments related to climate change and the continued emergence of physical climate impacts directly affect our business operations and financial performance. Thus these climate change issues and our responses to address them are reported to the Board of Directors, our overarching decision-making body responsible for the oversight of our climate action and resource circulation management. | P.23 CDP : CC1.1a, CC1.1b |\n|                     | b) Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. | The CEO is given the responsibility and authority to finalize company-wide measures, such as establishing climate change response strategies, developing relevant tasks, and implementing investments. The performance of our executive management is also assessed based on KPIs that include climate change-related metrics to ensure the substantive fulfillment of given roles. The CEO leads the Sustainability Council comprising the executives in charge of the major business areas and the consultative body consisting of the executives responsible for environment to establish and review the implementation status of relevant plans. The Environmental Management Task Force develops and oversees environmental management tasks including climate change responses. The EHS Council under each business unit monitors relevant issues at individual business sites and explores ways to resolve them. The Eco-Council advances strategies to develop eco-conscious products and reviews outcomes. | P.23 CDP : CC1.2a |\n| Strategy            | a) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term. | Risks and opportunities incurred by climate change affect not only products and services but also manufacturing processes, supply chains, R&D, and other business activities. We regularly monitor the risks facing our business sites around the world in accordance with procedures and manuals established for different areas of environment and safety, climate change and energy, and compliance. To identify the financial impacts of these risks, we categorize them into conversion risks and physical risks and analyze opportunity factors as well. In the short term, we view emissions permit price increases, extreme weather events, and the requirement to introduce high-efficiency technologies as potential risks and emissions permit purchasing and reduced energy costs as opportunities. We project changing consumption patterns and expanded renewable energy use as medium-term opportunities and the physical impacts of climate change (warming temperatures, etc.) as long-term risks. We establish response measures for long-term risks based on the country-specific emissions mitigation plans pursuant to the Paris Agreement, emissions scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and Energy Technology Perspectives of the International Energy Agency (IEA). For more details, refer to the section entitled \u201cRisks and Opportunity Analysis\u201d on page 26 herein. | P.23, P.25 CDP : CC2.2c, CC2.5a, CC2.4a, CC3.1c |\n|                     | b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. | As climate change continues to have adverse effects around the world, many countries are strengthening their relevant regulations. The costs related to natural disaster recovery and lost business opportunities are expected to rise in line with the aggravation of climate change. We continue to make investments in the areas of environment and safety and disaster-proof equipment to preempt the impacts of natural disasters as much as possible, which in turn will decrease our insurance premiums. As a company subject to Korea's emissions trading scheme, we project that our costs for responding to reinforced GHG emissions regulations and renewable energy purchasing will inevitably increase. In addition, failure to comply with global regulations and implement proper climate actions may compromise our brand value and adversely affect our sales. | P.26 CDP : CC2.5, CC2.6 |\n|                     | c) Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario. | Climate change-related risks are anticipated to have far-reaching effects through a set of highly complex channels. We strive to identify the socioeconomic impacts of climate change on our business through various scenarios, which are classified into aggressive action scenarios that require our global stakeholders to reach more ambitious targets and passive action scenarios that focus on maintaining the status quo. In accordance with the aggressive action scenarios, products with low energy efficiency ratings are projected to decrease in sales in the long term, while eco-conscious, high-efficiency products are expected to record continued sales growth. To remain prepared for such scenarios, we plan to make continued investments to develop ultra-low-power semiconductors and improve the energy efficiency of the representative models of the six main product categories. We will also take active measures to ensure GHG emissions mitigation and full conversion to renewable energy, while also promoting the energy efficiency enhancement of all of our products. | P.26-31 CDP : CC3.1c, CC3.1d |\n## TCFD Index\n\n| TCFD Recommendation | Related Contents | Page/ Reference |\n|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Risk Management**  | a) Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. | Our climate change-related risks concerning business operations, product planning, and industry trends are assessed regularly by related organizational units based on the environmental management frameworks of ISO 14001 and ISO 50001. Individual business sites are required to enter their GHG data (electricity, fuel, manufacturing process gases, etc.) into the EHS System, and we review their changes on a monthly basis and analyze the causes of such changes. Respective organizational units control GHG emissions in an integrated manner accordingly, and annual third-party audits are conducted to ensure the credibility and alignment of emissions data. | P.25 CDP : CC1.2a, CC2.2b |\n|                      | b) Describe the organization's processes for managing climate-related risks. | To more effectively manage climate change-related risks, the company-wide organizational unit in charge of EHS monitors our energy consumption, GHG emissions, and renewable energy use as well as the physical impacts of climate change. Relevant issues already faced by or expected to affect our business sites around the world are discussed at the EHS Council of each business unit and other regularly convened consultative bodies to seek optimal solutions. The Sustainability Council discusses relevant risks and opportunities from a company-wide perspective and makes necessary decisions. The Eco-Council examines climate change-induced business opportunities and shares the findings with pertinent business units for execution. | P.23 CDP : CC2.2d |\n|                      | c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization's overall risk management. | Semiconductor manufacturing requires a massive amount of power, and thus emissions permits and renewable energy prices are closely monitored and managed as factors that directly affect our business competitiveness. As the climate change-related regulations of individual countries influence our business activities and reputation, compliance with them is also managed within our company-wide risk management system. | P.25-26 CDP : CC2.2 |\n| **Metrics and Targets** | a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. | To more accurately assess and manage the risks and opportunities related to climate change, we monitor diverse metrics including the GHG emissions, per-unit GHG emissions, energy consumption, renewable energy use, and water consumption of individual business sites as well as the share of recycled materials in products, amount of e-waste collected, and average power consumption of individual products. | P.27-31, P94-95 CDP : CC11.3 |\n|                      | b) Disclose Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions), and Scope 3 (miscellaneous indirect scope) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks. | We disclose our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions via the Sustainability Report and CDP Report. Our direct emissions (Scope 1) in 2021 stand at 76 million tonnes and our indirect emissions (Scope 2) reflecting renewable energy use at 9.8 million tonnes. For total GHG emissions and emissions of individual GHGs over the last three years, refer to page 94 herein. | P.31, P94 CDP : C6, C7 |\n|                      | c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. | To curtail our GHG emissions, we have continued to expand our use of renewable energy. In June 2018, we announced the plan to power our business sites in the US, Europe, and China with 100% renewable energy by 2020. We also released the plan to install solar and geothermal power generation facilities in the parking lots, rooftops, and new buildings of the Suwon, Hwaseong, and Pyeongtaek sites for the promotion of renewable energy use in Korea. We installed renewable energy facilities of 1.9MW in 2018 and 1.5MW in 2019 at the Suwon and Giheung sites, respectively. From 2018 to 2020, we established and implemented action plans optimized for individual regions, from solar power generator installation to REC purchasing, PPA adoption, and Green Pricing. As a result, our renewable energy use in 2020 increased nearly three-fold compared to 2018, and all the preset targets were reached. In 2021, our renewable energy use increased by 30% from 4,030GWh in 2020 to 5,278GWh. To reduce manufacturing process gases and thereby achieve emissions mitigation by over 90%, we are striving to develop new catalysts to enhance gas disposal efficiency and expand gas disposal facilities.
