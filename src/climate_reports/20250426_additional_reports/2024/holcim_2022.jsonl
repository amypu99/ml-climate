WHAT HAVE BEEN YOUR HIGHLIGHTS FOR 2022?\n\n2022 was a year of significant achievements. We continued to make progress on our strategy, which places sustainability at the core of our business with ambitious targets in all of our pillars.\n\nIn Climate & Energy, we released our industry\u2019s first Climate Report last year, receiving 90% support from our shareholders at the AGM in May 2022. The report is a big step forward in transparency and disclosure of our climate-related risks and opportunities, in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and ahead of upcoming regulations on climate-related disclosures. The report also provides details on how we will reach our 2030 and 2050 net-zero targets.\n\nOur approach to sustainability is transparent, rigorous and science based. With this in mind, we submitted our upgraded 2030 climate targets, which are aligned with the new 1.5\u00b0C framework for the cement industry and received validation in November from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These include upgraded targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions per ton of cementitious material by 25% by 2030, as well as other indirect emissions on Scope 3, taking into account the recent optimization of the company\u2019s portfolio in both baselines and targets. This is a true milestone for the company and industry. We have continued to evolve our industry-leading Scope 3 methodology and reporting with greater transparency and automation than ever before. We have gone beyond the categories recommended by the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) and have extended our greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory to all Scope 3 categories. Reduction targets for the most material categories in our value chain have been validated by the SBTi.\nOur focus on decarbonization was solid in 2022. We reduced Scope 1 emissions to 562 kg CO\u2082 net per ton of cementitious materials, which represented a decrease of 2% on a like-for-like basis versus the prior year. This improvement was the result of our efforts in the use of industrial mineral components, which helped to lower Holcim\u2019s clinker factor, and the increased use of alternative fuels in our cement kilns, which increased our thermal substitution rate. We will continue to accelerate efforts on decarbonization using the traditional levers of alternative raw materials, clinker factor and alternative fuels as well as implementation of our exciting, next-generation technology projects.\n\nWe are pushing decarbonization across all of our business, including plants and corporate offices. In 2022, we launched the Office Goes Green initiative, our global program to make corporate offices more sustainable and raise internal awareness of everyday environmental habits. Through this initiative, we have been able to prevent more than 1 million plastic bottles per year from entering the environment. Countries competed in a challenge to develop the most impactful projects with initiatives to reduce plastic waste, increase recycling, switch to electric company cars and reduce carbon emissions from electricity use by switching electricity sources and power purchase agreements, and building onsite renewables. The level of engagement, impact of the initiatives, and imagination and creativity of the entries was exciting to see, and we look forward to going further in 2023.\n\nOn the Nature front, we met our 2022 biodiversity targets to have 100% of active quarries make rehabilitation plans and 100% of those with biodiversity importance put a Biodiversity Management Plan in place. We have now assessed over 48% of our quarries using our Biodiversity Indicator Reporting System (BIRS) methodology, a 33% increase compared to last year, and are on track to meet our 2024 target to have 100% of quarries measured using BIRS. We also made progress in lowering our total freshwater withdrawal. Our cement-specific freshwater withdrawal fell by 3.5% and aggregates-specific freshwater withdrawal fell by 2.1% on a like-for-like basis.\n\nAt COP 15 in Montreal, dedicated to biodiversity, it was great to see major progress on Target 15 to encourage large companies and financial institutions to conduct regular assessments and transparently disclose their risks and impacts on nature. We are fully supportive of this approach and as a member of Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) we have been working on the development of the framework for business to assess the risk and opportunities related to nature; we are currently piloting the beta framework.\n\nOur sustainability efforts earned the holy grail of a double \u201cA\u201d rating from Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) for both Climate and Water. We were honored to be part of the prestigious A list in Climate for the third year in a row and joined CDP\u2019s A List for Water for the first time. This ranked us as one of only 15 companies in Europe and the first in our sector to achieve a double \u201cA\u201d CDP score, a truly outstanding performance by all those involved. We also received CDP recognition as a \u201cSupplier Engagement Leader\u201d for the second year in a row.\n\nOn the business transformation side, we made huge steps divesting cement assets in India and Brazil while adding strong brands in the solutions and products segment with the acquisitions of Malarkey, PRB and SES Foam. The divested businesses are significant and, in accordance with reporting standards, we excluded them from our 2022 sustainability results and restated our baselines and targets based on our current footprint. The divestment and decarbonization efforts reduce Holcim\u2019s overall carbon emissions per CHF of revenue by 21% since 2021. It is always sad for teams to leave the Holcim family and to lose their great work in decarbonization, reversing nature loss and creating positive social impact. We are very excited to work with the new businesses to advance our sustainability journeys together.\n\nWe launched our Circular Economy Policy this year, and set new targets for recycling construction and demolition waste (CDW), with a company-wide campaign launched to increase its usage. Our performance in circular economy made outstanding progress in 2022, increasing recycling volumes by over 8% on a like-for-like basis to 34 million tons. This was despite an overall decline in production volumes in both our aggregates and cement businesses. We are also very proud to have produced the world\u2019s first 100% recycled clinker that meets European standards. We produced 12,000 tons at three plants in two countries, proving this achievement is scalable.\n\n2022 was a year of acceleration of our sustainable procurement processes. We made significant progress to increase qualification of high-ESG-risk suppliers from 73% to 95%, just missing our target of 100% by 2022. In addition, our supplier due diligence process was implemented in 100% of our countries. These achievements mark the beginning of a new phase. Moving forward we will maintain our commitment to supplier due diligence as a minimum control standard and will keep improving the due diligence process.\n\nIn Social, Holcim proudly became a founding member of the Roof Over Our Heads campaign.\nThe campaign, led by Sheela Patel of Slum Dwellers International, was launched in 2022 at COP27. It has the incredible ambition to put roofs over 1 billion people by 2030 through better design, construction and access to finance.\n\nHolcim and Habitat for Humanity have also entered a partnership to accelerate access to affordable housing driven by an innovative digital platform. Together we are deploying an online affordable housing portal to enable low-income families to access finance as well as building materials and solutions in a safe and seamless way. The first project was rolled out in Mexico and is enabling the affordable renovation of 600 homes in the Baj\u00edo and Veracruz regions. In 2022, Holcim invested more than CHF 22.5 million in social initiatives and contributed to building and renovating more than 8,000 buildings. Holcim also trained over 12,000 people, 20% of our workforce, on human rights topics and has conducted a human rights impact assessment in 98% of our reporting units in the last three years.\n\nQ. WHAT INNOVATIONS ARE YOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT?\n\nWe are pushing the boundaries of innovation to shape the future of building and make it work for people and the planet. The experts at Holcim\u2019s Innovation Center are driving cutting-edge research in multiple areas, from CO\u2082 reduction to ultra-high-strength concrete and 3D-printing technologies. More than 450 products were launched in 2022 alone. Holcim\u2019s 14Trees won the Financial Times/International Finance Corporation Transformational Business Award for its work in 3D printing homes and schools in Africa using advanced materials and technologies. The world\u2019s first 3D-printed school in Malawi and the 3D-printed, 52-unit Mvule Gardens housing complex demonstrate how rapidly 3D printing can accelerate construction.\n\nThe EU Innovation Fund awarded Holcim EUR 328 million in two grants for breakthrough carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) projects in Germany and Poland, fully supporting our CCUS evolution. Both projects feature scalable technologies and will put Holcim at the forefront of Europe\u2019s decarbonization.\n\nHuge thanks to the countries, functions and teams that are fully committed to have sustainability at the core of our business and build progress for people and the planet. Without them, our 2022 achievements would not have been possible. We will continue to drive initiatives to accelerate our performance in sustainability in 2023. I look forward to going further from pledge to action and seeing the great results in 2023.\n\n#ThisIsJustTheBeginning\n\nMAGALI ANDERSON\nChief Sustainability & Innovation Officer\nCLIMATE & ENERGY\nIn 2022, net CO\u2082 emissions directly under our control (Scope 1) decreased by almost 2% to 562 kilograms of CO\u2082 per ton. Our efforts in the use of clean electrical energy helped decrease indirect emissions (Scope 2) to 37 kg net CO\u2082/ton. Scope 3 emissions intensity showed good progress and reductions in the categories of fuels. Absolute CO\u2082 emissions across our value chain and operations decreased by 4% on a like-for-like basis. These emissions reductions show continued progress toward our net-zero ambition.\n\n562 KG NET CO\u2082 emissions per ton of cementitious material (Scope 1)\n\nCIRCULAR ECONOMY\nOur Circular Economy results in 2022 were outstanding, growing 8% to 34 million tons of materials recycled across our business. This was all despite a decline in production volumes in both cement and aggregates. Our recycled content in cement increased to 20%, on the way to our goal of 30% by 2030. We are also laying great foundations for the use of construction and demolition waste (CDW) with 6.8 million tons used in 2022, making progress toward reusing 10 million tons of CDW annually by 2025.\n\n34 MILLION TONS of waste-derived resources\n\nNATURE\nIn biodiversity we achieved our 2022 targets, with 100% of active quarries having rehabilitation plans and 100% of those with biodiversity importance having a Biodiversity Management Plan in place. We made great progress setting BIRS baselines across our sites, with 80 additional sites assessed and greater acceleration expected in the coming years. In 2022, we made great progress toward strategic targets for water, reducing freshwater withdrawal in cement to 304 liters/ton compared to 315 litres/ton in 2021 (2022 consolidation), while maintaining stable performance in aggregates and ready mix.\n\n304 LITERS OF FRESHWATER withdrawn per ton of cementitious material\n\nPEOPLE\nWe are committed to respect human rights and to empower people and communities to build a better future. In 2022, we committed to expand our human rights impact assessments from country to site level, and now 98% of cement and grinding sites have an assessment in place \u2013 great progress from 89% in the previous year. Additionally we contributed almost CHF 22.5 million in housing and infrastructure, health, education and skills, creating a positive social impact. Our employees spent over 30,000 hours volunteering in their local communities.\n\n22.5 MILLION (CHF) contribution in social initiatives\nPERFORMANCE DATA TABLES\n### PERFORMANCE AGAINST TARGETS\n\n**Unit key**\n- Mt \u2013 million tons\n- MGO \u2013 million gigajoules\n- M \u2013 million joules\n- M/t \u2013 million joules per ton\n- Mm\u00b3 \u2013 million cubic meters\n- CHF \u2013 Swiss Francs\n- NR \u2013 Not reported\n- % \u2013 percentage\n\n| Metric | Base year | Baseline | Target | Target year | Current performance | Achieved to date |\n|--------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| Specific CO\u2082 emissions \u2013 net (Scope 1) \u2013 cement only | kg/CO\u2082/t | 2018 | 590* | -22.40% | 2030 | 562 | -4.8% |\n| Specific CO\u2082 emissions \u2013 gross (Scope 1) \u2013 cement only | kg/CO\u2082/t | 2018 | 623* | -22.40% | 2030 | 602 | -3.4% |\n| Specific CO\u2082 emissions \u2013 electricity (Scope 2) \u2013 cement only | kg/CO\u2082/t | 2018 | 46* | -65.00% | 2030 | 37 | -20.5% |\n| CO\u2082 indirect emissions from purchased fuels (Scope 3) | kg/CO\u2082/t purchased fuels | 2020 | 286* | -20.00% | 2030 | 285 | -0.2% |\n| CO\u2082 indirect emissions from purchased clinker and cement (Scope 3) | kg/CO\u2082/t CLC | 2020 | 710* | -25.10% | 2030 | 709 | -0.1% |\n| Cement-specific freshwater withdrawal | L/t | 2018 | 377* | -33.00% | 2030 | 304 | -19.4% |\n| Aggregates-specific freshwater withdrawal | L/t | 2018 | 225* | -20.00% | 2030 | 218 | -3.3% |\n| Ready mix (RMX)-specific freshwater withdrawal | L/m\u00b3 | 2018 | 212* | -15.00% | 2030 | 202 | -4.8% |\n| Waste-derived resources \u2013 all segments | Mt | 2018 | n/a | TBC | 2030 | 34.0 |\n| Construction and demolition waste (CDW) used | Mt | 2020 | 6.6 | 12 | 2030 | 6.8 | 0.2 |\n| Circularity ratio \u2013 cement (waste used/production volumes) | % | 2020 | 22* | 30 | 2030 | 20.1 | -1.9 |\n| Recycling ratio \u2013 all segments (waste used/sales volumes) | % | 2020 | 8.5* | 17 | 2030 | 6.8 | -1.7 |\n| High-ESG-impact suppliers qualified (% spend) | % | 2017 | n/a | 100% | 2022 | 95% |\n| Specific dust emissions | g/t | 2018 | 121 | 75 | 2030 | 71.1 | -50 |\n| Specific NOx emissions | g/t | 2016 | 1,513 | 1,100 | 2030 | 1,176.7 | -336 |\n| Specific SO\u2082 emissions | g/t | 2016 | 357 | 230 | 2030 | 231.8 | -125 |\n| Total contribution to create positive social impact | CHFm | 2021 | n/a | 350 | 2030 | 66.0 | 19% |\n\n* Baselines have all been restated based on the current consolidation scope.\n\n### PERFORMANCE DATA TABLES\n\n#### Products and solutions\n\n| Product | Unit | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|---------|------|------|------|------|\n| Total raw material consumption \u2013 all segments | Mt | 480 | 533 | 432 |\n| Clinker produced | Mt | 127 | 140 | 94 |\n| Clinker consumed | Mt | 127 | 134 | 90 |\n| Cement fillers consumed (limestone, gypsum, mineral components (MIC), etc.) | Mt | 49 | 54 | 31 |\n| Cement produced | Mt | 176 | 188 | 121 |\n| Mineral components (slag, fly ash, etc.) produced | Mt | 3 | 3 | 3 |\n| Cementitious material produced\u00b9 | Mt | 180 | 197 | 128 |\n| Aggregates produced | Mt | 243 | 257 | 252 |\n| Asphalt produced | Mt | 11 | 10 | 10 |\n| RMX produced | Mm\u00b3 | 40 | 46 | 45 |\n| Clinker factor (average % of clinker in cements)\u00b2 | % | 70.6 | 70.1 | 73.0 |\n| Production clinker factor | % | 75.9 | 75.5 | 74.8 |\n| Net sales of sustainable solutions\u00b2 | % | 26 | 30 | 32 |\n\n#### Producing assets included in evaluation\n\n| Asset | Unit | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| Cement-producing sites including grinding and blending | # | 269 | 266 | 147 |\n| Aggregates sites | # | 462 | 447 | 474 |\n| Asphalt sites | # | 86 | 85 | 86 |\n| RMX sites | # | 1,162 | 1,198 | 1,165 |\n| Quarries operated | # | 629 | 701 | 647 |\n\n\u00b9 Cementitious material is defined following the GCCA definition: Total clinker produced plus mineral components consumed for blending and production of cement substitutes, including clinker sold but excluding clinker bought.\n\n\u00b2 Cements is defined as total cements produced, excluding clinker sold, including clinker bought.

The list of principal consolidated companies is presented in the Holcim Integrated Annual Report 2022.\n\nChanges in scope of consolidation\nIn the 2022 Sustainability Performance Report, the most significant changes in consolidation are the divestments of India, Brazil and Russia. Key performance indicators (KPIs) have been shown \u201cas published in the reporting year\u201d and \u201c2022 consolidation scope\u201d in separate lines. Unless stated otherwise, all prior-year figures for other indicators are \u201cas published in the reporting year.\u201d\n\nDivestments and acquisitions\nFor business(es) divested during the year, data are excluded for the entire year. For business(es) acquired during the year, data is included for the entire year.\n\nWhen a new site is acquired by Holcim, its policies and procedures for non-financial reporting may not necessarily be in line with Holcim standards. Accordingly, new sites have up to the second reporting year after acquisition to meet, and report performance according to, Holcim standards.\n\nBaselines for key indicators have been restated based on the 2022 consolidation scope applying GHG Protocols and GCCA Sustainability Framework guidelines.\n\nMETHODS OF DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING METHODOLOGIES\nExtrapolation\nSince 2019, Holcim reporting is based on eleven months of data (as at 30 November), which are extrapolated to the annual estimated values. The objective is to accelerate the reporting process to align with the financial reporting timeline.\n\n\u2022 For environmental data, the full year production, taken from SAP, is used to extrapolate energy consumption, CO\u2082 emissions, air emissions, water indicators including consumption and discharge, raw materials and waste-derived resources. No other indicators, such as environmental certifications and hectares rehabilitated, are extrapolated, as they are not necessarily linear.\n\n\u2022 For Employees, only hours of training per employee have been extrapolated.\n\n\u2022 For Sustainable solutions, data are collected for the full year.\n\n\u2022 For Health and safety, data are reported for the full year.\n\n\u2022 For People: Human rights, data are reported for the full year.\n\nControls\nControls put in place to ensure data quality and robustness include:\n\n\u2022 The Axiom digital reporting and analytics platform, as well as internally developed proprietary spreadsheet-based import templates used in 2022, included built-in validation rules to ensure robustness of data reported. This includes highlighting when a value is outside an expected range or shows a significant deviation from previously reported data, requiring an explanatory comment.\n\n\u2022 A robust workflow process is in place requiring a validation of the data and explanations by two managers for each questionnaire.\nMETHODOLOGY AND CONSOLIDATION 2022\n\n- Validation dashboards have been developed to allow entities and subject matter experts to identify values that are out of range.\n- Data (such as production, spend on social initiatives and number of employees) are checked against other reporting streams such as SAP and technical reports, as well as for consistency.\n\nEconomic indicators\n\n- In 2022, data on net sales of sustainable solutions were collected through SAP\u2019s financial reporting process, complemented with a country-specific survey for sales associated with affordable housing and water, not yet transitioned to SAP.\n- Data on supplier assessments was collected through proprietary spreadsheet-based import questionnaire templates and respective protocols: the Holcim Sustainable Procurement questionnaire. Data are gathered at Country/Group Reporting Unit level and cover all business segments and their industrial production sites.\n- The Sustainable Procurement questionnaire was conducted covering 49 entities representing more than 98% of our total procurement spend.\n\nEnvironmental indicators\n\nEnvironmental performance indicators follow the reporting guidelines of the GCCA (previously the World Business Council for Sustainable Development \u2013 Cement Sustainability Initiative (WBCSD CSI)).\n\nIn 2022, environmental data were collected through the Axiom digital reporting and analytics tool as well as proprietary spreadsheet-based import templates. Reporting guidelines for environmental reporting were issued to ensure proper reporting, highlighting new and updated environmental indicators as well as changes in reporting scope as needed.\n\nAll sites that were active during the reporting year have been considered eligible to be included under the environmental reporting. For sites that were active less than six months, their impact has been estimated based on their production and Group averages.\n\nFor environmental data, cement terminals are not considered material, and therefore can be excluded from the consolidation.\n\n- **Scope 1, Scope 2 and energy:** We use the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of CO\u2082 emissions from cement manufacturing (previously WBCSD CSI Guidelines for Emissions Monitoring and Reporting in the Cement Industry Protocol (2012)). Emission levels can be measured continuously or based on spot measurement. Information is always available at kiln level. If an emission component has not been measured in 2022 due to travel or other restrictions, the 2021 measurement has been used to estimate the performance at kiln level. If no measurement was available in 2021, the 2022 Group average has been used to estimate the Group\u2019s absolute impact.\n\n- **Percentage of production with measurement:** The full production from a kiln is included in this coverage only when the emission of the respective pollutant(s) is monitored, otherwise the production contribution from the kiln is considered zero. For the percentage of production with comprehensive emission monitoring, the full production from a kiln is included only when emissions of all pollutants (dust, NOx, SO\u2082, VOC/THC, heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Ti, Sb, As, Pb, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni and V), PCDD/F) are monitored.\n\n- **Scope 3 emissions:** In 2020 we developed a more comprehensive and rigorous approach to measuring the CO\u2082 emissions from our supply chain. The methodology is aligned with GHG and GCCA protocols. In 2021 we further improved accuracy by automating data capture \u2013 for example, through our Transport Analytic Centre (TAC) digital solution, which captures CO\u2082 emissions from downstream transportation. The TAC covers our operations in 55 countries, monitoring around 90,000 trucks and 1.6 billion kilometers traveled across all our business segments. For indirect emissions of electricity purchased, we are currently accounting for the upstream emissions of generation companies (WTT) and transmission and distribution losses (TDL), based on emissions factors from DEFRA (for WTT) and IEA (for TDL). In 2022, we began reporting data in eight additional categories (Categories 2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15). We are now reporting Scope 3 emissions from 14 out of 15 GHG categories (Category 11 is not applicable).\n\n- **Emissions:** We use the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of emissions from cement manufacturing (previously WBCSD CSI Guidelines for Emissions Monitoring and Reporting in the Cement Industry Protocol (2012)). Emission levels can be measured continuously or based on spot measurement. Information is always available at kiln level. If an emission component has not been measured in 2022 due to travel or other restrictions, the 2021 measurement has been used to estimate the performance at kiln level. If no measurement was available in 2021, the 2022 Group average has been used to estimate the Group\u2019s absolute impact.\n\n- **Scope 1, Scope 2 and energy:** We use the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of CO\u2082 emissions from cement manufacturing (previously WBCSD CSI Cement CO\u2082 and Energy Protocol version 3.1) to calculate CO\u2082 emissions between the 1990 baseline and the reporting year. To calculate Scope 2 emissions we align with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Extensive work on ascertaining the most accurate available emissions factors is continually being conducted. Emissions from captive power plants are included in the performance data table under \u201cOther segments: CO\u2082 emissions from fuels.\u201d The reporting coverage of the CO\u2082 data is 100%. Default CO\u2082 emissions factors for fuels are taken from the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines. Operations can overwrite these default values if more precise values or measurements are available.\nMETHODOLOGY AND CONSOLIDATION 2022\n\n- **Water**: The GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of water in cement manufacturing (previously the CSI Protocol for Water Reporting) has been used as a reference to measure the water performance of the Group. Data from captive power plants are reported separately. The coverage of water data is 98% on average.\n\n- **Waste and recycling**: Waste comprises all forms of solid or liquid waste (excluding wastewater) and is defined as hazardous or non-hazardous based on the legislation of the country in which the site operates. Overburden has been excluded from non-hazardous waste disposed of onsite.\n\n- **Waste-derived resources**: Data reported for waste-derived resources include alternative raw materials, industrial mineral components (consumed and/or processed and sold externally), alternative fuels, volume of returned concrete recycled, secondary and/or recycled aggregates and recycled asphalt.\n\n- **Biodiversity and quarries**: Quarries that have been assessed using Biodiversity Indicator Reporting System (BIRS) and those with rehabilitation plans in place are aligned with the Holcim Directive on Quarry Rehabilitation and Biodiversity. The key requirements go far beyond legal compliance and include measures respecting the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, restore and offset) and a biodiversity management plan for sites assessed as of high biodiversity value.\n\n**Health and safety (H&S)**\n\nH&S performance indicators follow the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of safety in cement and concrete manufacturing, issued February 2020.\n\nH&S data is gathered at site level and further consolidated at Country/Group Reporting Unit level, and covers all business segments and their industrial production sites, including corporate and above country, regional and service entities.\n\nIn 2022, H&S data were collected through Holcim\u2019s reporting system: iCare | HSE Incident management module.\n\nData are segregated according to onsite and offsite incidents, and cover employees, contractors and third parties. The hours worked that are used to calculate incident rates for employees and contractors are calculated and/or estimated locally by business units.\n\n**Social indicators**\n\nIn 2022, social data were collected through Holcim\u2019s reporting system and respective protocol: the annual social questionnaire.\n\nData is gathered at Country/Group Reporting Unit level and covers all business segments and their industrial production sites, including corporate and above country, regional and service entities.\n\nThe 2022 social data are derived from a survey covering 58 entities representing 99% of the total Group workforce, and include majority-owned entities and managed assets.\n\nAmong other aspects, the social survey collects data on employees, headcounts and labor relations, and includes questions to verify that child labor is not used.\n\n**Human Rights and Stakeholder engagement indicators**\n\nIn 2022, stakeholder data were collected through Holcim\u2019s reporting system and respective protocol: the annual human rights and stakeholder questionnaire. Information about spending on social initiatives and number of beneficiaries was collected through SAP FC, at Country/Group Reporting Unit level, and covers all business segments and their industrial production sites.\n\nThe 2022 human rights and stakeholder data are derived from a survey covering 60 entities representing 93% of the total Group workforce and include majority-owned entities and managed assets. We collect information on, among other aspects, the entities\u2019 implementation of the human rights approach, human rights assessment and action plans, stakeholder engagement activities and community engagement structures, specific impact indicators of social initiatives, volunteering activities, political donations and subsidies.\n\nIn 2021, Holcim announced its 2030 People strategy to continue creating shared value and uplifting the well-being of communities worldwide. The strategy focuses on three pillars: bridging the world\u2019s housing and infrastructure gap, improving livelihoods and upholding the highest standards of human rights. To support the implementation of the strategy, we changed our main KPI from beneficiaries to monetary contribution to social initiatives.\n\nThe total contribution to create positive social impact is a cumulative KPI from 2021 to 2030. In 2022, it is calculated by including the total spend on the social initiatives made by Holcim to implement projects and donations. It also includes third-party contributions, which are the resources received through external partnerships to implement social initiatives led by Holcim in the countries.\nHolcim differentiates four categories for the Social Initiatives, which are:\n\n- **Housing and Infrastructure**: Initiatives that facilitate access to housing and infrastructure for the community, such as affordable housing solutions, building or improving community facilities (hospitals, schools, parks, etc.), rural roads, etc.\n- **Health**: Covid-19 support provided for communities, health awareness campaigns, vaccination programs, general healthcare services.\n- **Education and Skills**: Road safety, lectures in partnership with schools and universities, livelihood and income-generation programs, professional training targeting the community.\n- **Other**: Environmental management and awareness, cultural, recreational or other initiatives to contribute to positive social impact.\n\nA direct beneficiary is defined as a person who was directly involved in the project or benefited from its implementation. Whenever possible, we count the exact number of beneficiaries (number of community members trained). When precise measurement is not possible (e.g., beneficiaries of a new hospital or bridge built by Holcim), estimates are made based on scientific methods such as social research, expert interviews or the like. Furthermore, if estimates need to be made, a standard and conservative assumption is used, with a maximum of 30% of the potential beneficiaries being considered. The type and extent of benefit varies significantly depending on the project.\n\nUnder Stakeholder Engagement and Human Rights, data such as number of community advisory panels, number of engagements with key stakeholders at site level, and complaints related to human rights, environmental impact and other potential topics are recorded. Furthermore, any conflicts with stakeholders that sites may have or expect in the future, and how such conflicts are addressed, are captured. Also, countries report on the latest version of their human rights assessments and the status of implementation of their human rights action plans.\n\n**Reporting cycle**\nThe Holcim Group will continue to report annually.\nASSURANCE STATEMENT\n\nIndependent assurance report on a selection of non-financial information\n\nTo the Executive Committee,\n\nFurther to your request and in our quality as an independent verifier, member of the network of one of the statutory auditors of the entity Holcim (hereafter \u201cEntity\u201d), we present our report on a selection of non-financial information consisting in selected consolidated environmental, communities, and health & safety indicators (hereafter \u201cSustainability Indicators\u201d) and other non-financial reporting processes (\u201cNon-Financial Reporting Processes\u201d), that the Entity has chosen to prepare in accordance with its protocols (hereafter the \u201cGuidelines\u201d), for the year ended on 31 December 2022, presented in its Sustainability Performance Report (hereafter \u201cReport\u201d) and listed in Appendix 1.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed as described under the \u201cNature and scope of procedures\u201d and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Indicators taken as a whole are not fairly presented, in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects. In addition, we have no comment on the fact that the Non-Financial Reporting Processes were implemented as described in the \u201cMethodology and consolidation\u201d section of the Report and in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\nResponsibility of the independent verifier\n\nIt is our role, in response to the Entity\u2019s request, based on our work, to:\n\n- attest that the Non-Financial Reporting Processes were implemented as described in the \u201cMethodology and consolidation\u201d section of the Report and in accordance with the Guidelines\n- express a limited assurance conclusion that the Sustainability Indicators have been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the Guidelines, consisting in external standards elaborated by the Global Cement and Concrete Association (previously the World Business Council for Sustainable Development \u2013 Cement Sustainability Initiative (WBCSD CSI)) completed with Entity-specific procedures, a summary of which is provided in the \u201cMethodology and consolidation\u201d section of the Report.\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Sustainability Indicators and the Non-Financial Reporting Processes as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in their preparation as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to report on the entire Report for the year ended on the 31 December 2022 or on the compliance with other applicable legal provisions.\n\nThe Entity\u2019s responsibility\n\nAs part of this voluntary approach, it is the responsibility of the Entity to prepare the Sustainability Indicators and to implement the Non-Financial Reporting Processes in accordance with the Guidelines, of which a summary is included in the Report.\n\nIndependence and quality control\n\nOur independence is defined by the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) of our profession. In addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, ethical requirements and professional guidance by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) relating to this engagement.\nASSURANCE STATEMENT\n\nMeans and resources\nOur work engaged the skills of 8 people between November 2022 and February 2023 and took place over a total duration of intervention of about 18 weeks.\n\nWe conducted a dozen interviews with people responsible for preparing the Sustainability Indicators and the Non-Financial Reporting Processes, representing in particular the Human Resources, the Health and Safety, the Procurement and the Sustainable Development directions.\n\nNature and scope of procedures\nWe conducted the work described below in accordance with the international standard ISAE 3000(1) (International Standard on Assurance Engagements).\n\n1. Review of the non-financial reporting processes\nWe undertook interviews with the people responsible for the collection and preparation of the information at the headquarters level and at the country level for a selection of entities, in order to:\n\n- assess the suitability of the questionnaires and definitions used in the surveys, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability\n- verify the implementation of the process for the collection and compilation of the information.\n\n2. Limited assurance on a selection of Sustainability Indicators\nWe undertook interviews with people responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Indicators in the Sustainable Development and Health & Safety Departments, those in charge of the data collection process and, when applicable, the people responsible for internal control processes and risk management, in order to:\n\n- assess the suitability of the Guidelines for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability, taking into consideration, if relevant, the best practices of the industry\n- verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the Sustainability Indicators and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the Sustainability Indicators\n- verify the alignment of the methodology used by the Entity to calculate the restatements of some Sustainability Indicators (identified with * in Appendix 1 for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021, identified with ** in Appendix 1 for the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, identified with *** in Appendix 1 for the year 2018 and identified with **** in Appendix 1 for the years 2020 and 2021) to take into account the structural changes of the Entity (divestments and acquisitions) in accordance with the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTI) guidelines.\n\nWe determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the Sustainability Indicators, in relation to the characteristics of the Entity, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry best practices:\n\n- at the Entity level, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions, etc.), implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, on a test basis, the calculations and the compilation of the information, and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other information presented in the Sustainability Performance Report. We also verified, on a test basis, the calculations of the restatements of some Sustainability Indicators (identified with * in Appendix 1 for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021, identified with ** in Appendix 1 for the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, identified with *** in Appendix 1 for the year 2018 and identified with **** in Appendix 1 for the years 2020 and 2021) to take into account the structural changes of the Entity (divestments and acquisitions)\n- at the level of the representative selection of sites and entities that we selected,2 based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. The sample selected therefore represented on average 17% of the hours worked used for the calculation of safety indicators, and between 9% and 28% of the environmental information.3\n\n---\n\n1 ISAE 3000: \u201cAssurance Engagements other than audits or reviews of historical information\u201d, International Federation of Accountants.\n2 Five cement plants: Apaxco (Mexico), Fujairah (UAE), Exshaw (West Canada), L\u00e4gerdorf (Germany) and Dotttenhausen (South Germany), and five Group Reporting Units (GRU): Mexico, UAE, West Canada, Germany and South Germany.\n3 On average, 18% of production (cement (16%), aggregates (13%), RMX (18%)), 14% of cement net CO2 emissions (Scope 1), 15% of absolute gross Scope 1 emissions, 14% of absolute Scope 2 emissions, 16% of waste-derived resources, 15% of air emissions, 14% of cement energy consumption, 14% of other segments energy consumption, 28% of quarries operated and 9% of cement freshwater withdrawal.\nASSURANCE STATEMENT\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance review engagement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement opinion in accordance with the professional guidelines of the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\nAPPENDIX 1: SELECTION OF NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nThe Sustainability Indicators\n\nProducts and solutions\n- Total raw material consumption \u2013 all segments\n- Clinker produced\n- Cement produced\n- Cementitious materials produced\n- Aggregates produced\n- RMX produced\n- Clinker factor (average % of clinker in cements)\n\nRecycling and waste\n- Waste-derived resources \u2013 all segments*\n- Internal hazardous waste recycled or recovered\n- Internal non-hazardous waste recycled or recovered\n- Internal hazardous waste disposed\n- Internal non-hazardous waste disposed\n- Construction and demolition waste (CDW) recycled\n\nCO2 and energy\n- CEM-specific CO2 emissions \u2013 net (Scope 1)**\n- CEM-specific CO2 emissions \u2013 gross (Scope 1)***\n- CEM CO2 emissions \u2013 net (Scope 1)\n- CEM CO2 emissions \u2013 gross (Scope 1)\n- Absolute Scope 1 emissions \u2013 gross\n- Absolute Scope 2 emissions\n- Absolute Scope 3 emissions\n- Absolute Scope 3 emissions per category of emissions (as defined by the GHG Protocol)\n  - Category 1 \u2013 Purchased goods and services\n  - Category 2 \u2013 Capital goods\n  - Category 3 \u2013 Fuel- and energy-related activities\n  - Category 4 \u2013 Upstream transportation and distribution\n  - Category 5 \u2013 Waste generated in operations\n  - Category 6 \u2013 Business travel\n  - Category 7 \u2013 Employee commuting\n  - Category 8 \u2013 Upstream leased assets\n  - Category 9 \u2013 Downstream transportation and distribution\n  - Category 10 \u2013 Processing of sold products\n  - Category 11 \u2013 Use of sold products\n  - Category 12 \u2013 End-of-life treatment of sold products\n  - Category 13 \u2013 Downstream leased assets\n  - Category 14 \u2013 Franchises\n  - Category 15 \u2013 Investments\n\nCO2 and energy continued\n- CO2 indirect emissions from purchased fuels (Scope 3)****\n- CO2 indirect emissions from purchased clinker and cement (Scope 3)****\n- CO2 indirect emissions from downstream transportation (Scope 3)****\n- CEM energy consumption total\n- Other segments thermal energy\n- Other segments electrical energy\n\nWater\n- Cement-specific freshwater withdrawal**\n- Aggregates-specific freshwater withdrawal\n- Ready mix-specific freshwater withdrawal\n- Total water withdrawal\n\nEnvironmental management systems (EMS) and compliance\n- Cement sites with an ISO 14001 certification\n\nBiodiversity\n- Quarries assessed using BIRS methodology \u2013 active only\n- Active quarries with rehabilitation plans in place\n- Active quarries with biodiversity importance\n- Active quarries with biodiversity importance having ongoing Biodiversity Management Plans in place\n\nAir emissions\n- Clinker produced with continuous monitoring of dust, NOx and SO2 emissions\n- Clinker produced with monitoring of dust, NOx and SO2 emissions\n- Total dust, NOx, SO2, VOC, mercury, dioxin/furan emissions\n- Specific dust, NOx, SO2, VOC, mercury, dioxin/furan emissions\n\nPeople: Social initiatives\n- Total contribution to create positive social impact\n\nHealth and safety\n- Fatalities (employees and contractors)\n- Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (employees and contractors) onsite\n- Total Injury Frequency Rate (employees and contractors) onsite\n\nThe Non-Financial Reporting Processes\n\nReporting processes covering\n- Human Resources-related information, including Group employees per employment contract and age interval, gender diversity, turnover, development and social dialogue\n- Human Rights- and Stakeholder-related information, including number of beneficiaries and human rights assessments\nHolcim Ltd has reported in accordance with GRI Standards for the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022.\n\nWith the disclosures in the Annual Integrated Report 2022, Sustainability Performance Report 2022 and related documents on our website, Holcim has reported in accordance with GRI 2021 Standards for the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022.

SASB Standards identify the subset of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues most relevant to financial performance in 77 industries. The SASB Standards focus on financially material issues because their mission is to help businesses around the world report on the sustainability topics that matter most to their investors.\n\nAlthough there is much ESG and sustainability information disclosed publicly, often it can be difficult to identify and assess which information is most useful for making finance-related decisions. SASB identifies financially material issues, which are the issues that are reasonably likely to impact the financial condition or operating performance of a company and therefore are most important to investors.\n\nThe material issues identified by SASB for the Construction Materials sector are:\n\n- GHG emissions\n- Air quality\n- Energy management\n- Water and wastewater management\n- Waste and hazardous materials management\n- Ecological impacts\n- Employee health and safety\n- Product design and life cycle management\n- Competitive behavior\n\n**AIR:** Annual Integrated Report 2022\n\n**SPR:** Sustainability Performance Report 2022\n### SASB INDEX\n\n| SASB reference | Description | Page, comment, performance |\n|----------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Greenhouse gas emissions** | | |\n| EM-CM-110a.1 | Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations | We report this in our annual disclosure to the CDP. We post our annual disclosures on our website, on the \"Our ESG Commitments\" page. In our 2022 submission (reflecting 2021 data) we list all carbon pricing regulations which impact our operations and the percentage of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions covered by the regulations. See sections C11.a and C11.b starting on page 47. |\n| EM-CM-110a.2 | Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets | SPR: pages 6; 8; 9 Climate Action Climate Report |\n| **Air quality** | | |\n| EM-CM-120a.1 | Air emissions of the following pollutants: \u2022 NOx (excluding NO2) \u2022 SOx \u2022 Particulate matter (Dust-PM10) \u2022 Dioxins/furans \u2022 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) \u2022 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \u2022 Heavy metals | We report annually on all emissions with the exception of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in our Sustainability Performance Report. We report not only absolute emissions of these substances but also specific emissions by both clinker and cementitious material. The only PAH we consider material and measure is benzene, and this is measured as required by the Global Cement and Concrete Association. Our measurements of benzene emissions in 2022 were: Total benzene emissions (tons): 293 Specific benzene emissions: \u2022 Grams/ton clinker: 3.2 |\n| **Energy management** | | |\n| EM-CM-130a.1 | Total energy consumed | SPR: pages 9\u201310 Cement total energy consumption: 407 million GJ Other segments thermal energy: 20 million GJ Other segments electrical energy: 4 million GJ Total energy consumed: 431 million GJ |\n| EM-CM-130a.1 | Percentage grid electricity | 86% of 2022 electricity consumption in the cement segment was from the grid. |\n| EM-CM-130a.1 | Percentage alternative energy | SPR: pages 9\u201310 \u2022 Thermal energy % of alternative fuels (excluding biomass) 18% \u2022 Thermal energy % biomass 10% \u2022 Total thermal substitution rate 28% |\n| EM-CM-130a.1 | Percentage renewable | SPR: page 10 Measured for cement sector: In 2022, we consumed 356 million GJ of thermal energy for clinker production. Of this, 34 million GJ (10%) was biomass fuels. We consumed 51 million GJ of electrical energy, of which 14 million GJ (27%) was renewable. Total energy consumed was 407 million GJ, and total renewable energy consumed was 48 million GJ (12%). |\n| **Water and wastewater management** | | |\n| EM-CM-140a.1 | Total fresh water withdrawn | SPR page 10 We report water withdrawn from a number of sources for all segments and for captive power plants separately. |\n| EM-CM-140a.1 | Percentage recycled | SPR page 10 We do not currently measure the volume of water recycled \u2013 we measure the number of sites equipped with a water recycling system. |\n| EM-CM-140a.1 | Percentage in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress | SPR page 10 AIR page 44 We measure and report on the number of sites located in Medium-High to Extremely High water risk areas according to the WRI Aqueduct tool. The concept of water risk includes not only water stress but also water quality, regulatory and reputational risks. In 2022, 24% of our sites (cement, aggregates and ready mix) were located in such areas. |\n### SASB INDEX\n\n| SASB reference | Description | Page, comment, performance |\n|----------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Waste management** | | |\n| EM-CM-150a.1 | \u2022 Waste generated  \n\u2022 % hazardous waste  \n\u2022 % recycled | SPR: page 9  \nIn 2022, we generated a total of 1.99 million tons of waste.
