In 2022, we initiated a major transformation of our organization to further improve our innovation capabilities and align with our growth strategy as a pure-play medicines company.\n\nWe expect these changes to simplify our business, enhance accountabilities and strengthen our commercial activities by enabling us to better focus on our in-market products and high-value pipeline assets. Overall, our efforts are set to support our long-term sales and profit growth and help us create sustainable shareholder value.\n\nAs part of this transformation, which includes our intention to spin off our Sandoz generics and biosimilars Division, we merged our Oncology and Pharmaceuticals commercial organizations and created a new Operations organization that combines our manufacturing and services activities. Besides substantial cost savings, we expect these steps to increase our operational agility and strengthen our business in key markets such as the United States and China.\n\nThe organizational changes, which we expect to finalize in 2023, complete the portfolio shift we started in 2014. Over this time, we have divested several non-core businesses and spun off our eye-care division Alcon. With a view to boosting our innovation power, we have also made substantial investments in cutting-edge technology platforms, including gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy and RNA technology.\n\nNovartis delivered on its sales and operating profit targets in 2022 despite the challenges of a volatile macroeconomic environment and while executing on our ongoing transformation, which entailed job reductions due to structural changes. This performance was supported by cost discipline and continued operational streamlining, as well as the strong uptake of recently launched medicines, such as multiple sclerosis treatment Kesimpta, and continued strong demand for our cardiovascular medicine Entresto and psoriasis treatment Cosentyx.\n\nLast year also saw new leadership at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research and our Global Drug Development organization, which entailed job reductions due to structural changes. This performance was supported by cost discipline and continued operational streamlining, as well as the strong uptake of recently launched medicines, such as multiple sclerosis treatment Kesimpta, and continued strong demand for our cardiovascular medicine Entresto and psoriasis treatment Cosentyx.\n\nThe Board of Directors also remained vigilant in its governance oversight efforts by putting added emphasis on values such as integrity as Novartis pivots towards becoming a high-performance, pure-play medicines company. Likewise, the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors are keeping up the intensive dialogue with stakeholder groups and working towards achieving our vision to be the most valued and trusted medicines companies in the world.\n\nI thank you for the confidence you have placed in our company and am pleased to be able to propose a dividend increase of 3.2% to CHF 3.20 at the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoerg Reinhardt\nChair of the Board of Directors\n2022 was a year of transformation for Novartis. After more than USD 100 billion in acquisitions and divestures over the last several years, our structural transformation from a diversified healthcare conglomerate into a focused, innovative medicines company will be largely complete after the planned spin-off of Sandoz in 2023.\n\nWe also begin 2023 with a simplified organizational structure that will spur innovation and give us a stronger foundation for growth in a rapidly changing global business environment.\n\nWhile Novartis has pursued bold portfolio change, core elements of our company remain the same. Our vision is to become the most trusted and valued medicines company in the world \u2013 valued not only for our business performance, but also for the difference our innovation makes for patients and society.\n\nThe world is counting on us to succeed. Fewer than 10% of diseases known to affect humans are currently treatable, and globally, people live an average of 10 years with a disease or disability. Yet new treatments broadly still reach only a fraction of eligible patients, and manageable conditions like heart disease cause millions of avoidable deaths each year.\n\nOur performance in 2022 showed that we are making progress in addressing society\u2019s greatest disease burdens. Our focus on cardiovascular disease, for example, gives countries and healthcare systems solutions to address the world\u2019s leading cause of death and disability. Entresto, our medicine for heart failure and hypertension, is estimated to be treating around 10 million patients worldwide, while our cholesterol-lowering siRNA treatment Leqvio is now approved in 70 countries.\n\nWe saw robust growth momentum across our in-market medicines. This includes stronger-than-expected uptake in the US for Pluvicto, our novel radioligand therapy for advanced prostate cancer, highlighting our ability to turn the promise of next-generation medicines into a reality for patients.\n\nDespite challenging macroeconomic conditions and an unstable geopolitical environment, we delivered a solid financial performance that underscores the progress we are making, with 4% growth in net sales in constant currencies (cc) and 8% growth (cc) in core operating income compared with the previous year. Looking ahead, we aim to generate sales growth of 4% CAGR over the next five years, and grow above peer median beyond 2027.\n\nOur investments in R&D are key to achieving these ambitions. In 2022, we saw a positive Phase III readout for iptacopan, which was discovered at NIBR, in a rare and deadly blood disorder. We saw an important positive Phase III result for Pluvicto in earlier lines of prostate cancer. And we also reported positive Phase III results for Cosentyx in hidradenitis suppurativa, offering the potential to expand one of our most successful medicines and bring a new treatment option to patients with this painful skin disease.\n\nAs we continue innovating for patients, millions around the world are still without proper access to healthcare. Translating the latest science into lasting progress requires us to work with healthcare systems and other stakeholders to advance access for underserved patients in low- and middle-income countries, while also tackling access barriers in some of the wealthiest countries in the world.\n\nIn the US, for example, we expanded our 10-year Beacon of Hope initiative, which seeks to address racial disparities in healthcare, including by increasing diversity among clinical trial participants and investigators. We also pledged to invest USD 250 million in R&D for the treatment of malaria and neglected tropical diseases, building on our decades-long commitment to global health priorities. We continue to make progress in other aspects of our ESG agenda, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations by nearly half since 2016.\n\nAs we look to the future as a focused medicines company, our dedication to innovation and excellence will drive us forward. We have set clear growth ambitions and we are confident we will meet them. Through reshaping Novartis, we are set to reimagine medicine for decades to come.\n\nSincerely,\n\nVas Narasimhan\nChief Executive Officer\nWho we are\n\nIn this section\n\n- Our company \u2192 p. 8\n- Our medicines \u2192 p. 9\n- Our global operations \u2192 p. 10\n- Our people, culture and values \u2192 p. 11\nOur company\n\nNovartis is one of the world\u2019s leading medicines companies.

At the same time, aging populations are putting pressure on healthcare resources and access to healthcare remains a challenge around the world. Here are 10 major trends currently shaping our business environment.\n\nSpending on healthcare continues to grow\n\nThe need for high-quality healthcare is more critical than ever. Globally, people live for an average of 10 years with a disease or disability, and around 17 billion disability-adjusted life years are lost annually to ill-health and early death. Over the next five years, global spending on medicines is forecast to rise faster than GDP in many developed countries. The price of medicines remains a key issue as increased healthcare spending and a more uncertain economic outlook weigh on government budgets.\n\nAging populations are fueling a rise in chronic illness\n\nIncreased longevity is one of the triumphs of modern medicine. By 2050, the UN expects there will be 1.5 billion people over the age of 65, double the current number. Aging and lifestyle changes are triggering an increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes, causing millions of preventable deaths and putting further pressure on healthcare resources.\n\nMedical science continues to accelerate\n\nScientific innovation is advancing at an unprecedented rate. In recent years, new types of medicines have been approved, including RNA therapies, gene and cell therapies, and radioligand therapies, which offer targeted approaches to treating serious diseases. Because these medicines are complex, they require focused investment and expertise to bring them to reality for patients.\n\nAccess to healthcare remains a formidable challenge\n\nWorldwide, millions of patients struggle to access the medicines they need. This may be because of cost, inequity, or structural issues in healthcare systems. While access to medicines remains an acute issue in lower-income countries, it is a problem in developed countries too, where the pandemic highlighted that deep health inequities remain entrenched. As medical science advances so should access to medicines.\n\nPatients are moving to the center of healthcare\n\nPatients are demanding more say over their treatment through patient representative groups and other means. In response, healthcare systems and pharmaceutical companies are moving toward a more integrated, end-to-end approach, with an increased focus on patient engagement in drug development and other areas. At the same time, patients are becoming more important as data owners \u2013 as personal data enables more targeted treatments and supports the development of new medicines.\n\n3\u20136%\n\nGlobal healthcare spending\n\nOver the next five years, spending on medicines globally is forecast to rise by 3\u20136%, growing faster than GDP in many developed countries. (IQVIA Institute, The Global Use of Medicines 2022)\n\n76%\n\nDeaths from NCDs\n\nGlobally, NCDs accounted for 75.6% of all deaths in 2019, up from 60.8% in 2000. (World Health Organization, World Health Statistics 2022)\n\n10\u201320\n\nUS gene therapy approvals\n\nBy 2025, the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) expects to be approving 10\u201320 gene and cell therapies annually. (FDA statement, 2019)\n\n2 bn\n\nPeople lacking access to essential medicines\n\nFive billion people worldwide have access to medicines, leaving an estimated two billion without. (Access to Medicine Foundation, 2022)\n\n78\n\nPatient organizations\n\nMembership of the European Patients\u2019 Forum (EPF), an umbrella body of patient organizations across Europe, rose to 78 in 2022 from 13 in 2003. (EPF Annual Report 2020)\nOur business environment (continued)\n\nEconomic uncertainty is growing, post-pandemic\n\nThe global economy is facing considerable uncertainty, driven by concerns over rising prices and geopolitical instability. Forecasts suggest the current economic slowdown is likely to continue in 2023. In our own industry, COVID-19 put strain on supply chains and highlighted the importance of resilient supplies of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) \u2013 the raw materials used to make finished medicines.\n\nBiopharma searches for more efficiency\n\nAt a time of growing economic uncertainty, investors are looking for sustainable growth in margins and earnings. To remain competitive, pharmaceutical companies are moving to more agile, efficient business models, particularly as they invest to build specialized capabilities in R&D and manufacturing. Meanwhile, rates of return on R&D are increasing for the first time in several years, largely because of emergency approvals during the COVID-19 crisis and faster innovation cycles.\n\nNew technologies are reshaping our industry\n\nThe use of data science and technology is increasing across our industry in everything from R&D to manufacturing and marketing. While this has brought greater efficiency, it also requires new investment and skills. Importantly, new technologies are helping to close gaps between companies, healthcare systems and patients \u2013 for example, by providing insights into the social determinants of heart health, which are enabling the development of new prevention measures.\n\nWorking practices are changing\n\nWorking practices are changing in many countries. Demand for new skills is increasing, especially in areas such as data science. Workforces are becoming more flexible and more diverse. This allows companies to tap into new talent pools, which is important at a time of skills shortages in many parts of the economy.\n\nClimate change is increasingly affecting human health\n\nExtreme temperatures and poor air quality are changing patterns of both infectious diseases and NCDs, including malaria and respiratory illnesses. Ultimately, climate change could undermine decades of progress in improving human health at a time when antimicrobial resistance is also rising. At the same time, more governments are looking to decarbonize their economies over the long-term, while companies also face increased scrutiny over the sustainability of their operations and supply chains.\n\n2.9%\n\nExpected global GDP growth\n\nGlobal GDP growth is forecast to slow to 2.9% in 2023. Growth in some of the world\u2019s most advanced economies is expected to be lower. (International Monetary Fund\u2014World Economic Outlook, 2022)\n\n45%\n\nIncreased spending on R&D\n\nSpending on R&D by large pharmaceutical companies increased by nearly 45% between 2016 and 2021. (IQVIA, Global Trends in R&D 2022)\n\n410 bn\n\nAdded value in healthcare (USD)\n\nTechnology-driven innovation in healthcare could create up to USD 410 billion in added value every year by 2025. (McKinsey, The era of exponential improvement in healthcare, 2019)\n\n76%\n\nEmployees valuing diversity\n\n76% of job seekers and employees believe that a diverse workforce is an important factor when evaluating job offers, and nearly a third (32%) would not apply to a company that lacks diversity. (Glassdoor, 2020)\n\n250 000\n\nAdditional deaths\n\nBetween 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year due to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. (WHO, Climate Change and Health, 2021)\nOur material issues\n\nThrough our materiality assessment, we identify issues where we have the most potential to create value for stakeholders and society.\n\nEvery four years, we conduct a detailed assessment to identify our material issues. Results from this assessment inform our strategy and ESG reporting. The assessment sits alongside our regular risk analysis (see page 68).\n\nOur latest assessment, conducted in 2021, was based on a survey of more than 500 external and 12,000 internal stakeholders. Respondents were asked to rank the impact of Novartis across eight impact clusters. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 140 respondents. The results of this exercise can be seen in the chart on the right.\n\nExternal stakeholders were drawn from our main stakeholder groups, including patients, customers, partners and shareholders. Internal stakeholders, including senior management, were drawn from across business divisions and functions.\n\nOverall, these results were in line with the previous assessment carried out in 2017 and were consistent across stakeholder groups. Patient safety, access to healthcare, innovation and ethical business practices also ranked highly in our previous survey.\n\nFor full details of our materiality assessment, please see www.novartis.com/materiality\nStrategy and value creation\n\nIn this section\n\n- Our strategy \u2192 p. 17\n- Stakeholder engagement \u2192 p. 21\n- How we create value \u2192 p. 20\n- Measuring our impact \u2192 p. 23\n\nMarta Cortes-Cros, director of a radioligand therapy research site at Novartis headquarters in Basel, Switzerland.\nOur strategy\n\nOur strategy as a focused medicines company is to deliver high-value medicines that alleviate society\u2019s greatest disease burdens through technology leadership in R&D and novel access approaches.\n\nWe have made significant progress in transforming Novartis from a diversified healthcare conglomerate into a focused medicines company. In doing so, we have divested or spun off non-core businesses and made targeted acquisitions to focus on our core business: discovering and developing new medicines and finding new ways to deliver them to as many people as possible.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to execute on our strategy by putting in place a new organizational structure to support innovation, growth and productivity. We also updated our strategic priorities and announced our intention to spin off our Sandoz Division, which paves the way for Novartis to advance as a company focused fully on innovative medicines.\n\nOur focus areas determine where we invest most of our time, energy and resources.\n\nCore therapeutic areas with high unmet patient needs: cardiovascular; immunology; neuroscience; solid tumors; and hematology.\n\nTechnology platforms where we have the depth and scale to discover, develop and commercialize new therapies: chemistry; biotherapeutics; RNA therapy; radioligand therapy; and gene and cell therapy.\n\nPriority geographies that together account for the majority of expected growth in global healthcare spending: US, Germany, China and Japan.

Novartis in Society Integrated Report | 18\nTransforming and focusing our company\n\nWe have evolved from being a diversified healthcare conglomerate to a focused, innovative medicines company. Announced in April 2022, our new organizational structure aligns the way we operate with this strategy.\n\nThe changes \u2013 part of our Transforming for Growth initiative \u2013 are designed to power our next phase of innovation, growth and productivity. We aim to drive shareholder returns by sharpening our focus on our core business, becoming more agile and efficient, and creating the conditions for growth in our priority markets. The new structure became fully operational in January 2023. Please see page 42 for further details.\n\nIn August 2022, we also announced plans to spin off 100% of our Sandoz Division, which we expect to be complete by the second half of 2023. The spin-off will create Europe\u2019s leading producer of generics and a global leader in biosimilars and allow us to concentrate fully on our core business. Spinning off Sandoz is in the best interests of our shareholders as it would create two standalone companies focused on their respective growth strategies.\n\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including consultation with works councils and employee representatives (as required), general market conditions, tax rulings and opinions, final Board of Directors endorsement and shareholder approval in line with Swiss corporate law. The transaction is expected to be tax neutral to Novartis.\nHow we create value\n\nThrough our core business, we improve and extend the lives of millions of people around the world, while creating value for our employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.\n\nNovartis is a focused medicines company. More than three quarters of our sales come from innovative medicines.\n\nWe use innovative science to address some of society\u2019s most challenging healthcare issues.\n\nWe invest in advanced technology platforms, like radioligand therapy, which offer targeted approaches to fighting disease.\n\nNew medicines undergo clinical trials to prove they are safe and effective. Not all succeed. Those that do are submitted to regulators for approval.\n\nNovartis medicines improve and extend the lives of millions of people around the world.\n\nWe generate financial returns for shareholders, provide salaries and other benefits for employees and create economic value through the taxes we pay and our relationships with suppliers and partners worldwide.\nThe table below shows a summary of why and how we engage with our main stakeholder groups and the main issues discussed.\n\n| Stakeholder engagement | Objectives | Approach | Main issues discussed |\n|------------------------|------------|----------|-----------------------|\n| Patients and caregivers | Identify unmet patient needs; ensure the long-term safety of our medicines; recognize patient perspectives and embed them into our decision-making in a consistent and systematic way. | Dedicated patient engagement teams; partner with patient organizations to address unmet needs; co-design clinical trials. | Elevating the voice of patients in healthcare systems; including patient perspectives in the lifecycle of our medicines to improve health outcomes. |\n| Customers | Explain the benefits and risks of our medicines; understand customer expectations and constraints on pricing and distribution; ensure a reliable supply of our medicines to patients. | Personalized contact with physicians through face-to-face visits and dedicated online platforms; scientific and medical congresses; discussions with healthcare systems on reimbursement and access to medicines. | Sharing results from our clinical trials; efforts to optimize disease management; innovative contract structures such as outcome-based agreements; collaborations to improve patient access. |\n| Employees | Continue to attract, develop and retain employees; develop new skills across the company; promote a corporate culture based on our values and behaviors; ensure a safe and healthy working environment. | Townhalls and events; quarterly surveys to measure engagement and other aspects of our culture; health and well-being offerings; regular evaluation, training, and feedback. | Employee engagement, explaining our new organizational model; updates to our corporate strategy. |\n| Shareholders and investors | Explain our strategy, performance and governance to shareholders and potential investors; ensure continued access to international capital markets for Novartis. | Meetings with portfolio managers, stewardship teams and analysts; quarterly updates; press releases and disclosures; roadshows and presentations; continued focus on our largest 100 shareholders, who together represent 60% of our ownership. | Financial and operational performance; updates on our strategy; R&D pipeline progress; the healthcare policy environment; ESG strategy and progress. |\n| Partners | Work with external researchers, partners and organizations to discover and develop new medicines; secure supplies we need for our business; improve access to medicines and support business growth. | Network of alliances with industry, academia and non-governmental organizations; regular third-party risk assessments; face-to-face meetings and industry conferences. | R&D partnering across our therapeutic areas and technology platforms, business development and licensing opportunities; standards on quality, ethics, environmental management and human rights in our supply chain. |\n| Policymakers and regulators | Maintain constructive dialogue with regulators; provide data on patient outcomes; ensure our views and interests are represented on issues affecting our industry. | Dedicated public affairs teams; working with industry associations, meetings with regulators, governments, and other policymakers. | Advocacy supporting value-based healthcare; measures to support innovation in the life sciences; constraints on healthcare spending; our therapeutic areas and expanding access to our medicines. |\nPatient engagement\n\nNovartis has a longstanding commitment to respect and understand the perspective of patients throughout our business to ensure we meet their most critical needs.\n\nResearch shows that effective patient engagement leads to faster enrolment in clinical trials, increased patient retention and more efficient trial design \u2013 helping to streamline R&D and bring medicines to patients faster. Embedding patient insights into our commercial activities also leads to more successful launches and better patient adherence to treatments.\n\nWe have developed a five-point framework (see infographic below) to gather input \u2013 from early research through to post-launch \u2013 and we are making progress in consistently and systematically embedding patient insights into these key milestones. For example, in 2022 we obtained patient input in 87% of our early research programs and 37% of our clinical development programs (compared with 84% and 30%, respectively, in 2021).\n\nThe broader industry is also moving to a more patient-centric model of healthcare, as companies and healthcare systems recognize the benefits of patient engagement and patients demand a greater say in their treatment. Healthcare regulators in the US, Europe and other countries recently issued guidelines on patient engagement, including recommendations on co-designing clinical trial endpoints with patients. See page 37 for more information on our approach to clinical trials.\n\nFive key milestones for patient engagement\n\n1. Integrated development plan\n2. Development\n3. Full development\n4. Submission\n5. Launch & life-cycle management\n\nPre-clinical\nExploratory (Phases I & II)\nPivotal (Phase III)\nPre-launch (registration & approval)\nCommercialization (post-approval)\nMeasuring our impact\n\nOur business positively impacts society in various ways. By delivering high-value medicines, for example, we improve and extend people\u2019s lives. At the same time, our activities may have negative effects, which is why we strive to reduce our environmental footprint, uphold safety standards and protect human rights in our value chain.\n\nNovartis supports the development of emerging methodologies and standards to measure the impact of companies on society and the environment. We focus on two areas: impact valuation and assessing our contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nSDGs\nIn 2022, we took part in a pilot project with the United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) to assess our activities against social and environmental impact areas.\n\nThe analysis is based on our industry sector as well as information about our main countries by sales, production and supplier spend. It uses country-level proxy data to identify potential positive and negative impact areas that connect to the SDGs. We publish the results for information purposes only.\n\nThe results show a significant positive association with \u201chealth and sanitation\u201d \u2013 which connects to SDG 3 \u2013 through the impact of our medicines on human health. UNEP FI defines a significant impact area as one where there is a strong correlation with a company\u2019s business, its sector and the countries in which it operates. Please see page 34 for further information about our contribution to SDG3. The analysis also showed a moderate positive impact on employment and the economy due to wages, benefits and employee development.\n\nAs a company with a global manufacturing network and supply chain, we have a potential moderate negative impact on natural resources including climate, air and water. We also have a potential moderate negative impact on employment due to risks associated with occupational safety. Minimizing our impact on the environment and ensuring a safe working environment are key parts of our strategy and operating model. See pages 46 and 51 for more details.\n\nImpact valuation\nNovartis is a founding member of the Value Balancing Alliance (VBA), a non-profit organization that aims to create a standard for measuring the value companies provide to society. Based on VBA methodology, we are pioneering an approach called social, environmental and economic (SEE) impact valuation, which aims to show the positive impact we bring to countries, health systems and individuals, balanced by the negative impact of our operations on the environment and other areas. Expressing these impacts in monetary terms makes them transparent and comparable.

A definition of non-IFRS measures used by Novartis, and further details, including reconciliation tables, can be found in \u201cItem 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\u201d of the Novartis Annual Report 2022.\n\n2 2022 weighted average number of shares outstanding: 2,181 million (2021: 2,243 million)\n\n3 Dividend 2022: proposal to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting on March 7, 2023.\nOperating income was USD 9.2 billion, down 13% (cc) from the prior year, mainly due to higher restructuring costs related to the implementation of our new organizational model and higher impairments.\n\nNet income was USD 7.0 billion, compared with USD 24.0 billion in the prior year, mainly due to the divestment of our stake in Roche in the prior year. Excluding the Roche impact, net income declined by 9% (cc), mainly due to lower operating income. Earnings per share were USD 3.19 compared with USD 10.71 in the prior year. Excluding the Roche impact, EPS declined by 7% (cc).\n\nTo help people understand our underlying performance, we also present our core results, which exclude the impact of amortization, restructurings, acquisitions and other significant items. Core operating income of USD 16.7 billion rose 8% (cc). Core net income of USD 13.4 billion rose 3% (cc). Core earnings per share were USD 6.12, up 6% (cc). Free cash flow of USD 11.9 billion was down 10%, mainly due to a decrease in net cash flows from operating activities and lower divestment proceeds, partly offset by lower purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nInnovative Medicines\n\nOur Innovative Medicines Division focuses on our five core therapeutic areas, as well as other promoted brands (in the therapeutic areas of ophthalmology and respiratory) and established brands.\n\nThe IM Division delivered net sales of USD 41.3 billion in 2022, an increase of 4% (cc) from the prior year.\n\nSix products with multibillion-dollar sales potential \u2013 Cosentyx, Entresto, Zolgensma, Kisqali, Kesimpta and Leqvio \u2013 contributed 32% of IM net sales in 2022, up from 26% in 2021.\n\nSix products with multibillion-dollar sales potential \u2013 Cosentyx, Entresto, Zolgensma, Kisqali, Kesimpta and Leqvio \u2013 contributed 32% of IM net sales in 2022, up from 26% in 2021. Core operating income for the IM Division was USD 15.2 billion, up 8% (cc).\nCardiovascular\nSales were USD 4.8 billion, up 40% (cc). The performance was driven by continued strong growth for Entresto, which registered sales of USD 4.6 billion, up 37% (cc), with increased patient share across all geographies.\n\nLeqvio, our treatment for high cholesterol, registered sales of USD 112 million in its first year after launch. Leqvio is the first and only small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol approved in the US. It is approved in 70 countries. Launch of the product is ongoing, with a focus on patient on-boarding, removing access hurdles and enhancing medical education.\n\nNeuroscience\nSales were USD 5.1 billion, increasing by 5% (cc), mainly driven by sales growth of Kesimpta, but partly offset by a decline in sales of Gilenya. Kesimpta showed strong sales growth, up 200% (cc) to USD 11 billion, driven by launch momentum across all geographies. It is now approved in 80 countries with more than 36,000 patients treated. Sales of Zolgensma grew 5% (cc) to USD 1.4 billion.\n\nGilenya sales were USD 2.0 billion, declining 24% (cc) from the prior year, mainly due to generic pressure in the US and Europe.\n\nSolid Tumors\nSales were USD 4.7 billion, up 21% (cc) from the prior year. Tafinlar + Mekinist grew 11% (cc) to USD 1.8 billion, with growth across all geographies. The combination therapy remains the worldwide targeted therapy leader in BRAF+ melanoma.\n\nSales of Kisqali grew strongly across all geographies based on increasing recognition of its overall survival and quality of life benefits in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.\n\nHematology\nSales were USD 6.5 billion, up 7% (cc) from the prior year. Promacta, which is known as Revolade outside the US, grew 9% (cc) to USD 2.1 billion, driven by increased use in second-line persistent and chronic immune thrombocytopenia and as a first-line and/or second-line treatment for severe aplastic anemia.\n\nScemblix continued its strong launch uptake with sales of USD 149 million, demonstrating the high unmet need in chronic myeloid leukemia.\n\nOther Promoted Brands\nSales were USD 3.1 billion, declining by 1% (cc) from the previous year due to competition for our respiratory and ophthalmology portfolios. Lucentis sales declined 4% (cc) to USD 1.9 billion, mainly in Japan and Europe, due to biosimilar launches. Xiidra sales were USD 487 million, up 4% (cc) from the prior year. Beovu sales grew 18% (cc) to USD 203 million.\n\nUltibro Group sales declined by 9% (cc) to USD 479 million, mainly in Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, due to competition. Ultibro Group consists of Ultibro Breezhaler, Seebri Breezhaler and Onbrez Breezhaler.\n\nEstablished Brands\nSales were USD 9.9 billion, down 13% (cc) from the previous year, as sales of established medicines such as Afinitor and Gilvec declined due to generic competition.\nSandoz\n\nThe Sandoz Division is a global leader in generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars, and sells products in well over 100 countries. The division has three global franchises: Retail Generics, Biopharmaceuticals and Anti-Infectives.\n\nSandoz returned to growth in 2022, with a 4% (cc) increase in net sales from the previous year to USD 9.2 billion.\n\nSales in the Biopharmaceuticals franchise grew 9% (cc) to USD 2.1 billion, driven by growth across all geographies. Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets protein- and other biotechnology-based products, including biosimilars, and provides biotechnology manufacturing services to other companies.\n\nSales in the Biopharmaceuticals franchise grew 9% (cc), driven by growth across all geographies.\n\nIn Anti-Infectives, Sandoz manufactures and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, mainly antibiotics, for use by the Retail Generics franchise and for sale to third-party customers. Total franchise sales to third parties were USD 380 million, a decrease of 5% (cc) from the prior year, mainly due to product discontinuations and supply challenges.\n\nIn Retail Generics, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets finished dosage forms of small molecule pharmaceuticals for sale to third parties across a broad range of therapeutic areas, including finished dosage forms of anti-infectives sold to third parties. Sales in the franchise were USD 6.8 billion, up 4% (cc) from the prior year, growing across all regions apart from the US.\nDeliver high-value medicines\n\n2022 highlights\n\n10.0 bn\nInvested in R&D (USD) comprising approximately 19.8% of our net sales\n\n44\nOngoing Phase III programs in our development pipeline\n\n24\nSubmissions in the US, the EU, Japan and China for new treatments as well as new indications for existing treatments\n\n23\nApprovals in the US, the EU, Japan and China\n\nIn this section\n\nBringing our medicines to patients\nWe seek to maximize the value of our key in-market and launch medicines, while investing in R&D to deliver the next generation of therapies for patients.\n\nResearch and development\nFrom the inception of a potential therapeutic through to clinical development and launch, our teams collaborate in support of our purpose to improve and extend people\u2019s lives.\n\nOur approach to clinical trials\nClinical trials help determine whether our investigational medicines are effective and safe before they are approved by regulatory authorities for general use in patients.\n\nKey assets in our R&D pipeline\nWe provide an update on select R&D programs across our core therapeutic areas as well as select programs linked to our global health priorities.\n\nVan Lacour received a Novartis radioligand therapy, Pluvicto, for advanced prostate cancer as part of a managed access program in 2021. Today, he is living a fulfilling life in his hometown of Natchez, Louisiana, in the US, where he enjoys taking photographs and listening to his collection of old records.\nDeliver high-value medicines\n\nMillions of people around the world live with serious diseases that cause early death and disability and place an enormous burden on healthcare systems. At Novartis, we are dedicated to discovering and developing new treatments for diseases including cancer, heart disease and neurological conditions \u2013 and delivering them at scale to reach as many patients as possible.\n\nDelivering new medicines is at the core of our purpose and value creation as a company: we are in the business of improving and extending people\u2019s lives and helping governments shape healthier societies.\n\nImproving human health is more critical than ever. Globally, people live for an average of 10 years with a disease or disability. Chronic conditions make up an increasing share of the disease burden as populations age, with cardiovascular disease and cancer together responsible for 28 million deaths annually.\n\nWe use a variety of scientific tools to meet this challenge. Medical science is advancing at an unprecedented rate and new types of treatments are coming to the fore, including RNA therapies, gene and cell therapies, and radioligand therapies that offer targeted approaches to treating serious diseases.\n\nIn 2022, Novartis continued to deliver high-value medicines to patients. We received 23 approvals in the US, EU, China and Japan, including a novel radioligand therapy for advanced prostate cancer in the US and EU. We advanced our focused pipeline of investigational medicines, with several clinical data readouts paving the way for further launches in 2023 and beyond.\n\nHowever, we also had disappointments as some clinical trials of investigational compounds \u2013 including ACZ885 (canakinumab) for lung cancer and UNR844 for presbyopia \u2013 did not meet their primary goals.\n\nBringing our medicines to patients\n\nWe focus on high-value innovative medicines with the potential to transform the treatment of diseases across our five core therapeutic areas where we have a leadership position and where there are high unmet patient needs.\n\nTo do this, we seek to maximize the value of our key in-market and launch medicines, while investing in R&D over the longer term to deliver the next generation of therapies for patients. We follow an integrated, end-to-end approach across the drug development continuum \u2013 from early research through development, launch and patient access \u2013 with close collaboration between our R&D, manufacturing and commercial teams to broaden the reach and impact of our medicines.\n\nWe also focus our activities on key markets that represent the majority of the expected growth in healthcare spending over the next several years. Foremost among these is the US, the world\u2019s largest healthcare market, where we aim to be a top-five player by 2027.\n\nAcross our key products and markets, we pursue effective life-cycle management and launch excellence to maximize the commercial potential of our medicines and broaden access for patients in line with the Novartis Access Principles (see page 54). This involves investing earlier in pre-launch preparation and working systematically to meet the needs of healthcare professionals and patients, including by reducing time to diagnosis and working with healthcare systems to find solutions that improve the health of entire populations.\n\nDeliver high-value medicines performance indicators\n\n| 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|\n| Projects entering development pipeline | 5 | 7 | 6 |\n| Ongoing Phase III programs | 44 | 54 | 44 |\n| US FDA breakthrough therapy designations | 1 | 3 | 2 |\n| Major submissions (US, EU, JP, China) | 24 | 34 | 13 |\n| Major approvals (US, EU, JP, China) | 23 | 21 | 26 |\n| New molecular entity (NME) approvals | 1 | 2 | 4 |\n\n1 Includes Innovative Medicines and Sandoz biosimilars only\n2 Includes projects having achieved first patient, first visit (FPFV) in confirmatory development (incl. projects entering confirmatory development from an acquisition or in-licensing). Figures shown for the year 2021 and 2020 consider projects applying the former methodology, i.e. projects entering confirmatory development from internal R&D activities. FPFV has occurred in post-proof-of-concept stage after NIBR.\n3 Includes projects with FPFV in a Phase III study but not yet filed in the US, EU, Japan or China\n4 Number of breakthrough therapy designations granted by the US Food and Drug Administration for therapies under development by Novartis\n5 Includes small molecules or biologics, new fixed-dose combinations of existing APIs, and new target indications, defined as new disease or new line of treatment (e.g., first line vs. second line)\n6 Includes NMEs such as small molecules, biologics, in the EU, new fixed-dose combinations of existing APIs\nCardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes chronic conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels such as heart failure, heart attacks and strokes, is the world\u2019s leading cause of death and one of society\u2019s biggest health concerns. More people die every year from heart attacks and strokes than died from COVID-19 during the recent pandemic. Many of these deaths are preventable through management of risk factors including high cholesterol. The total global cost of CVD is set to rise to more than USD 1 trillion by 2030.\n\nOur cardiovascular portfolio comprises therapies to treat heart failure and reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (also known as \u2018bad cholesterol\u2019), a key contributor to the build-up of fat deposits in arteries (atherosclerosis). We are also working systematically to meet the needs of health systems and patients through innovative access approaches, such as population health agreements, that work in tandem with our medicines to reduce the impact of CVD equitably and at scale.\n\nOur cholesterol-lowering treatment Leqvio has now been approved for use in 70 countries worldwide. Leqvio is a subcutaneous injection given by a healthcare provider every six months (after an initial dose and one at three months). In conjunction with a healthy diet and statins, Leqvio may help those who have difficulty sticking to medicines that are self-administered and have greater dosing frequency.\n\nThe launch of Leqvio in the US and other markets is ongoing, with a focus on patient on-boarding, removing access hurdles and enhancing medical education. In the US, we continue to see steady progress in expanding access to Leqvio. After securing coverage from key payers, the medicine is covered at or near label for 76% of patients around one year after launch. In addition, 67% of patients pay out-of-pocket expense of less than USD 10.\n\nWe are advancing our partnership with the National Health Service (NHS) in England focused on people who have had a cardiovascular event and have high LDL cholesterol. The aim is to help doctors to identify and treat 300,000 people over three years. In 2022, as part of our collaboration, we secured access for Leqvio in nearly all local care formularies, developed tools to more easily identify patients not being optimized, and helped the NHS improve overall cholesterol management in primary care.\n\nAddressing the factors behind heart disease in the US\n\nAlmost a quarter of deaths in the US are due to cardiovascular disease. Social factors such as living conditions, education and diet play a key role in determining a person\u2019s heart health. These risk factors are exacerbated by racial inequity: according to the American Heart Association, heart disease accounts for nearly 40% of the disparity in life expectancy between Black and white Americans.\n\nOur three-year Closing the Gap initiative with Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health focuses on addressing the social determinants of heart health in five vulnerable neighborhoods in Philadelphia with high rates of stroke and adverse outcomes related to heart disease. The aim is to reduce the impact of undertreated and untreated heart disease risk factors by creating systems of change in these communities that enable people to live healthier lives and experience better connections to health systems.\n\nClosing the Gap enables us to take an upstream approach. Dedicated clinical personnel and community health workers conduct screenings and connect people with resources such as food, health, education or housing assistance. Assistance is also provided to help people reduce health risks related to diabetes and hypertension, and connect them to trusted sources of care.\nWe also continue to strengthen the position of Entresto, our medicine for heart failure and hypertension, which we estimate to be treating approximately 10 million patients worldwide. With the update of the 2022 guidelines issued by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology and Heart Failure Society of America, Entresto is now included as a treatment option for the majority of patients with heart failure and is recommended as a preferred drug in its class for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, a form of heart failure with high morbidity and mortality.\n\n**Immunology**\n\n**Key product: Cosentyx**\n\nImmunology covers a broad spectrum of conditions, including chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis. Immunological diseases affect an estimated 4.5% of the world\u2019s population, and their prevalence is increasing.\n\nIn 2022, we saw continued growth for Cosentyx, our treatment for several systemic inflammatory conditions, due to approvals for new indications in key markets and initiatives to expand patient access. Since initial approval in 2015, Cosentyx has treated more than 960,000 patients worldwide.\n\nIn the EU, Cosentyx received approval for active enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and active juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) in children aged six years and over, following US approval in 2021. ERA and JPsA are subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that, if left untreated, can lead to high levels of pain and disability.\n\nIn China, Cosentyx maintained a strong growth trajectory as we continued to expand hospital access for continued patient uptake. Based on internal Novartis estimates, Cosentyx is now available in approximately 1,900 hospitals in China and has been used to treat around 250,000 psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis patients since approval in 2019.\n\nWe also reported Phase III results for Cosentyx in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a painful and recurrent skin disease that affects around one in 100 people. The data showed HS patients treated with Cosentyx experienced rapid and long-lasting symptom relief, with favorable safety consistent with the medicine\u2019s well-established profile. Data from these trials has been submitted to regulatory authorities in Europe and the US and other countries, with the goal of bringing Cosentyx as a new treatment option to patients as soon as possible.\n\n**Neuroscience**\n\n**Key products: Kesimpta, Zolgensma**\n\nAround 2 million people worldwide suffer from multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease that is the most common cause of neurological disability unrelated to trauma in people under 40 years of age.\n\nKesimpta, our treatment for relapsing forms of MS, which has been shown to reduce the risk of worsening disability from MS for up to four years, has now been approved in 80 countries with more than 36,000 patients treated. Kesimpta has seen strong launch uptake in the US, Japan and Europe. In Europe, it saw additional launches in Italy and Spain during 2022, and reached 10,000 active patients by the end of the year.\n\nNew data in 2022 showed that earlier treatment with Kesimpta is more effective in limiting the progression and impact of MS compared with treatment at a later stage \u2013 helping to reduce the burden of the disease for patients and healthcare systems. Kesimpta is a once-monthly injectable treatment that can be taken from home, which helps broaden access for patients who have difficulty visiting healthcare facilities.\n\nZolgensma, a one-time, intravenous gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), has now launched in most major markets. SMA is a rare genetic neuromuscular disease that results in the progressive and irreversible loss of motor neurons, which causes muscle weakness and atrophy. Zolgensma has been approved for use in 45 countries. In 2022, South Korea and Poland agreed to reimburse patients for the therapy. So far, more than 2,500 patients have used Zolgensma across clinical trials, access programs and in the commercial setting.\n\nNew data in 2022 also reinforced the transformational benefit of Zolgensma, demonstrating age-appropriate development when used pre-symptomatically, and maintenance of the ability to speak, swallow and meet nutritional needs when used symptomatically.\n\n**Solid Tumors**\n\n**Key products: Kisqali, Pluvicto**\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and is a growing health issue in LMICs. The WHO estimates there will be 50% more new cancer cases in 2040 than there are today.\n\nBreast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer. Kisqali, our medicine for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, the most common subtype of breast cancer, has now been approved for use in more than 95 countries and has been used to treat more than 60,000 patients. Kisqali, which inhibits two enzymes involved in the control of cell cycle progression known as CDK4 and CDK6, continues to show strong growth due to the increasing recognition of its impact on overall survival and quality of life benefits in the advanced breast cancer setting. In early 2023, it was approved in China for premenopausal and perimenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.\nWorking to eliminate malaria and neglected tropical diseases\n\nUN Sustainable Development Goal 3 is about good health and well-being. At Novartis, we have been working for decades to find new treatments for some of the world\u2019s biggest healthcare challenges \u2013 from noncommunicable diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease to infectious diseases such as malaria.\n\nOne of the targets to support SDG 3 is to end the epidemics of malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Every year, NTDs trap millions of people in a cycle of poverty and illness.\n\nIn June, we endorsed the Kigali Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases and pledged USD 250 million over five years (2021-2025) to advance new treatments for NTDs and malaria. This commitment includes the development of next-generation antimalarials, including an optimized formulation for infants, as well as further research into Chagas disease, dengue, leishmaniasis and cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic infection that causes life-threatening diarrhea in malnourished children.\n\nHematology\nKey product: Scemblix\n\nAround 500 000 new cases of leukemia are recorded globally every year. Approximately 15% of all cases are chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML, most common in adults over 65. Significant advances in recent years have led to improved survival rates, enabling more patients to live with the disease. Even so, many patients remain at risk of disease progression, and are resistant to, or intolerant of, most available treatments.\n\nOur CML treatment Scemblix is now approved for use in 40 countries\n\nIn 2022, our CML treatment Scemblix received approval for use in the EU and Japan following US approval in 2021. It is now approved for use in 40 countries. New data for Scemblix also showed long-term efficacy for patients with Philadelphia chromosome\u2013positive CML in chronic phase. Scemblix is also being studied for possible use in patients newly diagnosed with chronic CML.\n\nWhen faced with incurable disease, the hope for many patients is to live as long and as well as possible. In 2022, Kisqali data continued to demonstrate an overall survival benefit while maintaining or improving quality of life for people living with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, which has now been observed across all three Phase III clinical trials. A Phase III study of Kisqali in early-stage breast cancer \u2013 the biggest-ever clinical study of a CDK4/6 inhibitor for this disease \u2013 is ongoing.\n\nDuring the year, we also secured approval early in the US, EU and other countries for Pluvicto, our radioligand therapy for progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), an advanced form of prostate cancer that currently has few treatment options. Prostate cancer is among the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men and causes more than 30 000 deaths in the US every year. Since launch, we have been working to scale up production of Pluvicto to meet higher-than-expected demand.\n\nIn December, we announced positive approval early results from a second, pivotal Phase III study of Pluvicto in mCRPC patients prior to receiving a taxane-based chemotherapy. An additional Phase III trial in an earlier line of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is ongoing, with a data readout anticipated in 2024.\n\nIn 2022, our CML treatment Scemblix received approval for use in the EU and Japan following US approval in 2021. It is now approved for use in 40 countries. New data for Scemblix also showed long-term efficacy for patients with Philadelphia chromosome\u2013positive CML in chronic phase. Scemblix is also being studied for possible use in patients newly diagnosed with chronic CML.\n\nHematology\nKey product: Scemblix\n\nAround 500 000 new cases of leukemia are recorded globally every year.

An additional Phase III trial in an earlier line of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is ongoing, with a data readout anticipated in 2024.\nResearch and development\n\nAs with our commercial strategy, we have clear priorities in R&D to maximize the value of our pipeline of investigational medicines.\n\nFrom the inception of a potential therapeutic through to clinical development and launch, our teams collaborate in support of our purpose to improve and extend people\u2019s lives. Researchers at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) work across several therapeutic areas to uncover biological insights into the origins and pathogenesis of disease to drive the discovery and development of the next generation of medicines. Our Global Drug Development (GDD) organization leads the advanced clinical development of potential new medicines, running large clinical trials and steering the way to regulatory approval and access for patients.\n\nThis work is powered by technology platforms that help us to discover, develop and commercialize new therapies across our therapeutic areas. We focus on two established platforms \u2013 chemistry and biotherapeutics \u2013 plus three advanced platforms \u2013 RNA, radioligand therapy, and gene and cell therapy \u2013 that offer targeted approaches to treating disease. We are investing to build our capabilities in these advanced platforms and expect them to play an increasingly important role in developing new medicines in the future.\n\nWithin this \u2018two plus three\u2019 approach, we focus our development resources on our priority assets to maximize high potential early programs and ensure flawless execution of late-stage pipeline programs, in addition to supporting lifecycle management by growing the evidence base for key in-market assets.\n\nWe continue to make significant investments to support our R&D strategy. In 2022, we invested USD 10.0 billion in R&D, compared with USD 9.5 billion in the prior year. Approximately 21,000 Novartis employees work in R&D \u2013 around one fifth of our total workforce.\n\nDelivering high-value medicines requires a focus on productivity and prioritization to increase our returns on R&D investment \u2013 for example by moving quickly to expand projects with high potential and stop or out-license non-core programs. At the same time, we are using AI to optimize drug discovery and development, and reduce cycle times (see page 52).\n\nWhile most of our research is conducted internally, we increase our chances of discovering new medicines by collaborating with outside researchers and biotech companies. Our network consists of more than 300 outside academics and 100 industry alliances working on joint research and drug discovery.\n\nSignificant pipeline advancements in 2022 include the approval of novel radioligand therapy Pluvicto, and further approvals and indication expansions for Scemblix, Kymriah and Cosentyx. We also presented several late-stage data readouts that pave the way for further launches in 2023 and beyond.\n\nFor example, our complement factor B inhibitor iptacopan (LNP023) met its primary endpoints in two Phase III studies in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare and deadly blood disorder. Global regulatory submissions for iptacopan for the treatment of PNH are anticipated to be filed in 2023. If approved, iptacopan has the potential to become the first oral monotherapy for PNH.\n\nIptacopan was discovered at NIBR through research targeting the immune system\u2019s alternative complement pathway, of which complement factor B is a key part. When it\u2019s working properly, this pathway helps clear the body of pathogens and damaged cells. When it\u2019s not, it can cause the destruction of critical cells in the body, leading to a variety of debilitating diseases.\n\nIptacopan is also being studied for other indications such as kidney diseases and other rare blood disorders. Its potential as an oral treatment for several complement-mediated diseases was recognized early, prompting the design of a streamlined, parallel development plan in multiple patient populations.\n\n\u2018Two plus three\u2019 \u2013 our key technology platforms\n\n| Chemistry | Biotherapeutics | RNA therapy | Radioligand therapy | Gene & cell therapy |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Chemistry is the discovery of low molecular weight synthetic molecules that can be optimized as medicines. | Biotherapeutics, or biologics, are medicines derived from the molecules of life, carefully engineered to treat specific diseases. | RNA therapies use various forms of ribonucleic acids (RNA) to modify biological pathways in the body to treat or cure specific illnesses. | Radioligand therapy delivers precision-targeted radiation to cancer cells in the body with the goal of limiting damage to surrounding tissue. | Gene therapies modify part of a patient\u2019s genetic makeup to help treat genetic or inherited diseases. Cell therapies treat diseases by restoring or altering certain sets of cells or by using cells to carry a therapy through the body. |\nCreating new possibilities in cancer care\n\nCancer is a spectrum of diseases with diverse characteristics that share a common feature \u2013 abnormal cells that grow out of control. Novartis has developed a world-class portfolio of compounds and biotherapeutics that inhibit key pathways driving cell survival and growth in a number of cancers. While tremendous progress has been made, an urgent need for new and better treatments remains. We are pursuing technologies that hold the potential for more diverse, targeted therapeutics to treat additional forms of cancer.\n\nNovartis scientists are working to make CAR-T therapy, a treatment for certain blood cancers that sits at the intersection of cell-, gene-, and immuno-based therapies, better and more effective. The technology, known as T-Charge, shortens the time it takes to genetically engineer T cells during the CAR-T manufacturing process, so they can be given back to patients faster. T-Charge also helps these cells persist in patients longer, with the goal of giving them a better chance to control cancer. We are studying T-Charge in clinical trials to gauge its potential efficacy.\n\nRadioligand therapy uses radiation to destroy cancer cells in a more targeted way than conventional radiotherapy. By using special molecules that carry a therapeutic radioisotope and circulate throughout the bloodstream, this technology can target cancer cells anywhere in the body while limiting damage to surrounding cells. Radioligand therapy is used for certain neuroendocrine tumors and advanced stages of prostate cancer. Novartis scientists are working to apply it to other cancer types.\n\nFinally, targeted protein degradation takes advantage of the proteasome, a cell\u2019s internal machinery for eliminating unwanted proteins. With this technology, scientists will potentially be able remove proteins from the cell, rather than just blocking their activity \u2013 opening the way to develop targeted therapies for cancer-causing proteins that have long eluded drug hunters.\n\n50% More cancer cases\nThe WHO estimates there will be 50% more new cancer cases in 2040 than there are today.\nInnovation for global health\n\nIn 2022, we also advanced our efforts to develop novel medicines for diseases that predominantly affect underserved patients in LMICs. For example, we announced we will progress ganaplacide/lumefantrine (KAF156) into Phase III development for the treatment of patients with acute uncomplicated malaria.\n\nGanaplacide is a novel agent with a new mechanism of action and is active against malaria parasites that are partially resistant to existing antimalarials. Combined with a once-daily formulation of lumefantrine, this combination has the potential not only to clear malaria infection, but also to block the transmission of the malaria parasite.\n\nThe Phase III trial is planned to start in 2023 and will include clinical sites in sub-Saharan Africa. Ganaplacide/lumefantrine is being developed with support from the Medicines for Malaria Venture and their partners.\n\nOur approach to clinical trials\n\nClinical trials play a critical role in delivering high-value medicines: they help determine whether our investigational medicines are effective and safe before they are approved by regulatory authorities for general use in patients.\n\nFor every clinical trial our primary responsibility is to protect the safety, well-being and legal rights of all participants and ensure adherence to the highest ethical standards for clinical research. For more information, see our position on responsible clinical trials.\n\nAs part of the Novartis Commitment to Patients and Caregivers, we are committed to seeking patient input into the design of our clinical trials, helping us to develop medicines that address patient needs. We are also committed to registering new medicines in every country where patients have taken part in clinical trials and to publishing the results. See page 22 for more information on patient engagement.\n\nDiversity in clinical trials\n\nDiverse representation in clinical trials helps us understand how patient groups who are most likely to be treated for a disease will respond to a medicine \u2013 ultimately improving the quality of care for every patient, while also helping to address health inequities in society. In the US, for example, only 8% of participants across all clinical trials in the country in 2020 identified as Black or African American, despite this group having one of the lowest life expectancies and higher mortality from diseases such as CVD.\n\nWe include diversity and inclusion principles in all Phase III studies with US participation. For example, we consider epidemiology variances for race, ethnicity and gender for target disease indications during feasibility planning and trial recruitment. We plan to extend this approach to all studies worldwide.\n\nTo increase recruitment of under-represented groups in our trials, we are working with patient groups and through community partnerships \u2013 including with churches in Atlanta and with our partners in Beacon of Hope (see page 58 for details of this program). In one example, we leveraged these relationships to help enroll patients in a Phase III trial of Entresto for heart failure in the US. As a result, 50% of patients enrolled from these sites and 22% of patients overall in the trial were from under-represented groups.\n\nTo increase recruitment of under-represented groups in our trials, we are working with patient groups and through community partnerships.\n\nIn 2022, the FDA issued new guidance on diversity in clinical trials. In response, we are now updating our guidelines to incorporate the guidance into our priority programs from 2023.\n\nClinical trials (phases I-V)\n\n| Phase | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Phase I | The purpose of Phase I is to establish whether a drug is safe for use in humans. It usually involves a small group of healthy volunteers. |\n| Phase II | Phase II assesses the medicine\u2019s effectiveness and determines the right dosage. Trials involve larger groups of patients with the disease. |\n| Phase III | Phase III determines whether the medicine is safe and effective for a wider variety of patients. This is the last phase before submission to regulators for approval. |\n| Phase IV | Monitoring continues after approval. In some cases, Phase IV trials are carried out to collect data on potential long-term adverse effects. |\n\nApproved for general use\nManaged and post-trial access programs\n\nOur managed access programs (MAPs) provide eligible patients \u2013 those with serious or life-threatening illnesses \u2013 with access to medicines not yet approved or available in their home countries. In 2022, we reviewed 7,730 MAP requests from physicians from 80 countries and across 55 compounds. We approved 94% of these. By the end of 2022, more than 9,700 patients were receiving treatment under Novartis MAPs.\n\nWe are the first pharmaceutical company to publish peer-reviewed research on our MAPs, spanning more than 30,000 patient requests from 110 countries over three years. Results showed an average approval rate of approximately 95%. Most programs (87%) took place in high-income countries, those with compassionate use regulations made available online (94%) and those with a high level of clinical trial activity (96%). This research is intended to inform discussions among policymakers, regulators and the industry on how to broaden access to patients through compassionate use.\n\nOur post-trial access (PTA) policy, which applies to all confirmatory clinical trials and trials for serious and/or life-threatening conditions, ensures patients who have derived clinical benefit from an investigational treatment can continue to receive it, free of charge, until it is commercially available and accessible locally. Our PTA policy applies regardless of the severity of the disease, the availability of alternative therapies, or the location of the clinical trial. PTA plans were incorporated in all in-scope trials approved in 2022. See the Novartis Position on Post-Trial Access for more information.\n### Key assets in our R&D pipeline\n\nThe table below provides an update on select R&D programs across our core therapeutic areas as well as select programs linked to our global health priorities.

We also took further steps to transform our manufacturing network, improve supply chain management and reduce our environmental footprint.\n\nFocusing our organization\n\nIn recent years, we have evolved from being a diversified healthcare conglomerate to a focused, innovative medicines company. Announced in April 2022, our organizational structure aligns the way we operate with this strategy.\n\nWe integrated our former Novartis Pharmaceuticals and Oncology units under our Innovative Medicines Division with separate US and international commercial organizational units. We also integrated our manufacturing and business services teams into a single Operations organization and integrated our corporate functions.\n\nThese changes \u2013 part of our Transforming for Growth initiative \u2013 are designed to power our next phase of innovation, growth and productivity by sharpening our focus on our core business. Creating a simpler, more agile organization will enable us to take quicker decisions and scale the use of new technologies, while reducing duplications in our marketing and sales activities and introducing more efficient end-to-end management across our research, development and commercial operations.\n\nThis new structure became fully operational in January 2023. We estimate these changes will result in cost savings of approximately USD 1.5 billion by 2024, freeing up resources for investment in research and development (R&D) and delivering returns to shareholders. In the short term, we expect the impact of these productivity gains to help offset moderately rising energy costs and inflationary pressures in our supply chain.\n\nExcellence in manufacturing\n\nIn 2022, we worked to further increase efficiency across our manufacturing sites. We introduced new innovative manufacturing techniques, such as continuous manufacturing, based on an end-to-end, uninterrupted production line. We also automated more processes, such as packaging lines and inspection of prefilled syringes, and introduced 3D printing for spare parts. At the same time, we switched more of our production to cleaner energy and improved our environmental performance.\n\nIn recent years, we have been adapting our sites, consolidating production where possible, particularly in small molecules and generics where we face most competition. Since 2019, we have closed, exited or sold 17 manufacturing sites and have announced the closure, exit or sale of nine additional sites.\n\nIn parallel, we have been expanding capacity in strategic focus areas such as biopharmaceuticals and advanced technology platforms such as radioligand therapy. In 2022, we were given approval for a new 16 000m\u00b2 facility in Durham, North Carolina, to produce Zolgensma, our gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. We also began operations at a new, state-of-the-art biopharmaceuticals plant in Austria that uses high-quality manufacturing expertise. We also began operations at a new, state-of-the-art biopharmaceuticals plant in Austria that uses high-quality manufacturing expertise. In addition, we began siRNA drug substance production for our cholesterol drug Leqvio in Switzerland, expanded radioligand therapy (RLT) production in the US and Europe, and continued work on our new RLT facility in Indiana, US, which is due to come into operation in 2023.\n\nThese changes mirror developments in our product mix and help us retain flexibility, so we maintain supplies and react quickly to fluctuations in demand. We increased production of Cosentyx and Tahnilar across various sites after the two medicines were added to China\u2019s national reimbursement list. Overall, we produced approximately 72.5 billion treatments in 2022, ensuring a continuous and reliable supply of our medicines to patients worldwide.\n\nDuring the year, we also stepped up our contract manufacturing business, through which we leverage our manufacturing facilities and expertise, including in gene and cell therapy, to produce medicines for third-party customers alongside our own. Our sites in Singapore, the US and Europe are producing medicines and vaccines for other pharmaceutical companies. Contract manufacturing means we can increase capacity utilization at our sites while giving customers access to high-quality manufacturing expertise.\nInvesting in early-stage technical development\n\nIn September, we announced a USD 300 million investment in early technical development capabilities for next-generation biotherapeutics at facilities in Switzerland, Slovenia and Austria. Biotherapeutics currently account for around half of all new drug approvals and have enormous potential to treat unmet patient needs across a range of diseases. Spanning both drug substance and drug product development, this investment is expected to lead to faster transition times from pre-clinical to first-in-human studies, helping to put Novartis at the forefront of biotherapeutic development.\n\nSupply chain management\n\nWe work with thousands of external partners worldwide, from suppliers in our R&D organization to wholesalers and distributors, who ensure our medicines reach patients. The diversity and geographic spread of our supply chain makes it highly resilient, even in times of pandemic or other economic shocks.\n\nWe contractually oblige third-party suppliers to abide by our standards on quality, ethics, and human rights. To support this approach, we carry out regular risk assessments and audits in risk areas including health and safety, labor rights, information security and anti-bribery and corruption. We also work with suppliers to reduce their environmental impact (see section below).\n\nIn 2022, we extended our third-party risk assessments downstream to include wholesalers and distributors of our medicines, and updated our expectations for suppliers to carry out due diligence on human rights.\n\nOver the past three years, we have assessed nearly 97% of our tier one suppliers in Operations that play a critical role in our supply chain. Of these, only around 1% were considered high-risk.\n\nSustainability in our supply chain\n\nEnvironmental sustainability criteria have been integrated in supply contracts covering more than a third of our Scope 3 supplier emissions. Our plan is to increase this to all suppliers by 2025. To support our approach, we are engaging with suppliers to develop sustainability roadmaps \u2013 part of our goal to achieve carbon neutrality across our value chain by 2030 and to be net zero by 2040.\n\nMore than 90% of carbon emissions associated with our business are generated outside our own operations.\n\nProtecting patient health and safety\n\nPatient health and safety is fundamental to our business. We cannot deliver on our purpose if we do not provide safe, high-quality medicines. Our activities are focused on three areas: manufacturing safe medicines (product quality); ensuring these medicines remain safe and that we identify possible adverse events to minimize risks to patients (pharmacovigilance); and combating falsified medicines, which can pose a serious threat to human health.\n\nProduct quality\n\nAll our facilities operate under strict regulations from regulatory health authorities. Health authorities regularly inspect our facilities to ensure we are complying with all relevant laws and standards. In 2022, health authorities, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Swissmedic and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), carried out a total of 139 inspections. Of these, 100% were found to be acceptable, up from 99.2% in 2021. Novartis also routinely audits suppliers and other partners to ensure quality standards are maintained.\n\nWe carry out thorough investigations into safety issues with our products, and act quickly to address any concerns. For example, in May we suspended production of our Pluvicto radioligand therapy for prostate cancer at two sites in Italy and the US to address quality concerns in their manufacture. After remediating the issues, we restarted production in June and resumed delivery of doses to patients. These issues did not affect patient safety, and no risk to patients from the doses previously produced at these sites was identified.\n\nDuring the year, we had 19 recalls \u2013 7 for IM and 12 for Sandoz. None were related to relevant health authorities.\n\n### Supply chain performance indicators\n\n| Year | Number of suppliers risk-assessed by TPRM | Actions taken |\n|------|------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| 2022 | 11,097                                   | 11,064       |\n| 2021 | 12,064                                   | 8,448        |\n| 2020 | 12,064                                   | 8,448        |\n\n1. Assessment is done on new suppliers and new products, services or sites from existing suppliers. Not all suppliers trigger risk assessments.\n2. Figures do not include GxP audits (see \u201cPatient health and safety performance indicators\u201d).\n3. Decreased due to fewer medium- and high-risk cases.\n\n### Progress against ESG targets\n\n| Target | Progress |\n|--------|----------|\n| Conduct risk assessments for all new eligible suppliers | 100% (conducted via TPRM process) |\nPharmacovigilance\nEffective pharmacovigilance relies on timely assessment and reporting of adverse events and is critical to ensuring patient safety. We maintain a high level of compliance to regulatory requirements for both individual case safety reports and periodic benefit-risk assessments.\n\nReports of adverse events from various sources, including clinical studies and spontaneous reports, are used to evaluate and optimize risk management actions for the proper use of our medicines. As an example, following two patient fatalities we updated the label for Zolgensma, in alignment with health authorities, to specify that fatal acute liver failure had been reported. While this is clinically important safety information, it is not a new safety signal, and we firmly believe in the overall favorable risk-benefit profile of Zolgensma, which has been used to treat more than 2,500 patients worldwide. We notified health authorities in all markets where Zolgensma is used, and communicated to healthcare professionals as an additional step in markets where this action is supported by health authorities.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to support education programs for patients, providers and pharmacists. Our pharmacovigilance team also supported a program with the UK regulatory authority to provide early access to two cancer medicines \u2013 Scemblix and Pluvicto \u2013 for patients with clear unmet medical need before marketing approval was received later in the year.\n\nCombating falsified medicines\nThe illicit trade in falsified medicines is a threat to patient safety and an increasingly significant issue for health systems around the world. The Pharmaceutical Security Institute reported a 38% increase in pharmaceutical crime incidents between 2016 and 2021, leading to an all-time high in 2021.\n\nOur strategy is focused on two areas: the quick authentication and reporting of falsified medicines, as well as collective action to address the issue. In 2022, we investigated 213 incidents in 48 countries and worked closely with law enforcement on 74 enforcement actions which led to the seizure of approximately 1.2 million units of falsified medicines. Since 2017, our efforts have prevented serious safety risks for an estimated 1.8 million patients.\n\nWe plan to roll out 250 Authentifield sensors in 75 countries in May 2023. These sensors enable our Innovative Medicines employees to rapidly authenticate (solid) drug products, which is vital in preventing falsified medicines reaching patients. Meanwhile, our MoVe internal mobile application, which enables employees to quickly verify the authenticity of secondary packaging of any Novartis product, is now active in 49 countries.\n\nIn 2022, Novartis also engaged over 8,100 key stakeholders across 27 countries on topics including public awareness, policy, and capacity-building. We voluntarily reported 100% of confirmed incidents to the WHO, 95% within the recommended 10-day timeframe.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability\nWe continue to reduce emissions, water consumption and waste sent for disposal in our own operations, in line with our 2025 targets. In 2022, we also introduced environmental sustainability criteria into suppliers\u2019 contracts and started engaging with them to define actions to reduce emissions in our supply chain.\n\nOur environmental sustainability strategy and engagement activities are consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C compared to pre-industrial levels in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to develop science-based targets in accordance with the SBTi Net Zero standard. We also joined The Climate Pledge which is working toward net-zero by 2040, in line with our own target.\n\nTo accelerate progress across the pharmaceutical sector and other industries, we work closely with organizations such as the AMR (antimicrobial resistance) Industry Alliance, Pharmaceutical Environmental Group, World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative.\n\nSee page 89 for our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) statement.\nClimate\nIn 2022, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 23% from the prior year, representing a reduction of 49% compared with our 2016 baseline. We have been steadily reducing our emissions for several years, mainly through energy efficiency, increased use of renewables and new manufacturing technologies.\n\nWe are committed to using 100% renewable electricity across our operations by 2025. In 2022, we had renewable power purchase agreements in place to cover electricity consumption across our operations in Europe and North America.\n\nCurrently, 20 of our manufacturing sites are certified under ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) or the EU\u2019s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme \u2013 equivalent to about half of our total production by volume.\n\nOur Scope 3 emissions increased by 20% from the prior year, driven primarily by increased business travel following the pandemic. The calculation of emissions from purchased goods and services is based on proxy (spending) data and statistical modelling. The resulting figure provides an approximate reflection of emissions based on industry averages. Over time, we plan to move to a calculation based on primary activity data, which we expect will give a more accurate representation of our Scope 3 emissions and better highlight our efforts to engage with our suppliers on environmental sustainability.\n\nWaste\nIn 2022, we continued efforts to reduce waste sent for disposal. We have introduced sustainable design guidelines for our products, devices and packaging. Where feasible, we are switching to recycled plastics, cutting back on the use of blister packs and increasing the use of reusable shipping boxes. Since 2016, we have reduced the amount of waste sent for disposal by 59%.\n\nWater\nWe have continued to reduce our water consumption by using more recycled water (where local regulations allow) and adopting less water-intensive production techniques. Since 2016, our water use has reduced by 42%.\n\nIn 2022, we began to classify our facilities based on whether they are in areas affected by water scarcity. The initial results showed that 36 locations contributing approximately 11% of our water consumption are in areas of high risk or very high risk as defined by the WWF Water Risk Filter. During 2023 we plan to conduct operational water risk assessments at 15 priority locations with the highest water consumption to determine actions needed to ensure we become water neutral at these locations. We aim to be water neutral at all our locations by 2030.\n\nProgress against ESG targets\n\n| Target | Progress |\n|--------|----------|\n| Climate | On track: 49% reduction vs. 2016 baseline |\n| Waste | On track: Nine out of ten sites in scope have eliminated PVC in packaging |\n| Water | On track: 42% reduction vs. 2016 baseline |\n\n1 Scope 1 and Scope 2 from energy\n2 In accordance with SBTi net-zero standard\n3 From Novartis owned and operated sites.

Water-stressed regions are determined using WWF water risk filter\nSupporting global efforts to combat climate change\n\nHealthcare contributes almost 5% to global greenhouse gas emissions. But the effects of climate change cut both ways: rising temperatures and air pollution are also harming human health and, in some cases, changing disease patterns. Reducing greenhouse gases lies at the heart of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nMany countries around the world are decarbonizing their healthcare systems. So far, 50 have made the pledge, including Germany, the US, the UK and emerging markets such as Indonesia and Egypt. If we want to retain our position in these markets, we must show progress with our own decarbonization program.\n\nAt Novartis, we aim to be net zero by 2040. Over the past two years, we have also started introducing environmental sustainability criteria into our supplier contracts, extending this to wholesalers and distributors in 2022.\n\nEnvironment performance indicators\n\n| Indicator | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-----------|------|------|------|\n| Energy use \u2013 on site and purchased (million GJ) | 9.9 | 9.8 | 10.9 |\n| Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (1 000 tCO2e) | | | |\n| Total Scope 1 emissions | 347.2 | 352.8 | 378.3 |\n| Total Scope 2 emissions (market based) | 154.9 | 292.7 | 335.5 |\n| Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 (excluding offsets) | 502.1 | 645.5 | 713.8 |\n| Total Scope 3 emissions | 8 770.0 | 7 290.4 | 7 268.8 |\n| Total Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions | 9 272.1 | 7 935.9 | 7 982.6 |\n| Water (million m\u00b3) | | | |\n| Total water withdrawal | 521 | 47.6 | 54.7 |\n| Total water discharged | 49.6 | 46.6 | 54.5 |\n| Water consumption | 7.5 | 7.7 | 8.4 |\n| Operational waste (1 000 t) | | | |\n| Total waste generated | 97.0 | 103.6 | 130.6 |\n| Total waste diverted from disposal | 69.5 | 73.4 | 88.6 |\n| Total waste directed to disposal | 27.5 | 30.2 | 42.1 |\n\n1 Other than where indicated, environmental data for the current year are based on actuals for January-September and estimates for October-December (to be updated with actuals in 2023 in our annual Novartis Environmental Sustainability datasheet).

In 2022, we moved to an integrated company structure to align with our focused strategy, while also putting in place measures to help employees manage through this significant change. We also continued to phase in new ways of working and advanced our efforts to increase workforce diversity.\n\nChanges to our organizational model\n\nExecuting on our strategy as a focused medicines company requires us to work differently. We reorganized our company to create a more agile and simpler organization that is aligned with our focused strategy and will support innovation, growth and productivity. Regrettably, our Transforming for Growth initiative also entails job losses as we reshape our company to focus on our core Innovative Medicines business.\n\nWe recognize that these changes cause considerable uncertainty for many of our employees. To manage the process, we put in place six basic principles:\n\n- **Fairness in decision-making**: all decisions were taken in line with our Code of Ethics and Values and Behaviors.\n- **Balanced representation**: where units were merged, we ensured proper balance in terms of both organizational structure and opportunities for leadership positions.\n- **Equal opportunities**: throughout the process, we worked to ensure equal opportunities for all employees to maintain our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.\n- **Support and care**: those affected by the changes had access to various support programs to help them transition to new roles, either within or outside Novartis.\n- **Social dialogue**: during the process, we consulted with Works Councils and other employee representative bodies in accordance with local law and regulations.\n- **Simple approvals**: we simplified approval processes so that key decisions could be taken as quickly as possible.\n\nWith the new organization, we will see a reduction in our workforce over the next two years. In total, through Transforming for Growth we expect to reduce our workforce by up to 8,000 positions by the end of 2024. In 2022, employee turnover stood at 15%. Voluntary turnover was 9%, up from 8% in the previous year.\n\nInvesting in our culture\n\nWe are investing in our culture to help drive our long-term performance as a focused medicines company. We encourage all Novartis employees to be inspired, curious and unbossed to unlock innovation and drive performance. For us, this is about building an agile, diverse workforce and making sure we attract and retain talent for the future.\n\n---\n\n### People performance indicators\n\n|                      | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Headcount 1          | 105,533| 108,514| 110,738|\n| Full-time equivalent positions 1 | 101,703| 104,323| 105,794|\n| Percentage turnover voluntary / overall | 9 / 15 | 8.0 / 13.0 | 5.0 / 10.0 |\n| Percentage of hires: internal / external | 66 / 34 | 62 / 38 | 58 / 42 |\n| Annual learning hours per employee 2 | 42.4 | 52.1 | 53.2 |\n| Representation of nationalities: overall / management 3 | 147 / 116 | 143 / 115 | 142 / 113 |\n| Employees represented by an employee representative body or covered by a collective bargaining agreement (%) 4 | 48 | 47 | 46 |\n\n### Health and safety\n\n- **Lost-time injury and illness rate (per 200,000 hours worked)**: Novartis employees / Third-party personnel 0.16 / 0.20\n- **Total recordable case rate (per 200,000 hours worked)**: Novartis employees / Third-party personnel 0.31 / 0.28\n- **Fatalities: Novartis employees / Third-party personnel / Contractors**: 0 / 0 / 0\n\n---\n\n1 \u201cHeadcount\u201d reflects the total number of employees in payroll systems. \u201cFull-time equivalent positions\u201d adjusts headcount for employees working less than 100%.\n2 Since 2022, Novartis reports training hours for internal employees only.\n3 Management defined by Global Job Level Architecture and Novartis Top Leaders\n4 Generally non-management employees\n5 Data include all work-related injuries and illnesses, whether leading to lost time or not.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)\n\nWe are focused on creating a work environment in which all employees feel they belong and can do their best work.

To support this approach, we embed DEI into objectives for managers and in internal policies and controls, including our Code of Ethics.\n\nGender equity is an important part of our DEI strategy. Women now make up 47% of our overall management, compared with 46% in 2021 and 42% five years ago.\n\nAs part of our public pledge to the UN\u2019s Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC), we are also committed to further improving pay equity and transparency. Based on the latest data available as of December 31, 2021, Novartis has a global mean pay gap of +3.1% and a global median pay gap of -3.0%, compared with +3.3% and -2.3%, respectively, in the prior year. While we acknowledge this percentage is influenced by worldwide workforce demographics, our global mean pay gap is significantly ahead of the Bloomberg benchmark of +19% mean for the same period.\n\nAcross the organization, we are also increasing pay transparency and systematically removing historical salary data when hiring to reduce the likelihood of perpetuating possible discrimination. At the end of 2022, 84% of our global hiring was taking place on this basis. Our aim is to complete preparations for full pay transparency for all employees by the end of 2023, in time for annual pay discussions in February 2024.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) performance indicators\n\n| Indicator | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-----------|------|------|------|\n| Overall headcount | 51 / 49 | 51 / 49 | 50 / 50 |\n| Hires | 52 / 48 | 52 / 47 | 52 / 48 |\n| Board of Directors | 31 / 69 | 31 / 69 | 29 / 71 |\n| Executive Committee of Novartis | 27 / 73 | 25 / 75 | 23 / 77 |\n| Novartis Top Leaders | 39 / 61 | 38 / 62 | 33 / 67 |\n| Senior management | 41 / 59 | 39 / 61 | 39 / 61 |\n| Middle management | 48 / 52 | 47 / 53 | 46 / 54 |\n| Overall management | 47 / 53 | 46 / 54 | 45 / 55 |\n\n1 Fewer than 0.5% of employees have unknown classification.

We also support the UN Standards of Conduct for Business to tackle discrimination against LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex) employees and are members of the International Labor Organization\u2019s (ILO) Global Business and Disability Network. In 2022, we received the Stonewall Top Global Employer Silver Award and were included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, a recognition of the progress we continue to make in providing a positive and inclusive work environment for all employees.\n\nThrough our parental leave program, introduced in 2019, all Novartis employees regardless of gender or sexual orientation can benefit from a minimum period of 14 weeks paid parental leave following the birth or adoption of a child, ensuring equity and greater flexibility for birthing and non-birthing parents.\n\nNew ways of working\n\nIn recent years, working models have become more flexible \u2013 a logical step during the upheavals of the pandemic. In 2020, we took an experimental approach and launched a program called Choice with Responsibility to give employees more flexibility and maintain business continuity, while also emphasizing the importance of working together onsite on occasions to support innovation and strengthen teamwork and collective responsibility.\nAs the pandemic has subsided in many countries, we have made the decision to further evolve our approach to hybrid working to increase our focus on collaboration and innovation. Our updated guidance was announced in 2022 and will be implemented in 2023 pending local consultations and country-specific requirements, including local health and safety regulations. We aim to provide flexibility where it makes sense, while also prioritizing time spent together, encouraging a team-first mindset, and giving greater clarity and accountability to our teams.\n\nThe diversity of roles across our organization allows for different levels of flexibility. As a result, we have provided specific guidance for our field force, office workers, lab workers and manufacturing workers.\n\n**Employee engagement**\n\nWe measure employee engagement every quarter. The engagement score decreased in the second half of 2022 to 73, two points below the global benchmark. Engagement favorability, which measures the percentage of \u201cagree\u201d or \u201cstrongly agree\u201d survey responses, was 76% in the fourth quarter, compared with 85% a year earlier. This outcome was anticipated following the announcement of our Transforming for Growth initiative.\n\nThe engagement score is based on responses to two questions: \u201cHow happy are you at Novartis?\u201d and \u201cWould you recommend Novartis as a great place to work?\u201d. The voluntary and anonymous survey, which is sent to all Novartis employees, is carried out by an external consultant to ensure independence. In Q4 2022, 69% of Novartis employees took part in the survey. Results are used on an aggregated basis to identify potential risks and make improvements to working conditions, training and development, access to support programs and other areas where necessary.\n\n**Learning, growth and leadership development**\n\nWe want a future-ready workforce that can achieve our strategic objectives. To do this, we continue to promote curiosity, learning and growth, which helps us to adapt to our changing business environment and ensures we build strategic skills, particularly in areas such as R&D, data science, and launch excellence to drive performance.\n\nSince 2019, we have made significant investments in learning and development through our \u2018Going Big on Learning\u2019 initiative, which has led to an approximately 50% increase in average employee learning hours since 2016. In 2022, employees dedicated an average of 42.4 hours to learning. While this was down from 52.1 hours in the previous year, largely due to the impact of organizational changes in our business, it was still ahead of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAlthough overall learning objectives and investments are being recalibrated in line with the broader organizational transformation at Novartis, we continue to prioritize learning as a key part of our culture to drive innovation and performance. Alongside mandatory training in areas like ethics and health and safety, approximately 36,000 employees took courses through LinkedIn and Coursera on a range of topics including data science, digital skills and marketing.\n\nIn addition, more than 11,000 managers have taken part in our Unbossed Leadership Experience program since 2020, which gives them the skills to lead cultural change within the organization. We also provide dedicated training to first-time managers.\n\nMatch is our cross-company online platform that allows employees to take charge of their own learning and career development through a range of offerings, from jobs and mentoring opportunities to short-term project assignments and \u2018bite-sized\u2019 training modules. In 2022, we rolled out Match across the company. The number of users increased to over 33,000 \u2013 with more than 900 mentorships, over 350 project assignments and about 250,000 learning units on the platform completed.\n\n**Performance management and career development**\n\nAll Novartis employees receive support for performance management and career development through a flexible, continuous system of coaching, feedback and recognition by managers and colleagues. Teams and individuals create objectives that focus on both short- and longer-term impact. In addition, managers and employees have regular discussions on topics including progress toward goals, development, feedback and well-being.\n\n**Supporting mental health and well-being**\n\nMental health is increasingly in the spotlight as the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors have taken a toll on people\u2019s mental, social and physical well-being. The effects of stress on daily life is the most frequently reported mental health issue globally, according to the Ipsos World Mental Health Day 2022 survey.\n\nAt Novartis, we have a dedicated well-being program for employees, known as Energized for Life. In 2022, we stepped up our employee assistance programs and e-training, as we recognized that Transforming for Growth would inevitably add to pressures for many employees.\n\nIn February, we launched a new version of \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d, an online library of tools and resources, accessed by over 10,500 employees during the year. We also added a question on well-being to our regular employee engagement survey.\n\nWe measure employee attitudes before and after our well-being programs to ensure we are on the right track. Figures for 2022 show those participating in our programs had better work-life balance, communicated more with colleagues and were able to manage their time more effectively.\nProviding a safe and secure working environment\n\nOur commitment to occupational health and safety is built into our Code of Ethics. In addition, we have strict health and safety controls across our sites that go beyond legal requirements:\n\n- At all our sites, we conduct regular audits to assess compliance with regulations and internal controls.\n- We also carry out risk assessments to determine the necessary frequency of these audits, and have crisis management plans in place to deal with emergency situations.\n- Both our own employees and outside contractors receive regular health and safety training.\n\nHealth and safety standards are also incorporated into our supplier contracts and risk assessments. In addition, 18 of our sites have ISO 45001 certification, covering 35% of employees and third-party personnel working in manufacturing and supply.\n\nSafety incident rates returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, consistent with industry benchmarks. However, over the longer term we continue to see improvement with the total recordable incident rate for employees, Novartis, partners and society in areas that are aligned with our strategy and purpose.\n\nWe signed a new partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, while also providing support for those affected by the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn 2022 we signed new partnerships with organizations such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, while also providing support for those affected by the war in Ukraine (see page 61). Our projects over the past year included mentoring health-tech entrepreneurs, supporting environmental sustainability in the supply chain, and working with the UN on projects for innovation.\n\nWages and cost of living\n\nNovartis is committed to paying employees a living wage that meets or exceeds the amount for basic living needs, in line with our UN Global Compact commitment.\n\nThe cost of living is understandably a concern for many of our employees as inflation remains high in many countries. While we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, we do not make changes to pay based solely on inflation \u2013 we also consider factors such as our competitive position, business needs and our EPIC and Living Wage commitments. Historically, our approach has led to salary increases in many countries above the local rate of inflation.\n\nOur Employee Share Purchase Plan enables employees to voluntarily purchase Novartis shares at a discounted price. The plan currently covers employees in North America (the US, Puerto Rico and Canada), with rollout to employees in other countries and regions scheduled over the next several years. All permanent employees are eligible for the plan (with certain exceptions).\n\nEngaging employees through volunteering\n\nOur Novartis Engagement & Volunteering Program empowers employees to make a difference through giving, community initiatives and skills-based volunteering with civil society partners in a chosen community. Over time, the program has evolved into a sustainable, skills-based model that generates impact for employees, Novartis, partners and society in areas that are aligned with our strategy and purpose.\n\nWe signed a new partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, while also providing support for those affected by the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn 2022 we signed new partnerships with organizations such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, while also providing support for those affected by the war in Ukraine (see page 61).

Internally, we are investing to build a strong data, digital and IT foundation for our own systems and processes \u2013 spanning everything from R&D and operations to product management and commercial activities. We are also using data science and technology to better meet the needs of customers and patients. As part of our overall strategy, we focus on priority projects that can be scaled globally and have the highest impact.\n\nSupporting innovation\n\nOur business produces enormous amounts of data, not only from research and development but also from production, distribution and marketing. We are taking advantage of this resource to improve productivity and spur innovation.\n\nOur Generative Chemistry project, for example, helps scientists at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research (NIBR) speed up the discovery of new high-value medicines. The process for researching and developing new medicines is complex, requiring the evaluation of hundreds of thousands of candidate compounds before a project reaches the clinical trial stage. We use machine learning algorithms to identify new patterns and suggest molecules to synthesize in the lab.\n\nMore than 250 specialist data scientists are embedded within NIBR project teams to help optimize and accelerate key aspects of our research.\n\nThis is just one example of how data science has become a pillar of our drug discovery efforts. More than 250 specialist data scientists are embedded within NIBR project teams to help optimize and accelerate key aspects of our research \u2013 from target identification and dose modeling to refining predictive biomarkers. In pre-clinical and early clinical work, for instance, NIBR data scientists created a neural network model to assess brain penetration potential for several neurological drug candidates. Using biodistribution data, they also developed a method to accurately predict how doses of an investigational radioligand therapy would be absorbed by key radiosensitive organs.\n\nIn our drug development operations, our Nerve Live program collects data from dozens of domains to generate insights, drive efficiency and reduce risk \u2013 for example to keep clinical trials running smoothly or helping with oversight of drug safety operations for our portfolio. The program has been successfully scaled after launching five years ago, with thousands of employees now using Nerve Live\u2019s decision-support tools to help them in their daily work.\n\nAndromeda, which was launched in 2020 and is now used by more than 10,000 employees, is a solution that covers the entire portfolio of Novartis, spanning research, development and our commercial operations. It uses advanced analytics and simulations to accelerate portfolio decision-making, helping to drive efficiency and contributing to the value of our pipeline.\n\nOur data42 platform gives our data scientists and researchers access to 2 million patient records, enabling researchers to analyze millions of robust privacy controls for patient data, it has become a pillar of our drug discovery efforts.

Backed by robust privacy controls for patient data, it enables researchers to analyze millions of health records, genomic data, adverse events and other information to generate hypotheses and test them through statistical modeling. Today, this data analytics platform is being used by over 1,100 Novartis data scientists and researchers.\n\nIn 2020, we launched a common platform for data and analytics aimed at maximizing the value of our data. Today, this platform is used at scale across the company to generate reliable data in a standard format and enable insights using AI and machine learning. Ultimately, this will speed up decision-making, increase efficiency and provide new insights.\n\nThrough our Lean Digital Core (LDC) program, we are replacing our legacy enterprise resource planning systems with a single system across our organization. This will simplify how we work and allow for easier and more cost-effective upgrades. We anticipate cost savings of approximately USD 500 million as a result.\nUsing AI to tackle heart disease\n\nIn 2022, the Novartis Foundation launched the AI4HealthyCities program, with more planned for 2023. Insights from the program could increase understanding about heart disease and how heart health could be improved by tackling the underlying social, economic or environmental causes. These include everything from healthy diet and physical exercise to education, exposure to pollution and access to decent housing.\n\nThe Novartis Foundation seeks to improve the health of low-income populations around the world and reduce health inequity by using data and population health management.\n\nFor more information, see www.novartisfoundation.org\n\n2 cities\n\nNew York and Lisbon are the first cities to take part in the Novartis Foundation\u2019s AI4HealthyCities program, with more planned for 2023.\n\nDiana Wong Ramos, a stroke survivor and patient advocate, holds an information session for patients at a hospital in Lisbon, Portugal.\nBuild trust with society\n\nWe aim to increase access to our medicines for underserved populations around the world, and follow high standards of ethical behavior wherever we operate. In 2022, we pledged investment for research into new medicines for neglected tropical diseases while advancing partnerships to enhance cardiovascular and cancer care for patients across the world.\n\nAccess to medicines\n\nDespite recent medical advances, billions of people around the world still lack access to the medicines and healthcare services they need.\n\nMany of the most acute issues are in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which face the dual burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as well as fragile and under-resourced health systems. But the COVID-19 pandemic also exposed deep health inequities in higher-income countries, where barriers to access are often linked to structural health system issues as well as demographic, social and economic challenges.\n\nAt Novartis, we not only discover and develop new medicines, but also aim to make them available to as many people as possible. We have been committed to increasing access to medicines for decades. Over the years, we have moved from a donations-based approach to one that employs a combination of access models for more sustainable social impact. In 2022, our access programs and initiatives reached 54.6 million patients worldwide.\n\nOur targets\n\nTo reinforce our commitment to access, we set key targets covering both our strategic innovative therapies and our global health priorities (see page 55).\n\nIn 2022, we achieved a 26% increase in patients reached with our strategic innovative therapies in LMICs compared with the previous year, representing an increase of 119% since 2019. Patients reached through our global health programs declined by 5% from the prior year, driven by increased availability of generic alternatives due to the easing of COVID-19-related supply disruptions in the wider industry. However, we remain on track to meet our target as the latest figure represents an increase of 107% from 2019.\n\nOur approach\n\nTo achieve our targets, we work to improve access for patients across the lifecycle of our medicines. We are guided by the Novartis Access Principles, which commit us to systematically integrate access strategies in how we research, develop and deliver our new medicines.\n\nThese strategies include innovative approaches to affordability, such as sustainable business models and value-based pricing, as well as efforts to adapt medicines for different patient groups or for diverse environments. While affordability and availability remain key issues, the ability of health systems to effectively use innovative medicines is another critical barrier to access.\n\nIn 2022, we pledged additional funding for research into new medicines for neglected tropical diseases. We became the first pharmaceutical company to contribute an innovative medicine to the\n\nNovartis Access Principles\n\nWe systematically integrate access strategies into how we research, develop and deliver our new medicines globally.\n\nAffordability: We aim to price our medicines based on the value they deliver to patients, healthcare systems and society. We also use innovative access and pricing models, taking into account local income levels, affordability barriers and economic realities.\n\nR&D: We systematically assess our product portfolio against the unmet needs of underserved populations. We aim to make our products available in countries with the highest burden of the disease to be treated.\n\nSystem strengthening: We work with governments and other partners to lower barriers to healthcare delivery and support quality patient care in areas where we can have the greatest impact.\nNovartis global health priorities\n\nOur work on global health is aligned with our overall efforts to expand access to our medicines. We follow an integrated approach for the elimination or control of four diseases where there has been market failure and little investment in research and development:\n\n**Sickle cell disease (SCD)**\n\nEvery day, an estimated 1,000 children are born in Africa with SCD. Of those, more than half die before their fifth birthday due to preventable complications from the illness.\n\nThe Novartis Africa Sickle Cell Disease program is a holistic approach to diagnose, treat and manage the disease in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We are engaging with eight countries in SSA. This includes full partnership agreements with three countries, with more planned over the next several years. See page 59 for details of our integrated approach to tackling SCD.\n\n**Malaria**\n\nAccording to the WHO, there were an estimated 619,000 malaria deaths globally in 2021, despite it being a preventable and treatable disease. Novartis has been involved in the fight against malaria for decades. Since 1999, we have delivered more than one billion treatments of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to endemic countries, of which over 90% were supplied on a zero-profit basis. We are developing a new optimized dose of ACT for use in infants of less than five kilograms. In 2022, we announced our decision to proceed to Phase III clinical trials in 2023 for our lead malaria pipeline program (see page 37).\n\n**Chagas disease**\n\nChagas disease causes around 12,000 deaths a year. The disease is endemic in 21 countries, mostly in Latin America. Fewer than 1% of the six million people infected receive proper antiparasitic treatment. Starting as a parasitic disease, Chagas disease can lead to chronic heart disorders in up to 30% of patients. We are conducting a Phase IV study in patients with the cardiac form of Chagas disease in collaboration with the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute, and working to strengthen health care systems in Brazil, Mexico, and Bolivia. Novartis is also a member of the Global Chagas Disease Coalition.\n\n**Leprosy**\n\nCurrently, an estimated 2-3 million people live with leprosy. Over the past 30 years, great strides have been made in treating the disease through multidrug therapy (MDT). Since 2000, Novartis donations of MDT packs have treated over 7.5 million people. In 2020, we renewed our pledge to continue donations for another five years. We are also working with the WHO on a process to reliably replenish the stocks of medicines used to treat leprosy.\n\n**Research and development**\n\nWe assess our R&D work against the needs of underserved populations and integrate access considerations and evidence needs for LMICs early into the development process. We begin anticipating potential access barriers and enablers for our investigational medicines at the end of Phase II development. To further improve access, we do not file or enforce patents in low-income countries.\n\nIn 2022, we pledged to invest USD 250 million for research into new medicines for malaria and neglected tropical diseases such as Chagas disease and leishmaniasis (see page 34).\nBeyond our investigational therapies, we also adapt existing medicines for different patient groups or for diverse environments. In 2022, we launched a pediatric friendly formulation of hydroxyurea, a treatment for sickle cell disease, in Ghana, with plans to expand to Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.\n\n**Affordability and availability**\n\nWe use a combination of approaches to make our medicines affordable for patients across the income pyramid.\n\nIn high-income and upper-middle income countries, we seek to price our medicines based on the value they deliver to patients, health systems and society. We believe this approach incentivizes health systems to focus on interventions that deliver the most effective, efficient and sustainable outcomes. For more information on our position on value-based pricing, please see our corporate website.\n\nIn LMICs, we implement tiered pricing for launches of our strategic innovative therapies, taking income levels, local affordability barriers and economic realities into consideration. This approach supports governments in responding to unmet medical needs in a way that is sustainable for our business. All our medicine launches in 2022 included a tiered pricing strategy for LMICs.\n\nAdditionally, we have support programs to help patients facing financial hardship or other barriers to access, as well as to support education on disease awareness and adherence to medication. These include Novartis Patient Assistance in the US and Novartis Oncology Access for patients across Asia and the Middle East. Overall, we have around 800 active patient support programs in 80 countries.\n\nTo drive access in SSA, we launched a dedicated unit in 2019 to focus on reaching more patients in the region across several therapeutic areas through sustainable business models. We deliver our portfolio of medicines across the income pyramid in SSA and have established an ecosystem of local partners to drive impact and reach more patients across income levels.\n\nOur Novartis Access program, an innovative business model to increase access to on- and off-patent medicines for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in countries across Africa, Latin America and Asia, evolved in 2022. The aim of this was to address the complexity of health system barriers that, along with a lack of access to high-quality and affordable medicines, contribute to poor health outcomes. To further drive impact and integrate the approach into our core business, we increased the flexibility of the product offering, broadened distribution to additional channels, and took steps to address health system needs that may inhibit access to these medicines.\n\nOur Novartis Access program, an innovative business model to increase access to on- and off-patent medicines for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in countries across Africa, Latin America and Asia, evolved in 2022.

To further drive impact and integrate the approach into our core business, we increased the flexibility of the product offering, broadened distribution to additional channels, and took steps to address health system needs that may inhibit access to these medicines.\n\nThe agreement allows the Medicines Patent Pool, a United Nations-backed public health organization, to sub-license nilotinib to generic manufacturers who will be able to manufacture and commercialize the medicine in those markets. The approach has been tested successfully with communicable diseases like HIV and COVID-19, but never in cancer. We hope this will provide a new model for the sector to increase access to life-changing medicines for non-communicable diseases.\n\nWe know that making medicines available is only one part of the journey to improve access. Collaboration with our ATOM Coalition partners in diagnostics, training and delivery will also be critical to help meet our collective goal of bringing the most appropriate medical interventions to everyone who needs them.\n\n---\n\n1 Marketed by Novartis under the brand name Tasigna\n\n---\n\n**Breaking new ground in access to innovative cancer medicines**\n\nNovartis is a founding member of the Access to Oncology Medicines (ATOM) Coalition, a public-private partnership that aims to build a new sustainable access model for cancer medicines. Novartis is the first pharmaceutical company to contribute an innovative medicine to ATOM. We granted a \u201cfreedom to operate\u201d license ahead of patent expiry in multiple LMICs for nilotinib, which was developed to treat chronic myeloid leukemia.\n\nThe agreement allows the Medicines Patent Pool, a United Nations-backed public health organization, to sub-license nilotinib to generic manufacturers who will be able to manufacture and commercialize the medicine in those markets. The approach has been tested successfully with communicable diseases like HIV and COVID-19, but never in cancer. We hope this will provide a new model for the sector to increase access to life-changing medicines for non-communicable diseases.\n\nWe know that making medicines available is only one part of the journey to improve access. Collaboration with our ATOM Coalition partners in diagnostics, training and delivery will also be critical to help meet our collective goal of bringing the most appropriate medical interventions to everyone who needs them.\nAt the same time, we continued to expand our emerging market brands (EMB) program, adding 29 new EMBs including for Leqvia, Pigray and Kesimpta. We also continue to narrow or eliminate the time lag between launches in Europe and in other countries. For instance, during 2022 we launched an EMB of our lung cancer treatment Tabrecta in Malaysia two months before the first EU launch in Germany.\n\nThrough our donation programs, we help broaden access to patients in LMICs with serious or life-threatening illnesses and those affected by natural disasters and extreme poverty. In 2022, we expanded our 20-year collaboration with the Max Foundation to include donations of our Kisqali and Femara medicines for breast cancer \u2013 a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in LMICs. The expanded program, known as CancerPathtoCare\u2122, will also continue to support patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and other rare cancers through donations of our Glivec, Tasigna and Scemblix medicines.\n\nWe expanded our 20-year collaboration with the Max Foundation to include donations of our Kisqali and Femara medicines for breast cancer. For over 30 years, Novartis has been working with partners around the world to eliminate leprosy. Since 2000, through the WHO, Novartis has donated more than 70 million blister packs of multidrug therapy (MDT) valued at approximately USD 124 million, helping to treat more than 7.5 million leprosy patients worldwide. Our agreement with the WHO also covers donations of triclabendazole for the treatment of fascioliasis, a disease caused by parasites known as liver fluke. Novartis has been donating the medicine to the WHO since 2005.\n\n**Health system strengthening**\n\nBarriers to access are complex: while affordability and availability remain key issues, the ability of health systems to effectively use innovative medicines is another barrier. We work closely with governments and civil society to strengthen health systems and lower barriers to healthcare delivery.\n\nWe follow a systematic, enterprise-wide approach. Health system strengthening (HSS) is being integrated throughout our core business planning processes, and all Novartis launches have a global HSS strategy for local adaptation.\n\nCurrent projects include reducing delays in breast cancer diagnosis due to COVID-19 backlogs through clinic optimization in Portugal and helping to establish heart failure clinics in 14 LMICs to reduce the high re-admission rates many patients face following heart failure. Our Avoidable Blindness program executed partnerships across four countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on strengthening policy, primary care integration and referral networks \u2013 all critical elements of equitable access to eye health services.\n\nWe supported key partnerships during the year. These included the Collaborative on Strategic Public Private Partnerships for Cardiovascular Health with Harvard University and the World Economic Forum to strengthen the capacity of health systems to detect, treat and ultimately prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which accounts for over 85% of all cardiovascular disease deaths. In the US, we expanded our Beacon of Hope program, which funds research at historically Black medical colleges into how to tackle disparities endemic in the US health system (see page 58).\n\nThe data table below covers HSS activities in LMICs managed by the Novartis Global Health organization. In 2022, we increased the number of people reached despite fewer points of service provision and standalone awareness events, due primarily to our focus on maximizing the efficiency of these activities. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in some countries also limited the number of community engagements during the year.\n\n| Novartis Global Health Health system strengthening performance indicators\u00b9 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Health educators trained | 4,477 | 2,827 | 671 |\n| Healthcare providers trained | 12,035 | 10,719 | 12,648 |\n| Points of service provision\u00b2 | 1,313 | 4,365 | 5,902 |\n| People reached at points of service provision | 979,755 | 360,356 | 486,642 |\n| Awareness events held | 297,700 | 412,872 | 424,878 |\n| People reached at awareness events | 12,960,922 | 9,678,360 | 8,048,360 |\n\n\u00b9 Data reflect the full scope of access approaches managed by the Novartis Global Health organization.\n\u00b2 Points of service provision include facilities and health camps where healthcare services are provided.\nAct4Biosimilars\nIn May, our Sandoz division founded and sponsored a new global initiative called Act4Biosimilars to increase access to biologics. Bringing together patient advocates, healthcare professionals and industry leaders, Act4Biosimilars is aimed at increasing global adoption of biosimilars by at least 30% in more than 30 countries by 2030. Biosimilars tend to cost much less than branded medicines, which makes them more affordable for those on low incomes. Sandoz already systematically considers access when pricing generics and biosimilars, typically entering a market at below the reference price. Sandoz medicines reached approximately 450 million patients worldwide in 2022.\n\nFighting antimicrobial resistance\nThe WHO has declared antimicrobial resistance (AMR) \u2013 when antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become ineffective and infections become increasingly difficult or impossible to treat \u2013 a major public health threat. AMR causes nearly 1.3 million deaths a year, as many as HIV and malaria combined, according to the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance report published in 2022.\n\nNovartis supports the global scientific consensus that overuse, underuse and misuse of antimicrobial medicines all contribute to the spread of AMR, and that a balanced approach is needed. Our approach to tackling AMR focuses on four areas:\n\n- **Prevention** responsible manufacturing to prevent antibiotics entering the environment\n- **Access** strengthening access to high-quality, affordable antibiotics\n- **Responsible use** ensuring prescription of the right antibiotic at the right dose for the right duration\n- **Innovation** investing in the development of new, more effective antibiotics through the AMR Action Fund\n\nIn 2022, Sandoz announced an additional EUR 50 million investment to support increased manufacturing capacity for finished dosage form penicillin at the Kundl, Austria, manufacturing site. Sandoz also extended its collaboration agreement with Ares Genetics to develop a digital platform for development and life-cycle management of antibiotics until 2025. In addition, Novartis is part of the AMR Action Fund, which plans to invest more than USD 1 billion in the clinical development of new antibiotics.\n\nSandoz announced an additional EUR 50 million investment to support increased manufacturing capacity for finished dosage form penicillin\n\nNovartis is partnering with the Ecumenical Pharmaceutical Network (EPN) to support faith-based organizations in SSA combat AMR through prevention, education and awareness. See our corporate website for more information about our work on AMR.\n\nTaking action on health equity in the US\nIn 2022, we committed an additional USD 17.7 million to our Beacon of Hope initiative in the US to tackle racial health disparities, bringing total funding to more than USD 50 million over ten years. Beacon of Hope aims to address factors that disproportionately affect health in underserved communities by increasing diversity in clinical trials, reversing bias in data standards, and enabling the next generation of African American, Black and Hispanic healthcare leaders.\n\nThe additional funds are being used to create Clinical Trial Centers of Excellence at three historically Black medical colleges and universities (HBCUs) \u2013 Howard University College of Medicine, Meharry Medical College and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science \u2013 in addition to the centers at the Morehouse School of Medicine, which were announced in 2021.\n\nAs part of the initiative, NIBR is offering a 10-week paid summer fellowship program for students at HBCUs to learn drug discovery, data analytics and clinical research practices, with the goal of training up to 250 scientific leaders over 10 years.\n\nBeacon of Hope brings together Novartis, the Novartis US Foundation, the Morehouse School of Medicine, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, Coursera, the National Medical Association, and 26 HBCUs in the US. In addition, two other global pharmaceutical companies joined the collaboration in 2022.\n\nFor more information, see our corporate website\nIntegrated access in action: sickle cell disease (SCD) in Africa\n\nThe Novartis Africa Sickle Cell program provides a blueprint for how to address access barriers across the continuum of care. Launched in 2019, the program takes an end-to-end approach to tackling the disease in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), from research into new medicines to efforts to break down barriers to diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\u2022 R&D: While the genetic cause of SCD has been known for decades, it\u2019s only recently that the medical world has gained the tools to potentially fix the errant gene that causes the disease. Together with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we are exploring the possibility of a novel in vivo gene therapy for SCD, offering hope of a cure for the disease. We envision developing an accessible therapy that could potentially be administered directly to the patient through a single injection. This contrasts with complex procedures associated with ex vivo gene therapies that require cells to be extracted from the body and are individually manufactured before treatment.\n\n\u2022 Availability of existing treatments: We continue to roll out hydroxyurea across the continent. The medicine has been shown to improve health outcomes among those living with SCD. In 2022, we launched a pediatric-friendly formulation of hydroxyurea in Ghana, with plans to expand to Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda in 2023. Building on that, we are assessing the opportunity to introduce innovative therapies for SCD.\n\n\u2022 Health system strengthening: We are working to strengthen early intervention in SCD treatment, particularly among young children. Our new partnership with the American Society of Hematology, agreed in 2022, will improve screening and diagnosis at health institutions in seven SSA countries.\n\n80%\n\nSCD patients\nAn estimated 80% of people with SCD live in sub-Saharan Africa. The Novartis Africa Sickle Cell Program works with governments to tackle the disease.\nMaintaining high ethical standards\n\nOur industry faces ethical questions and decisions every day on issues such as patient care, data use, and access to medicines. To guide us in these decisions, we have a comprehensive Code of Ethics \u2013 developed together with our employees and experts in behavioral science \u2013 that applies to all employees, as well as a suite of internal policies and controls. We also provide online tools, such as the Ethical Decision Explorer, to help employees navigate ethical dilemmas, in addition to training on ethics to employees at all levels of the company. In 2022, 98% of employees completed training on our Code of Ethics.\n\nIn addition, our ethical standards are built into our relations with business partners via our Third Party Code and we have programs in place to combat falsified medicines and monitor potential adverse effects of our medicines (see page 44).\n\nWe also work through industry codes, including PhRMA\u2019s Code on Interactions with Health Care Professionals and the IFPMA\u2019s Code on Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices, as well through as regional and local industry associations. The UN Convention Against Corruption and the OECD\u2019s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officers inform our policies and programs. We are a signatory to the UN Global Compact and we are working to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. You can read more about our approach to ethics, risk and compliance on pages 68-75.\n\nEncouraging employees to speak up\n\nThe Novartis SpeakUp Office, our grievance mechanism, enables employees and external parties to raise concerns about potential misconduct while being protected against retaliation.\n\nIn 2022, a total of 2,569 complaints of alleged misconduct, resulting in 2,400 cases with 2,871 allegations, were received and handled. Of the total cases, 385 (16%) were classified as central matters (higher-risk cases) warranting further investigation. Lower-risk matters are addressed or investigated locally. The investigated central matter allegations resulted in 116 dismissals or resignations, and in 62 written warnings. Other remedial actions such as training, coaching and implementing new controls were also used when deemed appropriate.\n\nThe increase in cases from the prior year was primarily due to matters related to data security as a result of enhanced protective measures and monitoring systems the company put in place. These measures included a campaign on data loss prevention to support regular mandatory trainings on information management, data privacy and data use. The increase in reported cases indicates that our SpeakUp program and related awareness activities are having an impact in encouraging people to raise their concerns.\n\nMeasuring our ethical climate\n\nIn 2022, we conducted our second global ethics survey to gather data on ethical behavior and the ethical climate across our company. We received more than 33,000 responses. We use insights from the survey to drive conversations at the global and local levels and take action where needed. For example, in 2022 we further clarified our commitment to protect employees who speak up from disciplinary action in a new standalone policy on non-retaliation, which was created in consultation with our human rights and employee relations teams. We intend to continue running the global ethics survey in 2023.\n\nEthical business practices performance indicators\n\n| Code of Ethics | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| Employees trained and certified (%) | 98 | 98 | 98 |\n| Misconduct cases reported | 385 | 174 | 157 |\n| Total allegations | 544 | 296 | 284 |\n| Allegations substantiated | 257 | 137 | 118 |\n| Dismissals and resignations related to misconduct | 116 | 62 | 101 |\n\n1 Active Novartis employees with an email address, trained via e-learning.\n2 A central matter applies to issues where a senior leader or manager is involved, or issues which may have a potentially disruptive reputational impact. Also, central matters can involve sexual harassment, discrimination, retaliation and issues with significant financial impact.\n3 The number of misconduct cases, allegations reported/substantiated, and dismissals/resignations may change year-on-year as matters may be reassessed in the course of the case life cycle. As a result, we may restate data from previous years.\n4 The number of allegations is higher than the actual number of cases as a case can have more than one allegation.\n5 \u201cAllegations substantiated\u201d and \u201ctotal allegations substantiated per category\u201d may include allegations from previous years. Whereas \u201cmisconduct cases reported\u201d and \u201ctotal allegations\u201d refer to allegations reported within each calendar year.\nHelping those affected by the war in Ukraine\n\nWe provided support to refugees and those displaced by the war in Ukraine. We also provided essential medical supplies and continued to deliver our medicines to patients who need them.\n\n- Since the start of the war, we have provided 21 million doses of medicine to those in Ukraine and to refugees in border areas, worth more than USD 33 million.\n\n- We donated USD 3 million to organizations working with refugees and displaced people, including Save the Children, the International Rescue Committee and the Red Cross, and allocated a further USD 1 million to patient organizations supporting displaced refugees.\n\n- Novartis employees donated more than USD 2.2 million to non-profit organizations through employee giving. Beyond donations, our employees also volunteered their time and skills and opened their homes to host refugees.\n\nTo protect employees, we suspended our operations in Ukraine in March. After studying safety protocols in the country, we resumed business operations remotely in June to help the country restore some basic critical business processes. We continue to review and adapt our activities to the prevailing security and safety situation. Protecting employees remains our priority.\n\nIn Russia, we took measures to freeze capital investment, advertising and other promotional activities. We also stopped new clinical trials and suspended enrollments in existing trials. We continue, however, to supply vital medicines to patients in Russia. We will keep measures affecting both Ukraine and Russia under review.\nGovernance\n\nIn this section\n\n- Corporate governance \u2192 p. 63\n- Ethics, risk and compliance \u2192 p. 68\n- Compensation Report \u2192 p. 76\n\nAnnie Hilliard, an employee in our Global Drug Development organization.\nCorporate governance\n\nStrong corporate governance is vital for the effective management of our business and is the cornerstone of trust in Novartis.

Our CEO chairs the IMB. Other representatives from Novartis senior management are among its core and extended membership.\n\nOur Sustainability & ESG Office, part of our Global Health and Sustainability organization, is responsible for embedding ESG management across our business. ESG issues are integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management approach. In addition, we have internal policies and controls to minimize risk in areas such as human rights, health and safety, anti-bribery and corruption. Stakeholder engagement also plays an important role in helping us identify possible ESG risks and opportunities (see page 21). For example, we have an independent Bioethics Advisory Committee, which advises management on ethical issues related to our research, drug development and access programs.\n\nThe table on this page provides an overview of the governance of our four most material topics, identified as part of our materiality assessment (see page 15).\n\n| Topic                        | Board committee(s)                                      | ECN/management                  |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Patient health and safety    | \u2022 Audit and Compliance Committee                        | \u2022 President, Operations          |\n|                              |                                                         | \u2022 President, GDD                 |\n| Innovation                   | \u2022 Science & Technology Committee                       | \u2022 President, NIBR                |\n|                              |                                                         | \u2022 President, GDD                 |\n|                              |                                                         | \u2022 Innovation Management Board    |\n| Access                       | \u2022 Governance, Sustainability and Nomination Committee   | \u2022 President, Innovative Medicines US |\n|                              |                                                         | \u2022 President, Innovative Medicines International |\n|                              |                                                         | \u2022 President, Global Health & Sustainability |\n|                              |                                                         | \u2022 ESG Committee                  |\n| Ethical business practices   | \u2022 Audit and Compliance Committee                        | \u2022 Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Officer |\n|                              | \u2022 Risk Committee                                        | \u2022 ESG Committee                  |\nOur Board of Directors\n\nJoerg Reinhardt, Ph.D.\nBoard Chair\nNationality: German\nYear of birth: 1956\nBoard member since: 2013\nCommittees: 1\n\nSimon Moroney, D.Phil\nVice-Chair\nNationality: German/New Zealander\nYear of birth: 1959\nBoard member since: 2020\nCommittees: 2\n\nPatrice Bula\nLead Independent Director\nNationality: Swiss\nYear of birth: 1956\nBoard member since: 2019\nCommittees: 3\n\nNancy C.

In addition, we work to uphold human rights and reduce social and environmental risk throughout our value chain. To support our approach, we encourage employees to take personal accountability for their decisions.\n\nOur Code of Ethics\nThe healthcare industry deals with ethical questions every day \u2013 for example on affordability and access to medicines, or how to protect patients\u2019 sensitive personal data. Many of these issues go to the heart of our strategy as a focused medicines company.\n\nOur approach to managing ethical decisions is based on our Code of Ethics, which applies to all Novartis employees. This Code sets out commitments in 23 areas that are applicable across our business, codifying who we are, what we stand for and the principles to which we hold ourselves accountable. We conduct an annual global ethics survey to measure our progress in embedding our Code across our organization (see page 60).\n\nManaging risk\nOur strategy as a focused medicines company creates both opportunities and risks for our business. Many of these risks relate to our business environment, such as the uncertainty inherent in research and development or increasing societal expectations of our industry. Effectively managing these risks is critical to achieving our strategic goals and creating value for our stakeholders and society.\n\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is designed to generate a holistic view of risks for the company and drive a culture of smart risk-taking. It ensures that effective risk management is integrated into our significant activities and helps us better understand our risk exposure by providing increased transparency for leaders on how our key threats and opportunities are evolving throughout the year.\n\nOur annual ERM process results in the Novartis Risk Compass, which helps our Board of Directors and senior management focus on key risks and align strategy with risk exposure.\n\nRisks are grouped into three categories: strategic, operational and emerging. Risks are rated on a four-point scale \u2013 very high, high, medium, low \u2013 based on their likelihood and potential impact, using the \u2018most-probable worst-case\u2019 scenario for each risk as a reference point. Once key risks are identified, mitigation plans are created.\n\nNovartis Risk Compass\n\nStrategic risks\nare the most consequential to our ability to execute our strategy or achieve our business objectives.\n\nOperational risks\nrelate to internal processes or systems, employee errors or external events.\n\nEmerging risks\nrequire close monitoring and have the potential to become strategic or operational risks.\n\nAwareness topics\nare longer-term trending topics that have the potential to become new risks.\nIn addition to the three categories described above, we identify separate \u201cawareness topics\u201d that we believe may become new risks over time. Awareness topics are not rated. We regularly monitor risks and revise our assessments, if necessary.\n\nRisk governance\nThe effectiveness of risk management depends on its integration into the governance of the organization, including strategy-setting and decision-making. This requires involvement and support from management and governance bodies at different levels of the company:\n\n\u2022 The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the risk management system and processes within Novartis. Together with senior management, this body revises the prioritization of risks, the risk portfolio and actions implemented by management, and performs ad hoc reviews of key risk areas.\n\n\u2022 The ECN regularly assesses risks and fosters a culture of risk awareness, in line with the Novartis Values and Behaviors and the Novartis Code of Ethics. The overall ERM process is the responsibility of the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Officer. The CEO reviews and validates the annual Novartis risk portfolio, while members of the ECN are appointed as risk owners for relevant strategic risks.\n\n\u2022 These bodies are supported by the Risk & Resilience organization, which is part of the Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) function and manages the ERM process, as well as risk leaders from key markets and functions.\n\nRisks in 2022\nOur risk portfolio in 2022 comprises 16 risks. Of these, six are categorized as strategic, seven as operational and the remaining three as emerging. In addition, we have identified two awareness topics.\n\nChanges in our external environment have exacerbated some risks and given rise to new ones\n\nWhile the majority of risks remain the same as in 2021, changes in our external environment over the past year \u2013 such as the war in Ukraine and an increasingly negative global macroeconomic outlook \u2013 have exacerbated some risks and given rise to new ones. In addition, the decisions to spin off our Sandoz Division and transform our organizational structure have influenced our risk portfolio due to the significant nature of these changes.\nNovartis 2022 risk portfolio\nThe table below sets out our full risk portfolio for 2022. Please see the following page for more details on our six strategic risks.\n\nStrategic risks\n- **Key products and commercial priorities**\n  Failure to deliver key commercial priorities and successfully launch new products\n- **Research and development**\n  Failure to successfully prioritize, integrate and execute our research and development programs for new products or new indications for existing products, given our focus on innovative medicines\n- **Pricing, reimbursement and access**\n  Pricing and reimbursement pressure, including pricing transparency and access to healthcare\n- **Alliances, acquisitions and divestments**\n  Failure to identify, execute, and/or realize the expected benefits from our external business opportunities\n- **Strategic transformations**\n  Failure to meet organizational transformation programs objectives and/or unintended adverse impacts on our business\n- **Environmental, social and governance matters**\n  Failure to meet environmental, social and governance expectations\n- **Third-party management**\n  Failure to maintain adequate governance and oversight over third-party relationships, and failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory or other obligations\n- **Legal, ethics and compliance**\n  Challenges posed by evolving legal and regulatory requirements and societal expectations regarding ethical behavior\n- **Manufacturing and product quality**\n  Inability to ensure proper controls in product development and product manufacturing, and failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards\n- **Supply chain**\n  Inability to maintain continuity of product supply\n\nEmerging risks\n- **Geopolitical developments**\n  Impact of geo- and socio-political threats\n- **Macroeconomic developments**\n  Impact of macroeconomic developments\n- **Climate change**\n  Impact of climate change and increased risk of major natural disasters\n\nOperational risks\n- **Cybersecurity and IT systems**\n  Cybersecurity breaches, data loss, and catastrophic loss of IT systems\n- **Fragmented IT landscape and strategic technology programs implementation**\n  Failure to address fragmented business processes, unclear data ownership, and IT applications and infrastructure nearing their end-of-life may disrupt our core business processes\n- **Talent management**\n  Inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified individuals in key roles and markets\n- **Third-party management**\n  Failure to maintain adequate governance and oversight over third-party relationships, and failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory or other obligations\n- **Legal, ethics and compliance**\n  Challenges posed by evolving legal and regulatory requirements and societal expectations regarding ethical behavior\n- **Manufacturing and product quality**\n  Inability to ensure proper controls in product development and product manufacturing, and failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards\n- **Supply chain**\n  Inability to maintain continuity of product supply\n\nAwareness topics\n- **Antimicrobial resistance and pandemics**\n  Rise of antimicrobial resistance could potentially create future pandemics and impact the performance of certain Novartis products (e.g., oncology)\n- **Falsified medicines**\n  Impact of falsified medicines on patient safety, and reputational and financial harm to Novartis and our products\n**Strategic risks in focus**\n\nThe table below provides an overview of our six strategic risks. Further information on our risk portfolio can also be found in the Novartis Annual Report.\n\n| Risk rating: | Very high | High | Medium | Low |\n|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-----|\n\n### Deliver high-value medicines\n\n- **Key products and commercial priorities**\n  - Failure to deliver key commercial priorities and successfully launch new products\n  - Our ability to grow our business depends on the commercial success of key products. Their success could be impacted by a number of factors, including pressure from new or existing competitive products; changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals; unexpected side effects or safety signals; supply chain issues or other product shortages; pricing pressures; regulatory proceedings; changes in labeling; loss of intellectual property protection; and global pandemics.\n  - **Actions**\n    - We are focusing our commercial strategy on eight priority brands / launch assets across five core therapeutic areas, as well as four priority geographies (US, Germany, China, Japan).\n    - We also continue to evolve our customer engagement model to combine traditional face-to-face visits with virtual engagements with healthcare professionals. We are similarly changing our approach to partnering with healthcare systems, payers and other healthcare providers.\n\n### Research and development\n\n- **Research and development**\n  - Failure to successfully prioritize, integrate and execute our research and development programs to develop new products or new indications for existing products, given our focus on innovative medicines\n  - We engage in costly, lengthy and uncertain R&D activities, both independently and in collaboration with third parties, to identify and develop new products and new indications for existing products. Failure can occur at any point, including after substantial investment. New products must undergo intensive preclinical and clinical testing. Further, regulatory authorities continue to establish new and increasingly rigorous requirements for approval and reimbursement. The post-approval regulatory burden has also increased.\n  - **Actions**\n    - As with our commercial strategy, we have clear priorities in R&D. We focus on five technology platforms: two established platforms (chemistry and chemical biology; biotherapeutics) plus three advanced platforms (RNA therapy; radioligand therapy; gene and cell therapy).\n    - We seek to enter into agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and with academic and other institutions to develop new medicines.\n    - We are also accelerating the use of data science and digital technology to make the drug discovery and development process more efficient and effective.\n\n### Embed operational excellence\n\n- **Alliances, acquisitions and divestments**\n  - Failure to identify, execute, and/or realize the expected benefits from our external business opportunities\n  - As part of our strategy, we acquire and divest products or entire businesses, and enter into strategic alliances and collaborations. This strategy depends in part on our ability to identify strategic opportunities, value them appropriately and competitively and close transactions with third parties. Efforts to develop and market acquired products, to integrate acquired businesses or to achieve expected synergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations. Also, our strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties may not achieve their intended goals and objectives.\n  - **Actions**\n    - We established a new Strategy and Growth function to help drive our growth strategy end-to-end, including establishing an enterprise-level business development and M&A strategy to help identify external opportunities that align with our strategy.\n    - We are also enhancing our due diligence approach, for example by strengthening risk assessments in areas such as advanced therapies.\n### Strategic risks in focus (continued)\n\n| Risk | Context | Actions |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| **Embed operational excellence** | | |\n| Strategic transformations | Failure to meet organizational transformation programs objectives and/or unintended adverse impacts on our business | \u2022 We established a dedicated transformation team for Transforming for Growth, which reports to our Executive Committee, while also putting in place measures to help employees and leaders manage through this significant reorganization of our business. \u2022 Ahead of the proposed Sandoz spin-off, we are working to strengthen Sandoz\u2019s capabilities in functions that are currently shared and begin the separation of function- country- or site-level dynamics. Sandoz is also considering plans to strengthen its development and manufacturing capabilities. |\n| Pricing, reimbursement and access | Pricing and reimbursement pressure, including pricing transparency and access to healthcare | \u2022 We are increasing efforts to enable patient access through innovative pricing and access initiatives in the US, Europe and other markets, including contract structures such as pay-over-time and outcome-based agreements. \u2022 We also continue to execute against access-to-medicine and global health targets. These targets are backed by a sustainability-linked bond, which embeds them into the core of our business operations. |\n| Environmental, social and governance matters | An inability to successfully perform on ESG matters may have negative effects on our recruitment and retention of employees, as well as on our operations, financial results, reputation, and/or share price. Examples include failing to meet our access-to-medicines commitments or ensuring that third parties in our value chain comply with ESG requirements. We may also fail to meet evolving ESG due diligence and reporting regulations. | \u2022 We regularly review our ESG strategic roadmap to ensure commitments are on track and latest developments are incorporated. We also monitor ESG regulatory changes and set up internal governance and processes to be compliant with regulatory requirements. |\nThird-party risk assessments\nWe established a third-party risk management (TPRM) framework in 2019 to help identify and manage risks when interacting with third parties. In 2022, we extended our TPRM program to perform risk assessments on wholesalers and distributors in addition to vendors and suppliers.\n\nOur TPRM framework is supported by our Third Party Code, which we recently updated to specify human rights due diligence and environmental sustainability expectations from third parties. We have also introduced guides to help procurement teams buy more of our supplies from certified sources.\n\nNovartis is a member of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI). Our Third Party Code is consistent with the PSCI\u2019s principles for responsible supply chain management.\n\nComplying with laws, regulations and controls\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry. Making sure we comply with laws and regulations is important to secure the trust of both regulators and the wider public.\n\nWe have a comprehensive compliance management system, developed in line with external standards (e.g., those issued by the OECD), which that helps us to prevent, detect and correct systemic misconduct.\n\nThe aim of this system is to ensure compliance not only with laws and regulations, but also with our internal policies and controls. In 2022, we conducted a review of our Compliance Evaluation Program, supported by an external non-profit organization focused on governance and anti-corruption.\n\nWe conducted a review of our Compliance Evaluation Program, supported by an external non-profit organization focused on governance and anti-corruption.\n\nWe work to detect and prevent misconduct. Where evidence of misconduct is found, we take swift and appropriate action. Our programs are supported by our SpeakUp Office, which allows employees and external parties to raise concerns about potential misconduct in confidence (see page 60).\n\nAnti-bribery policies and practices\nNovartis does not tolerate any form of bribery and/or corruption. Our Anti-Bribery Policy, Professional Practices Policy and Conflict of Interest Policy outline our expectations for all employees. We also clearly set out our standards in our Code of Ethics. Bribery risks in our supply chain are addressed by our Third Party Code and Anti-Bribery Third Party Guideline. The Third Party Code is an integral part of every supplier contract.\n\nWorking with Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), we helped develop a reporting standard on anti-bribery for the pharmaceuticals industry. The resulting expectation document issued by NBIM, which is based on principles such as the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, formed the basis of our first dedicated anti-bribery report published in early 2022. We plan to report on a regular basis.\n\nInternal Audit\nInternal Audit assists the Board of Directors and the ECN by providing independent assurance and advice on the effectiveness, efficiency and adequacy of processes and controls that support Novartis in achieving its strategy, managing major risks, and ensuring compliance with applicable policies, laws and regulations. To ensure its independence, our Internal Audit sits outside the ERC function; it works according to an audit plan approved by the Board\u2019s Audit and Compliance Committee. During 2022, Internal Audit carried out 53 audits, reviews and advisories relating to both our own operations and our suppliers. These audits include the review of ethical standards.\n\nProduct quality and patient safety\nWe have extensive policies, systems and controls in place to protect patient safety. These relate primarily to two areas: product quality and pharmacovigilance.\n\nTo ensure product quality, we maintain a robust quality management system for our medicines in full compliance with requirements from health authorities and other regulators. We have manufacturing licenses and relevant ISO and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificates for all our manufacturing, medical devices, supply and distribution operations, issued after inspections by regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), the World Health Organization (WHO) and Swissmedic.\n\nWe conduct thorough investigations whenever there is any evidence of deviation from these standards, or if we detect failures in our manufacturing processes. We conduct comprehensive quality and safety training for employees and third parties. We require all employees involved in manufacturing, supply and distribution to attend at least two annual training sessions on quality standards. All third parties providing services or goods manufactured to good practice standards are required to have\ntheir own quality assurance and formal training process. Furthermore, we are regularly audited on our training procedures, and training is also included in our audits for third parties.\n\nFollowing regulatory guidance (including FDA and EMA recommendations) we monitor chemical and biological medicines for impurities, including those classified as \u201cprobable human carcinogens\u201d (e.g., nitrosoamines). Any product identified with a potential risk undergoes further evaluation and risk management, with results submitted to the relevant health authorities as required.\n\nPharmacovigilance involves monitoring the safety of our drugs both during development and in the commercial setting. This enables us to detect any adverse effects that may emerge at any stage of the drug\u2019s lifecycle. In accordance with international regulations, we share periodic safety reports with the relevant health authorities and maintain current benefit-risk analyses for our medicines.\n\nWe also support education programs for patients, providers and pharmacists, and provide regular training to employees in adverse event reporting. For some medicines, post-approval studies may be conducted to collect more data on possible long-term or adverse effects.\n\nHealth, safety & environment (HSE)\nWe work to maintain a safe and healthy environment at all our facilities. To achieve this, we have an integrated HSE management system. Every year, we carry out a comprehensive assessment to ensure compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and internal standards. We also have extensive health and safety programs that cover a broad spectrum of work related hazards.\n\nTo monitor progress, we set annual HSE targets, investigate all safety incidents, including \u201cnear-misses\u201d and encourage employees to report all incidents. Novartis sites are subject to inspection by health, safety and environmental regulators. In addition, we require sites to carry out regular self-assessments; a dedicated team conducts more focused audits on a 3- to 5-year cycle.\n\nWe are also committed to protecting contractors\u2019 safety: we assess outside contractors and make sure they have the right resources and procedures in place to be working at our sites. Supplier contracts include specific occupational health and safety criteria.\n\nCybersecurity\nAs reflected in our Code of Ethics, we are committed to the responsible use of information in our business processes, including personal information, and we adhere to appropriate standards to achieve this purpose. We have robust governance, processes and policies in place to ensure the security of our data and IT systems. All Novartis employees participate in annual mandatory training in information management.\n\nTo prevent IT system interruptions, Novartis has risk-based services continuity and systems recovery plans in place, which are tested periodically. We also conduct ongoing internal vulnerability analyses (including simulated hacking) as well as external testing via a third-party to ensure the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls. We require employees to report IT security incidents to a Cyber Security Operations Center that operates 24 hours a day. Novartis has not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents in the three years through 2022.\n\nAnimal welfare\nAnimal research lies behind many recent medical advances, including cancer treatments, vaccines and drugs to treat neurological diseases such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and depression. It is a currently unavoidable part of medical science. Animal studies are also often required by health regulators to prove that medicines are safe and effective for humans.\n\nOur animal research is governed by our Animal Welfare Policy, updated in 2022. This policy applies to all Novartis-sponsored studies, whether internal or external. As part of the policy, we are committed to applying the 3 R\u2019s rule \u2013 to reduce the number of animals needed in our studies, to refine study methods to minimize animals\u2019 distress or pain and to replace animal studies with alternative options where possible. See page 84 for our 2022 animal research performance indicators.\n\nIn 2022, we recognized several award-winning projects that significantly advanced the 3Rs at Novartis, including one that replaced mice in rheumatoid arthritis studies with a novel human cell based in-vitro assay. We also launched a grant program to prospectively fund research projects to validate new alternatives to animal research, reduce animal numbers and improve the animals\u2019 experience.\n\nTransparency and disclosure\nWe attach great importance to being transparent about our activities and performance. In addition to our Annual Report and this Novartis in Society Integrated Report, we publish many of our internal policies, codes and guidelines, and provide quarterly updates on our financial and ESG performance. We also disclose our progress against the UN Global Compact principles, as well as our payments to healthcare professionals and patient organizations, our political contributions and the results from our clinical trials. For more information, see our corporate website.\nUpholding our commitment to human rights\n\nOver the years, we have worked to embed human rights in our business. In our Code of Ethics, we pledge to conduct our business in a manner that respects the rights and dignity of all people. In 2022, we updated our Human Rights Commitment Statement.\n\nTo ensure we live up to our commitments, we have a human rights management program, based on three pillars, aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights:\n\nDue diligence\nWe conduct ongoing human rights due diligence across our business. We also make sure we have policies and management systems in place to support our commitments. Our suppliers and partners are regularly assessed and monitored against our Third Party Code and we collaborate with industry partners like the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative on topic-specific supply chain projects such as conflict minerals and child labor.\n\nIn 2022, we carried out an assessment of our global health program to assess compliance with international human rights standards. This assessment applied to specific functions within our global health program and was based on the Human Rights Guidelines for Pharmaceutical Companies in relation to Access to Medicines, issued in 2008 by the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health. In addition, our human rights team worked with our pharmaceutical export business to conduct human rights risk assessments covering high-risk countries.\n\nEmpowerment\nWe work to provide access to effective grievance mechanisms for those who may have been affected by human rights abuses, primarily through our SpeakUp office. In 2023, we plan to update our SpeakUp reporting tool to make the process of reporting a human rights grievance more accessible to third parties. We provide targeted training for employees in high-risk functions or locations \u2013 and raise awareness throughout the Group regarding the importance of respecting human rights.\n\nEngagement\nWe engage with stakeholders to listen to their concerns, take collective action where it makes sense and regularly report our performance on human rights. We share actions taken to address the potential risk of conflict minerals, forced labor, child labor and other salient risks in our global supply chain through our annual UK and Australia Joint Modern Slavery Statement and other public disclosures.\n\nOur human rights priorities\nIn 2022, we updated and streamlined our Human Rights Commitment Statement to focus on four priority areas, each aligned with the Novartis Code of Ethics. Below, we provide links to key policies and commitments relevant to each focus area.\n\nRight to health\nKey topics\n- Access to medicine; clinical trials; product quality; falsified medicines\n\nLabor rights\nKey topics\n- Freedom of association and collective bargaining; non-discrimination and equal treatment in employment; occupational health and safety; living wages; child labor; modern slavery including forced labor and human trafficking\n\nHuman rights & the environment\nKey topics\n- Environmental impact of our operations and products over their lifecycle\n\nTechnology & human rights\nKey topics\n- Responsible use of personal information; ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI)\nCompensation Report\n\nIn 2022, we continued to make progress in transforming Novartis into a focused medicines company. Feedback received prior to our last Annual General Meeting (AGM) indicated that shareholders agreed our compensation system is aligned with our purpose, strategy and culture.\n\n2022 performance highlights\n\n2022 was a year of solid financial performance, with growth in constant currencies across sales, core profits and core margins. The performance was driven by key in-market and launch products, including Entresto, Kesimpta, Kisqali, Cosentyx, and Pluvicto.\n\nIn April 2022, we announced the introduction of a new organizational model designed to support our next phase of innovation, growth, and productivity as a focused medicines company. The restructuring is expected to deliver USD 1.5 billion in savings by 2024.\n\nThere was nonetheless an immediate impact on Operating Income that, along with unfavorable fair value adjustments on financial assets, impacted operating income growth.\n\nWe continued to deliver high value medicines to patients with 23 approvals, including a novel radioligand therapy, Pluvicto, and 24 submissions across our priority geographies. We also had several important clinical data readouts, for example, iptacopan for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. However, we also had disappointments as some clinical trials of experimental compounds did not meet their primary endpoints, including ACZ885 (canakinumab) in lung cancer, and UNR844 in presbyopia.\n\nNovartis also continued to deliver on its commitments to broaden access to medicines and tackle major global health challenges. We pledged further investment for research into malaria and neglected tropical diseases, increased access to our innovative medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and formed new collaborations to strengthen healthcare systems.\n\nPerformance against incentive targets, combined with base salary and other benefits and pension, resulted in 2022 total realized compensation for the CEO of CHF 8 452 176. This is a reduction of 24.7% compared with 2021, driven mainly by lower payout of the Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP). More details on CEO performance and compensation are available in the Compensation Report of our 2022 Annual Report.\n\nChanges to Executive Committee compensation system and disclosures\n\nDuring the year, we reviewed our Executive Committee compensation system, with the aim of simplification and increased transparency.\n\nEffective the 2022-2024 cycle of the LTTP, we strengthened the assessment of research and early development performance under the Innovation metrics, to ensure that targets are focused more directly on activities that create long-term value. From this cycle, the Science & Technology Committee sets targets that take into account the expected Net Present Value (eNPV) of programs transitioning to late-stage clinical development.\n\nEffective from performance year 2023, we will remove \u201cShare of Peers\u201d as a financial performance measure for the Annual Incentive plan. The weighting of the three remaining financial measures, Group Net Sales, Group Operating Income and Group Free Cash Flow, will be 40%, 30% and 30%, respectively. In addition, we will fold division specific financial targets, where applicable, into individual strategic objectives (40% weighting) of the related Executive Committee member. All Executive Committee members will be evaluated, with a 60% weighting, against the performance of Group financial measures mentioned above.\n\nDuring the year, we announced our intention to separate our Sandoz generics and biosimilars Division into a new publicly traded standalone company, by way of a 100% spin-off, subject to approval of the Novartis AG Board of Directors and shareholders. Based on the planned completion of the spin-off in 2023, the Compensation Committee made some initial decisions on the 2023 compensation elements related to the spin-off.\n\nAlignment with company strategy\n\nIn 2022 we refocused our strategy to deliver high-value medicines that alleviate society\u2019s greatest disease burdens through technology leadership in research and development, and novel access approaches. In line with this refocused strategy, we updated our strategic priorities to target innovation power, sales growth, delivering both margin and total shareholder returns, and sector leadership in material ESG factors.\n\nThis resulted in some enhancements to the Annual Incentive plan and LTTP plans as explained earlier.\nExecutive Committee compensation governance\n\nA summary of the compensation decision authorization levels within the parameters set by the AGM is shown below, along with an overview of the risk management principles.\n\nDecision on\nCompensation of CEO\nCompensation of other Executive Committee members\n\nDecision-making authority\nBoard of Directors\nCompensation Committee\n\nExecutive Committee compensation risk management principles\n\n- Rigorous performance management process, with approval of targets and evaluation of performance for the CEO by the Board of Directors\n- Balanced mix of short-term and long-term variable compensation elements\n- Values and Behaviors are a key component of the Annual Incentive and are embedded in our culture\n- Performance-based Long-Term Incentives, with three-year cycles\n- All variable compensation is capped at 200% of target\n- Contractual notice period of 12 months\n- Post-contractual non-compete period is limited to a maximum of 12 months from the end of employment.\n\nResulting compensation, if applicable, will not exceed the average annual compensation (annual base salary plus Annual Incentive) of the previous three financial years\n\n- Good and bad leaver provisions apply to the variable compensation of leavers\n- No severance payments or change-of-control clauses\n- Clawback and malus principles apply to all elements of variable compensation\n- Share ownership requirements; no hedging or pledging of Novartis share ownership\n- No loans granted to current or former members of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors or to \u201cpersons closely linked\u201d to them\n\nShareholder votes on compensation at the 2023 AGM\n\nIn line with our Articles of Incorporation, at the 2023 AGM, shareholders will be asked to approve the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the members of the Executive Committee of CHF 90 000 000. This is lower than the prior term, primarily due to the stepping down of the CEO, Sandoz from the Executive Committee. For the Board of Directors, the maximum aggregate amount proposed to shareholders is CHF 8 750 000, which is slightly higher than the prior term, due to change in committee memberships. Full details on compensation for the CEO, other Executive Committee members and Board members can be found in the Compensation Report of our 2022 Annual Report, and in the compensation votes at the 2023 AGM.\n\n2022 Executive Committee compensation system\n\n| Purpose | 2022 fixed pay and benefits | Performance-related variable pay |\n|---------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Annual base salary | Pension and other benefits | 2022 Annual Incentive | Long-Term Incentive awards cycle 2022-2024LTPP |\n| Reflects responsibilities, experience and skill sets | Provide retirement and risk insurance (tailored to local market practices/regulations) | Rewards for performance against short-term financial and strategic objectives, and Values and Behaviors | Rewards long-term shareholder value creation and innovation in line with our strategy |\n| Form of payment | Cash | Country/individual-specific and aligned with other employees | 50% cash 50% equity deferred for three years | Equity, vesting following a three-year performance period |\n| Performance measures | Balanced scorecard comprising: Financial measures (60%) Strategic objectives (40%) | Net sales growth CAGR (25%) Core operating income CAGR (25%) Innovation (25%) Relative TSR (25%) |\n\n1 LTPP = Long-Term Performance Plan\n2 Executive Committee members may elect to receive more of their Annual Incentive in equity instead of cash\n3 The Annual Incentive deferred in equity is granted under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)\n4 Financial Measures are Group Net Sales (30%), Group Operating Income (30%), Group Free Cash Flow as a % of sales (cc) (20%) and Share of peers (20%)\n5 Strategic objectives are aligned with our transformation to become a pure-play Innovative Medicines company: Strategy, Growth / Launches, Innovation, Operational excellence, Build trust with society\n2022 total realized compensation for the CEO\n\nThe 2022 total realized compensation for the CEO was CHF 8 452 176.

Any significant deviations are restated the following year in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report. Previous years\u2019 data reflect only actuals.\n\n2 Using location based emission factors published in 2014 or 2015 depending on geography and data source. We plan to update the emission factors in the future reporting periods with the latest available ones.\n\n3 Scope 3 emissions are reported in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Only the Scope 3 categories which are assured are separately disclosed. The total scope 3 emissions figure includes all categories. Our Scope 3 emissions increased by 20% from the prior year, driven primarily by purchased goods and services and, to a smaller extent, by increased business travel following the pandemic.\n\n4 Data includes indirect emissions from air travel, train travel, car rentals and hotel stays. The indicator is calculated using 12-month actual data.\n\n5 For all disclosed years, the calculation for our inhalers is based on the IPCC 2015 GHG emission factor and assumes all hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gas used in the production process is released upon use of the inhalers. We are in the process of determining if a portion of this gas is released during manufacturing and whether a portion also remains in the inhaler after its use, which would therefore need to be excluded from our calculation of Scope 3 use of sold products emissions.\n\n6 Carbon offsets are based on data provided by third parties. For further details, please see our Reporting Criteria document.\n\n7 Water withdrawals includes water used for cooling and returned to the environment without the need for additional treatment.\n\n8 Water consumption and non-contact water withdrawn from the environment for cooling and returned directly to the environment after use.\n\n9 Water discharged via treatment and water lost.\n### People performance indicators\n\n|                      | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Headcount            | 105,533| 108,514| 110,738|\n| Full-time equivalent positions | 101,703| 104,323| 105,794|\n| Percentage turnover: voluntary / overall | 9 / 15 | 8 / 13 | 5 / 10 |\n| Percentage of hires: internal / external | 66 / 34 | 62 / 38 | 58 / 42 |\n| Annual learning hours per employee | 42.4 | 52.1 | 53.2 |\n| Representation of nationalities: overall / management | 147 / 118 | 143 / 115 | 142 / 113 |\n| Employees represented by an employee representative body or covered by a collective bargaining agreement (%) | 48 | 47 | 46 |\n| Health and safety |        |        |        |\n| Lost-time injury and illness rate (per 200,000 hours worked): Novartis employees / Third-party personnel | 0.16 / 0.20 | 0.14 / 0.05 | 0.12 / 0.20 |\n| Total recordable case rate (per 200,000 hours worked): Novartis employees / Third-party personnel | 0.31 / 0.28 | 0.25 / 0.13 | 0.23 / 0.30 |\n| Fatalities: Novartis employees / Third-party personnel / Contractors | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 / 1 |\n\n### Gender representation by contract type (female / male)\n\n|                      | Permanent | Temporary | Full-time | Part-time |\n|----------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Overall headcount    | 52,311 / 49,549 | 53,509 / 51,497 | 53,729 / 53,096 | 6,753 / 1,175 |\n| Hires                | 52 / 48   | 52 / 47   | 52 / 48   | 52 / 48   |\n| Promotions           | 53 / 47   | 55 / 45   | 52 / 48   | 52 / 48   |\n| Overall turnover     | 49 / 51   | 50 / 50   | 49 / 51   | 49 / 51   |\n| Voluntary turnover   | 51 / 49   | 51 / 49   | 52 / 48   | 52 / 48   |\n| Board of Directors   | 31 / 69   | 31 / 69   | 29 / 71   | 29 / 71   |\n| Executive Committee of Novartis | 27 / 73 | 25 / 75 | 23 / 77 |\n| Novartis Top Leaders | 39 / 61 | 38 / 62 | 33 / 67 |\n| Senior management    | 41 / 59   | 39 / 61   | 39 / 61   | 39 / 61   |\n| Middle management    | 48 / 52   | 47 / 53   | 46 / 54   | 46 / 54   |\n| Overall management   | 47 / 53   | 46 / 54   | 45 / 55   | 45 / 55   |\n| Entry-level positions | 52 / 48   | 52 / 48   | 52 / 48   | 52 / 48   |\n| Revenue-producing roles | 51 / 49   | 51 / 49   | 50 / 50   | 50 / 50   |\n| STEM roles           | 46 / 54   | 46 / 54   | 46 / 54   | 46 / 54   |\n\n1. \"Headcount\" reflects the total number of employees in payroll systems. \"Full-time equivalent positions\" adjusts headcount for employees working less than 100%.\n2.

This is our third TCFD disclosure. It is based on updated TCFD guidelines published in October 2021.\n\nWe are committed to reducing the impact of our business activities on the environment, and have set clear targets covering climate, water and waste (see page 45). These targets relate to both our own manufacturing operations and to our wider supply chain.\n\nIn 2022, we carried out an in-depth assessment of the company\u2019s climate-related risks and opportunities. The results form the basis of this disclosure. While we believe our business strategy is well-adapted to current climate risks and opportunities, we continue to work to improve our approach where possible, particularly as it relates to risk management and governance of climate issues.\n\nGovernance\n\nBoard oversight\n\nUltimate responsibility for our climate strategy lies with the Novartis Board of Directors. The Board has delegated primary responsibility for climate strategy and governance, including progress on metrics and targets, to the Governance, Sustainability and Nomination Committee (GSNC). Climate-related topics were on the agenda at two out of three GSNC meetings in 2022.\n\nIn addition, several other Board committees have responsibilities that relate to environmental sustainability. These are:\n\n- The Audit and Compliance Committee, which is responsible for internal controls and all compliance processes and procedures, including those related to climate\n- The Risk Committee, which oversees the company\u2019s risk management (including both physical and transition climate risk)\n- The Compensation Committee, which determines how environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues (including climate) should be incorporated into compensation plans for members of the Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN)\n\nSeveral Novartis Board members have competence on ESG issues. We assess Board-level competence through criteria that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Whether the respective Board member has comprehensive/expert understanding of ESG-related issues\n- Whether the respective Board member has led a company/organization to adopt ESG goals or shape external sustainability leadership initiatives\n\nFor more information on the composition and expertise of the Novartis Board, please see our Annual Report.\n\nManagement oversight\n\nThe ECN, led by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), is responsible for implementing the company\u2019s climate strategy.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is included in the CEO\u2019s Balanced Scorecard under the \u201cStrategic Objectives\u201d component, which is weighted at 40% of the annual incentive. Performance measures for other members of the ECN include emissions reductions targets where relevant for their area of responsibility.\n\nThe CEO chairs our ESG Committee, which oversees the company\u2019s ESG strategy, including progress against our climate, water and waste targets. The ESG Committee meets every two months. Climate is included as a specific agenda item at least once a year. In 2022, it was discussed two times.\n\nMain governance and management bodies with climate-related responsibilities\n\n| Board of Directors |\n|---------------------|\n| Governance, Sustainability and Nomination Committee |\n| Audit and Compliance Committee |\n| Risk Committee |\n| Compensation Committee |\n\n| Executive Committee |\n|---------------------|\n| ESG Committee |\n\n| Other governance / management bodies |\n|-------------------------------------|\n| Sustainability & ESG Office |\n| Environmental Sustainability Operations |\n| ESG Council |\nStrategy\nClimate issues are integrated into our strategy, business model and financial planning process. Environmental sustainability spans two of our strategic priorities: \u2018Embed operational excellence\u2019 and \u2018Build trust with society\u2019. It is also included in our materiality assessment (see pages 15, 41 and 54).\n\nFinancial planning\nAll capital projects over USD 20 million require a formal Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to determine possible impact on the climate and/or company exposure to climate risks. We also apply an internal shadow carbon price of USD 100 per metric ton in our strategic decision-making and financial planning.\n\nIn 2022, Novartis deployed approximately USD 30 million in capital expenditure on environmental projects to reduce consumption of natural resources, improve energy efficiency and adopt renewable energy solutions across our operations.\n\nMaterial climate-related issues\nResults from our 2022 scenario analysis show that: a) climate change potentially presents both risks and opportunities for Novartis, and b) the company\u2019s current strategy and financial position remain resilient to the possible impact of climate change.\n\nTo conduct our analysis, we used the scenarios listed on page 91, based on input from both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). All risks and opportunities were assessed on a short-, medium- and long-term basis, in line with TCFD guidance.\n\nFinancial quantification\nWhen assessing risks, including climate-related risks, Novartis defines the financial impact as the potential loss of annual sales, trade receivables or market share according to the following thresholds: <1% (insignificant); 1\u20132% (minor); 2\u20133% (moderate); 3\u20135% (major); and >5% (severe).\n\nResults of 2022 scenario analysis\nOur scenario analysis covered eight physical risks and thirteen transition risks and/or opportunities. Only the most significant items were carried forward for further quantitative analysis. These are set out in the table on page 91. For purposes of comparison, impact is shown for the 2030 and 2050 time horizons only. Please note the physical and transition risks identified below all fall within the \u201cinsignificant\u201d level of financial impact (i.e., less than 1% loss of annual sales, trade receivables or market share).\nPhysical and transition risks and opportunities\n\n| Physical risks | Impact | Description | Potential 2030 financial impact | Potential 2050 financial impact | Risk treatment |\n|----------------|--------|-------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|\n| Tropical cyclones | Insignificant | Potential financial implications through interruptions at our sites (e.g., property damage, equipment repair) or via disruption to transport networks (e.g., delaying delivery of raw materials to sites or finished products) | USD 16\u201318 million | USD 25\u201343 million | We have a resilient supply chain with a broad geographic footprint, dual supply for key products and adequate inventory level / stock policies. Our sites have physical infrastructure mitigation in place (e.g., shelters, flood defenses, building insulation, back-up generators), supported by administrative controls (e.g., emergency response / business continuity plans). We are also implementing energy efficiency initiatives across our operations to reduce energy demand and transition to renewable energy solutions. |\n| Flooding | Insignificant | Flooding could lead to disruption or delays in manufacturing processes (e.g. through property and infrastructure damage or repairs, fresh-water availability etc.) and interruptions in product distribution. | USD 70\u201380 million | USD 35\u201395 million | |\n| Extreme heat | Insignificant | Extreme heat conditions could increase operating costs by augmenting our cooling needs and energy consumption to ensure processes and equipment operate efficiently. | USD 6\u201310 million | USD 9\u201319 million | |\n| Water stress and drought | Insignificant | Water stress and drought could potentially impact our operating costs through higher water prices, and/or a need to source water from alternative suppliers. This may also impact revenue by reducing efficiency or causing a shutdown of water-intensive production processes. | USD 250 000 \u2013 940 000 | USD 470 000 \u2013 1 million | |\n\nTransition risks\n\n| Carbon price | Insignificant | Carbon prices are likely to increase further across major operating countries. This may increase our future operating costs. | USD 4\u201322 million in additional annual carbon costs | USD 5\u201353 million in additional annual carbon costs | Reducing emissions as part of our environmental sustainability targets will limit exposure to carbon pricing. |\n| Net-zero healthcare systems | Insignificant | Requirements to rapidly decarbonize may drive up capital expenditure (while failure to decarbonize may threaten the company\u2019s license to operate in certain countries). | USD 26\u2013873 million in annual revenue classified as \u201cat risk\u201d (i.e. related to markets with more ambitious net-zero targets than Novartis). | For the most part, our net-zero targets are aligned with health system goals. In our key markets our net-zero commitment will require us to decarbonize at a faster rate than required. \u201cAt risk\u201d revenues relate to a relatively small, low-footprint region. |\n\nTransition opportunities\n\n| Circular economy | Insignificant | We may face potential increases in operating costs driven by higher plastic prices / taxation imposed by countries. However, this is also an opportunity for Novartis to switch away from \u201cvirgin\u201d (non-recycled plastic) | USD 21\u201360 million in savings (from avoidance of increasing plastic costs) | USD 10\u2013120 million in savings (from avoidance of increasing plastic costs) | We will reduce exposure to prices as we move closer to our plastic-neutral goal, particularly in advanced economies where plastic is being phased out or replaced by recycled materials. Risk will be entirely mitigated by 2030 if company goals are met. |\n| Energy source | Insignificant | Impact of rising fossil fuel prices may be avoided by switching to more sustainable sources (particularly in replacing natural gas for heating with electricity). | USD 70\u2013230 million in annual savings (by reducing proportional use of natural gas for heating) | USD 80\u2013320 million in annual savings (by reducing proportional use of natural gas for heating) | We will minimize exposure by increasing our use of clean energy in heating and other infrastructure investments. |\n\n1 With the exception of water stress/drought \u2013 see footnote 2 below.\n2 Based on water scarcity data from the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Water Risk Filter. Risk assessed using different scenarios to those used for other physical risks to reflect the WWF data, although these may be equated approximately to scenarios 1 and 2 above. WWF financial ranges use RCP4.5 / SSP1-2.6 and RCP6.0 / SSP3-7.0.\n3 Markets have been categorized as \u201cat risk\u201d where regional and/or healthcare system targets are ahead of the Novartis target. Other regions have been categorized as \u201cneutral\u201d where the Novartis target is equal to or ahead of regional targets.\n4 Savings are derived assuming low and moderate growth scenarios in terms of projected increase in plastic costs.\nRisk management\n\nIn addition to our scenario analysis, climate risks are also in scope of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, which ensures a consistent approach to risk assessment and treatment across our business.\n\nRisks are identified through annual risk workshops and periodically reviewed. Our Sustainability & ESG Office takes part in this process to ensure environmental and climate risks are considered.\n\nThe outcomes are consolidated into the Novartis Risk Compass, which is a categorization and visualization of Novartis top risks by grouping them into Strategic Risks, Operational Risks, Emerging Risks and Awareness Topics, comprising a selection of the top three items for each category (see page 68). Climate is captured primarily under the following two risks:\n\n- Environmental, social and governance matters: a strategic risk defined as failure to meet environmental, social and governance expectations\n- Climate change: an emerging risk defined as impact of climate change and increased risk of major natural disasters\n\nRisks are assessed based on their potential impact and likelihood over the next five years, using the \u201cmost probable worst-case\u201d scenario as a reference point. These are the same criteria used for other enterprise risks.\n\nTo ensure alignment, our scenario analysis applies similar definitions for likelihood and impact. Senior managers across the business also provide input as part of our risk assessment.\n\nWe take measures to avoid risks or reduce the risk exposure, where appropriate; these measures are determined by our risk appetite. We continually monitor risk and, if needed, periodically review our assessment and/or measures to be taken. The table below summarizes the outcome of our 2022 risk assessment for our two climate-related risks.\n\nIn 2023, we will explore ways of further integrating the scenario analysis into our ERM framework.\n\nMetrics & targets\n\nWe use various climate-related metrics and set targets relating to carbon emissions, water consumption, waste, and plastic use. See page 82 for a list of our metrics and page 45 for details of our environmental sustainability targets.\n\n| Risk Description | Risk category | Risk rating | Risk treatment |\n|------------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Environmental, social and governance issues | Failure to meet environmental, social and governance expectations | Strategic | High | See page 72 for details |\n| Climate change | Impact of climate change and increased risk of major natural disasters | Emerging | Medium | We have prepared global incident plans for specific types of events (e.g., earthquakes, flooding) which are available for local adaptation and specification. |\nIndependent limited assurance report on selected Sustainability Information of Novartis AG\n\nTo the Board of Directors of Novartis AG\n\nWe have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on Novartis AG\u2019s (hereinafter \u201cNovartis\u201d) Sustainability Information on pages 81 to 84 in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report (the Report) for the year ended 31 December 2022 (hereinafter \u201cSustainability Information\u201d).\n\nOur assurance engagement does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods or to any other information included in the Report, the Novartis Annual Report, Form 20-F or displayed elsewhere on Novartis\u2019s website for the current year or for previous periods unless otherwise indicated, including any images, audio files or embedded videos.\n\nOur Limited Assurance Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed as described under the \u2018Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our assurance conclusion\u2019 and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Information in the Report for the year ended 31 December 2022 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria as included here (Reporting Criteria).\n\nWe do not express an assurance conclusion on information in respect of earlier periods or to any other information included in the Report, the Novartis Annual Report or Form 20-F, including any images, audio files or embedded videos.\n\nUnderstanding how Novartis has Prepared the Sustainability Information\n\nThe Reporting Criteria have been used as criteria references for the disclosures. Consequently, the Sustainability Information needs to be read and understood together with the Reporting Criteria.\n\nWe do not express an assurance conclusion on information in respect of earlier periods or to any other information included in the Report, the Novartis Annual Report or Form 20-F, including any images, audio files or embedded videos.\n\nInherent Limitations in Preparing the Sustainability Information\n\nDue to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure, it is possible that errors or irregularities may occur in disclosures of the Sustainability Information and not be detected. Our engagement is not designed to detect all internal control weaknesses in the preparation of the Sustainability Information because the engagement was not performed on a continuous basis throughout the period and the assurance procedures performed were on a test basis.\n\nThe nature of non-financial information; the absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw; and the methods and precision used to determine non-financial information, allow for different, but acceptable evaluation and measurement techniques and can result in materially different measurements, affecting comparability between entities and over time. The Reporting Criteria have been developed to assist Novartis in its purpose in producing the Report. As a result, the Sustainability Information may not be suitable for another purpose.\n\nThe Report includes a deduction from Novartis\u2019s emissions for the year ended 31 December 2022 of 30.7 (\u2018000 tCO\u2082 emissions) relating to offsets. The offsets are derived from Novartis\u2019s forestry projects and Novartis has engaged an external provider to calculate the amount of CO\u2082 emissions sequestered. We have performed procedures as to whether these sequestered CO\u2082 emissions relate to the current period, and whether the description of them in the Report and Reporting Criteria is inconsistent with the related documentation and calculations from the external provider. We have not, however, performed any procedures regarding the assumptions used in the calculation methodology for these offsets by the external provider, and express no opinion about whether the offsets have resulted, or will result, in a reduction of 30.7 (\u2018000 tCO\u2082 emissions).\n\nNovartis\u2019s Responsibilities\n\nThe Board of Directors of Novartis is responsible for:\n\n- Selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting the Sustainability Information;\n- The preparation of the Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;\n- Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and\n- The contents and statements contained within the Report and the Reporting Criteria.\nOur Responsibilities\nWe are responsible for:\n- Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;\n- Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and\n- Reporting our opinion to the Board of Directors of Novartis.\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Sustainability Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Sustainability Information as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\nProfessional Standards Applied\nWe performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions information included within the Sustainability Information, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.\n\nOur Independence and Quality Control\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior.\n\nOur firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur work was carried out by an independent and multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners and sustainability experts. We remain solely responsible for our assurance conclusion.\n\nSummary of the Work we Performed as the Basis for our Assurance Conclusion\nWe are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material misstatement of the Sustainability Information is likely to arise. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. Carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Sustainability Information included, among others:\n- Inquiries of employees responsible for the determination and consolidation, as well as the implementation of internal control procedures, regarding the Sustainability Information;\n- Inspection of selected internal and external documents to determine whether qualitative and quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accurate and balanced manner;\n- Assessment of the data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the reliability of the reported data on a test basis and through testing of selected calculations;\n- Analytical assessment of the data and trends of the Sustainability Information included in the scope of the limited assurance engagement;\n- Considering the appropriateness of the carbon conversion factor calculations and other unit conversion factor calculations used by reference to widely recognised and established conversion factors; and\n- Reading the narrative within the Report with regard to the Reporting Criteria, and for consistency with our findings.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nKPMG AG\nRichard Broadbelt George Richards\nLicensed audit expert\nBasel, 31 January 2023\nAbout this report\n2022 at a glance\nChair\u2019s letter\nCEO\u2019s letter\nWHO WE ARE\nOur company\nOur medicines\nOur global operations\nOur people, culture and values\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nOur business environment\nOur material issues\nSTRATEGY AND VALUE CREATION\nOur strategy\nHow we create value\nStakeholder engagement\nMeasuring our impact\nPERFORMANCE IN 2022\nFinancial performance\nDeliver high-value medicines\nEmbed operational excellence\nStrengthen our foundations\n\u2022 Unleash the power of our people\n\u2022 Scale data science and technology\n\u2022 Build trust with society\nGOVERNANCE\nCorporate governance\nEthics, risk and compliance\nCompensation Report\nAPPENDICES\nBack cover photo: Maggie Perez, a health educator in Philadelphia, PA, checks the blood pressure of a local resident.\n\nAbbreviations\nThis report uses the following abbreviations:\n\nACT Artension-based combination therapy\nAGM Annual General Meeting of Shareholders\nAI Artificial intelligence\nAMR Antimicrobial resistance\nAPI Active pharmaceutical ingredient\nATOM Access to Oncology Medicines\nCAGR Compound annual growth rate\nCEO Chief Executive Officer\nCML Chronic myeloid leukemia\nCO\u2082 Carbon dioxide equivalent\nCVD Cardiopulmonary disease\nDEI Diversity, equity and inclusion\nDNA Deoxyribonucleic acid\nD.
