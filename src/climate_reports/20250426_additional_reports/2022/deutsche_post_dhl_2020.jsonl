Our share of this figure is 0.4%. The Group has set an ambitious target: Reduce GHG emissions to net zero by 2050 (including subcontractors, excluding offsetting).\n\n- **Material topics:** Energy efficiency and climate change, air pollution\n- **Policies\\(^2\\):** Our Environmental and Energy Policy defines measures to minimize our effects on the environment. In line with our investment policy all new acquisitions must be demonstrably more carbon efficient than existing assets\n- **Management system:** We implement our environmental standards across the Group and create a uniform framework for a \u2018green\u2019 thinking and action (based on ISO standards)\n- **Renewable energy:** Renewable energy is the primary source of electricity across the Group\n\nOur programs and partnerships support the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n---\n\n1) Source: Climate Watch, WRI (2020); 2) Environmental Policy, Investment Policy, Green Electricity Policy\nEnergy Efficiency and Climate Protection \u2013\nTwo-fold approach to reducing GHG emissions\n\nIncrease efficiency\n\u2022 Efficiency measures in vehicles, operations, buildings, network\n\u2022 Low hanging fruits already picked, further improvements become more difficult\n\nUse clean technologies\n\u2022 Substitute remaining energy demand with clean fuel alternatives such as electricity, hydrogen or synthetic fuels\n\u2022 Picking up momentum as technologies evolve\n2020 Environmental measures in geographical regions\n\nShares of renewable energy use and ISO certified sites further increased.\n\n**AMERICAS**\n- 900 vehicles with alternative drives\n- 97% electricity from renewable energy sources\n\nClimate neutral products offsetting projects\n- Aruba: Energy from wind\n- Brazil: Energy from compost\n- Chile: Electricity from waste\n- Guatemala: Water filters\n\n**EUROPE**\n- 16,200 vehicles with alternative drives\n- 93% electricity from renewable energy sources\n\n**GLOBAL**\n- 12,632 sites, of which 59% ISO certified\n  - 49% certified by ISO 14001\n  - 51% certified by ISO 50001\n  - 41% certified by both\n- ~2bn climate neutral products\n\n**OTHER**\n- 350 vehicles with alternative drives\n- 39% electricity from renewable energy sources\n\nClimate neutral products offsetting projects\n- Eritrea: Well rehabilitation\n- Lesotho: Stoves replace firewood\n\n**ASIA PACIFIC**\n- 550 vehicles with alternative drives\n- 61% electricity from renewable energy sources\n\nClimate neutral products offsetting projects\n- India: Wind power plant\n- Laos: Hydroelectric power plant\n- Vietnam: Small biogas plants\n\nClimate neutral offsetting projects\nGHG Efficiency KPI \u2013 The Carbon Efficiency Index\n\nWe measure and manage our GHG efficiency using the carbon efficiency index (CEX). Our goal is to improve the CEX to 50 index points (ip) by 2025 compared to the base year 2007. In 2020, we were able to increase efficiency by 2 ip to 37 ip. Key drivers:\n\n- Shifting airfreight volumes from passenger aircraft to our own, more efficient cargo aircraft\n- Increased volumes in our German parcel business and the international e-commerce business, which lead to improved network utilization\n- Improved efficiencies in ocean freight business\n\n**GHG Efficiency Improvement**\n\n**2020 CEX by Divisions (index points)**\n\n| Division                  | 2020 CEX |\n|---------------------------|----------|\n| Group                     | 37       |\n| Post & Parcel Germany     | 45       |\n| Express                   | 41       |\n| Global Forwarding, Freight| 30       |\n| Supply Chain              | 44       |\n| eCommerce Solutions       | 27       |\n\n**Calculation of CEX**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Efficiency of DPDHL service} = \\frac{\\text{CO}_2\\text{e from our operations including own transportation and those of subcontractors}}{\\text{Reference base of DPDHL service}}\n\\]\n\n- **Post & Parcel Germany**: CO\u2082e per liter (volume) of parcels and letters\n- **Express**: CO\u2082e per ton kilometer (TKM)\n- **Global Forwarding, Freight**: CO\u2082e per ton kilometer (TKM)\n- **Supply Chain**: CO\u2082e per m\u00b2 warehousing; per transport revenue\n- **eCommerce Solutions**: CO\u2082e per pieces\n\n**GHG Efficiency Improvement**\n\n- 2016: +30%\n- 2020: +37%\n- 2007: 0%\n- 2012: +20%\n- 2016: +30%\n- 2020 Target: +50%\n\n**2020 ESG Statbook**\nGHG Emissions \u2013 Our Footprint\n\nThe relative share of the different transportation modes to GHG emissions has been mostly stable over the years. Air (66%) and road transport (22%) are the main sources of our emissions (ocean 10%, buildings 2%). In 2020 our GHG emissions decreased slightly to 27.38 m t CO\u2082e\\(^1\\).\n\nMain drivers:\n- Air freight: Shift of volumes from passenger to own, more efficient freighter aircraft as well as the pandemic-related shortage of capacity\n- Ocean freight: Increased efficiencies in our ocean freight business\n- Road transport: Increased volumes in our national parcel and international e-commerce business\n- Buildings: Share of renewable electricity increased to 86%\n\nCalculation methodology: GHG emissions are calculated automatically via our financial systems based on GHG Protocol and other international standards\\(^2\\).\n- Compensation via offsetting not included\n- Subcontractor emissions (scope 3) are included using calculation models derived from the same standards\n\n1) Tank-to-wheel; metric ton (= 1,000kg)\n2) GHG emission calculations are based on the guidelines of GHG Protocol, GLEC, EN 16258 standard and ETS\n\nESG Presentation FY 2020 - published on March 9, 2021\nEnergy Consumption \u2013 Our fuel consumption reflects the ongoing heavy demand for transportation solutions\n\nThe total energy consumption increased by 4.5%. Air transportation increased by 5.4% while road transportation decreased by 8.0%. Consumption in buildings reduced by -0.6% mainly driven by increased using of renewable electricity.\n\n2020 Energy Consumption\nTotal (Scopes 1 and 2)\n\n- Air fleet 72%\n- Road fleet 17%\n- Buildings 11%\n\n27,383 m kWh\n\nOf which:\nFleet Energy Consumption\n\n- Kerosene 81%\n- Diesel 16%\n- Gasoline 3%\n\n24,294 m kWh\n\nOf which:\nBuildings Energy Consumption\n\n- Electricity 55% of which 86% renewable electricity\n- Natural gas 31%\n- Heating oil 6%\n- District1)/geothermal heating 6%\n- LPG 2%\n\n3,089 m kWh\n\n1) Including district cooling\n\nESG Presentation FY 2020 - published on March 9, 2021\n\n2020 ESG Statbook\nAir Pollution \u2013 Our Approach\n\nBurning fossil fuels results in local air pollutants such as mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM10), which negatively impact air quality, especially in urban areas.\n\nOur business model bears a share of this responsibility, which is why we want to minimize air pollution with zero-emission solutions such as pick-up and delivery by foot, bicycle and electric vehicle. In addition, these measures help reduce noise pollution and take some of the pressure off the parking problem in cities.\n\nZero-emission delivery in pick-up and delivery operations\n\n- Post & Parcel Germany: ~28,500 bicycles, including ~8,000 e-bikes and ~8,700 e-trikes, 4% of delivery districts by foot\n- Express - City Hub solution: ~100 cargo bikes to pick up and load pre-sorted delivery containers at central points\n\nGHG emissions savings per year\n\n- E-bike up to 5 t\\(^1\\) CO\\(_2\\)e\n- CubiCycle up to 8 t\\(^1\\) CO\\(_2\\)e\n\n\\(^1\\) Tank-to-wheel; metric ton (= 1,000kg)\nAir Pollution \u2013 Modernizing Air Fleet\n\nOur air fleet consists of 280 dedicated cargo aircraft including smaller feeder aircraft.\n\nWe are continuously modernizing our own aircraft.\n\n14 Boeing 777 freighters are gradually being brought into operation. They will generate 18% efficiency improvements and consume less fuel compared to the aircraft replaced\n\n- **27%** of our aircraft\\(^1\\) comply with the highest NOx emission standards\n- **30%** of our aircraft\\(^1\\) comply with highest noise regulation standards\n\n\\(^1\\) Without feeder aircraft.\n\n2020 ESG Statbook\n\nESG Presentation FY 2020 - published on March 9, 2021\nAir Pollution \u2013 Modernizing Road Fleet\n\nOur road fleet consists of ~106,000 vehicles:\n\n- 73% vans, 10% trucks, 17% cars\n- ~18,000 of our vehicles are equipped with alternative drive systems (equivalent to 17% of our road fleet); an increase of 32% compared to 2019\n- 15,400 e-drive systems already in operation\n\nWe continuously upgrade our conventional vehicles in accordance with the latest emissions standards.\n\n- 88% of vehicles are compliant with Euro 5 or Euro 6 standards, or were entirely emissions-free (ZEV)\n\n1) Comprises the largest vehicle fleets in areas covered by the Euro emissions classifications\n\nESG Presentation FY 2020 - published on March 9, 2021\n\n2020 ESG Statbook\nEnvironmental Products for our Customers\n\nWith our environmental products, we pass on our expertise in climate-friendly logistics processes to our customers.\n\n**Transparency through Carbon Reports**\n- Transparency on carbon footprint based on latest accounting standards\n- Baseline to evaluate carbon reduction decisions\n\n**Offsetting through Climate Neutral**\n- Certified neutralization of climate impact by investing in high-quality climate protection projects along the entire supply chain\n- All-in-service that allows the customer to focus on core business\n\n**Avoid & Reduce with Green Solutions**\n- Low-emission road freight\n- Green real estate solutions\n- Network, product and carrier management\n- Waste management and recycling (Envirosolutions)\n\nWebsite\nBest Practice Examples Air Transport \u2013 Sustainable Aviation Fuel\n\nFlights from Schiphol and San Francisco using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)\n\n- DHL Express began using SAF in regular operations for the first time from Amsterdam and San Francisco airports\n- SAF supply agreements have been signed with Shell (for Amsterdam) and Neste (for San Francisco); agreements cover the entire consumption at both airports (blending ratio >35%)\n- SAF is made from sustainably sourced, renewable waste and residue raw materials\n- In its neat form and over its lifecycle SAF reduces GHG emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuels\n\n- Reduction of GHG emissions up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuels\n- SAF use still limited to a 50% blend with conventional jet fuel by fuel standards\nBest Practice Examples Ocean Freight \u2013 Sustainable Marine Fuels\n\nSustainable marine fuels (SMF) for all Less-than-Container-Load shipments (LCL)\n\n- Customers already had the option to purchase SMF for ocean freight shipments in recent years\n- DHL Global Forwarding is now purchasing SMF for all LCL shipments - at no extra cost for the customer. For full-container load shipments, this remains an optional product for our customers\n- Transport emissions are reduced according to the mass balance principle\\(^2\\). Global Forwarding ensures that the corresponding amount of sustainable fuel is used on container ships\n\n1) Mono-nitrogen oxides (NO\\(_x\\)), particulate matter (PM\\(_{10}\\)), sulfur dioxide (SO\\(_2\\)); 2) Definition of mass balance: SMF does not have to be used on the actual vessels the shipments are transported on, as all vessels emit GHG into the same atmosphere\nBest Practice Examples Road Transport \u2013 Decarbonization of Freight transport\n\nCollaboration with customers and subcontractors in Sweden\n\n- Insetting initiative \u2018Skicka Gr\u00f6nt\u2019: Customers can support climate-friendly transportation for a small surcharge\n- Revenues will be used for financial support for subcontractors when investing in green alternatives: >200 clean vehicles have been put onto the market\n- To date, these vehicles have driven more than ~32m km, corresponding to more than 800 laps around the earth or about 40 round trips to the moon\n\nThought Leadership\n\nFind out more about insetting in the white paper \u2018Carbon Insets for Logistics\u2019 jointly developed by Smart Freight Centre and DPDHL Group.\n\n- 43% share of alternative fuels in road transport Sweden\n- Carbon efficiency increased by 45% compared to 2008 baseline\n- 32m km have been driven so far\nBest Practice Examples Road Transport \u2013 Emission-free Pick-up and Delivery \u2013 We are testing various technologies in our operations\n\nCity Hub Concept\n\nRollout Status Express \u2013 example NL\n- 14 cities in the Netherlands run on zero emissions\n- 16 city hubs across the country\n- ~100 green vehicles and ~100 cargo bikes: Cargo bike can carry 125-kg containers for inner-city deliveries\n- Positive impact of regulatory measures\n\nElectrification\n\nRollout status\n\nPost & Parcel Germany\n- 14,000 E-vehicles (vans)\n- 19,200 chargers\n- 200m km driven = 80,000 t GHG emissions avoided\n- Positive impact of regulatory measures\n\nExpress\n- ~1,500 smart chargers including load management in preparations at 46 sites and 19 countries all over Europe\n- 156 chargers successfully implemented in 9 countries\n\nTruck project at Global Forwarding, Freight Subsidy Project Freight Germany\n- Testing of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) communication with fast charging systems at Freight Germany\n- 2 to 3 distribution trucks in operations\nBest Practice Examples \u2013 Buildings\n\nPhotovoltaics\nAt one of our sites in Panama photovoltaics provide 82% of the energy required. 65 t CO\u2082e emissions have been already saved\u00b9).\n\nZero-emission facilities\n\u2022 Our site in Tampere (Finland) combines state-of-the-art photovoltaics with geothermal systems for heating and cooling\n\u2022 Our logistics center at Cologne-Bonn Airport (Germany) uses an ice energy storage system with a holding capacity of >1 million liters for heating and cooling. In combination with a heat pump and photovoltaics it\u2019s also entirely emissions free\n\n\u00b9) Savings achieved in 2019.\nOther topics \u2013 Biodiversity, natural resources, noise, waste\n\nThese topics are not considered material by us or our stakeholders, since our business model does not have a serious impact in these areas. Nevertheless we consider these issues to be socially relevant, and inform on them briefly.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n- Our sites are predominantly located in urban areas or designated industrial and commercial zones\n- Hence, our business operations generally do not have a negative impact on conservation areas or endanger protected plant or animal species\n- Our Group-wide Policy on the Usage of Liquid Biofuels also addresses biodiversity aspects in the countries where biofuels are produced\n\n**Natural Resources**\n- Paper\n  - We use only recycled paper products where these meet our technical and economic requirements\n- Water\n  - Water is mainly used by our employees for sanitary needs\n  - Maintenance or scrapping of our aircraft, road vehicles is generally the responsibility of the manufacturer or other third-party providers\n\n**Noise Pollution**\n- Management teams at Group sites located in or near residential areas work closely with residents and other stakeholders to ensure that any noise pollution we cause is kept to an acceptable minimum\n- Increased use of electric vehicles for pick-up and delivery and modernization of our air fleet is also helping to reduce noise pollution\n\n**Waste & Recycling**\n- We try to avoid waste whenever possible and take increasing advantage of digitalization\n- We support recycling, contributing to the circular economy\n- Our contracts for maintenance and disposal include explicit requirements for compliance with environmentally friendly practices\n\n**External initiatives:** UN Convention on Biological Diversity, United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce, Pro Recycling Paper Germany\n\nESG Presentation FY 2020 - published on March 9, 2021\nContents\n\n1 ESG Approach\n   Strategy\n   UN Global Compact\n   UN Sustainability Development Goals\n   Stakeholders\n   Materiality\n   ESG Ratings\n\n2 Environment\n   Our Approach\n   Material Topics\n   Best Practice Examples\n   Other topics\n\n3 Social\n   Our Approach\n   Material Topics\n   \u2022 Employee Engagement\n   \u2022 Human Rights\n   \u2022 Occupational Health & Safety\n   \u2022 Employee Development\n   Diversity & Inclusion\n   Corporate Citizenship\n\n4 Governance\n   ESG Responsibilities & Committees\n   Material Topics\n   Other topics\n   Corporate Governance\n\n5 Outlook\n\n6 Explanations and contact\nSocial responsibility for our employees as well as for the communities in which we operate\n\nWe define Social Responsibility (S) as the responsibility for ...\n\n... our employees.\n\nGreat company to work for all \u2013 Our Focus\n\n- Employee Engagement\n- Respect for Human Rights\n- Occupational Health & Safety\n- Employee Development\n\nEmployer of Choice is one of our three strategic goals\n\n... the communities we operate in.\n\nCorporate Citizenship \u2013 Our Focus\n\n- LOCAL ENGAGEMENT: Participating in volunteering activities to serve local needs\n- GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT: Taking responsibility to position DPDHL Group as a global citizen\n- BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT: Solving global challenges with a business mindset\n\n- Employee Volunteering\n- Disaster Management\n- Improving Employability\n- Protecting the Environment\n- Facilitating Trade\n\nWe make a difference through our logistical expertise and the engagement of our employees\n\nThrough our programs and partnerships, we support the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nEmployer of Choice \u2013\nOur employees are our most valuable asset\n\nWith around 570,000 employees, we are one of the world's largest employers in our industry.\n\n\u2022 We aim to be employer of choice \u2013 attracting competent and committed employees, continuously developing them and retaining them over the long term\n\n\u2022 Motivated employees are the prerequisite for excellent service quality and thus for the satisfaction of our customers and the sustainable success of our business\n\n\u2022 In line with our six leadership attributes, we promote open communication, create a safe and non-discriminatory working environment in which employees can develop as individuals\nOur values are anchored in our Code of Conduct (Code).
