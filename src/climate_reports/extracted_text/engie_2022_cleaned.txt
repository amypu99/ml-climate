This 8th edition integrated report designed share, all our internal external stakeholders, our vision world, business model, strategy, creation financial non-financial value simple educational way. What happened within during that should be remembered? Catherine MacGregor: was good year ! I am proud everything we accomplished such short time. agreement Board Directors, we repositioned refocused our activities around our four core businesses: renewables, course; solutions; networks; thermal generation supply. We reaffirmed ' industrial approach priority we place operational excellence. We accelerated our growth investments Renewables Solutions. As we were engaged an extremely ambitious transformation, our teams demonstrated exemplary mobilization challenging context pandemic. I would like express my deepest gratitude them. However, I regret our poor results health safety. We are fully mobilized currently strengthening our actions everywhere we operate, both our teams our contractors. concrete terms, what do you consider highlights ? Catherine Jean-Pierre Clamadieu: This year was marked MACGREGOR historic rise prices that impacted consumers manufacturers. This price surge adds further Chief Executive Officer meaning our commitments terms social societal responsibility, line our goal lead just transition wherever we operate. Guided our purpose, our strategy – which places our performance within comprehensive CSR approach – contributes Sustainable Development Goals United Nations. Therefore, we are fully reaffirming our historic adherence 10 Principles United Nations Global Pact. Catherine MacGregor: There were so many highlights during my first year at ! We commissioned an additional GW renewable assets won major contracts solutions, such as contract Georgetown University United States or contract City Paris, which entrusted cooling network us twenty years. We entered into several strategic partnerships renewable gas segment, such as CMA-CGM decarbonize maritime transport, or Masdar United Arab Emirates develop green hydrogen. All while we continued assist our individual customers moving toward decarbonized economy. We also completed disposal EQUANS under good terms conditions. This will offer amazing development opportunities teams. was marked renewed mobilization climate change. How positioning itself this context? Jean-Pierre Clamadieu: indeed marked turning point this area: United States, President Biden took initiative rejoin Paris Agreement soon after his inauguration. At COP26, first time, governments paved way gradual phase-out fossil fuels. framework set up Paris 2015 now complete functional. their part, mobilization economic players around voluntary coalitions was remarkable accelerator. Mobilization also track Europe: it has increased 2030 emissions reduction goal 55% compared 1990, established "Fit 55" road map. major transformation our economy underway determined be major player. Catherine MacGregor: first half year, presented stronger climate goal be "Net Zero Carbon" three scopes 2045 following "well below °C" trajectory, currently being certified SBTi*. All our teams are enthusiastically mobilized around this goal. This major commitment which we have already made progress. I salute their determination meet exciting challenges transition build tomorrow' low-carbon system today. At time when world experiencing historic crisis Ukraine, how being impacted? Jean-Pierre Clamadieu: has strongly condemned invasion Ukraine we have course committed comply every respect applicable sanctions. We have expressed our solidarity Jean-Pierre affected populations our employees affected these events. Our teams are mobilized CLAMADIEU ground support Foundation. Chairman Board Directors solid we can approach this new crisis confidence spirit solidarity. Catherine MacGregor: As world player, we assume our responsibilities. immediately mobilized all resources ensure safety employees affected conflict. Our priority also ensure security supply our customers. We are currently working this end accelerating filling our storage facilities diversifying our gas purchases. longer term, this conflict reinforces our ambition be carbon neutral: accelerate decarbonization our activities, particularly renewable gases. , GLOBAL LEADER TRANSITION Simplified refocused, fully committed implement sustainable growth strategy achieve Net Zero Carbon goal 2045 P.06 , global leader transition P.08 business model aligned our purpose accelerate transition P.10 core activity low-carbon world P.12 model that contributes United Nations Sustainable Development Goals P.14 market trends P.15 Priorities shared stakeholders P.16 Anticipating managing risks P.17 Building low-carbon system tomorrow P.20 Creating global value P.23 Commitments collective progress , GLOBAL LEADER TRANSITION global industry leader low-carbon supply related services.

RENEWABLE GASES, AN ESSENTIAL SOURCE CARBON NEUTRALITY As renewable resource, biomethane component circular economy. Though it remains marginal global mix, it an source future that needed, alongside low- carbon hydrogen synthetic gases, achieve carbon neutrality. What are renewable gases? Biogas Synthetic methane Renewable gas obtained from natural process: This name covers different types renewable gases (CH ): fermentation organic matter. production • renewable gases produced from various organic waste biogas makes it possible recover organic waste from according different processes, such as pyrogasification agricultural (manure, residues) or urban (sludge, food waste) ( high-temperature thermochemical process that uses environments. waste produce gas that can be injected into existing Biomethane networks) hydrothermal gasification ( high-pressure, gas very high methane concentration derived from high-temperature thermochemical process converting biogas purification injected into networks. BioNGV liquid biomass into synthetic gas). or bioLNG (or liquefied biomethane) are used as clean fuels. • gases from methanation processes based low-carbon hydrogen carbon. Renewable hydrogen gas that naturally present universe. Low-carbon hydrogen When produced from renewable resources, hydrogen can Hydrogen produced natural gas using various CO provide low-CO electricity heat, both directly or capture technologies, which allow it be stored or reused through fuel cells. As highly versatile fuel, hydrogen can be transported stored liquid or gaseous form. Hydrogen: an accelerator decarbonization achieve carbon-neutral future, relies diversified mix , particular, an ambitious program develop hydrogen production, transport, storage distribution capacities. This gas can be stored underground saline cavities over long periods. It can be injected as mixture into gas network, or used pure form variety purposes, particular industry mobility sector, or converted into low-carbon electricity. It contributes solving problem intermittence renewable energies. Another fundamental advantage hydrogen fact that it can be produced from locally established renewable energies, thereby promoting short circuit local jobs. Thanks -depth knowledge regions which it operates ability intervene entire value chain – from development financing hydrogen projects sales end customers – has major assets bolster development. Hydrogen therefore promise new technological, industrial sector, both locally globally, new jobs at stake, essential as contribution decarbonization mix. governments have understood this: Europe, more than 10 countries (including France) European Commission have published their "National Hydrogen Strategy" road map, related promises funding.
