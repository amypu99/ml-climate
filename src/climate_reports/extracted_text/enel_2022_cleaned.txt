Risk definition Climate change Risk ineffective identification, assessment management risks related climate changes – caused acute chronic events (physical risks) effects regulatory, technology market trends arising from transition lower-carbon economy (transition risks) – through strategic operating initiatives adap- tation mitigation climate risks. Reference scenario description risk physical risks arising from climate change can be classified acute (or extreme events) or chronic: former are linked extremely intense weather-climatic conditions, while latter refer gradual endur- ing changes climatic conditions. Extreme events may expose Group potential unavailability assets infrastructure, service resto- ration costs, inconvenience customers, etc. Chronic changes climatic conditions, other hand, may expose Group other physical risks or opportunities (depending geographical location): example, structural changes rainfall or wind patterns could impact Group's business generation terms, while structural temperature changes can impact electricity demand. regard energy transition process towards more sustainable model progressive electrifica- tion reduction CO emissions line Group's decarbonization strategy, there are risks, but above all opportunities, tied both changing regulatory context technological electrification trends, resulting market developments, potential effects also commodity energy prices.. Mitigation actions associated strategic goals order facilitate proper identification management risks opportunities related climate change, Group policy was published 2021. policy describes common guidelines assessing risks opportunities arising from climate change.

These risks were identified analyzing main events occurred past three years. particular, relation probability occurrence, mechanical risks (falls, knocks, crushing cuts) are most likely, whilst terms potential associated impact, electrical risks are those most severe consequences (fatalities). Also, relation Group's presence different geographical contexts worldwide, employees con- tractors may be exposed health risks relating emerging infectious diseases, epidemic potentially pandemic nature, which may affect their good health well-being.

From perspective procurement process, preferred tool tender, which guarantees maximum competition equal opportunity access all operators having necessary technical, eco- nomic-financial, environmental, safety, human rights, legal ethical characteristics. Procurement direct award without competitive bidding can occur only exceptional suitably motivated circumstances compliance relevant statutory legislation. Moreover, supplier qualification system, same one throughout Group, checks – even before procurement process starts – potential suppliers are line strategic corporate vision expectations relation all mentioned profiles requirements. regard risk governance system, Group focused application metrics indicate level risk before after mitigation action, order implement precautionary actions reduce uncertainty tolerable level or mitigate any impacts all business, technological geographical areas. effectiveness risk management supply chain monitored using specific indicators, including probability insolvency, concentration contracts individual suppliers or industrial groups, supplier's dependence , performance index proper conduct during tender, quality, punctu- ality sustainability execution contract, Country risk, etc., which thresholds are defined guide definition procurement, negotiation award strategy tender, allowing informed choices based potential risks befits (savings). During Covid-19 emergency, actions were taken, which were made structural, differentiation procurement sources ( prevent interruptions supply chain) performing, remotely, activities would normally require physical interaction between supplier (e.g. company -site inspections). Furthermore, order counter consequences geopolitical situation Ukraine, which increased market volatility further stressed supply chain, which already seriously tested during period Covid-19 pandemic, Global Procurement constantly monitors activities inherent supply/logistics chain, also active participation suppliers, through specific contractual obligation monitor order mitigate risks deriving from market shortages or critical issues regarding logistics business interruptions.
