Three transition scenarios were considered analysis risks opportunities. baseline scenario, line group' strategic forecasts, two alternative scenarios, which potential risks opportunities comparison baseline scenario were assessed: • FOCUS ENERGY TRANSITION (FET)_This baseline scenario, based mainly forecasts made Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) published International Energy Agency Word Energy Outlook (WEO '21), line Paris goals. ' strategy has been consistent this scenario recent years, it continued be force during work prepare Capital Markets Day (held 9 November 2022). Two more recently published scenarios were also taken into account establish this baseline scenario: Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) (WEO '22) Consumer Transformation Scenario (CT) published National Grid Future Energy Scenarios set (FES '22). APS scenario assumes all aspirational goals announced governments, including energy access long-term net zero goals, will be met time full. If implemented time full, temperature increase about .7º C APS 2100 would be maintained. UK CT scenario based high level electrification, arising from customers' willingness change behaviour, high efficiency improved demand flexibility. • SLOWER TRANSITION SCENARIO: this scenario considers slowdown fulfilling more ambitious commitments or potential breaches commitments made. result, global warming would be limited less than 2º. This scenario based forecast published WEO22 Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which shows trajectory policies currently approved. Regional scenarios like Falling short Scenario (FS) published National Grid (FES 2022), which involves not reaching Net Zero United Kingdom 2050, have also been combined. • FASTER TRANSITION SCENARIO: this third scenario considers more optimistic ambitious hypotheses, based estimates Net Zero Scenario (NZ) (WEO2022), which describes way globally achieve stabilisation .5º C increase global average temperatures, together universal access modern energy 2030.

Priority given investment financially appealing markets, high rating, ambitious electrification goals, regulatory stability. committed maintaining its financial strength, always taking social, environmental governance pillars into account. All this allows affirmation no significant risks arising from climate transition scenarios other than basic case short term have been observed, thanks resilience business model strategy Group. However, exceptional situation arising from invasion Ukraine Russia has led implementation various measures governments, particularly Europe, might delay progress towards low-carbon economy (intervention electricity markets, rate hikes, etc.) Group supports measures provide "green exit" from crisis. 2025 - 2030 period It medium term climate transition scenarios key tool evaluating impact climate change company its current strategy. analysis three scenarios described 2025-2030 period intended identify impacts opportunities offered variations key parameters energy sector macroeconomic domain businesses geographic areas which Group has presence. key parameters scenarios linked operational business indicators, such changes therein have both positive negative impacts businesses. levels correspondence (medium or high) between main parameters examined climate scenarios key parameters group' businesses specified below. discussed, potential scenarios analysed consider plausible projections made highly credible organisations, well internal assumptions based particularities specific geographic areas which has presence within countries. regional values parameters selected from each climate scenario have thus been specified. example, electricity demand could potentially be reduced 18% Slower scenario, or increase 9% Faster scenario compared baseline scenario; renewable installed capacity, potential reductions up 44% projected Slower scenario, increases up 33% Faster scenario, certain geographic areas be analysed where Group has presence. conduct analysis, behaviour parameters most sensitive potential changes climate scenarios each country was analysed, both main geographic areas which group has presence other high-activity countries shown map below: This analysis scenarios has allowed identification main risks opportunities business geographic area, well absence significant impacts some cases. table below provides qualitative description trend most relevant operating indicators each business geographic area under two alternative scenarios. Slower scenario shows, mid-term, slower speed increase demand electricity installation new renewable generation, lower penetration generation mix respect baseline scenario. There also smaller change consumers' mindset, home gas consumption percentages remaining high electricity percentages remaining low. All foregoing compared baseline scenario forecast 2030. main impacts group' businesses geographic areas : • Europe retail: due slower speed electrification reached this scenario, projections strategic plan Europe might be negatively affected medium magnitude. • Spain USA renewables: some developments currently forecast 2030 would slow down, their implementation would be postponed due reduction installed renewable capacity compared projection base case 2030. • impact USA UK grids would be less significant: due lower investment grids than forecast plan, well lower electrification homes vehicles. • rest businesses would maintain expected growth rates. Faster scenario, focusing achieving net zero 2050, key indicators decarbonisation scenarios, which drivers growth ' businesses, would already be strongly boosted 2030. It must be supported more ambitious commitments from countries establishment regulatory frameworks accelerated procedures required meet this goal. It will also require strengthening ensuring financial instruments technological infrastructure deployment across all geographic areas. following opportunities stand out: • Spain, USA IEI renewables: where impacts could be very high if these more ambitious increases renewable energy achieved, driven European American commitments policies. They would also generate significant opportunities Australia new Asian countries. • Spain, USA UK networks: This scenario highest investment renewables transmission distribution networks accelerate network reinforcement infrastructure improvement projects needed ensure integration system quality supply. • No significant impacts rest businesses found, investments developments current plan guaranteed. variations operating parameters described above have an impact financial indicators various businesses geographic areas. positive negative impact EBITDA respect expected data 2030 both transition scenario alternatives base case described below. 2030 there could be more opportunities than risks overall, mainly driven Group' renewable businesses. Slower scenario, variations operating parameters identified above could have an impact group' businesses, reducing EBITDA €100 million €300 million 2030, except Networks business, which would undergo an impact lower than €100 million. Faster scenario, opportunities growth identified Networks businesses €100 million €300 million, more than €300 million Global Generation businesses, driven results renewables business Spain, USA IEI. Finally, smaller opportunities could arise retail business, achieving slight improvements EBITDA, estimated be far below €100 million. Net-Zero scenario has been evaluated assuming organic growth stable balance sheet structure. 2030-2050 period projections key transition parameters become more uncertain long term. However, strengths ' management its strategy always based stable sustained growth geographic areas, lower financial risks, greater regulatory stability, assurance Group' profit. Thus, currently available projections, no significant risks decarbonisation path being led Group key geographic areas expected. Any opportunities may emerge expected be significant, so continues lead investment, but also innovation promotion new technologies, thus fostering global progress industry well capitalising new opportunities they arise. conclude, group' current positioning, based levers its action plan (see "Climate Action Plan" section), places it favourable position maximise opportunities efficiently face transition risks various climate scenarios analysed. group believes opportunities stemming from decarbonisation global economy (growth renewables, investments integrated smart grids, storage, electrification industrial sectors transport, green energy, etc.) outweigh risks.

This requires urgent action revert loss biodiversity. Given location our infrastructure their interaction territory, has believed more than fifteen years biodiversity material issue its Business Model, this reason places respect biodiversity ecosystems key place within its business strategy. Since 2007, has had Biodiversity Policy which forms part its "I.. Governance Sustainability System". this policy, which was strengthened 2021, commits assuming position leadership fight against loss biodiversity generating positive net impact biodiversity from its activities. These commitments involve integrating biodiversity into strategic planning, managing risk through continuous assessment impacts dependencies throughout life cycle, applying mitigation hierarchy (avoid, mitigate, restore offset) all our activities, avoiding placement new infrastructure protected areas, implementing biodiversity action plans, working together Stakeholders, encouraging awareness communication. It also entails promoting, along its Stakeholders, social culture which biodiversity valued, preserved, restored sustainably used, maintaining ecosystem services, favouring healthy planet, providing essential benefits all. supports ambitious objectives negotiations new global framework Convention Biological Diversity approved Montreal December 2022. Biodiversity Plan 2030, approved October 2022 after being presented company' corporate bodies, aligned goals approved Global Biodiversity Framework. particular importance Goal 15, relating reporting impacts biodiversity impacts covered this report its Biodiversity Report. Moreover, already working Task Force Nature related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) WBCSD evaluate draft recommendations provide feedback. addition Biodiversity Policy, has following mechanisms integrate protection conservation biodiversity within management, it be taken into account decision-making processes: • Biodiversity Policy • Comprehensive Risk Control Management System • Environmental Management System group • Tools evaluating impacts dependencies • Biodiversity Plan • Environment biodiversity committees Objectives Biodiversity Plan 2030 At , we have strengthened our commitment nature set ourselves goal having positive net impact biodiversity 2030, i.e. year which our activities have contributed preserving improving biodiversity. Objective 2025: No net deforestation part its actions achieve this goal 2030, also commits ensuring its activity does not generate net deforestation 2025. This commitment applies both direct actions actions group' supply chain. Biodiversity Plan 2030 achieve this ambitious goal, has launched Biodiversity Plan 2030 ( "Plan"), which applies all group' facilities activities, which has three areas action: measure, act transform. This approach aligned Science-Based Targets Nature (SBTNs) its vision Framework Action "AR3T1" landmark pillars provided Taskforce Nature- related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). Biodiversity Plan 2030 continuation years work protection preservation biodiversity, its integration into strategic planning decision-making group. commitments procedures derived from this Plan : i. conservation hierarchy; iii. application solutions based preservation nature; iv. supply chain involvement. All them, together other measures, constitute adequate tools guarantee achievement objectives Plan 2030. Interaction biodiversity Main impacts dependencies ■ GRI 304- identifies impacts dependencies stemming from interaction these activities biodiversity natural capital, order avoid, minimise, remedy /or offset these impacts dependencies. has been working developing implementing tools identify, quantify assess impacts dependencies its activities natural capital since 2012. identification these impacts dependencies an iterative process. Below some information sources tools used: • Corporate Environmental Footprint • Assessments environmental impact at new projects • Impact surveillance, monitoring re-evaluation programmes • Matrix impacts dependencies technology developed Natural Capital Energy Working Group • Matrix materiality activities regard drivers biodiversity loss • Results pilot natural capital assessment projects at ' facilities. this regard, 2022 continued work pilot projects quantify net effect our activities biodiversity at several our facilities Spain, Brazil, United Kingdom Mexico, using international benchmark methodologies obtaining initial results projects. Identification dependencies Carrying out operations maintenance activities requires, addition raw materials, services nature provides. identifying these dependencies, we able assess those services plan actions prevent their modification protect preserve them. An analysis group' activities makes it possible identify dependencies following ecosystem services: • Waterway maintenance service, through hydrological cycle. water cycle makes it possible recover river flows, which necessary produce energy at hydro plants cooling processes at thermal plants. • Climate regulation service, which obtained through nature means long-term storage carbon dioxide soils, plant biomass oceans. This service important all generation facilities. • Terrain stabilisation erosion control. Vegetation slopes prevents avalanches landslides. This service important hydroelectric plants transmission distribution grid facilities. • Protection against floods storms, through buffer provided vegetation during such events. This service important hydroelectric plants grid facilities. • Water. This resource source production at hydroelectric plants, it necessary cooling at thermal plants. • Mineral non-mineral (gas uranium) resources fuel power generation at thermal plants. • Gas product served customers users gas networks. Identification impacts Activities operations may have impacts during different phases life facilities identified order avoid, minimise appropriately correct such potential impacts, shown figure below: Based these actions, potential significant impacts biodiversity arising from group' activities, products services turn identified: ■ GRI 304- Facilities protected spaces or high biodiversity-value areas areas which conducts its activities serve habitats variety flora wildlife, some which under some form protection. This mainly due fact construction work was performed prior issuance declarations protection public authorities. This case certain hydroelectric plants Spain. There also facilities which – after an analysis alternatives, giving priority avoiding protected areas, after an environmental assessment process which mitigation hierarchy was applied – competent authorities authorised project. Such authorisation based consideration while protected areas or high biodiversity-value areas could not be avoided, preventive palliative measures prevented activities from having significant impacts protected habitats species. Therefore, following impact assessment process, it was determined presence such facilities protected spaces or high biodiversity-value areas was compatible protected elements, consequent implementation measures prevent, mitigate compensate possible adverse effects. following table shows facilities within or adjacent protected spaces or high biodiversity-value areas: Facilities within or adjacent protected spaces (PS) or high biodiversity-value (HBV) areas.

Priority impacts, which an action plan established based their significance. After identifying potential impacts, triggers measures prevent mitigate them, which horizontally integrated across all levels company. ■ GRI -25 However, even valid risk prevention systems unable prevent adverse impacts all cases. this reason, when due diligence system detects an actual negative impact, mitigation plans implemented reduce magnitude impact. those cases which this not fully possible, remedial action required. implements remedial actions or measures ensure victims affected people have access an effective remedy through legitimate processes active cooperation. Remedial actions intended restore one or more affected rights, returning affected people situation prior impact or, if this not possible, reestablishing it much possible through various types remedy. Along these lines, has taken certain actions prevent mitigate its main human rights impacts. regards its employees, company has worked, instance, ensure their labour conditions provide them decent wage, safe workplace takes their mental health into account, well respect diversity, inclusion, non-discrimination equality opportunity. These measures described "Commitment quality employment", " safe work environment" "Diversity inclusion" sections this report. area Labour Practices, has also taken action ensure labour practices adopted its supply chain make it possible prevent or mitigate impacts identified. Thus, company has integrated various factors ensure respect human rights various stages its engagement its suppliers, together other support training initiatives their improvement.

Specifically, objective measures number key suppliers covered sustainable development policies standards, such having human rights strategy, code conduct their suppliers, health safety standards (SDG ) global environmental sustainability strategy, including strategies water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7) biodiversity (SDGs 14 15). objective based specific model evaluation supply chain has been integrated into systems implemented Purchasing Department, both supplier classification system purchasing management system itself, supplier sustainability included decision-making process proposals awarding contracts. 70 Suppliers registered same country subsidiary which it does business considered be local based Supplier sustainability evaluation model: 2022 Purchasing Division consolidated use Global Supplier Sustainability Evaluation Model, which conformed international reality group organised around three core ESG pillars sustainability. evaluation supplier measures supplier' performance highly significant attributes: identification objectives linked Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), management climate change risk, circular economy strategy, human rights due diligence, compliance, good governance business ethics, etc. supplier must provide supporting evidence documentation its statements performance. following information assessed part three dimensions analysed: After analysis, suppliers rated at two levels: "adequate" if their score exceeds 51 100 points ( at least 30% points each ESG pillars), "inadequate" otherwise. At year-end 2022, more than 77% group' main suppliers awarded contracts 2020-2022 period already met established criteria followed sustainable development policies standards. Furthermore, 2022, €17,112 million have been allocated suppliers evaluated basis this ESG model. This amount represents 96% total amount awarded different suppliers making up group' supply chain. this amount, €16,287 million (91.5% total) was awarded suppliers surpassing above mentioned level sustainability. It should be noted 2022, objectives relating increase purchases from key suppliers evaluated "adequate" were met improvement plans were introduced monitored those suppliers did not achieve minimum scores established when they were awarded contracts from beginning 2020 end 2022. Therefore, improvement plans were sent 912 suppliers group during this period result this initiative has been 57% them have improved their level sustainability level "adequate". Not only supplier motivated this model improve its profile taking actions promote excellence business management, but Purchasing Division team also incentivised through quantifiable objectives choose those companies showing good performance sustainability or making commitment improve.
