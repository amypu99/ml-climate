ABOUT THE REPORT TABLE OF CONTENTS
FOR 2022, WE DECIDED TO GO FURTHER IN THE INTEGRATION OF BUSINESS
AND SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN OUR REPORTING, SO AS TO BETTER
DEMONSTRATE HOW THEY ARE INHERENTLY LINKED WITHIN OUR GROUP.
Our 2022 Integrated Annual Report thus provides a comprehensive overview of
the Group mission, governance, objectives and performance. It reaffirms our dual
commitment to simultaneously achieve economic success and social progress, which
has now been enshrined within our by-laws through our “Société à Mission” status.
We also focus on the sustainability issues that are central to our business, showing how
they are connected to our operations and broader value chain. Our intention with this
report is to be transparent, not only about how we are pursuing our sustainability
objectives, but also, about the challenges we are currently facing in pursuing them.
METHODOLOGY AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The 2022 Integrated Annual Report was created by Danone’s Sustainability
Performance team, with the support and supervision of the relevant thematic
expert teams, who were instrumental in ensuring its achievement, through
data collection and key testimonies.

environmental and social performance in our business model.
As a critical health factor, the nutritional value of food products is of growing
concern to both consumers and regulators. Our everyday products strive to bring
key nutrients relevant to their food categories and to limit certain nutrients, with
a focus on sugars. As a result, 91% of the product volumes sold are in healthy ca-
tegories and 88% of the product volumes sold scored ≥3.5 stars according to the
Health Star Rating system. According to this system, any product that scores 3.5
stars or above can be confidently promoted as a healthy choice (1).
New consumption patterns / planetary diet
To answer an ever-rising demand for more climate-conscious and
sustainable products, but also to adjust to increasingly specific consumer
needs and preferences, we are continuously adapting our portfolio. Danone
has been at the forefront of these changing consumer preferences to
promote more healthy, nutritious and sustainable offerings and ensure
that our products answer to local consumer diets and cultural or religious
preferences. Integrating more low-carbon and plant-based products into our
portfolio has also been key to address these challenges.
Product safety/quality
As it relates to production quality, spoilage, contamination, supply chain

affect Danone’s operations and brand reputation, particularly amid new
