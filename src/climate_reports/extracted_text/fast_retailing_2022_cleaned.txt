Tadashi Yanai Creativity individuals private sector; key shaping future next generation How did world science change during COVID-19 pandemic? Professor Shinya Yamanaka, who won Nobel Prize Physiology or Medicine, has been conducting research at Kyoto University, Japan, Gladstone Institutes, California, traveling back forth between countries while navigating travel restrictions. Through his research, Professor Yamanaka keeping close eye frontline future. Below an edited version discussions between Professor Yamanaka Tadashi Yanai, Chairman, President CEO . These discussions took place during period quarantine Professor Yamanaka after returning Japan, later during an -person meeting Tokyo. ITASREVNOC YTINUTROPPO FO EGA NA TROPER YTILIBANIATSUS GNILIATER TSA What pandemic has revealed Yanai You been actively communicating COVID-19 pandemic since started. Yamanaka Thank you. question how science can contribute world has always been my mind while doing iPS cell research. However, most scientists, including myself, could not predict COVID-19 would such an impact world. situation made me reflect scientist. Ever since, felt must continue communicate public, even if topic beyond my field expertise. Yanai also very important companies communicate. pandemic has closed borders, isolated families individuals, brought everything halt. has made us think about responsibilities how should communicate when actions are restricted. Now world so closely connected because globalization. has made me keenly aware how serious situation would be if these connections were lost. other words, pandemic has caused two crises. Yamanaka Even if society could overcome an infectious disease by cutting off connections, social structure economic activities would not be sustainable. very difficult balance these two. Yanai not only scientists who failed predict future, but also politicians economists, well. should not just close doors but find ways open them wisely emergency situations. must work together all over world spread apply knowledge globally. Otherwise, life will stop like cells not only from virus researchers but also from different fields, utilizing without blood flow. their own knowledge specialties. This was particularly clear U.S. Yamanaka field science has become more active. scientific world reminded me how country driving force global research usually driven by principle fierce competition. However, many us decided innovations. U.S. was at forefront efforts translate research switch from competition cooperation early . There were lot reactions findings into reality. At same time, suffered from having highest number infected deaths world. saw two sides country. Yanai certain period quarantine required when return Japan. can be stressful travel back forth between Japan U.S., but you visited U.S. frequently. Yamanaka because my research based Kyoto San Francisco. reason tolerate strict travel regulations because U.S., can access cutting edge research feel enthusiasm researchers directly. There are things cannot be conveyed precisely Internet. Yanai When globalized world fragmented, come realize there are tangible things which are indispensable human beings. These things cannot be captured by Internet. why need monitor infection situation adjust inspection quarantine systems facilitate crossing borders greater agility. Otherwise, will continue lose dynamism created by direct interactions. Yamanaka 2020 was like fighting without protective gear. However, more reassuring situation now, because preventive measures, including wearing masks, protection vaccines more sophisticated treatment methods even if do get infected. But more harmful variants may still emerge. paramount prepare ourselves thoroughly, especially when number infected decreases. This conversation was first Yanai When social economic conditions improve, must take good look held online October 12, 2021, then at at what going from global perspective rather than just rejoicing Ariake Office ITASREVNOC YTINUTROPPO FO EGA NA TROPER YTILIBANIATSUS GNILIATER TSA countries regions are difficult situations. Otherwise, entire world government demanding short-term results from research academia will not be able coexist prosper together. Or more precisely, believe too much. Basic research may not produce results five or 10 years. Trial nothing but an illusion one's own country can recover single-handedly. error are key great discoveries. single-year accounting system clearer than ever entire world connected at every corner, budget principle are also causing problems. proven by pandemic. Yamanaka Research funding divided into periods one year at shortest five years at longest. Faculty members are also given terms. Many power individuals private sector young members are only given terms five years. becoming impossible them conduct research where they find something other researchers do Yanai Another thing should be emphasized power individuals not notice continue observe under microscope more than private sector. They played vital role. acceleration vaccination decade. This exactly what research by Professor Yoshinori Ohsumi (Nobel Japan was due large part private sector. Laureate Physiology or Medicine his research autophagy) was like. Yamanaka agree. was so vaccines were short supply at one About quarter century ago, salaries university faculty were not point. Anyone could estimate 1 million shots per day were necessary high, but enough them eat, they could do their research without Japan before fall winter when infection situation would worrying about tomorrow. However, basic research at Japanese universities worsen. made an announcement declaring this number goal. quarter century ago was ranked around third or fourth highest world. government also set goal 1 million shots per day, set up large-scale Now falling lower lower. Education was called "100-year plan" this vaccination sites allowed vaccinations workplace. government country. need think about its fundamentals from now . supplied vaccine, but system logistics were entrusted local Yanai There no retirement age U.S. long you tenure. governments private sectors. changed system went along. Professor Syukuro Manabe, Nobel Laureate Physics, senior These efforts from both parties paid off. If government had made all meteorologist atmospheric oceanic sciences at Princeton University at decisions without room adjustments, would never achieved 1 million age 90. This not because he protected by system, but probably shots per day. because his research achievements are evaluated steady reliable. Yanai When need achieve something short period time, decisions Yamanaka U.S., when researcher hired tenure, his or her age based "uniformity" or "precedent" will be nothing but an obstacle. Groups or does not matter. Or rather, cannot ask . However, even if you societies put brakes ideas suggestions by individuals may make fewer mistakes, but they will not produce new results. This means there will be no future them. matter future country whether individuals private sector are an environment where they can think freely. Yamanaka Science has also shown unprecedented development. was inconceivable vaccines be ready available within year. They were available such short period time because efforts by startups Europe United States. They already had good skills handle mRNA they were experimenting clinically almost 10 years. Their experiments failed over over again, but they did not give up. think there little chance Japan investments will not be cut off by investors when startups fail repeatedly. Yanai Investors need take measure nature startups; are they just trying make money, or do they aspire contribute world from long-term perspective, such overcoming disease or developing technologies reduce CO2? Also, important startups clear purposes plans communicate their visions aspirations way easy investors understand. Yamanaka You are right. natural investors expect financial returns from their investments. At same time, attitude toward investments has been changing recent years. More more investors are not looking short-term results but expect make big return their investment future society, including generations their children grandchildren. Yanai also depends whether you sense crisis about global environment. think there still mindset Japan government should take care these major problems. Nothing will change unless individuals ITASREVNOC YTINUTROPPO FO EGA NA TROPER YTILIBANIATSUS GNILIATER TSA tenure, even if you won Nobel Prize, your salary will be lower Yamanaka Exactly. field biology, there are more more lower your laboratory will become smaller smaller if you don't produce situations where ability quickly analyze apply big data remarkable results long time.

Shortly after Meiji Restoration, Yukichi Fukuzawa said research institutions rather than working alone. there was no academic independence without financial independence.

This summary his response. refugee situation: an important lesson from COVID-19 pandemic At end 2020, there were approximately 82.4 million refugees displaced : fleeing war, conflict, violence, discrimination persecution. This ninth year row which this figure increasing. These increasing figures mean old conflicts never get resolved new conflicts emerge. Look at what's happened recently Ethiopia, example. Syria crisis 10 years old; Afghanistan, conflict over 40 years old. These are very worrying signs world has difficulty building peace. So unfortunately, if you look at geopolitical context, you cannot be too optimistic. You be realistic. This figure may continue rise again next few years. COVID-19 pandemic, dramatic may been continues be, has taught us very important lesson. these global challenges, such coronavirus climate change, cannot be resolved country by country.

Through training, Ms. Akter realized she had been under misconception "women are incapable taking up managerial positions," then shifted her mindset believe she capable. This also affected her surroundings. "Most supervisors used be men. At first, was told women were incapable being supervisors, but when showed my achievements, male employees changed their attitudes." Since then, there been some female workers who wish be promoted supervisors like Ms. Akter. " Bangladesh, idea still prevalent women are less capable both at work at home.
