forest products, as set out in our Forest Product Policy.
We also work with our suppliers and other organisations in the
industry to foster the implementation of specific improvement
plans in our supply chain. In 2022, we launched a first pilot of our
Collaboration Programme for Environmental Improvement
aimed at transforming the supply chain and reducing its
environmental impact, with a particular emphasis on water,
polluting discharges, management of chemical products and
energy, involving 208 key facilities. These plans enable us to
optimise the use of fresh water and energy, which in turn
reduces the associated emissions. This year, we have reduced
the relative water consumption (l/kg) in our supply chain by 17%
with respect to 2020.
Furthermore, we are mindful of the particular relevance of
protecting biodiversity, not only because of our specific
business, but also because it is an essential element for the
conservation and well-being of society and the planet. We
contribute to protecting and caring for biodiversity through a
number of initiatives, such as our involvement in the LEAF
Coalition, a project on regenerative agriculture and the
restoration of ecosystems in India, or our work with World Wide
Fund for Nature (WWF) and Canopy.
Our Sustainability Policy3 establishes the principles of
environmental action, applicable across all business areas and
throughout the value chain. It establishes as a fundamental
principle the preservation of the environment through the
implementation of continuous improvement actions in aspects
such as emissions to air, consumption of resources, use of
chemicals and waste management.
Notable among these are the consideration of environmental
variables in the planning and development of our activities and
1 This includes all our own facilities (headquarters, logistics centres, factories and stores), with the exception of international offices.
2 Additionality is a feature of power purchase mechanisms whereby the construction of new renewable energy generation infrastructure that would otherwise not be
guaranteed to be developed is promoted.
3 Our Sustainability Policy replaces the previous Environmental Sustainability Policy, the amendment of which was approved by the Board of Directors on 14 December
2020.
The current challenges call for swift and coordinated action by
all. In this regard, Inditex works closely with organisations such
as the MIT through the Climate and Sustainability Consortium,
The Fashion Pact, the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate
Action, Textile Exchange and Zero Discharge of Hazardous
Chemicals (ZDHC), among others.

A fundamental aspect when implementing our strategies and
achieving our environmental sustainability goals is to spread the
sustainability culture to all our teams. In 2022, we continued to
provide training and raise awareness among our staff. Overall,
more than 13,000 employees received environmental
sustainability training in 2022.

key factors and general framework for action to manage and

our sustainability goals.
Accordingly, in 2022 we signed a VPPA, and we continue to
work on negotiating new contracts that promote additionality by

reducing water consumption in our operations and supply
chain. This, in addition to preserving water as a natural resource,
contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as less
energy is needed to heat water in those production processes
that require it.
Our roadmap for sustainable and rational water usage
throughout our value chain is defined by our Global Water
Management Strategy. As we implement it, we develop a variety
of individual initiatives and collaborate with various stakeholders
to reduce our environmental impact and protect marine and
freshwater habitats, always seeking the most sustainable and
efficient processes and technologies. Notably, this strategy is
currently in the process of being updated, with the aim of
starting to implement the new version in 2023.
5.5.2.1. Initiatives in own operations
Water consumption at Inditex facilities is mainly for cleaning and
sanitary purposes, and its discharge into municipal wastewater
systems is guaranteed. In industrial settings, water is mainly
used for steam generation and recirculation systems in closed-
cycle industrial refrigeration, which allows us to estimate that the
water discharged is equal to the water consumed. Wastewater
in all facilities is discharged to the appropriate wastewater
systems. At Inditex, water consumption does not affect
protected habitats.
