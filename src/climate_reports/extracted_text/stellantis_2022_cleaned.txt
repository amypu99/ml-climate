This reduction 67% improvement from 2021. ■ At assembly plant Luton (UK), we improved piping system recovery solvents contaminated during color change cleaning process. This resulted more efficient waste solvent recovery lowered evaporation solvent. piping system project cost was approximately € 100,000, together some smaller improvements material consumption cleaning processes allowed site reduce their VOC emissions approximately .5 g/m². ■ paint shop vehicle assembly plant Madrid (Spain), we completed change from manual interior painting base coat lines robotic applicators.

RENATU self-assessment tool developed evaluate biodiversity industrial sites or developed areas. It was developed University Paris Pantheon Sorbonne has been designed scientifically validated within framework Infrastructure de Transport Terrestre ECOsystème et Paysage (ITTECOP) program French Ministry Ecological Transition Solidarity. RENATU indicator consists 11 categories that address items such as: invasive species, various vegetation layers, presence microhabitats, nesting sites distance biodiversity reservoirs. assessment conducted site walkthroughs data analysis.
