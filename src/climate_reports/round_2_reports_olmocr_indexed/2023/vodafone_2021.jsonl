As a result, while the Annual Report continues to be a core part of our reporting suite, we have simplified the format and included links to interactive online content, such as videos. This online material brings to life what we do, how we do it, and provides you with a better overall understanding of our business. We have also introduced new summaries at the start of each key section (denoted by an in the contents to the left).\n\nFor the first time we have also published a separate report that summarises our progress towards meeting the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), as well as a comprehensive addendum that includes data on environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Annual Report has been redesigned to aid navigation. We have cross-referenced relevant material and navigation buttons are \u2018clickable\u2019 when using the digital version of the Annual Report. Online content can be accessed by clicking links on the digital version of this Annual Report, copying the website address into an internet browser, or scanning the QR code on a mobile device.\n\nWe have also reported against a number of voluntary reporting frameworks to help our stakeholders understand our sustainable business performance. Disclosures prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) or Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) guidance can be found in our ESG Addendum or on investors.vodafone.com.\n\nVideos:\n\nOur new brand\n\nScan or click to watch a video summarising our new brand positioning, \u2018Together we can\u2019: investors.vodafone.com/videos-brand\n\nStrategy\n\nScan or click to watch our Chief Executive, Nick Read, summarise our performance this year and introduce the next phase of our strategy: investors.vodafone.com/videos-strategy\n\nFinancial performance\n\nScan or click to watch our Chief Financial Officer, Margherita Della Valle, summarise our financial performance in FY21: investors.vodafone.com/videos-cfo\n\nGoverance\n\nScan or click to watch our Chairman, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer, share his views on his first months at Vodafone: investors.vodafone.com/videos-chair\n\nScan or click to watch the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, David Nish, explain his role: investors.vodafone.com/videos-arc\n\nScan or click to watch the Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, Valerie Gooding, explain her role: investors.vodafone.com/videos-rem\n\nScan or click to watch our prospective Non-Executive Director, Olaf Swantee, introduce himself: investors.vodafone.com/videos-ned\nOur strategic framework\n\nOur next phase to drive returns through growth\n\nOur purpose: We connect for a better future\n\nInclusion for All\nEnsuring everyone has access to the benefits of a digital society\nRead more on pages 34-37\n\nPlanet\nReducing our environmental impact and helping society decarbonise\nRead more on pages 38-40\n\nDigital Society\nConnecting people and things and digitalising critical sectors\nRead more on pages 41-42\n\nOur strategy: The new generation connectivity and digital services provider for Europe & Africa, enabling an inclusive & sustainable digital society\n\nCustomer commitments\n\nBest connectivity products & services\nProviding the best core connectivity for consumers and businesses\n\nLeading innovation in digital services\nLeveraging our unique platforms and partnering with leading technology firms to provide customers with a \u2018best on Vodafone\u2019 user experience\n\nOutstanding digital experiences\nUsing our leading digital architecture to provide a seamless customer experience\n\nEnabling strategies\n\nSimplified & most efficient operator\nThrough digital transformation, standardisation, and automation of processes at scale\n\nSocial contract shaping the digital society\nInfluencing policy and regulation to shape a more healthy industry structure, and build a resilient, inclusive and sustainable digital society\n\nLeading gigabit networks\nMaintaining our leading gigabit networks as we provide our customers with the best connectivity products and \u2018best on Vodafone\u2019 user experience\n\nOur advantage: Leading connectivity provider\n\nOur people & culture\nThe \u2018Vodafone Spirit\u2019\nRead more on pages 21-22\n\nEurope & Africa\nTwo attractive regions with scale\nRead more on pages 16-20\n\nGovernance & Risk Management\nStrong frameworks in place\nRead more on page 81\n\nCreating value for society and shareholders\nA new generation connectivity and digital services provider\n\nOur business\n\nWe offer a range of leading connectivity products and platforms to consumers and businesses across Europe and Africa.\n\nConsumer\n\nEurope\nMobile\nWe provide a range of market leading mobile services, enabling customers to reliably call, text and access data.\n\nFixed\nOur fixed-line services include broadband, TV and voice. We offer high-speed connectivity through our next-generation network (NGN).\n\nConvergence\nOur converged plans, which combine mobile, fixed and TV services, provide simplicity and better value for customers.\n\nOther value added services\nThese include our Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) propositions, as well as security and insurance products.\n\nAfrica\nMobile\nWe provide a range of mobile services, enabling customers to call, text and access data. The demand for mobile data is growing rapidly driven by the lack of fixed broadband access and by increased smartphone penetration.\n\nM-Pesa & financial services\nM-Pesa is our African payment platform, which has moved beyond its origins as a money transfer service. Together with Vodacom\u2019s own platform, we now provide a range of financial services, as well as business and merchant payment services.\n\nBusiness\n\nWe serve private & public sector customers of all sizes with a broad range of connectivity services, supported by our dedicated global network.\n\nWe have unique scale and capabilities, and are expanding our portfolio of products and services beyond core mobile and fixed connectivity into new growth areas, such as:\n\n- Unified communications\n- Internet of Things\n- Cloud & security\n\nRevenue contribution (FY21)\n\nTotal revenue\n- Europe 77%\n- Africa 16%\n- Other 7%\n\nService revenue\n- Consumer 69%\n- Business 27%\n- Other 4%\n\nOur strategy (2019-21)\n\nWe have delivered the first phase of our strategy to become a new generation connectivity & digital services provider.\n\nDelivering our strategic priorities at pace\n\nDuring the first phase of our transformation we have focused on reshaping the Group and establishing a foundation from which to grow in the converged connectivity markets in Europe, and mobile data and payments in Africa.\n\nThis has been delivered through four key strategic priorities:\n\n- Deepening customer engagement\n- Accelerating digital transformation\n- Improve asset utilisation\n- Optimising the portfolio\n\nOver the last three years we have made strong progress against all of these strategic priorities \u2014 reshaping Vodafone to be a stronger connectivity provider.\n\nPurpose pillars\n\nOur strategy helps us to deliver our targets across three purpose pillars: Inclusion for All, Planet, and Digital Society.\n\n- Inclusion for All\n  Ensuring everyone has access to the benefits of a digital society.\n\n- Planet\n  Reducing our environmental impact and helping society decarbonise.\n\n- Digital Society\n  Connecting people and things and digitalising critical sectors.\nHow we manage our Group\n\nOur business model is underpinned by our strong governance and risk management framework.\n\nGovernance\nThe Board held seven scheduled meetings this year to deliberate on key strategic matters, our purpose and culture, our people and stakeholder interests.\n\nNominations and Governance Committee\nThis Committee evaluates the composition and performance of the Board to ensure it remains comprised of an appropriate balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and diversity.\n\nAudit and Risk Committee\nThis Committee provides effective governance over the appropriateness of financial reporting of the Group, including the adequacy of related disclosures, the performance of both the internal audit function and the external auditor and oversight of the Group\u2019s systems of internal control, business risks and related compliance activities.\n\nRemuneration Committee\nThis Committee assesses and makes recommendations to the Board on the policies for executive remuneration and reward packages for the individual Executive Directors.\n\nESG Committee\nOn 11 May 2021, the Board approved the establishment of a new Committee to oversee our ESG programme and monitor progress against ESG key performance indicators.\n\nRisk management\nAs the risk landscape becomes more complex and fast moving, we have to be more agile and adaptive in our identification and response to risks. We continue to evolve our risk processes to support the organisation\u2019s goals and strategy.\n\nRisk framework\nOur risk framework clearly defines roles and responsibilities and sets out a consistent end-to-end process for identifying and managing risks. We have embedded the risk framework across the Group as it allows us to take a holistic approach and to make meaningful comparisons. This year our framework was further enhanced, enabling us to be more dynamic in risk detection, modelling of risk interconnectedness and the use of data, all of which are improving our risk visibility and our responses.\n\nBoard oversight of principal and emerging risks\nTo provide adequate oversight, we report on our principal and emerging risks throughout the year to the different management committees and the Board. Additionally, risk owners are invited to present in-depth reviews to ensure that risks are managed within the defined tolerance levels.\n\nHow we measure success\n\nWe track a range of measures that reflect our financial, operational and strategic progress and performance.\n\nFinancial targets\nThe Group provides guidance on adjusted EBITDAaL1 and adjusted free cash flow2.\n\nSenior management incentive plans include organic service revenue, adjusted EBIT, adjusted free cash flow, customer appreciation metrics, relative total shareholder return and ESG measures.\n\nRead more on pages 20 and 101-103\n\nReturn on capital employed (\u2018ROCE\u2019)\nThis is a key area of focus for the Group, reflecting how efficiently we are generating profit with the capital we deploy.\n\nOur goal is to deliver a sustainable improvement in ROCE through a combination of consistent revenue growth, ongoing margin expansion, strong cash flow conversion, and disciplined allocation of capital.\n\nRead more on pages 20 and 31\n\nOperational metrics\nWe have a number of commercial metrics that are used to monitor our progress against our key strategic priorities and reflect the strong underlying momentum across the business.\n\nRead more on pages 14-15\n\nSocial contract\nMonitoring the success we have in shaping a healthier industry structure that is pro-investment, supportive of returns, and build a resilient, inclusive and sustainable digital society.\n\nRead more on page 19\n\nSustainability metrics\nWe monitor metrics that are aligned to the three pillars of our purpose.\n\n\u2013 Inclusion for All: Rural connectivity, our commercial propositions for equality, as well as workplace equality.\n\u2013 Planet: Our carbon footprint across the full value chain, enabling our customers to reduce their own emissions, and waste.\n\u2013 Digital Society: Customers connected to our gigabit networks, supporting SMEs, and the digitalisation of critical sectors.\n\nWe have also included Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) KPIs in the long-term incentive plan for our senior leaders.\n\nRead more on pages 32-42\n\nNotes:\n1. Adjusted EBITDAaL is equivalent to FY21 definition and calculation of adjusted EBITDA.\n2. Adjusted free cash flow is free cash flow before spectrum restructuring, integration costs and Vantage Towers growth capital additions.\nFinancial and non-financial performance\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nOur progress\n\nWe measure our success by tracking key performance indicators that reflect our strategic, operational and financial progress and performance.\n\nFinancial results summary\n\n| Financial results summary | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|---------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Group revenue (\u20acm)        | 43,809 | 44,974 | 43,666 |\n| Group service revenue (\u20acm)| 37,141 | 37,871 | 36,458 |\n| Operating profit/(loss) (\u20acm) | 5,097 | 4,099 | (951) |\n| Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) (\u20acm) | 14,386 | 14,881 | 13,918 |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year (\u20acm) | 536 | (455) | (7,644) |\n| Basic earnings/(loss) per share (\u20acc) | 0.38 | (3.13) | (29.05) |\n| Adjusted basic earnings per share (non-GAAP) (\u20acc) | 8.08 | 5.60 | 6.27 |\n| Cash flow from operating activities (\u20acm) | 17,215 | 17,379 | 12,980 |\n| Free cash flow (pre spectrum, restructuring and integration costs) (non-GAAP) (\u20acm) | 5,019 | 5,700 | 5,443 |\n| Borrowings less cash & cash equivalents (\u20acm) | (61,939) | (61,368) | (39,318) |\n| Net debt (non-GAAP) (\u20acm) | (40,543) | (42,047) | (27,033) |\n| Total dividends per share (\u20acc) | 9.00 | 9.00 | 9.00 |\n\nStrategic progress\n\nDeepening customer engagement\n\n| Deepening customer engagement | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Europe mobile contract customers (million) | 65.4 | 64.4 | 63.2 |\n| Europe broadband customers (million) | 25.6 | 25.0 | 18.8 |\n| Europe on-net gigabit capable connections (million) | 43.7 | 31.9 | 21.9 |\n| Europe Consumer converged customers (million) | 7.9 | 7.2 | 6.6 |\n| Europe mobile contract churn (%) | 13.7 | 14.6 | 15.5 |\n| Africa data users (million) | 84.9 | 82.6 | 75.6 |\n| M-Pesa transaction volume (billion) | 15.2 | 12.2 | 11.0 |\n| Business fixed-line service revenue growth (%) | 3.0 | 3.3 | 3.8 |\n| IoT SIM connections (million) | 123.3 | 102.9 | 84.9 |\n\nAccelerating digital transformation\n\n| Accelerating digital transformation | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-----------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Europe net opex savings (\u20acbn) | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.4 |\n| Europe digital channel sales mix (%) | 26 | 21 | 17 |\n| Europe frequency of customer contact (contacts per year) | 1.4 | 1.4 | 1.5 |\n| Europe MyVodafone app penetration (%) | 63 | 65 | 62 |\n\nImproving asset utilisation\n\n| Improving asset utilisation | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Average mobile data usage per customer in Europe (GB/month) | 7.2 | 5.7 | 3.7 |\n| Europe on-net NGN broadband penetration (%) | 30 | 30 | 28 |\n| Pre-tax return on capital employed (controlled) (non-GAAP) (%) | 5.5 | 6.3 | 5.9 |\n| Post-tax return on capital employed (controlled and associates/joint ventures) (non-GAAP) (%) | 3.9 | 3.9 | 3.5 |\n\nOur people\n\n| Our people | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|------------|------|------|------|\n| Average number of employees and contractors (thousand) | 105 | 104 | 102 |\n| Employee engagement index (%) | 74 | 77 | 80 |\n| Employee turnover rate (voluntary) (%) | 8 | 12 | 13 |\n| Women on the Board (%) | 45 | 42 | 42 |\n| Women in management and leadership roles (%) | 32 | 31 | 31 |\n| Women in total workforce (%) | 40 | 39 | 40 |\n\nNotes:\n1.

Before I comment on the strong progress we have made this year, and the key role Vodafone has played in keeping society connected during the COVID-19 pandemic, I would first like to comment on what attracted me to joining your Board.\n\nThe attraction of Vodafone\n\nVodafone is a dynamic and fast-paced business, operating in an essential industry. It has a clear vision and purpose for society, which in light of the current pandemic is even more relevant than ever. Under Nick\u2019s leadership not only has a lot already been achieved over the last three years, there is still a great opportunity ahead of us.\n\nThe opportunity to oversee and support the long-term success of Vodafone in the next phase of its transformation to become a new generation connectivity and digital services provider for Europe and Africa, enabling an inclusive, sustainable digital society is, I believe, an exceptionally exciting one \u2013 and one I\u2019m fully committed to.\n\nWhilst my induction to Vodafone has been almost entirely digital, I am grateful to the Board, Executive Committee and broader team for the comprehensive on-boarding that I have received and the many extensive engagements covering all aspects of the business. I would also like to thank my predecessor, Gerard Kleisterlee, for his strong support and counsel during my transition to Vodafone.\n\nSupporting society during the COVID-19 crisis\n\nSince I joined the Board, I have been impressed by the Company\u2019s ability to adapt quickly to the changes in circumstances for the business and the demand placed on our service, across all of our markets. The ongoing COVID crisis represents a significant challenge for many businesses and citizens. Yet, Vodafone has continuously adapted throughout this period. The passion and commitment of all of our 105,000 people, combined with the \u2018can-do\u2019 spirit to get things done together, has been essential over the last year.\n\nThe connectivity we provide has been a lifeline for society, enabling people to work, businesses to remain operational, public services to function and people to stay in touch with their family and friends. As a result, the pace of our \u2018social contract\u2019 response to the COVID crisis (so-called \u2018five point plan\u2019) has been significant and, as we did even before this crisis, we will continue to do whatever we can to support the most vulnerable among us. We are also committed to taking urgent action to address the climate change emergency both in our own and our business customers\u2019 footprint. Our high-speed connectivity and digital tools will be critical enablers of the green transition. Similarly, we are rapidly reducing our own environmental footprint, taking the lead in the sector, and demonstrating the value of digital.\n\nResilient performance in a challenging backdrop\n\nDespite the tough operating environment, and unprecedented period of global uncertainty, we delivered a resilient financial performance that was in line with our expectations and guidance for the year.\n\nThis was the result of the strong execution against our strategy, as we further deepened customer engagement and delivered a more consistent commercial performance, accelerated our digital transformation, continued to improve asset utilisation and optimised our portfolio.\n\nTotal revenue declined by 2.6% to \u20ac43.8 billion, with Group organic service revenue returning to growth in the second half of the year. This was despite lower roaming and visitor revenue following a significant reduction in international travel due to COVID-19. Group operating profit increased by \u20ac1.0 billion to \u20ac5.1 billion and basic earnings per share increased to 0.38 eurocents.\n\nThe significant progress we\u2019ve made in improving asset utilisation and reshaping the Group, including the successful IPO of Vantage Towers, is also helping to drive improved returns on capital and a reduction in net debt across the Group \u2013 however there is clearly still more to be done.\n\nThis good financial performance, solid commercial momentum and robust financial position provides the Board with the confidence to declare a total dividend per share of 9.00 eurocents for the year, implying a final dividend per share of 4.5 eurocents which will be paid on 6 August 2021.\n\nShaping industry structure to support the COVID-19 recovery\n\nAs we now look to the challenges faced by governments, regulators and policy makers in enabling and supporting both economic and social recovery, it is clear that the services we provide to people, businesses and public sector organisations are increasingly essential to this broader recovery. Yet, it is also clear to me that policy and regulatory decisions of the last decade have had a material impact on returns for the telecommunications industry, which still weighs heavily on operators\u2019 ability to invest in everything from connectivity infrastructure to new services.\n\nLooking forward, and considering Europe and Africa\u2019s important digital ambitions, there is an ever more urgent need to overcome the shortcomings of the past. Clear actions \u2013 and better cooperation between governments and industry \u2013 are required to create a more healthy and sustainable industry structure that is truly pro-investment, pro-innovation and supportive of returns.\n\nOur social contract embraces this new collaborative, partnership approach with governments, policy makers, regulators and external stakeholders. Through a shared future vision, we believe that both Europe and Africa can overcome their many digital divides and sizeable investment gaps, thereby allowing them to compete more effectively on the global stage and even become pioneers in many areas of the technology ecosystem.\n\nAt the same time, while we have started to see some positive signs of a more healthy industry structure emerge, it is also clear that the steps to date fall far short of what is needed to close the widening investment gaps and build a resilient, inclusive and sustainable digital society.\n\nVodafone is fully committed to delivering its part to achieve truly inclusive digital societies in all communities that we serve. Guided by our purpose, our \u2018social contract\u2019 response to the COVID crisis (so-called \u2018five point plan\u2019) has been significant and, as we did even before this crisis, we will continue to do whatever we can to support the most vulnerable among us. We are also committed to taking urgent action to address the climate change emergency both in our own and our business customers\u2019 footprint.

This includes a Recovery & Resilience facility, which combines \u20ac360 billion of loans and \u20ac312 billion of grants available to European Union Member States. This funding presents a direct and indirect opportunity given at least 20% of the total funding is planned to support the European Commission\u2019s digital transformation agenda.\n\nIn addition, in order to remain competitive and fulfil their social and environmental commitments, companies are increasingly looking to digitalise their operations to become more efficient and limit their environmental impact.\n\nDigital payments & financial services\nThe trend towards more digital forms of payment is growing, with a broader range of financial services now being delivered through apps and online. In Africa, the growth in smartphone penetration is allowing consumers to access digital financial services for the first time, enabling money transfers, loans, insurance and even merchant payments.\n\nOur stakeholders\nThe demands of our stakeholders are continuously evolving. Engaging with them regularly is fundamental to how we operate.\n\nOur customers\nWe are focused on deepening our engagement with our customers to develop long-term valuable and sustainable relationships. Vodafone is the largest mobile and fixed network operator in Europe and a leading global IoT connectivity provider.

Includes greenshoe proceeds of \u20ac0.2 billion received in April 2021.\nMega trends\n\nLong-term trends shaping our industry\n\nThe world continues to evolve rapidly. In part, this is due to the availability of new and transformational technologies, but it is also to do with the way society connects, adapts and makes use of these new digital advances. We have identified five \u2018mega trends\u2019 that will shape our industry in the years to come: remote working, connected devices, adoption of cloud technology, the digital and green transformation of public and private sectors, and digital payments.\n\nRemote working\n\nThe trend towards remote working for employees and businesses was strong before the impact of the pandemic, driven by the changing lifestyle priorities of different demographics. COVID-19 has driven a step-change in demand, driving multiple benefits including a more flexible organisational culture and greater productivity. This trend is driving demand for fast and reliable fixed and mobile connectivity for individual workers, but also emerging cloud architecture, digital security and unified communications solutions for employers.\n\nThe majority of large multinationals already have remote working capabilities, however they are now moving to more efficient technologies. For smaller companies, ranging from corporates to small/medium-sized offices, they rely on network operators such as Vodafone to provide secure remote working solutions. These solutions include virtual private networks, unified communication services and the migration of enterprise applications to the cloud. This is vital for business continuity, and it provides network operators an opportunity to further deepen customer relationships \u2013 offering them a broader range of services.\n\nConnected devices\n\nThe world is becoming ever more connected, and it is not just driven by smartphones. A wide range of new devices, across all sectors and applications, are increasingly being connected to the internet. The number of connected devices, known as the Internet of Things, is expected to more than double to 25 billion by 2025. This is driven by continued reductions in the cost of computing components, advances in cross-device operability and software, and the near-ubiquity of mobile networks.\n\nFor consumers, there is a growing range of applications such as smartwatches, tracking devices for pets, bags and bicycles, and connected vehicles \u2013 which can lower insurance premiums and enable a range of advanced in-vehicle solutions. Network operators are increasingly not only providing the connectivity, but also building the complete end-to-end hardware and software solutions for these devices.\n\nAdoption of cloud technology\n\nOver the last decade, large technology companies have invested heavily in advanced centralised data storage and processing capabilities that organisations and consumers can access remotely through connectivity services (commonly termed \u2018cloud\u2019 technology). As a result, organisations and consumers are increasingly moving away from using their own expensive hardware and device-specific software to using more efficient shared hardware capacity or services over the cloud. This is popular as it allows upfront capital investment savings, the ability to efficiently scale resources to meet demand, easily update systems and increase resiliency. This is driving demand for fast, reliable and secure connectivity with lower latency.\n\nMany small businesses increasingly understand the benefits of cloud technology, however they lack the technical expertise or direct relationships with large enterprise and cloud specialists. This presents an opportunity for network operators, who have strong existing relationships and can effectively navigate moving to the cloud at scale.\n\nFor businesses, the demand for IoT and potential use cases is even more evident. These include solutions such as automated monitoring of energy usage across national grids, tracking consumption in smart buildings and detecting traffic and congestion in cities.\n\nIn environments that are more localised, such as factories and ports, network operators are building and running Mobile Private Networks (MPNs). MPNs offer corporate customers unparalleled security and bespoke network control. As an example, MPNs enable autonomous factories to connect to thousands of robots, enabling them to work in a synchronised way. Once a product leaves the factory it can also be tracked seamlessly through global supply chain management applications, whether it is delivered through the post, a vehicle or even via drones.\n\nIn areas where the same solution can be deployed across multiple sectors, network operators are moving beyond connectivity to provide complex end-to-end hardware and software solutions such as surveillance, smart metering and remote monitoring; and it is often more efficient for these solutions to be created in-house. Scaled operators can leverage their unique position to co-create or partner with nimble start-ups at attractive economics.\n\nNote:\n1. GSMA Intelligence, The Mobile Economy 2020.\nLarger corporates who may already use the cloud today, are progressively moving away from complex systems based on their own servers or single cloud solutions, to multi-cloud offers, sold by network operators and their partners. This approach reduces supplier risk and increases corporate agility and resilience. Large corporates continue to drive higher demand for robust, secure and efficient connectivity services as they transition from their own legacy hardware and services. Cloud providers also recognise the criticality of telecommunications networks. Many cloud providers are partnering with the largest network operators, sometimes through revenue sharing agreements, to develop edge computing solutions which integrate data centres at the edge of telecommunication networks to deliver customers reduced latency. The opportunity is significant as the total addressable market in B2B cloud & security is expected to reach over \u20ac60 billion by 2024 compared to \u20ac40 billion today.\n\nConsumers use cloud solutions for a variety of reasons, including digital storage and online media consumption. Consumer hardware is also now being replaced by cloud-first solutions. For example, new cloud-based gaming services allow consumers to stream complex, bandwidth-heavy computer games directly to their phones or tablets, without the need for expensive dedicated hardware. Fast and reliable connectivity will act as a catalyst for further innovation and consumer applications, many of which do not currently exist today.\n\nDigital and green transformation of the public and private sectors\n\nAs part of the fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Union has launched a series of support mechanisms with \u20ac750 billion available under the banner \u201cNextGenerationEU\u201d. This includes the Recovery & Resilience facility, which combines \u20ac360 billion of loans and \u20ac312 billion of grants available to European Union Member States. Of these grants, approximately 70% of the total will be allocated to European Union Member States in which Vodafone has an operating presence. 70% of these grants are planned to be distributed by the end of 2022. The range of funding presents a direct and indirect opportunity given at least 20% of the total funding is planned to support the European Commission\u2019s digital transformation agenda.\n\nThe UK and many of our African markets have similar stimulus measures in place.\n\nThese support measures will help connect schools, hospitals and businesses to gigabit networks and provide hardware, such as tablets to millions of schoolchildren.\n\nSimilarly, the European Union has committed to be carbon-neutral by 2050. Mobile network operators across Europe will be able to benefit from these funds as they seek to limit their impact on the climate, and help other customers from across the private and public sectors reduce their own energy use and carbon emissions.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe can often lag behind in terms of digital adoption. However, under various government-led support mechanisms, SMEs will be eligible for vouchers, grants and loans to transition to eCommerce, upskill employees, and transition to cloud-based solutions whilst ensuring they are secure as they do so. SMEs will look to trusted and experienced network operators which can offer a full suite of solutions, whilst also help them navigate technical and regulatory processes. Finally, to ensure the benefits of these projects are spread equitably, funding is also being allocated towards rural inclusion to subsidise the building of network infrastructure where it is currently uneconomical for operators to do so.\n\nDigital payments\n\nBusinesses in Europe continue to expand and migrate sales channels from physical premises to online channels such as websites and mobile applications. As a result, businesses increasingly transact through mobile-enabled payment services which remove the need for legacy fixed sales terminals. Consequently, businesses demand reliable and secure mobile connectivity. Consumers are also increasingly transitioning away from using cash, to digital payment methods conducted directly via mobile phones or smartwatches, further increasing the importance of mobile networks.\n\nIn Africa, digital payments are primarily conducted via mobile phones through payment networks owned and operated by network operators, and the value of transactions processed per day is expected to reach over $3 billion globally by 2022, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020. Consumers are also moving beyond peer-to-peer transactions as rising smartphone penetration drives the adoption of mobile payment applications. Network operators are using these applications to sell additional financial services focused products, ranging from advances on mobile airtime and device insurance to more complex offerings such as life insurance. This plays a critical role in improving financial inclusion for millions of people across Africa where the traditional banking sector has not been able to reach.\n\nNotes:\n1.

We have also launched and embedded \u2018second\u2019 brands across our markets and now have over 5 million active users across our second brands in Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain.\n\nWe have maintained strong commercial momentum in our fixed business and over the past three years we have added 4.3 million NGN broadband customers in Europe. We also have converged customer plans available in all major markets. By deepening the relationship we have with our customers we have been able to drive a significant improvement in customer loyalty, with mobile contract churn in Europe reducing by 2.3 percentage points over the last three years.\n\nIn Africa, demand for mobile data remains significant given the lack of fixed line infrastructure. There is also a substantial opportunity to grow M-Pesa (our mobile payments platform) and expand it into new financial and digital services. During the last three years, we have continued to see significant demand for mobile data and monthly average data usage in our markets outside Europe has increased to 4.6 GB (FY18: 2.2 GB). The total number of data users in Africa has grown from 72.4 million to 84.9 million. The number of M-Pesa and other mobile money customers has continued to grow strongly, with a total of 48.3 million active users now registered.\n\nAccelerating digital transformation\n\nWe have now exceeded our original three-year target of at least \u20ac1.2 billion of net savings from operating expenses in Europe and Common Functions, with cumulative savings of \u20ac1.3 billion, equivalent to a c.15% net reduction. This focus on efficiency, delivered through standardisation, integration and digitalisation of our operations, has enabled our adjusted EBITDA margin to be resilient during the pandemic and remain broadly stable at 32.8%. In the last three years, we have introduced 5,500 role efficiencies in our shared service centres (\u2018_VOIS\u2019) and approximately 30% of Group employees now work in our shared operations. We are continuing to transform the business and evolve the Group digital toolset \u2013 including our AI assistant, TOBi, and Robotic Process Automation (\u2018RPA\u2019) \u2013 in order to further our productivity leadership. We have also increased our digital sales, now 26% of total sales across Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain, and optimised our retail footprint.\n\nImproving asset utilisation\n\nThree years ago, we began a series of activities to improve our asset utilisation to support a recovery in return on capital employed (ROCE). We have reached network sharing agreements with leading mobile network operators in most of our European markets, established Vantage Towers as a separate business to consolidate the ownership and operations of our passive mobile network infrastructure, and signed significant wholesale agreements in both our fixed and mobile networks.\n\nDespite the strong delivery of our strategic priorities at pace, our post-tax return ROCE of 3.9% remains below our cost of capital. In a subsequent section, we have set out our growth model and capital allocation framework and explained how we will drive shareholder returns through efficiency and growth.\n\nOptimising the portfolio\n\nIn order to achieve our strategic objectives to focus on converged connectivity markets in Europe, and mobile data and payments in Africa, we began a large programme to rationalise our portfolio in 2019. Our portfolio optimisation programme has had three overriding objectives as summarised below:\n\n| Objective | Transactions |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| 1. Focus on Europe & Africa | 5 disposals including New Zealand and Malta |\n| | 4 acquisitions, including purchase of HDG shares from minority shareholders |\n| | 3 mergers in Australia and India (Vodafone Idea & Indus Towers) |\n| 2. Achieve convergence with local scale | 3 acquisitions in Germany, Greece and Eastern Europe |\n| 3. Enable structural shift in asset utilisation | 2 tower mergers in Italy and Greece, as well as subsequent sale of INWIT stake |\n| | IPO of Vantage Towers |\n\nScan or click to watch our Chief Executive summarise our performance this year and introduce the next phase of our strategy: investors.vodafone.com/videos-strategy\nCreating a new generation connectivity & digital services provider\n\nThe next phase of our strategy\n\nWe have completed the first phase of our strategy to reshape Vodafone. We are now well positioned for the next phase in our multi-year transformation.\n\nThe next phase of our strategy focuses on three customer commitments and three enabling strategies, all of which work towards growing our revenues, expanding our margins, improving our cash conversion, and ensuring capital is allocated effectively.\n\nThese areas of focus, combined with our existing strategic execution, will create sustainable value for our shareholders and returns above our weighted average cost of capital.\n\nOur customer commitments\n\n- **Best connectivity products & services**\n  Grow revenue through providing the best core connectivity products and services in each of our markets for both consumers and businesses.\n\n- **Leading innovation in digital services**\n  Leveraging our unique platforms and partnering with leading technology firms to provide customers with a \u2018best on Vodafone\u2019 user experience.\n\n- **Outstanding digital experiences**\n  Using our leading digital architecture to provide a seamless customer experience across all channels \u2013 app, online, retail and physical delivery at home.\n\nOur enabling strategies\n\n- **Simplified & most efficient operator**\n  Delivering further efficiencies through digital transformation, standardisation of products and procedures, and automation of processes at scale.\n\n- **Social contract shaping digital society**\n  Influencing policy and regulation to shape a more healthy industry structure, and build a resilient, inclusive and sustainable digital society.\n\n- **Leading gigabit networks**\n  Maintaining our leading gigabit networks as we provide our customers with the best connectivity products and \u2018best on Vodafone\u2019 user experience.\n\nInvesting in our key differentiators\n\nOur leading scale and assets provide us with a significant advantage.\n\n- **Leading scale in core connectivity**\n  In Europe, we are the leading converged connectivity provider with 7.9 million converged customers, 113 million mobile connections, 142 million marketable NGN broadband homes, cover 98% of the population in the markets we operate in with 4G, and have launched 5G in 240 cities across 10 markets.\n\n  In Africa, we are the leading provider of mobile data and mobile payment services.

We feel positively about the opportunity technology gives us all when combined with the right human spirit.\n\nNotes:\n1. Including VodafoneZiggo\n2. Africa including Egypt, Ghana and Safaricom\nOur financial strengths\n\nWe have a resilient operating model, a robust financial position, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation.\n\nResilient and growing revenue streams\nWe generate revenue primarily through monthly recurring contracts or subscriptions \u2013 providing us with robust and resilient revenue streams. We are also growing quickly in new growth areas such as IoT, cloud & security, and next-generation fixed-line services.\n\nSignificant opportunities to lower our cost base\nBy being Digital First, radically simpler, and leveraging our Group scale we are able to structurally transform our cost base. Over the past three years we have delivered \u20ac1.3 billion of net opex savings in Europe, and are targeting a 20% reduction in our European cost base over five years to FY23.\n\nRobust balance sheet\nOur average tenure of debt is 12 years (excluding debt issued by Vantage Towers), we have no significant short-term refinancing needs, and we have a strong liquidity position with cash and short term Investments of \u20ac9.8 billion and unused facilities of \u20ac7.4 billion.\n\nDisciplined approach to capital allocation\n\nOur capital allocation framework\nEnabling us to balance our three capital allocation priorities:\n\nInvest in critical infrastructure\n\u20ac7.9 billion\nCash capital additions in FY21\n\nMaintain a robust balance sheet\n2.8x\nNet debt/adjusted EBITDA\n\nShareholder distribution\n9.00 eurocents\nDividends per share in FY21\n\nOur medium-term ambitions\n\nDisciplined capital allocation to drive shareholder returns.\n\nValue model\nMedium-term ambition\n\nConsistent revenue growth\nGrowth in both Europe & Africa\n\nOngoing margin expansion\nMid-single digit adjusted EBITDA\\(^1\\) growth\n\nGood cash conversion\nMid-single digit adjusted FCF\\(^2\\) growth\n\nDisciplined capital allocation\nNet debt to adjusted EBITDA: 2.5-3.0x\n\nSustainable value creation\nROCE\\(^3\\) greater than WACC\nA minimum dividend of 9.00 eurocents per share per annum\n\nNotes:\n1.

We believe that Vodafone has a significant role to play in contributing to the societies in which we operate and we want to enable an inclusive and sustainable digital society. Our sustainable business strategy helps the delivery of our targets across three purpose pillars: Inclusion for All, Planet and Digital Society. We have clear and robust short, medium and long-term targets across all three pillars.\n\nRead more on pages 23-31\n\nRead more on our capital allocation framework on page 20\n\nScan or click to watch our Chief Financial Officer summarise our financial performance in FY21: investors.vodafone.com/videos-cfo\nThe next phase in our strategy \u2013 a new generation connectivity and digital services provider\n\nFollowing the significant actions we have taken to reshape the Group, we are focused on growing our converged connectivity markets in Europe, and mobile data and payments in Africa. The next phase of our strategy focuses on three customer commitments and three enabling strategies, all of which work together towards realising our vision to become a new generation connectivity and digital services provider for Europe and Africa, enabling an inclusive and sustainable digital society.\n\nBest connectivity products & services\n\nConsumer Europe\nIn Europe, we are a leading converged connectivity provider with 7.9 million converged customers, 113 million mobile connections, 142 million marketable NGN broadband homes, we cover 98% of the population in the markets we operate in with 4G, and we have launched 5G in 240 cities in 10 markets in Europe. We have achieved this leading position by focusing on our core fixed and mobile connectivity. We are enhancing our products through capacity and speed upgrades, unlimited mobile plans, a distinct tiered branding hierarchy and convergent product bundles.\n\nConsumer Africa\nIn Africa, we are the leading provider of mobile data and mobile payment services. We have 178 million mobile customers in 8 markets which represent 40% of Africa\u2019s total Gross Domestic Product. We are the leading mobile connectivity provider by revenue market share in 7 markets. Excluding Kenya, we cover 62% of the population in the markets in which we operate with 4G services. Our M-Pesa financial services platform processed over 15 billion transactions during the year.\n\nVodafone Business\nIn March 2021, we held a virtual briefing on Vodafone Business for investors and analysts. This briefing outlined the following four key messages.\n\n1. We operate in attractive markets\n   We serve over 6 million private and public sector customers of all sizes, across Europe and Africa, in addressable markets totalling over \u20ac100 billion. With more employees seeking flexible working, gigabit connectivity with low latency and both public and private organisations driving digitalisation, we have a compelling structural opportunity, with expected addressable market growth of c.8% per annum.\n\n2. We have unique scale & capabilities\n   We have the scale, expertise and technology to successfully compete in these attractive markets. We are expanding our portfolio of products and services to enhance our provision of core connectivity services, with in-house innovation in IoT and partnerships with leading technology companies to offer cloud, security and unified communications services.\n\n3. We have strong operating momentum\n   Over the last three years, we have delivered a step-change in our commercial performance, leading to service revenue growth (excluding roaming and visitor revenue) of 1.8% in FY21, with total service revenue now over \u20ac10 billion. This has been driven by ongoing improvements in our commercial momentum, strong support to our customers throughout the pandemic, clear understanding of our economic model and disciplined prioritisation of high marginal return on capital opportunities.\n\n4. We are on a clear growth pathway\n   Our strategy is grounded in our purpose to connect for a better future and is focused on three core elements. Firstly, to be the trusted partner for small and medium-sized enterprises. Secondly, to be the gigabit connectivity provider of choice to large enterprises. Thirdly, to be the leading end-to-end provider of IoT solutions for every organisation.\n\nLeading innovation in digital services\n\nAlongside optimising our core connectivity services, we are building platforms that will allow \u2018best on Vodafone\u2019 experiences. Our primary areas of focus are premium TV in Europe; financial services in Africa; Vodafone Business specific digital platforms across the Group; and the IoT for both consumers and businesses.\n\nPremium TV\nOur consumer TV proposition now has over 22 million subscribers in 11 markets, making Vodafone the 2nd largest TV provider in Europe. We partner with 18 leading global content producers and distributors such as Disney, ViacomCBS, WarnerMedia, Netflix, Amazon and Comcast. Our premium TV offering is delivered through a seamlessly integrated, multi-device platform. This enables consumers to watch whatever they want, whenever they want on any connected device.\n\nFinancial services\nWe remain focused on embedding Vodacom as a leading pan-African technology company and M-Pesa offers a unique opportunity to extend our reach further into financial services through our investments in financial, digital and lifestyle services. This provides us with opportunities to enhance our relationship with the 178 million mobile customers we serve across our African footprint. In particular, we note our partnership with Alipay and the imminent launch of our single lifestyle app for customers and merchants in South Africa that promotes greater financial inclusion. We see this super-app as a precursor to M-Pesa\u2019s evolution, supporting accelerated growth across our financial services\u2019 businesses and assisting us in connecting hundreds of millions more in Africa so that no one is left behind.\n\nVodafone Business digital platforms\nWe are extending the breadth of our propositions to private and public sector organisations beyond connectivity. We estimate the addressable market for unified communications, cloud applications and digital security is over \u20ac50 billion and growing at over 10% per annum. We are partnering with leading technology firms such as Microsoft, Accenture, IBM, Google, Cisco and Amazon to provide our customers with best-in-class products and services. We provided further information on this growth opportunity as part of the Vodafone Business virtual investor briefing.\n\nIoT\nOur end-to-end IoT proposition is the largest of its kind globally. Our Business IoT offering for private and public sector clients was discussed at our recent virtual investor briefing. Our addressable market has already reached \u20ac10 billion and is expected to grow at 16% per annum over the medium term. At the end of March 2021, we had over 120 million devices connected to our network, including 35 million connected cars. We have also developed over 100 tailored end-to-end solutions for a range of sectors including healthcare, distribution, manufacturing and automotive.\n\nOur consumer IoT offering has now connected over 1.4 million devices such as the watches through our OneNumber service and our \u2018Curve\u2019 mobile tracking device. In addition, we recently launched a new smart kids\nwatch, developed with The Walt Disney Company. We will be expanding on the opportunity for consumer IoT and other consumer growth opportunities at a virtual investor briefing in December 2021.\n\n**Outstanding digital experiences**\n\nOver the last thirty years, Vodafone\u2019s approach to retail, distribution and customer care has evolved in line with broader social and technological development. During the 1990s, we operated primarily through a traditional retail \u2018high street\u2019 store model, whereby the vast majority of customer interaction was face-to-face and involved a high degree of manual process. In the 2000s, we introduced a multi-channel model, in which customers could also choose to interact with us through dedicated websites or contact centres, in addition to the retail stores. In the 2010s, we began to combine the models into an omni-channel experience, through which our customers could move between different channels for different missions.\n\nIn the new decade, our ambition is for customers to primarily interact with us in a \u2018Digital First\u2019 manner. Our investments in this area have already resulted in our artificial intelligence-enabled assistant (\u2018TOBi\u2019) resolving 63% of customer support interactions with no human interaction and an approximate 5% reduction in the frequency of customer contacts per year to 1.4. As we look ahead, we expect the majority of new customers will join Vodafone through digital channels and the overwhelming majority of customer interaction and queries will be fulfilled through either the MyVodafone app or support provided through \u2018TOBi\u2019. We will then support the ongoing customer relationship through data-driven and automated targeting of upselling, cross-selling and contract extension. This Digital First customer experience will improve customer loyalty and reduce the service cost per customer.\n\nWe will be expanding on our plans for outstanding digital experiences at a virtual investor briefing in December 2021.\n\n**Simplified, most efficient operations**\n\nThe connectivity value chain involves a high degree of repeatable processes across all of our markets, such as procurement, network deployment, network operations, sales activities, customer support operations, and billing and transaction processing. This has provided us with a significant opportunity to standardise processes across markets, relocate operations to lower cost centres of excellence and apply automation at scale, delivering best in class efficiency levels.\n\nIn the next phase of our strategy, we are pursuing these opportunities through two significant evolutions in our operating model. Firstly, integrating our network and digital teams in Europe and, secondly, streamlining our approach to product development and customer care within our European commercial teams. These programmes will be key components in delivering the next phase of our ongoing efficiency programme, which targets a total net reduction of Europe and Common Function operating expenses of 20% by FY23 (versus a FY18 baseline).\n\n**Integrating network & digital teams**\n\nWe are integrating our European network and digital teams. This new structure will drive effectiveness, increase our speed of execution, standardise key processes, and support the codification of what is the best solution for Group implementation. We will increase our IT and digital capabilities, standardise key development environments and enhance coding collaboration, while internalising software engineering capabilities, further leveraging our _VOIS shared services environment.\n\nThis new operating model for our technology teams will enable our multi-year journey to redefine our technology architecture following a \u2018Telco as a Service\u2019 (TaaS) model. Our TaaS model is based on two existing layers of inter-connected digital technology. We have created a standardised suite of customer and user-facing interfaces for an entire omni-channel journey and called it OnePlatform. The OnePlatform suite is powered by our Digital eXperience Layer (DXL). DXL refers to the abstraction layer in our IT architecture which separates customer-facing micro-services requiring frequent and rapid adjustment from back-end systems such as billing and CRM.\n\nWe have already moved more than half our core network functions to the cloud in Europe, supporting voice core, data core and service platforms on over 1,300 virtual network functions. In Europe, we now operate a single digital network architecture across all markets, enabling the design, build, test and deployment of next generation core network functions more securely, 40% faster and at 50% lower cost. Similarly, more than half of our IP applications are now virtualised and running in the cloud.\n\n**Product development consistency & common customer care**\n\nTo meet the needs of our customers, both individuals and businesses, we need to bring innovative and differentiated products to market and scale them across our footprint much faster than we do today. We also need to further leverage the scale of our footprint and avoid duplication and fragmentation of our resources. We are simplifying and unifying our approach to product development, reducing time and resources for new products from the idea creation phase to launch, with a new process to allocate and sustain funding across our markets.\n\nWe are also accelerating the deployment and adoption of digital tools through common digital platforms with the ambition to move to one \u2018My Vodafone\u2019 app and, over time, one TOBi chatbot platform. This will also help us deliver a more consistent customer experience regardless of geography, with further automation and simplification.\n\n**Social contract shaping industry structure to improve returns**\n\nOver the last decade, the performance of the European telecommunications industry has been weaker than other regions, which market commentators largely attribute to its regulatory environment. European regulation differs in both its fragmented approach to spectrum licensing and market structure, compared with North America or Asia.\n\nIn 2019, we introduced our \u2018social contract\u2019, which represents the partnerships we want to develop with governments, policy makers and civil society. We believe the industry needs a pro-investment, pro-innovation partnership approach to ensure Europe can compete in the global digital economy and be at the forefront of technology ecosystems. This requires healthy market structures, an end to extractive spectrum auctions, support for equipment vendor diversity, a defined framework for network sharing, and regulation that enables the physical deployment of network infrastructure, as well as rewards quality \u2013 such as security, resilience and coverage \u2013 with fair prices.\n\nFollowing our efforts and society\u2019s increasing reliance on our connectivity infrastructure and services, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are beginning to see positive signs of a healthier industry structure emerge. Recent spectrum auctions in the UK, Greece and Hungary were conducted in a positive manner and completed with spectrum being assigned at sustainable prices, in line or below European benchmark levels. Authorities are recognising that operators need to be able to focus available private funds for fast deployment of new infrastructure and services.\n\nWe have also seen national governments increase support, such as state-subsidies for rural networks in the UK and Germany. A key area will be shaping Member State recovery funds and how at least 20% of the \u00a3750 billion NextGenerationEU funding targeted for digital initiatives is distributed.\n\nWe will play our part by investing in our high-quality network infrastructure and will continue to work closely with regulators and policy makers in order to create a more healthy and sustainable industry structure that is truly pro-investment, pro-innovation and supportive of returns.\nStrategic review (continued)\n\nLeading gigabit networks\n\nIn order to provide our customers with the best connectivity products and \u2018best on Vodafone\u2019 connectivity platforms, we need to have leading gigabit network infrastructure in each of our markets. Importantly, we must also ensure that our customers recognise and value the quality of our gigabit network infrastructure. We will be hosting a dedicated virtual investor briefing on technology and our approach on 17 June 2021.\n\nIn mobile, we are currently deploying mobile network infrastructure to deliver 5G connectivity. So far, we have launched 5G services in 240 cities, in 10 markets in Europe. 5G services provide \u2018real world\u2019 speeds well in excess of 100 Mbps, compared with 4G which provides \u2018real world\u2019 speeds of 20-35 Mbps. In addition to the speed advantage, 5G networks that are \u2018built right\u2019 and with longer-term competitive advantage in mind, provide more uses cases, and significant capacity and efficiency advantages, ultimately lowering the cost per gigabyte of mobile data provision.\n\nHowever, the European mobile sector is also utilising dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology to share existing 4G spectrum to provide a more limited 5G experience.\n\nUnderpinning our 5G network infrastructure is our majority shareholding in Vantage Towers AG.\n\nClick to read more about Vantage Towers: vantagetowers.com\n\nAlongside our 5G mobile network infrastructure is our NGN fixed-line network infrastructure. We can now reach 142 million homes across 12 markets in Europe (including VodafoneZiggo). This marketable base is connected through a mix of owned NGN network (56 million homes, of which 44 million are gigabit-capable), strategic partnerships (24 million homes) and wholesale arrangements (62 million homes). This network provides us with the largest marketable footprint of any fixed-line provider in Europe. In Germany, our owned network covering 24 million households is being progressively upgraded to the latest DOCSIS 3.1 standard, which provides us with a structural speed advantage over the incumbent. Over the medium-term we will continue to increase the proportion of our Europe customers that can receive gigabit-capable connections through our owned network and continue to work with strategic partners to provide cable and fibre access.\n\nCommitted to improving returns\n\nOutlook for FY22\n\nOur performance during FY21 has been in line with our expectations and demonstrates the relative resilience of our operating model. We remain focused on the delivery of the next phase of our strategy.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA will be referred to as \u2018adjusted EBITDAaL\u2019 from FY22 onwards, with no change to the underlying definition. Free cash flow (pre spectrum, restructuring and integration costs) will be referred to as \u2018adjusted free cash flow\u20191, and excludes Vantage Towers growth capital additions.\n\nBased on the current prevailing assessments of the global macroeconomic outlook:\n\n- Adjusted EBITDAaL1 is expected to be between \u20ac15.0 - \u20ac15.4 billion in FY22, and\n- Adjusted free cash flow2 is expected to be at least \u20ac5.2 billion in FY22.\n\nDisciplined capital allocation to drive shareholder returns\n\nThe objectives of our portfolio activities over the last three years have been to focus on our two scaled geographic platforms in Europe and Africa; achieve converged scale in our chosen markets; and deliver a structural shift in asset utilisation. We are now a matrix of country operations, products and platforms and will continue to be disciplined in managing our portfolio, following three principles:\n\n- we aim to continue to focus on the converged connectivity markets in Europe, and mobile data and payments in Africa;\n- we aim to achieve returns above the local cost of capital in all of our markets; and\n- we consider whether we are the best owner (i.e. whether the asset adds value to the Group and the Group adds value to the asset) and whether there are any pragmatic and value-creating alternatives.\n\nOur capital allocation priorities are to support investment in connectivity infrastructure; maintain a robust balance sheet; and support improved shareholder distribution.\n\nOur growth strategy requires a greater level of investment, in four major areas.\n\n- We will continue to invest in leading gigabit networks by upgrading our fixed networks and rolling out 5G \u2018built right\u2019. To help fund this, our new Technology operating model will drive a higher level of efficiency in unitary spend, while greater standardisation will eliminate duplication.\n- We will have a stronger, more comprehensive product offering in every market, particularly in Vodafone Business, to accelerate our revenue and profit growth.\n- We will accelerate our digital capabilities, which will ultimately help us sustain margin expansion, strengthen our direct channels and build further differentiation in our customer offer.\n- We are retaining the flexibility to support Vantage Towers in realising its own growth ambitions, particularly in the high incremental returns opportunities of new build-to-suit sites and ground-lease buyouts.\n\nMedium-term financial ambition\n\nDuring this next phase of our ongoing transformation to be a new generation connectivity and digital services provider, we are committed to improving returns. The table below sets our model for value creation, alongside our medium-term financial ambition.\n\n| Value model | Medium-term ambition |\n|-------------|----------------------|\n| Consistent revenue growth | Growth in both Europe & Africa |\n| + Ongoing margin expansion | Mid-single digit adjusted EBITDAaL1 growth |\n| + Good cash conversion | Mid-single digit adjusted FCF2 growth |\n| + Disciplined capital allocation | Net debt to adjusted EBITDA: 2.5-3.0x |\n| = Sustainable value creation | ROCE3 greater than WACC |\n\nA minimum dividend of 9.00 eurocents per share per annum\n\nNotes:\n1. Adjusted EBITDAaL is equivalent to FY21 definition and calculation of adjusted EBITDA.\n2. Adjusted free cash flow is free cash flow before spectrum, restructuring integration costs and Vantage Towers growth capital additions. Growth capital additions is on a cash basis and includes expenditure on new sites, ground lease optimisation and other adjacency opportunities as defined by Vantage Towers.\n3. Pre-tax return on capital employed (controlled).\nOur people strategy\n\nOur vision is to create an inclusive environment, which is supportive of growth and where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\n\nWe are now beginning the next phase in our transformation to become a new generation connectivity and digital services provider for Europe and Africa. Our people strategy will accelerate this transition, by creating a place where everyone can truly belong, innovate, work effectively and fulfil their potential.\n\nVodafone Spirit\n\nOur culture \u2014 called the \u2018Vodafone Spirit\u2019 \u2014 outlines the beliefs we stand for and the four key behaviours enabling our strategy and purpose. The Vodafone Spirit is the catalyst for change, underpinning the successful and sustainable delivery of our transformation.\n\nThis year we focused on embedding Spirit at the individual, team, leader and organisation level.\n\nAt the start of the financial year, we launched a survey called \u2018Spirit Beat\u2019 to replace our annual employee survey. We use Spirit Beat surveys to measure our culture and its impact. The results \u2014 shown in the table below \u2014 show a strong adoption of the Spirit beliefs and behaviours. In the second survey undertaken in January 2021, scores remained relatively consistent in a time of unprecedented change. The scores also outlined strengths and areas of focus to embed our culture further.\n\nOur Spirit Beat surveys are conducted using artificial intelligence and the results are used to encourage the adoption of our Spirit behaviours. Following completion and based on confidential survey responses, all employees receive automated and personalised coaching tips called \u2018nudges\u2019 over a 20-week period, to support behaviour change and the creation of new habits. These personalised nudges create a continuous feedback loop and over 750,000 nudges have been sent to employees so far. Subsequent analysis has shown the value of these nudges: 71% of colleagues found nudges useful, and data shows that teams with managers who embraced the Vodafone Spirit had a higher Spirit Index (+13) and employee engagement score (+15) compared to managers who did not.\n\nSpirit Beat surveys\n\n|                      | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n| Earn customer loyalty| 72   | 74   |\n| Experiment, learn fast| 77   | 78   |\n| Create the future    | 75   | 75   |\n| Get it done, together| 76   | 77   |\n| Overall Spirit Index\u00b9| 75   | 76   |\n| Response rate        | 86%  | 84%  |\n\nNote:\n\u00b9 The overall Spirit index reflects the average of the four Spirit behaviour scores.\n\nInsights from our Spirit Beat surveys have informed our approach as we plan the next phase of embedding the Vodafone Spirit within our culture. We will continue to use AI-driven nudges and reinforce Spirit behaviours through our reward and recognition tools. We are embedding Spirit into our performance development approach to help us attract, retain and develop future talent to deliver our strategy, and are refreshing our global leadership development suite to support leaders to role-model Spirit behaviours. Aligned with Spirit, a new leadership assessment will be introduced to support leadership selection and we will continue to activate Spirit through Future Ready ways of working such as remote hiring and hybrid working.\n\nOur senior leadership are accountable for our culture transformation. The Board has monitored the launch and progress of Spirit, and our Executive Committee is regularly involved in discussions on survey results and actions.\n\nAs leadership is essential for driving the transformation, we have invested in developing inclusive leaders who drive growth and innovation, act as role models, coach and empower teams, and lead with Spirit behaviours.\n\nIn June 2020, we launched a leadership programme called the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) Spirit Accelerator for 277 of our senior leaders. This consisted of a series of leadership talks on the topics of resilience, psychological safety, adaptability, the future of work and growth mindset, as well as coaching delivered through a digital platform.\n\nAgile and efficient operating model\n\nDuring the year, we have worked to simplify our operating model, leveraging our global scale. We initiated one of our largest ever organisational changes to accelerate our transformation into a new generation connectivity and digital services provider for Europe and Africa. This consists of three major initiatives, effective from 1 April 2021:\n\n- **Product operating model**: We will establish a simplified and unified approach to product development, to shorten the time between idea creation of new products and launch. The new model will help us to leverage our scale when bringing innovative products to market and scale them across our footprint faster.\n\n- **Technology operating model**: We will create one integrated European network and IT/digital team across the Group, to drive efficiency, increase speed of execution, standardise key processes, and codify the best solutions for implementation across all of our markets.\n\n- **Customer operations model**: To prevent duplication in the creation of digital tools to serve our customers, we will move to common digital platforms across our entire footprint to deliver a consistent experience.\n\nOur transformation has provided a critical opportunity to embed Spirit more deeply into our operating model, organisation, and ways of working. As we have accelerated our transformation, we have codified the critical enablers of successful strategy execution, building on the results of the McKinsey Execution Excellence survey sent to 1,193 senior leaders from Vodafone. Vodafone scored above the benchmark in all areas, and together with structured leadership interviews and best practice sharing, the survey has provided us with the data and insights to define key success metrics for execution excellence.\n\nWe also continued to build an agile culture in order to accelerate our digital transformation, simplify our ways of working and enable quick and insight-led decision-making. We made good progress on implementing our new digital operating model, with 67 active tribes and 441 squads in 13 different markets.\n\nLastly, to support our transformation into Europe\u2019s leading connectivity provider, we integrated the Liberty Global organisations and people in Germany and central eastern Europe, as well as AbCom in Albania following recent acquisitions. We also successfully established Vantage Towers, our European tower company which listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange in March 2021.\nDiverse talent and future ready skills\n\nAs we evolve our operating model and execute our strategy, we have focused on developing diverse talent for the future, and accelerating reskilling and upskilling at scale.\n\nThis year, we created talent and succession pools for our most senior roles, as well as a pool for our female talent. These pools are reviewed and updated at the annual Executive Committee talent review and are considered by the Board.\n\nThe transformation into a new generation connectivity and digital services provider requires new skills and capabilities in our organisation, such as software engineering, automation and data analysis. To develop future skills at scale, we ran a skills transformation pilot in Italy, involving 10 functions, and more than 4,600 people (86% of local headcount). The results were encouraging, showing that there are almost as many future opportunities as there are roles that will change, highlighting the need for reskilling and upskilling programmes at scale. As part of the Italy pilot, we have successfully reskilled 2,000 people to date, of whom 115 have been redeployed to new roles. Through the pandemic, we have also prioritised reskilling for those whose roles were paused during lockdowns, such as retail employees reskilling as call support staff.\n\nWe have also continued to support the personal and professional growth of our people through the pandemic by moving all of our learning initiatives online. During the year, 85% of employees completed non-mandatory training during the year, with an average of 2.8 hours per month (including the skills transformation pilot in Italy). During the year, we invested an average of \u20ac470 into training for each employee to build future capabilities.\n\nWe continue to accelerate our skills transformation programme and will shortly launch a new tool which allows employees to update their skills profiles. This new functionality will help us measure and validate proficiency levels, as well as support our new global mentoring tool. We are targeting an 80% completion rate for our new skills profiles and a year-on-year increase in employees completing non-mandatory training.\n\nTo execute our strategy and bring our purpose to life, we also invested in youth hiring (6,974 hires, of which 757 graduates) whilst providing digital learning experiences to 30,601 young people, through local work experience programmes and initiatives.\n\nTo attract, engage and retain diverse talent, we launched our new Employer Value Proposition \u201cTogether We Can\u201d in March 2021, bringing our culture and purpose to life for candidates and employees.\n\nDigital and personalised experience\n\nOur people experience is informed by employee insights and guided by our culture. Ensuring employees are excited about the opportunities our transformation brings and placing them at the heart of the change is critical to drive our strategy at pace.\n\nFuture ready framework\n\nThis year, we introduced our future ready framework as an immediate response to the pandemic and began to rethink future ways of working. The framework is based on the outcomes of internal and external research, including two internal surveys, a business customer survey, 70 interviews and almost 100 video diaries, alongside the analysis of internal data and external trends. The data confirmed that our office-based employees, while missing the social office connection, strongly support increased adoption of remote working, and our leaders foresee their teams using office spaces to collaborate rather than for individual work. At the same time, we observed sustained levels of productivity.\n\nAs a result, we have introduced further flexibility to our working practices through new policies issued in March 2021. Our remote working policy sets global standards for new hybrid ways of working including an average split between remote and in-office working of 60:40 (depending on the specific role). Where appropriate, our remote hiring policy will also allow our teams to source skills irrespective of location.\n\nWe recognise that effective hybrid ways of working require new technology and policies. We have deployed digital collaboration and time management tools, such as Microsoft Teams and MyAnalytics, and introduced meeting guidelines to reduce meeting duration by 25%.\n\nWe have also started to reimagine how we will use our offices going forward, with the target of having approximately 80% of our office space dedicated to collaboration and co-creation. We have initiated pilots in offices in the Czech Republic and UK, leveraging our own IoT technology tracking how office space is used, as well as room booking.\n\nWe maintained strong relationships with the workers councils and unions, with approximately 22,000 people covered by collective bargaining agreements globally. This year, we reached several agreements with the unions as we began to shape the future of work. For example, in Italy, employees will work between 60-80% remotely post-COVID depending on their role and have guaranteed rights to disconnect during non-working hours.\n\nPulse surveys\n\nWe place significant importance on listening to the feedback of our colleagues. During the year we ran six pulse surveys to listen to employee feedback and used the results to inform our COVID-19 response plans.\n\nPulse surveys\n\n| How are you feeling? | Nov 2020 | Sept 2020 | July 2020 | April 2020 | April 2021 | April 2022 |\n|----------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Support you need to do your job effectively? | 82 | 83 | 83 | 85 | 84 | 85 |\n| Connected to your team? | 79 | 81 | 81 | 84 | 84 | 83 |\n| Response rate | 64% | 59% | 57% | 62% | 60% | 55% |\n\nNotes:\n1. During the early stages of the pandemic, we ran a number of pulse surveys to regularly check in with our employees.\n\nPay, benefits and wellbeing\n\nAs part of our people experience, we continued to ensure pay, benefits, and wellbeing propositions are competitive and fair.\n\nWe have simplified our reward approach to encourage collective performance and increased focus on recognition, launching our peer-to-peer recognition tool \u2018Thank You\u2019 (with 30,864 awarded during the year) and increasing the available budget for Vodafone Stars, our cash recognition programme. We also continued to apply our Fair Pay principles across all markets, working with the Fair Wage Network to ensure a good standard of living in each market.\n\nWe remained focused on physical and mental wellbeing, with a variety of training and services available in each market. In the UK we moved onsite medical services to online, including GP and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) services. Provision of employee assistance programmes and psychological support services continued to grow, particularly in Italy, Albania, Romania, as well as our shared service centres in Romania and Hungary.\n\nDigital tools\n\nOur people experience and strategy execution is powered by our digital tools and systems. We have established SuccessFactors as the single foundational platform and integrated new tools and apps such as Humu for Spirit Beat, DocuSign, our diversity data profile page, and domestic violence portal. To effectively support the transformation, we kicked off the \u201cfuture ready HR\u201d programme aiming to build a more digital and agile HR team. We have started to experiment with new solutions in our markets, such as a new digital onboarding process in Spain, and we will continue to implement advanced digital tools to support reskilling at scale, strategic workforce planning and recruiting.\nOur financial performance\n\nResilient performance, in line with our expectations\n\n- Total revenue declined by 2.6% to \u20ac43.8 billion (FY20: \u20ac45.0 billion), as our good underlying momentum and the benefit from the acquisition of Liberty Global\u2019s assets in Germany and Central and Eastern Europe was offset by lower revenue from roaming, visitors and handset sales, adverse foreign exchange movements and the disposal of Vodafone New Zealand.\n- Operating profit increased by 24.3% to \u20ac5.1 billion (FY20: \u20ac4.1 billion). Compared to the prior year period, we recognised lower gains on disposals, no impairment losses, and we no longer recognised Vodafone\u2019s share of losses related to Vodafone Idea following the write down of the asset to nil in FY20. On an underlying basis, performance was broadly stable as lower adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by lower restructuring costs, depreciation and amortisation and a higher share of profits from associates and joint ventures.\n- Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 1.2% to \u20ac14.4 billion (FY20: \u20ac14.9 billion) as the decline in revenue was partially offset by strong cost control, with a net reduction in our Europe and Common Functions operating expenditure of \u20ac0.5 billion.\n- Cash inflow from operating activities decreased by 0.9% to \u20ac17.2 billion (FY20: \u20ac17.4 billion).\n- Free cash flow (pre spectrum, restructuring and integration costs) decreased by 11.9% to \u20ac5.0 billion (FY20: \u20ac5.7 billion) due to lower adjusted EBITDA and increased investment in network performance during the pandemic, partially offset by working capital movements including lower cash commissions.\n- Income tax expense increased by \u20ac2.6 billion, primarily due to a non-cash charge of \u20ac2.8 billion following a decrease in the carrying value of deferred tax assets.\n- Total dividends per share are 9.0 eurocents (FY20: 9.0 eurocents), including a final dividend per share of 4.5 eurocents. The ex-dividend date for the final dividend is 24 June 2021 for ordinary shareholders, the record date is 25 June 2021 and the dividend is payable on 6 August 2021.\n\nAll amounts marked with an *** represent organic growth, which presents performance on a comparable basis, including merger and acquisition activity and foreign exchange rates.

See page 217 for more information.\n\nReported total revenue increased by 7.5% to \u20ac13.0 billion, primarily reflecting the consolidation of the acquired Liberty Global assets for the full year.\n\nOn an organic basis, service revenue grew by 0.5%* (Q3: 1.0%*, Q4: 1.2%*), with growth across all customer segments in the second half of the year. Growth was supported by good customer and ARPU growth, a strong performance in Business fixed and higher variable usage revenue during the COVID-19 lockdown, offset by lower roaming, visitor and wholesale revenue. The year-on-year impact from the decline in roaming and visitor revenue was -1.0 percentage points (Q3: -1.0 percentage points, Q4: -0.5 percentage points). Retail service revenue grew by 1.1%* (Q3: 1.5%*, Q4: 1.8%*).\n\nFixed service revenue grew by 1.4%* (Q3: 1.4%*, Q4: 1.4%*). This was driven by customer base and ARPU growth, higher variable usage during the pandemic and growing demand for new services, such as cloud & security. Business fixed service revenue grew strongly by 9.8%* in FY21. We added 301,000 cable customers in the year, including 140,000 migrations from legacy broadband DSL. Almost half of our cable broadband customer base now subscribes to speeds of at least 250Mbps, and gigabit speeds are now available to 22.4 million households across our network. Our total broadband customer base increased by 161,000 to 10.9 million despite the majority of our retail stores being closed for four months during the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including during most of Q4.\n\nOur TV customer base declined by 236,000 reflecting lower retail activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the year, we launched a harmonised portfolio across all homes in Germany, aligning our sales activities and brought Vodafone TV to the Unitymedia footprint. We also launched the \u2018DAZN\u2019 Pay-TV channel and our new Apple set-top box product during the year. The full benefit from these actions was not visible in our commercial results due to lockdown restrictions affecting retail activity. Our converged propositions, led by \u2018Gigakombi\u2019, allow customers to combine their mobile, landline, broadband and TV subscriptions for one monthly fee. Our converged customer base continued to grow, with 130,000 Consumer additions during the year. We now have over 1.6 million Consumer converged accounts.\n\nMobile service revenue declined by 0.7%* (Q3: 0.5%*, Q4: 0.9%*) mainly due to the reduction in roaming, visitor and wholesale revenue. Service revenue grew in the second half of the year, supported by higher variable usage and increased demand from business customers, particularly in the public and health sectors. We added 317,000 contract customers during the year, supported by the migration of 187,000 Unitymedia mobile customers onto our network. Contract churn improved by 0.8 percentage points year-on-year to 11.8%. We also added 437,000 prepaid customers, supported by our online-only proposition, \u2018CallYa Digital\u2019. We added a further 5.9 million IoT connections during the year, supported by a strong demand from SMEs.\nIn April 2021, we became the first operator in Europe to launch a standalone 5G network. This enables higher speeds, enhanced reliability and ultra-low latency, in addition to using 20% less energy on customers\u2019 devices.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by 1.8%* as the benefit synergy delivery and ongoing cost efficiencies were partially offset by a -1.5 percentage point year-on-year impact from lower roaming and visitors, and lower wholesale revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 0.4%* percentage points higher year-on-year and was 43.4%.\n\nWe have continued to make good progress on integrating Unitymedia, with the rebranding, harmonisation of our internet & TV portfolio, and the organisational integration completed during the year. We are eight months ahead of plan with respect to our cost and capital expenditure synergy targets and remain on track to deliver the remaining synergies.\n\n**Italy: 12% of Group service revenue**\n\n| FY21 \u20acm | FY20 \u20acm | Reported change % | Organic change % |\n|---------|---------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Total revenue | 5,014 | 5,529 | (9.3) | (7.5) |\n| Service revenue | 4,458 | 4,833 | (7.8) | (7.5) |\n| Other revenue | 556 | 696 | | |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 1,597 | 2,068 | (22.8) | (12.7) |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin | 31.9% | 37.4% | | |\n\nNote: 1. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are Non-GAAP measures. See page 217 for more information.\n\nReported total revenue decreased by 9.3% to \u20ac5.0 billion, driven by continued price competition in the mobile market, as well as lower roaming, visitor and equipment revenue.\n\nOn an organic basis, service revenue declined by 7.5%* (Q3: -7.8%*, Q4: -7.8%*). The year-on-year impact from the decline in roaming and visitor revenue was -2.1 percentage points (Q3: -1.9 percentage points, Q4: -1.2 percentage points).\n\nMobile service revenue declined 10.5%* (Q3: -10.7%*, Q4: -9.3%*) reflecting lower roaming and visitor revenue, a reduction in the active prepaid customer base year-on-year, which began to stabilise in Q4, and price competition in the value segment. Market mobile number portability (MNP) volumes were approximately 20% lower year-on-year, reflecting retail lockdowns. Our second brand \u2018ho\u2019 continued to grow, with 662,000 new additions during the year and now has 2.5 million customers. Quarterly net additions slowed in Q4, although returned to growth towards the end of the quarter. During the year, we signed mobile wholesale agreements with PostePay and Digi. We will start to migrate PostePay customers onto our network in the first quarter of FY22.\n\nFixed service revenue grew by 1.4%* (Q3: 1.1%*, Q4: -3.8%*) driven by 90,000 broadband customer additions. In total, we now have almost 3.0 million broadband customers. The quarter-on-quarter slowdown in Q4 service revenue trends reflected higher Business project revenue in the prior year. However, Business demand was strong overall, supported by our NPS leadership and now represents approximately 40% of fixed revenue. Our total Consumer converged customer base is now 1.2 million (39% of our broadband base), an increase of 105,000 during the year. Through our own next generation network and partnership with Open Fiber, our broadband services are now available to 8.4 million households. We also cover 3.4 million households with fixed-wireless access, offering speeds of up to 100Mbps.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA declined by 12.7%* reflecting a -4.0 percentage point year-on-year impact from lower roaming and visitors, and lower service revenue, partially offset by continued good cost control. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 1.3% percentage points lower year-on-year and was 31.9%.\n\n**UK: 13% of Group service revenue**\n\n| FY21 \u20acm | FY20 \u20acm | Reported change % | Organic change % |\n|---------|---------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Total revenue | 6,151 | 6,484 | (5.1) | (3.4) |\n| Service revenue | 4,848 | 5,020 | (3.4) | (0.8) |\n| Other revenue | 1,303 | 1,464 | | |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 1,367 | 1,500 | (8.9) | (7.3) |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin | 22.2% | 23.1% | | |\n\nNote: 1.

See page 217 for more information.\n\nReported total revenue decreased by 5.1% to \u20ac6.2 billion, primarily due to the depreciation of the local currency versus the euro, and lower roaming, visitor and equipment revenue.\n\nOn an organic basis, service revenue decreased by 0.8%* (Q3: -0.4%*, Q4: -0.6%*) as good customer base growth and strong Business demand, was offset by lower roaming, visitor and incoming revenue. The year-on-year impact from the decline in roaming and visitor revenue was -2.4 percentage points (Q3: -2.3 percentage points, Q4: -1.5 percentage points).\n\nMobile service revenue declined 3.3%* (Q3: -3.6%*, Q4: -1.8%*) as lower roaming, visitor and incoming revenue offset good customer base growth. During the year, we maintained our good commercial momentum, supported by a significant shift in sales mix, with digital sales growing significantly to 39%. We also benefited from Business demand, strong iPhone sales, and improved customer loyalty. Contract churn improved 1.1 percentage point year-on-year to 13.0%. In total, we added 219,000 customers to our mobile contract base in FY21. Our digital sub-brand \u2018VOXI\u2019 also continued to grow strongly, with 176,000 customers added during the year, supported by the launch of new propositions.\n\nFixed service revenue grew by 5.6%* (Q3: 7.9%*, Q4: 2.2%*) and our commercial momentum remained strong with 192,000 net customer additions during the year. The quarter-on-quarter slowdown in Q4 was driven by the lapping of strong Business fixed performance in the prior year and lower wholesale revenue. In March, we launched Vodafone \u2018Pro Broadband\u2019 which combines fixed and mobile connectivity to provide \u2018unbreakable\u2019 connectivity. Pro Broadband customers also benefit from super Wi-Fi and dedicated customer support. We now have 911,000 broadband customers, of which 459,000 are converged. Business demand for our SME and corporate products remained strong, including productivity and security solutions.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by 7.3%* reflecting the year-on-year impacts from lower roaming and visitors of -4.8 percentage points and a prior year one-off licence fee settlement of -4.6 percentage points. On an underlying basis, we continued to grow adjusted EBITDA, supported by strong cost control, with operating expenses 7.5% lower year-on-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 1.1% percentage points lower year-on-year at 22.2%.\n\nTo support our continued investment in our networks, products and services, we announced that an annual price increase of Consumer Price Index plus 3.3% will be applied to all broadband and mobile contracts signed from 9 December 2020, taking effect from April 2021.\n\nIn March 2021, we acquired 40MHz of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band for next-generation 5G mobile services at a cost of \u20ac206 million. The new spectrum acquired will enable us to significantly expand 5G network capacity to meet the growing demand for fast, reliable, high-quality data services.\nOur financial performance (continued)\n\n### Spain: 10% of Group service revenue\n\n|                      | FY21  | FY20  | Reported change | Organic change* |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Total revenue        | \u20ac4,166| \u20ac4,296| (3.0)           | (2.8)           |\n| Service revenue      | \u20ac3,788| \u20ac3,904| (3.0)           | (2.8)           |\n| Other revenue        | \u20ac378  | \u20ac392  |                 |                 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA      | \u20ac1,044| \u20ac1,009| 3.5             | 3.4             |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin | 25.1% | 23.5% |                 |                 |\n\nNote: 1. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are Non-GAAP measures. See page 217 for more information.\n\nReported total revenue decreased by 3.0% to \u20ac4.2 billion, primarily due to lower roaming and visitor revenue and other COVID-19 related impacts.\n\nOn an organic basis, service revenue declined by 2.8%* (Q3: -1.1%*, Q4: -1.3%*) reflecting price competition in the market and lower roaming and visitor revenue. The year-on-year impact from the decline in roaming and visitor revenue was -2.0 percentage points (Q3: -1.7 percentage points, Q4: -1.1 percentage points). The service revenue slowdown quarter-on-quarter mainly reflected a change in premium calling regulation.\n\nIn mobile, we are competing effectively across all segments, and grew our contract customer base by 70,000, despite the market remaining highly competitive following the easing of restrictions in the second half of the year and an increase in mobile number portability. Mobile contract churn decreased 1.0 percentage points year-on-year to 20.2% reflecting our continued focus on improving customer loyalty. Our second brand \u2018Lowi\u2019 added 236,000 customers during the year and now has a total base of 1.2 million.\n\nOur broadband customer base increased by 21,000 despite our more-for-more pricing actions, and higher competitive intensity during the second half of the year. We added 109,000 customers to our NGN network as customers continued to transition to higher-speed plans. Our extensive library of movies and TV series, as well as our new \u2018boxless\u2019 TV app proposition, supported continued good customer growth in TV with 156,000 customers added during the year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by 3.4%* and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 1.5%* percentage points higher year-on-year at 25.1%. The growth in EBITDA reflects lower commercial and football content costs, and a 5.8% reduction in operating expenses, partially offset by a -5.7 percentage point year-on-year impact from lower roaming and visitors.\n\n### Other Europe: 13% of Group service revenue\n\n|                      | FY21  | FY20  | Reported change | Organic change* |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Total revenue        | \u20ac5,549| \u20ac5,541| 0.1             | (1.4)           |\n| Service revenue      | \u20ac4,859| \u20ac4,890| (0.6)           | (1.4)           |\n| Other revenue        | \u20ac690  | \u20ac651  |                 |                 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA      | \u20ac1,760| \u20ac1,738| 1.3             | (0.5)           |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin | 31.7% | 31.4% |                 |                 |\n\nNote: 1. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are Non-GAAP measures. See page 217 for more information.\n\nTotal revenue increased by 0.1% to \u20ac5.5 billion, primarily reflecting the consolidation of the acquired Liberty Global assets in Central Eastern Europe for a full year, offset by lower roaming and visitor revenue and the disposal of Vodafone Malta in the prior year.\n\nOn an organic basis, service revenue declined by 1.4%* (Q3: -0.7%*, Q4: -0.2%*), as growth in Portugal, Czech Republic, and Hungary was offset by declines in Ireland, Greece and Romania. The decline in service revenue was driven by lower roaming and visitor revenue, lower prepaid top-ups (notably in Greece), and increased competition in some markets. The year-on-year impact from the decline in roaming and visitor revenue was -2.0 percentage points (Q3: -1.8 percentage points, Q4: -1.3 percentage points).\n\nIn Portugal, service revenue grew as mobile contract and fixed base growth was partially offset by lower roaming and visitor revenue. During the year, we added 62,000 mobile contract customers and 71,000 fixed broadband customers. Almost a third of our broadband customer base is converged.\n\nIn Ireland, service revenue declined reflecting lower roaming and visitor revenue and higher competitive intensity, partially offset by the successful launch of unlimited Consumer mobile data tariffs. During the year, our mobile contract customer base increased by 68,000 and mobile contract churn improved 0.6 percentage point year-on-year to 9.9%.\n\nService revenue in Greece declined, reflecting lower roaming, visitor and prepaid revenue and higher promotional intensity during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by strong fixed demand, notably from business customers. Mobile contract churn improved 1.8 percentage point year-on-year to 9.3%.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA declined by 0.5%*, including a -4.4 percentage point year-on-year impact from lower roaming and visitors. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 0.2%* percentage points and was 31.7%.\n\nWe have continued to make good progress on integrating the assets acquired from Liberty Global in Central Eastern Europe and we remain on track to deliver our targeted synergies.\nVodacom: 11% of Group service revenue\n\n| FY21 \u20acm | FY20 \u20acm | Reported change % | Organic change % |\n|---------|---------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Total revenue | 5,181 | 5,531 | (6.3) | |\n| Service revenue | 4,083 | 4,470 | (8.7) | 3.9 |\n| Other revenue | 1,098 | 1,061 | 3.2 | |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 1,873 | 2,088 | (10.3) | 2.9 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin | 36.2% | 37.8% | |\n\nNotes:\n1. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are Non-GAAP measures. See page 217 for more information.\n\nReported total revenue decreased by 6.3% to \u20ac5.2 billion and reported adjusted EBITDA decreased by 10.3%, primarily due to the depreciation of the local currencies versus the euro.\n\nOn an organic basis, Vodacom\u2019s total service revenue grew 3.9%* (Q3: 3.3%*, Q4: 7.3%*) as good growth in South Africa was partially offset by revenue pressure in Vodacom\u2019s international operations due to macroeconomic pressure and the zero-rating of person-to-person M-Pesa transfers for most of the year. The quarter-on-quarter improvement in growth in Q4 reflected stronger growth in South Africa and an acceleration in Vodacom\u2019s international markets as M-Pesa service fees normalised across all markets from January 2021.\n\nIn South Africa, service revenue growth achieved a 10-year high, as the business benefited from higher demand for voice, data and financial services, and an increase in consumer discretionary spend as a result of government measures and social grants during the COVID-19 pandemic. We added 133,000 contract customers, supported by strong growth in Business connectivity as remote working and mobile broadband demand increased. We also added 2.5 million prepaid customers supported by our successful \u2018Shake-off\u2019 summer campaign and new behavioural loyalty programme launched during the second half of the year. Data traffic increased by 6.0% year-on-year, and 45% of our customer base is now using data services. Our \u2018ConnectU\u2019 platform continues to promote digital inclusion via zero-rated access to a wide range of websites, including job portals and online learning platforms, with total unique users reaching 15.5 million at year end. Financial Services customers in South Africa increased by 15.4% to 13.3 million, reflecting our strong execution and the ongoing expansion of our service offerings. In January 2021, we announced an expanded wholesale agreement with Cell-C for its mobile contract and mobile broadband customers to roam on our network.\n\nIn Vodacom\u2019s international markets, service revenue slightly declined, reflecting economic pressure, the disruption to our commercial activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, the zero-rating of person-to-person M-Pesa transfers in DRC, Mozambique, and Lesotho, and the impact of service barring in Tanzania due to biometric registration compliance. There was a significant improvement in trends in the second half of the year, driven by the reinstatement of person-to-person M-Pesa transfer fees across all markets and improved commercial momentum. Digital adoption across Vodacom\u2019s international markets accelerated. M-Pesa transaction value increased by 28.4%, while M-Pesa revenue as a share of total service revenue increased by 1.6 percentage points to 20.9%, and 52% of our customer base is now using data services.\n\nVodacom\u2019s adjusted EBITDA increased by 2.9%* as growth in South Africa was partially offset by revenue pressure in Vodacom\u2019s international operations, notably in the first half of the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 1.3% percentage points lower year-on-year, partly driven by 5G roaming investment in South Africa. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.2%.\n\nOther Markets: 9% of Group service revenue\n\n| FY21 \u20acm | FY20 \u20acm | Reported change % | Organic change % |\n|---------|---------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Total revenue | 3,765 | 4,386 | (14.2) | |\n| Service revenue | 3,312 | 3,796 | (12.8) | 10.8 |\n| Other revenue | 453 | 590 | 8.5 | |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 1,228 | 1,400 | (12.3) | 32.6% |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin | 32.6% | 31.9% | |\n\nNotes:\n1. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are Non-GAAP measures. See page 217 for more information.\n\nReported total revenue decreased by 14.2% to \u20ac3.8 billion, primarily due to the depreciation of the local currencies versus the euro and the disposal of Vodafone New Zealand in the prior year.\n\nOn an organic basis, service revenue increased by 10.8%* (Q3: 12.3%*, Q4: 13.1%*), driven by customer base growth and increased demand for data across our markets. The year-on-year impact from the decline in roaming and visitor revenue was -1.5 percentage points (Q3: -1.0 percentage points, Q4: -0.5 percentage points).\n\nService revenue in Turkey grew ahead of inflation, reflecting strong customer contract ARPU growth and increased demand for mobile data and fixed broadband. Mobile contract customer additions were 1.1 million during the year \u2014 the highest amongst any of our markets \u2014 supported by migrations from prepaid customers. Contract churn improved by 3.3 percentage points year-on-year to 19.3%.\n\nService revenue in Egypt also grew ahead of inflation, supported by customer base growth and increased data usage, partially offset by lower roaming and visitor revenue. During the year, we added 402,000 mobile contract customers and 1.1 million prepaid mobile customers. Mobile contract churn in Egypt was the lowest in the entire Group at 6.5%.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 8.5%* and the adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 0.7%* percentage points. This reflected strong revenue growth and operating efficiencies in Turkey, offset by the lapping of a prior year settlement and the impact of the temporary zero-rating of e-money transaction fees in Egypt. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.6%.\n\nIn November 2020, we announced that Vodafone Egypt had acquired 40MHz of 2.6GHz spectrum, with a 10-year licence through to 2030. The spectrum will enable us to significantly expand network capacity to meet growing demand for reliable, high quality voice and data services.\n\nIn December 2020, we announced that discussions with Saudi Telecom Company in relation to the sale of Vodafone\u2019s 55% shareholding in Vodafone Egypt had been terminated. Vodafone Egypt has a strong market position in an attractive market and generates a strong return on capital employed, in excess of its local cost of capital. We are committed to retaining our presence in Egypt.\nOur financial performance (continued)\n\n**Associates and joint ventures**\n\n|                                | FY21  | FY20  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V.| (232) | (64)  |\n| Indus Towers Limited           | 274   | 19    |\n| Safaricom Limited              | 217   | 247   |\n| Vodafone Idea Limited          | \u2013     | (2,546) |\n| Other                          | 83    | (161) |\n| **Share of results of equity accounted associates and joint ventures** | **342** | **(2,505)** |\n\n**VodafoneZiggo Joint Venture (Netherlands)**\n\nThe results of VodafoneZiggo (in which Vodafone owns a 50% stake) are reported here under US GAAP, which is broadly consistent with Vodafone\u2019s IFRS basis of reporting.\n\nTotal revenue grew 1.6% (Q3: 0.5%, Q4: 1.8%) to \u20ac4.0 billion. This reflected mobile contract customer base growth and strong Business fixed demand, partly offset by lower roaming, visitor and handset revenue.\n\nDuring the year, VodafoneZiggo added 262,000 mobile contract customers, supported by the successful \u2018Runners\u2019 campaign and higher demand from businesses. Strong Business fixed performance was supported by an increase in the customer base, as well as higher demand for unified communications and remote-working solutions. The number of converged households increased by 81,000, with 44% of broadband customers and 71% of all B2C mobile customers now converged, delivering significant NPS and churn benefits. VodafoneZiggo was the first operator to launch a nationwide 5G network in the Netherlands and also completed its analogue TV switch-off during April 2021. VodafoneZiggo now offers 1 gigabit speeds to more than 3.1 million homes and is on track to provide nationwide coverage in 2022.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by 5.2%, supported by top line growth and cost synergies realisation, more than offsetting a year-on-year impact from lower roaming and visitor mobile revenue. VodafoneZiggo has now successfully delivered the \u20ac210 million cost and capital expenditure synergies targeted, one year ahead of the original plan.\n\nDuring the year, Vodafone received \u20ac209 million in dividends from the joint venture, as well as \u20ac43 million in interest payments. The joint venture also drew down an additional \u20ac104 million shareholder loan from Vodafone to fund spectrum licences acquired in July 2020.\n\n**Indus Towers Associate (India)**\n\nIn November 2020, we announced that the merger of Indus Towers Limited (\u2018Indus Towers\u2019) and Bharti Infratel Limited (\u2018Bharti Infratel\u2019) had completed. The merged company is listed on the National Stock Exchange of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange and was renamed Indus Towers Limited following the merger. Vodafone was issued with 757.8 million shares in the merged company in exchange for its 42% shareholding in Indus Towers and this is equivalent to a 28.1% shareholding in the combined company.\n\nIndus Towers is classified as held for sale at 31 March 2021 in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group\u2019s interest in Indus Towers has been provided as security against certain bank borrowings secured against Indian assets and partly to the pledges provided to the new Indus Towers entity under the terms of the merger between erstwhile Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel.\n\n**Safaricom Associate (Kenya)**\n\nSafaricom service revenue declined by 0.3%* (Q3: 1.6%, Q4: 6.4%*) due to depressed economic activity and the zero-rating of some M-Pesa services in the first half of the year. The quarter-on-quarter improvement in Q4 was driven by an increase in M-Pesa revenue as service fees normalised and higher demand for fixed broadband. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 3.3% primarily driven by a decline in revenue.\n\n**Vodafone Idea Limited Joint Venture (India)**\n\nIn October 2019, the Indian Supreme Court gave its judgement in the Union of India v Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India case regarding the interpretation of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), a concept used in the calculation of certain regulatory fees. Vodafone Idea was liable for very substantial demands made by the Department of Telecommunications (\u2018DoT\u2019) in relation to these fees. Based on submissions of the DoT in the Supreme Court proceedings (which the Group is unable to confirm as to their accuracy), Vodafone Idea reported a total estimated liability of INR 654 billion (\u20ac7.6 billion) excluding repayments and including interest, penalty and interest on penalty up to 30 June 2020. On 17 February, 20 February, 16 March and 16 July 2020, Vodafone Idea made payments totalling INR 785 billion (\u20ac0.9 billion) to the DoT. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India directed that telecom operators make payment of 10% of the total dues by 31 March 2021 and thereafter repay the balance, along with 8% interest, in 10 annual instalments.\n\nVodafone Idea Limited (\u2018Vodafone Idea\u2019) recorded losses for each of the six month periods ended 30 September 2019, 31 March 2020 and 30 September 2020, respectively. For the six months ended 30 September 2019, the Group recognised its share of estimated Vodafone Idea losses arising from both its operating activities and those in relation to the AGR judgement. The Group has no obligation to fund Vodafone Idea, consequently the Group\u2019s recognised share of losses in the six months ended 30 September 2019 was limited to the remaining carrying value of Vodafone Idea which was therefore reduced to \u20acnil at 30 September 2019; no further losses have been recognised by the Group.\n\nAs part of the agreement to merge Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in 2017, the parties agreed a mechanism for payments between the Group and Vodafone Idea pursuant to the crystallisation of certain identified contingent liabilities in relation to legal, regulatory, tax and other matters, and refunds relating to Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. Cash payments or cash receipts relating to these matters must have been made or received by Vodafone Idea before any amount becomes due from or owed to the Group. Any future payments by the Group to Vodafone Idea as a result of this agreement would only be made after satisfaction of this and other contractual conditions. The Group\u2019s potential exposure under this mechanism is now capped at INR 64 billion (\u20ac7.47 billion). See note 29 \u2018Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u2019 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n**Vodafone Hutchison Australia / TPG Telecom Limited Joint Venture (Australia)**\n\nIn July 2020, Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited (\u2018VHA\u2019) and TPG Telecom Limited (\u2018TPG\u2019) completed their merger to establish a fully integrated telecommunications operator in Australia. The merged entity was admitted to the Australian Securities Exchange (\u2018ASX\u2019) on 30 June 2020 and is known as TPG Telecom Limited. Vodafone and Hutchison Telecommunications (\u2018Australia\u2019) Limited each own an economic interest of 25.05% in the merged unit.\nNet financing costs\n\n| FY21 | FY20 | Reported change % |\n|------|------|-------------------|\n| Investment income | \u20ac330 | \u20ac248 | 78.9 |\n| Financing costs | (\u20ac1,027) | (\u20ac3,549) | |\n| Net financing costs | (\u20ac697) | (\u20ac3,301) | |\n| Adjustments for: | | | |\n| Mark-to-market (gains)/losses | (\u20ac1,091) | \u20ac1,128 | |\n| Foreign exchange losses | \u20ac23 | \u20ac205 | |\n| Adjusted net financing costs | (\u20ac1,765) | (\u20ac1,968) | 10.3 |\n\nNote:\n1. Adjusted net financing costs is a Non-GAAP measure. See page 217 for more information. The FY20 adjusted net financing costs has been aligned to the FY21 presentation which no longer excludes interest. This increased adjusted net financing costs for FY20 by \u20ac330 million.\n\nNet financing costs decreased by \u20ac2.6 billion, primarily due to mark-to-market gains of \u20ac1.1 billion (compared to losses of \u20ac1.1 billion in FY20). This was driven by a higher share price, causing a gain on options held relating to \u20ac3.8 billion of mandatory convertible bonds. Adjusted net financing costs decreased reflecting net favourable interest movements on borrowings in relation to foreign operations.\n\nTaxation\n\n| FY21 | FY20 | Change % |\n|------|------|----------|\n| Effective tax rate | 87.8% | 157.2% | (69.4) |\n| Adjusted effective tax rate | 26.9% | 25.3% | 1.6 |\n\nNote:\n1. Adjusted effective tax rate is a Non-GAAP measure. See page 217 for more information.\n\nThe Group\u2019s effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2021 was 87.8%.\n\nThe Group\u2019s effective tax rate for both years includes the following items: a \u20ac2,827 million charge (2020: \u20ac346 million credit) for the utilisation of losses in Luxembourg which arises from an increase (2020: decrease) in the valuation of investments based upon local GAAP financial statements and tax returns. The increase in the current year was principally driven by increases in the value of our operating businesses, listed associates and joint ventures. These items change the total losses we have available for future use against our profits in Luxembourg and neither item affects the amount of tax we pay in other countries.\n\nThe Group\u2019s effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2020 included a reduction in our deferred tax assets in Luxembourg of \u20ac881 million following a reduction in the Luxembourg corporate tax rate.\n\nThe Group\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2021 was 26.9%. The rate increased as a result of the mix of profits in the Group and a lower use of our Luxembourg losses in the year.\n\nThe Group\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate for both years does not include the following items: \u20ac320 million relating to Luxembourg losses (2020: \u20ac348 million) and \u20ac2,827 million charge (2020: \u20ac346 million credit) arising from an increase (2020: decrease) in the valuation of investments based upon the local GAAP financial statements and tax returns as stated above.\n\nWe expect the adjusted effective tax rate to rise to the high 20\u2019s over the medium term reflecting the forecast profit mix, a reducing annual use of our Luxembourg deferred tax asset as market conditions drive margins lower on existing financing activities, the impact of an anticipated reduction in levels of intercompany debt over the medium term and the impact of government responses to the COVID pandemic resulting in increased tax liabilities.\n\nThe Group\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2020 does not include the reduction in our deferred tax assets in Luxembourg referred to above.\n\nEarnings per share\n\n| FY21 | FY20 | Reported change % |\n|------|------|-------------------|\n| Basic earnings/(loss) per share | \u20ac0.38c | (\u20ac3.13c) | 3.51c |\n| Adjusted basic earnings per share | \u20ac8.08c | \u20ac5.60c | 2.48c |\n\nNote:\n1. Adjusted basic earnings per share is a Non-GAAP measure. See page 217 for more information.\n\nBasic earnings per share was 0.38 eurocents, compared to a loss per share of 3.13 eurocents for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nAdjusted basic earnings per share was 8.08 eurocents compared to 5.60 eurocents for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nConsolidated statement of financial position\n\nThe consolidated statement of financial position is set out on page 122. Details on the major movements of both our assets and liabilities in the year are set out below.\n\nAssets\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets decreased by \u20ac0.5 billion between 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 to \u20ac53.5 billion. This reflects the amortisation of computer software, partially offset by software and purchased licence additions in the period.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment increased by \u20ac1.1 billion between 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 to \u20ac41.2 billion. This reflects additions in the period, partially offset by the depreciation charge.\n\nOther non-current assets decreased by \u20ac9.2 billion between 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 to \u20ac32.0 billion, primarily due to a \u20ac5.5 billion decrease in derivative assets included in trade and other receivables, a \u20ac2.0 billion decrease in deferred tax assets and a \u20ac1.2 billion decrease in investments in associates and joint ventures, reflecting the reclassification of the Group\u2019s interest in Indus Towers Limited as held for sale at 31 March 2021. Further detail is provided in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nCurrent assets decreased by \u20ac6.2 billion between 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 to \u20ac27.0 billion, primarily due to a \u20ac7.7 billion decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a \u20ac0.8 billion decrease in trade and other receivables, partially offset by an increase of \u20ac2.1 billion in other investments.\n\nTotal equity and liabilities\n\nTotal equity decreased by \u20ac4.8 billion between 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 to \u20ac57.8 billion largely due to \u20ac2.4 billion of dividends paid to the Group\u2019s shareholders, \u20ac0.4 billion of dividends paid to non-controlling interests and total comprehensive expense for the period of \u20ac3.6 billion, partially offset by an increase of \u20ac1.9 billion arising from transactions with non-controlling interests in subsidiaries.\n\nNon-current liabilities decreased by \u20ac3.6 billion between 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 to \u20ac68.5 billion, primarily due to a \u20ac3.7 billion decrease in borrowings.\n\nCurrent liabilities decreased by \u20ac4.7 billion between 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 to \u20ac28.7 billion, primarily due to a \u20ac3.5 billion decrease in borrowings, a \u20ac1.4 billion decrease in financial liabilities under put option arrangements, partially offset by an increase of \u20ac0.4 billion in trade and other payables.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation did not have a significant effect on the Group\u2019s consolidated results of operations and financial condition during the year ended 31 March 2021.\nOur financial performance (continued)\n\nCash flow, capital allocation and funding\n\nAnalysis of cash flow\n\n| FY21 | FY20 | Reported change % |\n|------|------|-------------------|\n| Inflow from operating activities | 17,215 | 17,379 | (0.9) |\n| Outflow from investing activities | (9,262) | (8,088) | (14.5) |\n| Outflow from financing activities | (15,196) | (9,352) | (62.5) |\n\nCash inflow from operating activities decreased by 0.9% to \u20ac17.2 billion (FY20: \u20ac17.4 billion) due to an increase in the net working capital outflow compared to the prior year. Working capital movements in FY21 include a \u20ac0.3 billion inflow from handset purchases and the associated sale of customer receivables.\n\nOutflow from investing activities primarily increased by 14.5% to \u20ac9.3 billion (FY20: \u20ac8.1 billion) due to lower inflows from disposals of subsidiaries and disposals of short term investments, increased investment in network performance during the pandemic, partially offset by reduced outflows on purchases of subsidiaries and associates.\n\nOutflows from financing activities increased by 62.5% to \u20ac15.2 billion (FY20: \u20ac9.3 billion) due to lower inflows from disposals of subsidiaries and disposals of short term investments, increased investment in network performance during the pandemic, partially offset by reduced outflows on purchases of subsidiaries and associates.\n\nAnalysis of cash flow (continued)\n\n| FY21 | FY20 | Reported change % |\n|------|------|-------------------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 14,386 | 14,881 | (3.3) |\n| Capital additions | (7,854) | (7,411) | |\n| Working capital | 564 | (127) | |\n| Disposal of property, plant and equipment | 42 | 41 | |\n| Interest received and paid | (1,553) | (1,160) | |\n| Taxation | (1,020) | (930) | |\n| Dividends received from associates and joint ventures | 628 | 417 | |\n| Dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries | (391) | (348) | |\n| Other | 217 | 337 | |\n| Free cash flow (pre spectrum, restructuring and integration costs) | 5,019 | 5,700 | (11.9) |\n| Licence and spectrum payments | (1,221) | (181) | |\n| Restructuring and integration payments | (421) | (570) | |\n| Integration capital expenditure | (267) | \u2013 | |\n| Free cash flow | 3,110 | 4,949 | (37.2) |\n| Acquisitions and disposals | 447 | (14,454) | |\n| Equity dividends paid | (2,427) | (2,296) | |\n| Share buybacks | (53) | (1,094) | |\n| Foreign exchange (loss)/gain | (219) | 309 | |\n| Other movements on net debt | 646 | (2,428) | |\n| Net debt decrease/(increase) | 1,504 | (15,014) | |\n| Opening net debt | (42,047) | (27,033) | |\n| Closing net debt | (40,543) | (42,047) | 3.6 |\n\nNotes:\n1. Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow (pre spectrum, restructuring and integration costs), free cash flow and net debt are Non-GAAP measures. See page 217 for more information.\n2. See page 226 for an analysis of tangible and intangible additions in the year.\n3. Interest received and paid excludes interest on lease liabilities of \u20ac307 million (FY20: \u20ac305 million outflow), \u20ac6 (FY20: \u20ac175 million) of interest costs related to Liberty acquisition financing, included within Other, and \u20ac9 million of cash inflow (FY20: \u20ac273 million outflow) from the option structures relating to the issue of the mandatory convertible bonds, included within Share buybacks. The option structures were intended to ensure that the total cash outflow to execute the programme were broadly equivalent to the amounts raised on issuing each tranche.\n4. Integration capital expenditure comprises amounts for the integration of acquired Liberty Global assets and network integration.\n5. \u201cOther movements on net debt\u201d for the year ended 31 March 2021 includes mark-to-market gains recognised in the income statement of \u20ac1.0 billion, offset by payments in respect of bank borrowings secured against Indian assets (\u20ac613 million) and payments to Vodafone Idea Limited of \u20ac235 million in respect of the contingent liability mechanism. The comparative figure primarily included \u20ac1.5 billion of debt in relation to licences and spectrum in Germany and mark-to-market losses recognised in the income statement of \u20ac1.2 billion.\n6. Net debt as at 31 March 2020 has been aligned to the FY21 presentation, increasing by \u20ac3.7 billion to exclude derivative movements in cash flow hedging reserves and decreasing by \u20ac1.2 billion to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale.\n\nFree cash flow (pre spectrum, restructuring and integration costs) decreased by 11.9% to \u20ac5.0 billion (FY20: \u20ac5.7 billion) due to lower adjusted EBITDA and increased investment in network performance during the pandemic, partially offset by working capital movements including lower cash commissions.\n\nAcquisitions and disposals in the current year included proceeds from the Vantage Towers public offering of \u20ac2.0 billion, partially offset by payments to purchase shares from HDG minorities of \u20ac1.5 billion. The prior year included \u20ac2.0 billion received on completion of the sale of Vodafone New Zealand on 31 July 2019, together with \u20ac2.1 billion received on completion of the sale of Italian tower assets on 31 March 2020. It also included \u20ac10.3 billion paid on completion of the acquisition of the Liberty Global assets on 31 July 2019 and acquired net debt of \u20ac82.2 billion.\n\nNet debt at 31 March 2021 was \u20ac40.5 billion, compared to \u20ac42.0 billion as at 31 March 2020.\n\nBorrowings and cash position\n\n| FY21 | FY20 | Reported change % |\n|------|------|-------------------|\n| Non-current borrowings | (59,272) | (62,949) | |\n| Current borrowings | (8,488) | (11,976) | |\n| Borrowings | (67,760) | (74,925) | |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 5,821 | 13,557 | |\n| Borrowings less cash and cash equivalents | (61,939) | (61,368) | 0.9 |\n\nBorrowings principally includes bonds of \u20ac46,885 million (FY20: \u20ac49,412 million) and lease liabilities of \u20ac13,032 million (FY20: \u20ac12,118 million).\n\nReductions in borrowings are offset by movements in cash and cash equivalents and are principally driven by the early repayment of \u20ac3.4 billion of bonds due to mature up to 2024 and lower derivative collateral positions which impact both cash and short term borrowings.\nFunding position\n\n| FY21 | FY20 | Reported change % |\n|------|------|-------------------|\n| Bonds | \u20ac46,885 | \u20ac49,412 |\n| Bank loans | \u20ac1,419 | \u20ac2,880 |\n| Other borrowings incl. spectrum | \u20ac4,215 | \u20ac3,877 |\n| **Gross debt** | **\u20ac52,519** | **\u20ac56,169** | (6.5) |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | \u20ac5,821 | \u20ac13,557 |\n| Short term investments | \u20ac4,007 | \u20ac4,132 |\n| Derivative financial instruments | \u20ac3 | \u20ac610 |\n| Net collateral liabilities | \u20ac2,145 | \u20ac4,177 |\n| **Net debt** | **\u20ac40,543** | **\u20ac42,047** | (3.6) |\n\nNotes:\n1. Gross debt and net debt are Non-GAAP measures. See page 217 for more information. Net debt as at 31 March 2020 has been aligned to the FY21 presentation, increasing by \u20ac3,799 million to exclude derivative movements in cash flow hedging reserves and decreasing by \u20ac121 million to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale.\n2. Short term investments includes \u20ac1,063 million (FY20: \u20ac1,681 million) of highly liquid government and government-backed securities and managed investment funds of \u20ac2,954 million (FY20: \u20ac2,451 million) that are in highly rated and liquid money market investments with liquidity of up to 90 days.\n3. Collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments result in cash being paid/withheld as security. This is repayable when derivatives are settled and is therefore deducted from liquidity.\n\nNet debt decreased by \u20ac1.5 billion primarily as a result of free cash flow of \u20ac3.1 billion and \u20ac2.0 billion of proceeds from the Vantage Towers public offering, partially offset by \u20ac2.4 billion of equity dividends and \u20ac1.5 billion of payments to purchase KDG shares from minority shareholders.\n\nOther funding obligations to be considered alongside net debt include:\n- Lease liabilities of \u20ac13,032 million (31 March 2020: \u20ac12,118 million)\n- Mandatory convertible bonds recognised in equity of \u20ac1,904 million (31 March 2020: \u20ac3,848 million)\n- KDG put option liabilities of \u20ac492 million (31 March 2020: \u20ac1,850 million)\n- Guarantees over Australia joint venture loans of \u20ac1,489 million (31 March 2020: \u20ac2,062 million)\n- Pension liabilities of \u20ac513 million (31 March 2020: \u20ac438 million)\n\nThe Group\u2019s gross and net debt does not consider the 50% equity characteristic of the long term \u201cHybrid bonds\u201d being \u20ac3,971 million (31 March 2020: \u20ac2,971 million). The Group\u2019s gross and net debt includes certain bonds which have been designated in hedge relationships, which are carried at \u20ac1.4 billion higher value (31 March 2020: \u20ac1.5 billion higher) than their euro equivalent redemption value. In addition, where bonds are issued in currencies other than euros, the Group has entered into foreign currency swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption. The impact of these swaps are not reflected in gross debt and would decrease the euro equivalent redemption value of the bonds by \u20ac0.1 billion (31 March 2020: \u20ac1.3 billion).\n\nReturn on capital employed\n\nReturn on Capital Employed (ROCE) reflects how efficiently we are generating profit with the capital we deploy.\n\n| FY21 | FY20 | Change |\n|------|------|--------|\n| ROCE | 4.4% | 3.9% | 0.5 |\n| Pre-tax ROCE (controlled) | 5.3% | 6.3% | (0.8) |\n| Post-tax ROCE (controlled and associates/joint ventures) | 3.9% | 3.9% | \u2013 |\n\nNotes:\n1. The presentation of FY20 ROCE has been aligned to the FY21 presentation. See page 224.\n2. ROCE is calculated by dividing operating profit by the average of capital employed as reported in the consolidated statement of financial position. See page 223 for the detail of the calculation.\n3. Pre-tax ROCE (controlled) and Post-tax ROCE (controlled and associates/joint ventures) are Non-GAAP measures. See page 217 for more information.\n\nROCE increased to 4.4% (FY20: 3.9%). The increase reflects the increase in operating profit in the year coupled with broadly stable average capital employed.\n\nWe calculate two further ROCE measures: i) Pre-tax ROCE for controlled operations only and ii) Post-tax ROCE (including associates & joint ventures). See \u201cNon-GAAP measures\u201d on pages 223 and 224 for an explanation how ROCE is calculated and a reconciliation to the GAAP basis discussed above.\n\nROCE decreased to 5.5% on a pre-tax basis (FY20: 6.3%). The decrease reflects stable adjusted operating profit, offset by higher average capital employed. ROCE remained stable at 3.9% on a post-tax basis (FY20: 3.9%).\n\nShare buybacks\n\nOn 19 March 2021, Vodafone announced the commencement of a new irrevocable and non-discretionary share buyback programme (the \u2018programme\u2019). The sole purpose of the Programme was to reduce the issued share capital of Vodafone to partially offset the increase in the issued share capital as a result of the maturing of the first tranche of the mandatory convertible bond (MCB) in March 2021.\n\nIn order to satisfy the second tranche of the MCB, 1,426.8 million shares were reissued from treasury shares in March 2021 at a conversion price of \u20ac1.2055. This reflected the conversion price at issue (\u20ac1.3505) adjusted for the pound sterling equivalent of aggregate dividends paid in August 2019, February 2020, August 2020 and February 2021.\n\nThe programme started on 22 March 2021 and is expected to complete by 18 May 2021. Details of the shares purchased under the programme, including those purchased under irrevocable instructions, are shown below.\n\n| Date of share purchase | Number of shares purchased | Average price paid for share inclusive of transaction costs | Total number of shares purchased under publicly announced share buyback programme | Maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the programme |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| March 2021             | 52,682                    | 134.60                                                   | 52,682                          | 204,141                     |\n| April 2021             | 131,704                   | 135.34                                                   | 184,386                         | 72,437                      |\n| May 2021 (to 17 May)   | 65,852                    | 141.09                                                   | 250,238                         | 6,585                       |\n| **Total**              | **250,238**               | **136.70**                                               | **250,238**                     | **6,585**                   |\n\nNotes:\n1. The nominal value of shares purchased is 2020/21 US cents each.\n2. No shares were purchased outside the publicly announced share buyback programme.\n3. In accordance with shareholder authority granted at the 2020 Annual General Meeting.\n4. The total number of shares purchased represented 0.9% of our issued share capital, excluding treasury shares, at 18 May 2021.\n\nDividends\n\nThe Board is recommending total dividends per share of 9.0 eurocents for the year. This includes a final dividend of 4.5 eurocents compared to 4.5 eurocents in the prior year.\n\nThis year\u2019s report contains the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 61, which includes an analysis of our performance and position, a review of the business during the year, and outlines the principal risks and uncertainties we face. The Strategic Report was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nNick Read\nChief Executive\n18 May 2021\n\nMargherita Della Valle\nChief Financial Officer\n18 May 2021\nPurpose, sustainability and responsible business\n\nWe connect for a better future\n\nPurpose pillars\n\nOur strategy helps to deliver our targets across three purpose pillars: Digital Society; Inclusion for All; and Planet \u2013 and ensures Vodafone acts responsibly and ethically, wherever we operate.

Our 2021 Communication on Progress can be found in our 2021 ESG Addendum.\nPurpose\n\nOur purpose\n\nOur purpose \u2013 to connect for a better future by enabling inclusive and sustainable digital societies \u2013 serves as the framework for what we do at Vodafone. It is underpinned by our focus on three specific pillars: Inclusion for All, Planet and Digital Society.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis, we reviewed and adapted the focus areas under our three purpose pillars so they would respond better to the evolving socio-economic challenges and to society\u2019s needs.\n\nWe call the difference we make in supporting the communities in which we operate our social contract. Launched in 2019, our social contract is how we drive and activate many of our purpose initiatives. For example, our social contract creates new partnerships with governments and other stakeholders to overcome some of the most important challenges that our customers and societies are facing. In return, we want governments, policy-makers and regulators to adopt a pro-investment, pro-innovation approach to allow network operators to make sufficient returns on their investments.\n\nIn responding to the pandemic \u2013 specifically through the five-point plan we implemented in Europe and the six-point plan in Africa \u2013 our social contract has accelerated the delivery of our purpose during the last 12 months.\n\nAs a Group, through the consistent delivery against our plans in Europe and Africa, we have:\n\n- sent over 250 million text messages with free public health information;\n- supported 1.5 million healthcare workers through \u20ac6 million of donated funds and devices;\n- helped more than 15 million people through zero-rating health sites;\n- helped over 100 million people in Europe and Africa through \u20ac150 million in donations and in-kind benefits; and\n- donated \u20ac10 million in cash and in-kind donations through Vodafone Foundation.\n\nRead more on Vodafone\u2019s social contract on page 19\n\nOur purpose is also the basis of our new brand positioning: \u2018Together we can\u2019. It conveys our belief that technology and innovation can help millions of people and their communities to stay connected. We feel positively about the opportunity technology gives us all when combined with the right human spirit.\n\nThe following sections provide an overview of the purpose programmes and targets we have set, as well as the achievements over the past year as a result of the acceleration of purpose driven by our social contract.\n\nInclusion for All\n\nOur Inclusion for All strategy seeks to ensure no one is left behind. It focuses on access to connectivity, digital skills and creating relevant products and services, such as access to education, healthcare and finance. We are also committed to developing a diverse and inclusive global workforce that reflects the customers and societies we serve.\n\nWhilst the past year has seen an unparalleled acceleration in society\u2019s reliance on connectivity, it has also shone a light on the existing digital divides. Millions of people are still unable to take advantage of the benefits digital technology can bring.\n\nThrough our social contract acceleration, we have broadened the focus of Inclusion for All, and accelerated programmes to deliver benefit for groups affected by the crisis. Highlights have included:\n\n- 5.2 million students accessing free digital education;\n- over 18,000 devices donated for education;\n- we launched Jobseekers.Connected proposition in multiple markets; and\n- removed transaction fees for mobile money users.\n\nAccess for all\n\nThe use of fixed and mobile services is accelerating globally. For example, GSMA estimates that 5.1 billion people have a mobile phone and 3.8 billion use mobile internet. But many remain unconnected, with 600 million people globally still living outside areas covered by mobile networks.\n\nWe know that when people can access mobile internet, they are able to use services that improve their lives. For example 1.6 billion mobile subscribers have used mobile to monitor their health and 1.2 billion people have a mobile money account.\n\nAccess for all is therefore a priority \u2013 and rural connectivity is a specific focus area for us. Within the EU, 29% of the population live in rural areas. In Africa, the number is much higher. In Tanzania, for example, over 70% live in rural areas.\n\nExpanding rural networks can often be more challenging and have a lower return on investment due to lower population densities. That is why we are finding new ways to roll-out our network to rural locations in our markets, through a number of initiatives and innovative partnerships, including network sharing.\n\nNotes:\n1.

For example, we are piloting OpenRAN \u2013 a new promising way to engineer the access network \u2013 in rural communities. We have also continued to work with our partners AST & Science LLC to develop the first space-based mobile network to connect directly to 4G and 5G smartphones without the need for specialised hardware. The aim is to transform mobile coverage in the DRC, Ghana, Mozambique, Kenya and Tanzania. The mobile network will also reach 1.6 billion people across 49 countries from 2023.\n\nIn addition, this year, Vodafone Group Chief Executive, Nick Read, was appointed as a Commissioner to the UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, which brings together governments, civil society, industry and international organisations to address the digital divide, achieve universal broadband connectivity and accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\n\nEnabling quality education and digital skills\n\nEven before the COVID-19 crisis, an estimated 258 million children around the world were not in school. More than half of all children globally were not meeting the minimum expected standards in reading and maths.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has made things worse, impacting nearly 1.6 billion learners in over 190 countries. Lack of access to devices and poor connectivity hindered home learning. Across our markets, we have responded by providing devices and connectivity to students and families, as well as growing our existing education platforms across Europe and Africa.\n\nWe expanded Connected Education, which was launched in January 2020, by our social enterprise Vodafone Business Ventures to provide access to connectivity, devices and classroom collaboration software for students and teachers across the world. To date, over 800,000 students in over 2,900 educational institutions across 10 countries have benefited from this digital learning solution.\n\nIn South Africa, the Vodacom e-School solution allows learners to access curriculum-aligned content and educators to access learning materials on their smartphone with no data charges. We currently have over one million users on the platform.\n\nThis year, we announced an investment of \u20ac20 million by Vodafone Foundation to expand digital skills and education programmes across Europe, aiming to reach over 16 million learners by 2025. One example is Vodafone Foundation Germany\u2019s \u2018Coding for Tomorrow\u2019 which teaches students and their teachers about how to use digital technologies in an independent, critical and creative way. To date, the programme has reached 119,500 students and teachers.\n\nIn the UK, we launched Schools Connected to help improve connectivity for learners from low-income families. The programme provided an initial 250,000 SIMs with a 30GB data allowance valid for 90 days. All SIMs were ordered by 6,970 primary and secondary schools in just four working days, so we doubled the number of SIMs and distributed 500,000. We estimate that each SIM used potentially prevented a student missing 60 days of schooling.\n\nSupporting jobseekers and disadvantaged groups\n\nSupporting jobseekers has been a focus area for years, in particular building programmes to respond to the growing youth unemployment crisis. In the EU the youth unemployment rate is 17% and in South Africa it is 56%. In 2018, we launched the Future Jobs Finder, for jobseekers whose background is in non-technology fields. The Future Jobs Finder helps identify transferable skills and strengths, giving recommendations on tech professions and e-learning suited to people\u2019s backgrounds and aptitudes. Since its launch, the Future Jobs Finder has supported over 600,000 people.\n\nIn South Africa, our ConnectU platform provides over 15.5 million Vodacom customers with free access to a range of services covering health, education, safety and security, social media and jobs. ConnectU\u2019s job portal has enabled 3.1 million people to access seven different job search websites for free, with over a third of users being in the lowest income bracket.\n\nWe also developed a temporary immediate response initiative to address the contraction in economic activity caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Our \u2018Jobseekers.Connected\u2019 offer across our European markets, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa includes discounted connectivity to help jobseekers remain connected and supports them while they are searching for a new career opportunity. It includes free access to over 600 curated courses on global e-learning platform Udemy to help people re-skill.\n\nBringing mobile to more women\n\nGoal: To connect an additional 20 million women living in Africa and Turkey to mobile by 2025\n\nMobile technology enables women in many of our markets to access essential services from maternal healthcare to agricultural information for female smallholder farmers. 54% of women in emerging markets now use mobile internet, but the gender gap for internet usage is substantial with over 300 million fewer women than men accessing the internet on a mobile phone.\n\nWe develop commercial programmes that support education, skills and jobs, better health and wellbeing and safety for women, and enable economic empowerment. For example, this year, we expanded Vodacom\u2019s Mum & Baby service from South Africa to the DRC. Mum & Baby is a free-to-use (no data charges) mobile health service which gives customers maternal, neonatal and child health information. The service has helped over 1.9 million parents and caregivers to take positive actions to improve their children\u2019s health since its launch in 2017.\n\nThrough these programmes we aim to connect an additional 20 million women living in Africa and Turkey to mobile by 2025. Since 2016 we estimate to have added an additional 15.9 million female customers. The increase of women in our customer base also makes good business sense; women have a higher Net Promoter Score (+4pp compared to men).\nPurpose (continued)\n\nBuilding platforms for financial inclusion\n\nGoal: To connect over 50 million people and their families to mobile money services by 2025\n\nFinancial inclusion is key to reducing extreme poverty. Nevertheless, many people, especially women, still lack access to financial services with close to 1.7 billion adults currently un-banked. Without the ability to transfer money, people are limited in their ability to save, access loans, start a business and even be paid.\n\nIn 2007, together with our Kenyan associate, Safaricom, we developed the first mobile money transfer service, M-Pesa. This provides financial services to millions of people who have a mobile phone but limited access to a bank account. It is also widely used to manage business transactions and to pay salaries, pensions, agricultural subsidies and government grants, and reduces the associated risks of robbery and corruption in a cash-based society.\n\nIn April 2020, Vodacom and Safaricom completed the acquisition of the M-Pesa brand and the product development team from Vodafone Group through M-Pesa Africa, a newly created joint venture. The joint venture will help consolidate M-Pesa as the largest FinTech company in Africa and accelerate the growth of M-Pesa across the continent.\n\nAs of March 2021, 48.3 million customers were using M-Pesa (or equivalent), with over 15.2 billion transactions made in the year (1.7 million per hour on average) through a network of more than 918,500 agents.\n\nIn the last year we disbursed \u20ac4 billion in loans and overdrafts across our markets. We also launched a lending marketplace in Tanzania and Mozambique to enable lenders to easily integrate and offer a range of credit products with tailored pricing and terms to millions of customers and businesses.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, we implemented measures to support customers across our markets and promote digital payments as a safer way to transact than cash. These included removing fees on person-to-person transactions, increasing transaction and balance limits in partnership with the regulators and creating more flexible customer registration processes.\n\nThis year we have seen a significant increase in mobile money customers, as the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated consumers moving to cashless transactions. Over the next year, we plan to evaluate our 2025 goal to ensure it better reflects our commercial ambition and opportunity.\n\nM-Pesa and mobile money services adoption\n\n| Country     | Number of mobile money customers (million) | % of service revenue | % M-Pesa penetration on GSM base |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Kenya       | 28.3                                      | 33%                  | 90%                              |\n| Tanzania    | 7.4                                       | 37%                  | 62%                              |\n| Mozambique  | 4.9                                       | 19%                  | 73%                              |\n| DRC         | 3.0                                       | 10%                  | 26%                              |\n| Lesotho     | 0.9                                       | 10%                  | 69%                              |\n| Ghana       | 1.6                                       | 3%                   | 40%                              |\n| Egypt       | 2.3                                       | 1%                   | 7%                               |\n\nWorkplace equality\n\nWe are passionate about making the world more connected, inclusive and sustainable, and committed to creating a place where everyone can truly be themselves and belong. We bring the human touch to our technology to create a better digital future for all, starting with our people.\n\nOur people\n\nWe are committed to developing a diverse and inclusive global workforce that reflects the customers and societies we serve.\n\nKey information\n\n|                                | 2021  | 2020  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Average number of employees    | 94,274| 92,866|\n| Average number of contractors  | 10,481| 11,269|\n| Employee contract types        |       |       |\n| Permanent                      | 87%   | 87%   |\n| Fixed term contracts           | 13%   | 13%   |\n| Full-time                      | 93%   | 92%   |\n| Part-time                      | 7%    | 8%    |\n| Number of markets where we operate | 19   | 21    |\n| Employee nationalities         | 137   | 126   |\n| Our people across the Group    |       |       |\n| Germany\u00b9                       | 14%   | 14%   |\n| UK\u00b9                            | 9%    | 10%   |\n| Italy\u00b9                         | 5%    | 5%    |\n| Spain\u00b9                         | 4%    | 4%    |\n| Vodacom\u00b9                       | 11%   | 11%   |\n| _VOIS and Shared Operations\u00b2   | 31%   | 30%   |\n| Other\u00b2                         | 26%   | 26%   |\n| Employee experience            |       |       |\n| Employee engagement index      | 74    | 77    |\n| Alignment to purpose\u00b3          | 93%   | 94%   |\n| Voluntary turnover rate\u2075        | 8%    | 12%   |\n| Involuntary turnover rate\u2075      | 3%    | 7%    |\n\nNotes:\n\n1. World Bank 2017.\nDiversity and inclusion\n\nThis year, our diversity and inclusion focus has been on removing barriers to workplace equality, by accelerating momentum on gender equality, sustaining focus on LGBT+, setting solid foundations on race and ethnicity, and ensuring our physical and digital workplace is fully accessible. Our expanded focus on multiple dimensions of diversity reflects our ambition to be a company with a global workforce that reflects the customers, communities and businesses we serve, as well as the wider societies in which we operate.\n\nGoal: We aim to have 40% women in management roles by 2030.\n\nWe have reached 32%, and continue to drive progress through our programmes, policies and leadership incentives. Our progress and achievements to increase diversity were recognised with the inclusion of Vodafone in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index and Refinitiv\u2019s D&I Top 100 during the year. As part of our approach, we ensure that there is gender diversity when recruiting for senior leadership roles and our leadership team is accountable for maintaining and encouraging diversity amongst their teams. Women in management targets are also embedded in our long-term incentive plans. We hired 53% women for our graduate roles, and to date have supported 564 people back into employment after a career break through our Reconnect programme, of whom 470 were women. We have also connected with over 5,000 girls via our digital skills programme \u2018Code Like a Girl\u2019 since 2017, including 576 this year, and continued this programme during the COVID-19 pandemic by launching a digital coding classroom experience, available to all markets.\n\nGender diversity\n\n|                                | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|\n| Women on the Board             | 45%  | 42%  |\n| Women on the Executive Committee| 29%  | 29%  |\n| Women in senior leadership positions\u00b9 | 30%  | 29%  |\n| Women in management and senior leadership roles\u00b2 | 32%  | 31%  |\n| Women as a percentage of external hires | 43%  | 38%  |\n| Women as a percentage of graduates | 53%  | 53%  |\n| Women in overall workforce     | 40%  | 39%  |\n\nNotes:\n1. Percentage of senior women in our top 175 positions (FY20: 173).\n2. Percentage of women in our 6,609 management and leadership roles (FY20: 6,372).\n\nIn 2019, Vodafone launched the first global domestic violence policy, which set out comprehensive workplace resources, security and other measures for employees at risk of experiencing, and recovering from, domestic violence and abuse. As the majority of the global workforce shifted to home working in the outbreak of COVID-19, reports of a \u2018shadow pandemic\u2019 of domestic violence intensified worldwide. Our markets considered the policy very important for supporting employees affected by domestic violence and abuse. Of those affected, the most frequent forms of support were counselling and advice, paid safe leave and referrals to specialist organisations with adaptations to working hours and workload. We reinforced our commitment to this area through training, technology, modified remote working policies and support for other employers. Our technology includes free apps such as Bright Sky, which provides support and information to anyone in an abusive relationship or those concerned about someone they know, reaching over 75,000 users.\n\nTo support the health and wellbeing of our people through different life stages, we commissioned a global research project which identified that 62% of women with symptoms of menopause found it impacted their work. In March 2021, we made a global commitment to support women experiencing menopause, estimated to currently affect 37% of women in Vodafone. The virtual global launch event was held during International Women\u2019s Week in March with over 1,400 participants, and was followed by the release of digital supporting toolkits and resources. During the year, we also implemented our global parental leave policy across our markets, giving every parent the opportunity to take 16 weeks of fully paid leave with a phased return to work over six months where parents work the equivalent of four days and are paid for five to spend time with new children in their family. Alongside gender equality, we retained focus on supporting the LGBT+ community, being recognised as a Top Global Employer by Stonewall. Our global LGBT+ network is thriving, with over 3,000 allies and active support from senior executives who champion inclusion.\n\nWe marked International Day of People with Disabilities with a global event attended by over 600 people, highlighting initiatives across markets that create inclusive environments for customers and colleagues with visible and invisible differences. We have also hosted training on neurodiversity and accessibility webinars to ensure our colleagues are aware of the accessibility features in our digital workplace and how to use them.\n\nThis year, we have expanded our existing diversity and inclusion agenda and focused on race and ethnicity, starting with our Global Black Lives Matter webinar listening to colleagues share their experience. To build capability in holding conversations on race in the workplace, we launched a \u2018Let\u2019s talk about race\u2019 session in partnership with \u2018Business in the Community\u2019. We delivered Race Fluency sessions for our senior leaders, and launched cross-company reciprocal mentoring schemes. In October 2020, we hosted a global Black History Month webinar to reiterate our commitment, with the sponsorship of our Vodafone Business CEO, Vinod Kumar.\n\nTo better understand representation across our organisation and target diversity and inclusion programmes more effectively, we launched a campaign called #CountMeIn in November 2020, which encourages employees to voluntarily self-declare their diversity demographics. These include race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and caring responsibilities, in line with local privacy and legal requirements. Our intention is to use this data to set leadership targets around race and ethnicity, to complement our commitments on gender, by the end of 2021. We are still in the process of collecting robust and complete data for our entire workforce, however 29% of our Executive Committee members are from ethnically diverse backgrounds.\n\nOur commitment to diversity and inclusion is reflected across our global policies and principles, such as our Code of Conduct and our Fair Pay principles.\n\nRead more about our Fair Pay principles on page 97\n\nClick to read about our approach to fair pay: vodafone.com/fair-pay\nPurpose (continued)\n\nPlanet\n\nWe believe that urgent and sustained action is required to address the climate emergency. Business success should not come at a cost to the environment, and we are committed to ensure the greening of all of our activities. We also see a key role for our digital networks and technologies in helping to address climate change. Digitalisation is key to saving energy, using natural resources more efficiently and creating a circular economy.\n\nThis year, as part of the acceleration guided by our social contract, and our commitment to \u201cbuild back better\u201d, we brought forward our target to purchase 100% renewable electricity in Europe, from 2025 to July 2021. Building on previous commitments, we set a new Science-Based Target to reduce our carbon emissions and we set a \u2018net zero\u2019 goal.\n\nTo help deliver a twin digital and green transformation, we also set a target to enable our customers to reduce their emissions, and we updated our supplier evaluation criteria to include environmental considerations. In addition, we continue to focus on reducing electronic waste (e-waste), progressing against our target to reuse, resell or recycle 100% of our network waste by 2025, and driving action to reduce device waste.\n\nWe were recognised by global environmental non-profit organisation CDP for our actions and transparency on our environmental impact and secured a place on CDP\u2019s climate change \u2018A List\u2019. This places us in the top 5% of companies that responded to CDP\u2019s 2020 climate change questionnaire.\n\nWe also continued our work to identify potential climate change risks and opportunities through conducting Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) scenario-based risk and opportunity assessments across key markets. We are using the insights to create a circular economy.\n\nOur Planet goals\n\n| Year | Goal |\n|------|------|\n| 2021 | Purchase 100% of the electricity we use in Europe from renewable sources by July 2021 |\n| 2025 | Purchase 100% of the electricity we use globally from renewable sources |\n|      | Reuse, resell or recycle 100% of our network waste |\n| 2030 | Eliminate all carbon emissions (\u2018net zero\u2019) from our own activities and from energy we purchase and use (Scope 1 and 2) |\n|      | Halve carbon emissions from our carbon footprint (against a 2020 baseline), including joint ventures, all supply chain purchases, the use of products we have sold and business travel (Scope 3) |\n|      | Enable our business customers who use our services to reduce their own carbon emissions by a cumulative total of 350 million tonnes between 2020 and 2030 |\n| 2040 | Eliminate Scope 3 emissions completely to reach \u2018net zero\u2019 across our full carbon footprint |\n\nReducing carbon emissions\n\nGoal: To reduce our own carbon emissions to \u2018net zero\u2019 by 2030 and across the full value chain by 2040.\n\nWe set an approved 2030 Science-Based Target in line with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5\u00b0C, becoming the first major telecoms operator to follow the emission reduction pathway developed for the ICT sector (setting out specific emissions reduction trajectories for mobile, fixed and data centres).\n\nWe also committed to reaching full value chain \u2018net zero\u2019 emissions by 2040.\n\nDriving energy efficiency\n\nDespite ever-growing use of data and expansion of our networks, this year our total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions decreased by 30% to 1.37 million tonnes of CO\u2082e (carbon dioxide equivalent), due to our ongoing focus on energy efficiency and an increase in the proportion of renewable electricity purchased.\n\nWe are committed to continually improving the energy efficiency of our base station sites and in our technology centres, which together account for 96% of our total global energy consumption. During FY21, we invested \u20ac65 million of capital expenditure in energy efficiency and on-site renewable projects across our business, which has led to annual energy savings of 135 GWh.\n\nThis has been underpinned by the implementation of the \u2018best-in-class\u2019 ISO 50001 Energy Management System framework. To date, Albania, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Turkey and the UK have been awarded certification, with other markets due to implement the framework in the next year. Key energy efficiency initiatives we have focused on during the year include:\n\n- sourcing and deploying more efficient network equipment and powering-down carriers during times of low traffic;\n- gradually switching off the 3G network (which is typically 70% less energy efficient than 4G) and decommissioning legacy equipment in our core network;\n- deploying high-density pods (modular blocks with concentrated power and cooling technology) to maximise the performance of servers and minimise cooling requirements within data centres;\n- reducing energy demand by installing lower-energy power and cooling technologies; and\n- using AI algorithms in our passive infrastructure, allowing us to optimise energy use in cooling.\n\nWe continue to work with eSight Energy to implement an energy data management system using data feeds from our electricity suppliers and from smart meters. This system is now live across 12 markets in Europe, with smart meters installed at 62,000 sites. This year, we developed additional functionality, including a module to validate energy savings from projects, forecasting of energy consumption, tenant billing reports and capacity and meter calibration reports.\nOur performance\n\n| Unit | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|\n| Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions | Million tonnes of CO\u2082e | 1.37 | 1.95 |\n| Scope 1 emissions | Million tonnes of CO\u2082e | 0.27 | 0.28 |\n| Scope 2 emissions | Million tonnes of CO\u2082e | 1.10 | 1.67 |\n| Scope 3 emissions | Million tonnes of CO\u2082e | 9.4 | 9.5 |\n| Joint ventures and associates* | Million tonnes of CO\u2082e | 3.2 | 2.9 |\n| Purchased goods and services | Million tonnes of CO\u2082e | 4.0 | 3.7 |\n| Use of sold products | Million tonnes of CO\u2082e | 1.5 | 2.1 |\n| Fuel and energy-related activities | Million tonnes of CO\u2082e | 0.6 | 0.7 |\n| Other (business travel, upstream leased assets, waste) | Million tonnes of CO\u2082e | 0.1 | 0.1 |\n| *Of which India (Vodafone Idea and Indus Towers) | Million tonnes of CO\u2082e | 2.5 | 2.4 |\n\nRenewable electricity\n\n| Percentage of purchased electricity from renewable sources | % | 56 | 23 |\n| Percentage of purchased electricity from renewable sources in Europe | % | 80 | 33 |\n\nGHG emissions per petabyte (\u2018PB\u2019) of mobile data carried\n\n| Mobile Data Traffic (petabytes) | Petabytes | 11,714 | 7,983 |\n| Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions per petabyte of mobile data carried by our networks | Tonnes of CO\u2082e | 117 | 245 |\n\nVodafone energy use\n\n| Unit | 2021 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|\n| Base stations | Gigawatt hours / % | 4,239 / 73 | 3,995 / 69 |\n| Technology centres | Gigawatt hours / % | 1,358 / 23 | 1,488 / 26 |\n| Offices | Gigawatt hours / % | 201 / 3 | 263 / 5 |\n| Retail stores | Gigawatt hours / % | 33 / 1 | 46 / 1 |\n| Total | Gigawatt hours / % | 5,832 / 100 | 5,790 / 100 |\n\nPurchasing renewable electricity\n\nThis year, we spent approximately \u20ac760 million on purchasing electricity. During the year, 56% of our electricity purchased was from renewable sources (2020: 23%).\n\nIn July 2020, we committed that all of our European operations would be purchasing 100% renewable electricity no later than July 2021, significantly accelerating our previous target of 2025. This year, 80% of our purchased electricity in Europe was from renewable sources (2020: 33%) and we are confident that we will meet our July 2021 target.\n\nWe currently have Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in Spain and the UK. Electricity prices agreed under PPA contracts are broadly comparable to wholesale electricity prices and also provide us with more certainty, as well as helping to create new capacity within the markets. In addition, Italy, Germany, Ireland, Hungary, Romania, Spain, Greece and Czech Republic all sourced Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or tariffs during the year. The incremental cost of RECs (or their equivalent) is small in the context of our overall energy spend.\n\nWorking with our partners to reduce Scope 3 emissions\n\nScope 3 emissions are indirect GHG emissions which we cannot control but may be able to influence. As part of our Science-Based Target, we have committed to halve our Scope 3 carbon emissions by 2030 (against a 2020 baseline) and eliminate them entirely by 2040, as part of our \u2018net zero\u2019 target. The main sources of Scope 3 emissions are investments (joint ventures and associates), purchased goods and services, and the use of sold products.\n\nThis year, our estimated Scope 3 emissions were 9.4 million tonnes of CO\u2082e. We worked with the Carbon Trust to analyse our Scope 3 emissions and prioritise reduction opportunities, mostly by working with our suppliers.\n\nFrom October 2020, we introduced a 20% weighting for environmental and social criteria in our supplier evaluation criteria in \u2018Request For Quotation\u2019 (RFQ) processes. The updated process examines whether suppliers have environmental policies to address carbon reduction, renewable energy, plastic reduction, circular economy and product life-cycle (in addition to diversity and health and safety).\n\nRead page 50 for further information on our supplier evaluation criteria\n\nThe assessment awards positive scoring for suppliers that have set (or are willing to set) a Science-Based Target. In addition, suppliers which offer product-specific CO\u2082 data and pathways for reduction over the contract period are positively scored.\n\nOur supplier performance management programme also covers environmental factors, and suppliers\u2019 GHG performance is one of the factors evaluated in our annual assessment process. We ask selected suppliers to provide details of their GHG emissions and management programmes through CDP. Last year, 88% of those suppliers responded, with 77% reporting that they had set a target for GHG emissions. This work was recently acknowledged by CDP, with Vodafone joining its Supplier Engagement Rating Leaderboard, which recognises companies which engage with their suppliers to tackle climate change.\n\nIn addition to suppliers, we also work with our joint ventures and associates, which represent the most significant proportion of our Scope 3 emissions. Actions include:\n\n- In India, Vodafone Idea has developed an Energy and Carbon Management Policy, with actions to save energy and reduce carbon emissions;\n- In Kenya, Safaricom has committed to becoming a zero carbon-emitting company by 2050.\nPurpose (continued)\n\n\u2014 In the Netherlands, VodafoneZiggo launched its first green bond, which will be used to finance green projects that will lower its environmental impact; and\n\u2014 In Australia, TPG Telecom recently committed to purchase 100% renewable electricity by 2025.\n\nThe third most significant source of our Scope 3 emissions is the use of sold products (e.g. charging devices). As countries de-carbonise their economies, the use of sold products will become an increasingly significant source of emissions.\n\nIn Australia, TPG Telecom recently committed to purchase 100% renewable electricity by 2025.\n\nIn the Netherlands, VodafoneZiggo launched its first green bond, which will be used to finance green projects that will lower its environmental impact; and\n\nEnabling our customers to reduce their emissions\n\nFor Vodafone, our most important contribution to tackling climate change is through enabling our customers (which include both businesses and governments) to reduce their environmental footprint using our digital technologies and services.\n\nIn July 2020, we committed to helping our business customers reduce their own carbon emissions by a cumulative total of 350 million tonnes globally over 10 years between 2020 and 2030 \u2013 the equivalent to Italy\u2019s total annual carbon emissions for 2019.\n\nOur IoT service offer, including logistics and fleet management, smart metering and manufacturing activities, will be central in delivering this target. Other savings are expected to be made through healthcare services, cloud hosting and home working.\n\nWe work with the Carbon Trust to calculate the total GHG emissions avoided as a consequence of our IoT technologies and services. We estimate that over 54% of our 123 million IoT connections directly enabled customers to reduce their emissions in the past year. During the year, we estimate an avoidance of 7.1 million tonnes CO\u2082e, which is 5.2 times the emissions generated from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2).\n\nIn March 2021, we became a founding member of the European Green Digital Coalition, which brings together ICT sector companies to work together with EU policymakers and experts, to drive investment in, and implementation of, digital solutions in action against climate change.\n\nCarbon enablement overview\n\n| Number of connections | GHG emission saving (Million tonnes CO\u2082e) |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Smart meters          | 15.4                                     |\n| Smart logistics       | 38.1                                     |\n| Healthcare            | 11.8                                     |\n| Other (cloud/street lighting/ EV charging) | 1.1 |\n| Total                 | 66.4                                     |\n\nEnablement ratio\n\n| Total GHG enablement saving (Million tonnes CO\u2082e) | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions                    | 7.1  | 6.9  |\n| Enablement ratio                                 | 5.2  | 3.5  |\n\nReducing waste and helping to build a circular economy\n\nGoal: To reuse, resell or recycle 100% of our network waste by 2025\n\nApart from carbon emissions, electronic waste is a material environmental issue for our business. We have consistently sought to manage our own impact in a responsible manner and also support our customers with their efforts.\n\nOur global policy on waste management prioritises the reuse, resell or recycling of unwanted equipment. We aim to keep resources in use for as long as possible, extracting the maximum value from equipment while in use and then recovering and reusing materials responsibly.\n\nWe implement resource efficiency and waste disposal management programmes in all our markets to minimise environmental impacts from network waste, IT equipment and waste. This year, we generated an estimated 7.900 tonnes of waste (which includes hazardous waste) and we recovered and recycled 79%. Globally, 98.7% of our network waste was sent for reuse and recycling (excluding hazardous waste).\n\nTo deliver our 2025 goal to reuse, resell or recycle 100% of our network waste, we have launched an internal asset marketplace, a business-to-business solution within Vodafone that allows us to re-sell and re-purpose excess stock or large decommissioned electrical items like masts and antennae. Since launching at the start of 2020, we estimate that we have saved over \u20ac10 million of spend and avoided over 1,250 tonnes of CO\u2082e.\n\nWe are assessing the possibility of expanding the solution to partner markets and other operators.\n\nNetwork waste management (excluding hazardous waste)\n\n| Total network waste (metric tonnes) | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Reused                              | 20%  | 15%  |\n| Recycled                            | 79%  | 84%  |\n| Landfilled                          | 1%   | 1%   |\n| Total                               | 6,307| 8,138|\n\nApart from addressing our network waste, we are working on a series of actions to reduce device waste. We are increasingly adopting circular economy approaches and take a life-cycle management approach, which includes extending the lifespan of devices through repair, refurbishment and resale before encouraging the responsible recycling of devices at the end of their useful life.\n\nMost of our markets operate trade-in and device buyback schemes and repair services to encourage customers to repair or return their old devices. For example, this year Vodafone UK launched a phone trade-in tool, accessible via the MyVodafone app. The tool assesses device eligibility and provides a guaranteed trade-in price, encouraging greater trade-in rates.\n\nWe also strive to refurbish and reuse fixed-line equipment multiple times, with significant associated environmental and cost savings.\n\nGiven a large part of the solution to drive circularity for devices depends on industry action, we recently joined the Circular Electronics Partnership, which brings together leaders across the value chain \u2013 from manufacturing, reverse logistics, material recovery, to e-waste management \u2013 to drive circularity solutions for electronics.\n\nBeyond what we can directly and indirectly influence we also support societal change to more circular economy models. Digital and connected solutions are an essential part of the solution towards lower resource use and improved reuse and recycling. For example, through enabling material tracing or shifting from product-based business models to service-based ones.\n\nWe are also eliminating all unnecessary plastics and other disposable single-use items where there are lower impact alternatives across all our retail stores and offices.\n\nEngaging our people\n\nMore than 15,000 colleagues are currently members of our \u201c#RedLovesGreen\u201d employee engagement initiative, which aims to raise awareness of the individual actions that employees can take to reduce energy and other resource uses.\nDigital Society\n\nWe believe in the power of connectivity and digital services to strengthen the resilience of economies. Through our mobile and fixed networks, data flows at speed, connecting people and communities.\n\nOver the past year, the COVID-19 crisis has tested the resilience of our societies, of businesses small and large, and of public services. We have also seen how connectivity and digital services became a lifeline allowing people to work, learn, stay in touch with friends and family, access healthcare and more.\n\nThis year, in response to the COVID-19 crisis and informed by our social contract, we shifted the focus of the Digital Society pillar towards digitalising critical sectors, whilst continuing to invest in our network infrastructure and coverage. We have specifically focused on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), smart cities, agriculture and health. The following outlines our approach and progress in these areas.\n\nBuilding a gigabit network\n\nWe continue to invest in our network infrastructure and coverage to deliver a high-quality service that allows individuals and businesses to connect confidently anywhere and at any time, with benefits for the economy, for quality of life and for the environment.\n\nCurrently, we have over 150 million customers connected to our next-generation mobile and fixed networks.1\n\nSupporting small businesses\n\nSMEs are a critical part of the economy, but many have been disproportionately affected by the crisis. The OECD found that in 2020, more than half of SMEs were facing severe losses in revenues due to COVID-19, with one third fearing for their future without further support.2 SMEs also provide opportunities for socio-economic participation and social mobility for women, young people, and ethnic minorities; groups of the workforce that have been particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThrough Vodafone Business, we provide products and services which are specifically tailored for SME and small-office home-office (SOHO) businesses, helping guide them through technology choices and improving their digital readiness. These segments also represent a significant commercial opportunity for Vodafone, with the overall market expected to grow a combined \u20ac6 billion over three years.3\n\nTo better support SMEs across Europe, Vodafone Business launched V-Hub this year. The free service provides access to online information putting businesses in direct touch with experts to advise on digitalising their business. As at 31 March 2021, over one million businesses were using V-Hub across our four largest European markets. We plan to continue the expansion of the service, to support over three million customers by April 2022.\n\nNotes:\n1. Customers connected to our next-generation networks include active 4G and 5G customers, as well as customers connected to fixed networks with speeds higher than 30Mbps.\n2. OECD, 2020.\n3. Vodafone Business investor day, 2021.\n4. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 2017.\n5. Eurostat, 2021.\n6. World Bank, 2019.\n\nTo assist businesses most at risk within our supply chain, Vodafone ensured that all new orders issued to micro and small suppliers by Vodafone\u2019s European operations were paid within 15 days instead of the customary 30 to 60 days between April and October 2020, benefiting over 1,200 small businesses. We also offer optional supply chain financing which allows suppliers to leverage Vodafone\u2019s credit position to access cheaper funding and liquidity. This has no impact on Vodafone\u2019s commercially negotiated payments terms.\n\nIn South Africa, Vodacom Financial Services has built a supplier portal called VodaTrade, where small suppliers can connect with bigger business partners.\n\nDigitalising agriculture\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization, by 2050, the world will need to produce 50% more food than current levels.4 There is also a growing need to address the environmental impact of agriculture. In Europe, agriculture accounts for 10% of the EU\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions and over 40% of EU land use;5 in many cases leading to habitat loss and deforestation.\n\nThrough our connectivity and platforms (including our IoT platform), we are helping to increase the amount of information that farmers have available to them, enabling the optimisation of operations and use of resources. This allows a farmer to reduce the use of pesticides and fertiliser (which reduces emissions), water use and resource consumption, as well as improving the protection of biodiversity and increasing yields.\n\nThrough Vodacom\u2019s subsidiary, Mezzanine, we are digitalising agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa by giving smallholder farmers access to agricultural inputs, financial services like insurance, logistics suppliers, buyers and markets and knowledge through a digital agri-ecosystem called Connected Farmer. With over 2.1 million smallholder farmers registered, the platform allows an ecosystem of partners to register, profile, communicate and transact (using M-Pesa in some cases) with each other.\n\nTo support larger commercial farmers, Mezzanine developed MyFarmWeb, a cloud-based web platform that allows a producer to capture agricultural information (physical, chemical, and microbial soil analysis, pest presence, satellite and remote sensing information and data from various internet connected farming sensors) into a system that aggregates and calibrates the data to assist in best practice decision-making. This helps farmers to increase yield whilst not damaging the environment.\n\nOver 6,800 farms across Africa, USA, Australia and New Zealand use MyFarmWeb, and we are excited about the potential of further expansion of this platform.\n\nCreating smarter cities\n\nWith 55% of the world\u2019s population living in cities, digitalisation can play a key role in tackling many of our cities\u2019 most pressing challenges. Acting as a close partner with municipal governments, Vodafone\u2019s data platform and extensive IoT solutions help to make cities smarter by, for example, intelligently managing energy use and pollution right across the built environment. They can also protect citizens and businesses from crime more effectively and safeguard vulnerable citizens in their homes.\n\nThis year, Vodafone Spain continued work with the Sevilla municipal government to integrate the Vodafone Smart Cities Platform to monitor its services. The Security Vertical service, for example, monitors visitor flows and, by integrating different sources of anonymised and aggregated data with analytical capabilities, can help identify security risks. Smart management of parking, water use, waste collection, energy, and air quality are also being piloted.\nRevolutionising healthcare\n\nThe need for a fast response to the health crisis has accelerated the digitalisation of healthcare, which will also mean national healthcare systems will be in a better place to address the backlog that the COVID-19 crisis has created in a more cost efficient and faster way. Vodafone\u2019s connectivity services and platforms include:\n\n- **Connected (IoT) wearable or implanted devices**, which allow patients to be monitored as they recover at home while healthcare professionals can monitor and treat more patients;\n- **Artificial Reality and robotics to aid surgeries and remote expert support**, increasing both the quality of care delivered through digital assistants and access to healthcare for more people;\n- **Large-scale device (IoT) connectivity within hospitals**, enabling monitoring and optimal allocation of limited resources, such as beds, medical devices and even hospital staff; and\n- **Auxiliary robotics**, which have the future potential to take care of non-patient-facing work in hospitals, such as cleaning and restocking, so that doctors and nurses can spend more time with patients.\n\nIn Greece, we have implemented the Vodafone Telemedicine Programme, an end-to-end telemedicine care system to support patient management, monitoring and clinical care. Since launching in 2013, more than 500 doctors have been trained in the programme and over 5,000 virtual appointments were conducted. Almost 75% of patients reported a reduction in the number of hospital visits and 90% of doctors thought that the greatest benefit was the ability to deliver better quality care to their patients.\n\nOver the last year, Vodafone has played a significant role in supporting government responses to the COVID-19 health crisis. For example, across Europe, Vodafone provided connectivity to emergency hospitals. In Spain, we connected 500 wireless IoT alarms by beds in the largest field hospital in Madrid. In South Africa, our subsidiary Mezzanine, provided a PPE stock visibility solution to 350 hospitals to monitor and optimise the stock of 3,500 facilities spread across the country.\n\nWe contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goals (\u2018SDG\u2019s) provide a blueprint for human progress and a clear call to action for businesses to contribute to a better future.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has posed a huge challenge to society and has led to a reversal of progress on a number of SDGs: for example, over 100 million additional people have been pushed into extreme poverty, 1.6 billion children have missed school during the last year and the pandemic has widened gender inequalities. Digital technology can help accelerate progress towards delivering the SDGs as society builds back better. Vodafone is committed to playing our role and we believe we can increase the speed and scale of delivery across a wide number of SDGs through leveraging our technology and services, and through partnering with others.\n\nWe enable inclusive and sustainable digital societies\n\nVodafone is committed to accelerating connectivity and digitisation in order to meet the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. We have identified two priority SDGs (SDG9 build resilient infrastructure and innovation, and SDG17 strengthen the means of implementation and partnerships for sustainable development) that will enable us and our partners to find lasting solutions to social, economic and environmental challenges and thereby accelerate the delivery of many other SDGs.\n\n**Connectivity**: We want everyone \u2013 whoever they are and wherever they live \u2013 to have access to reliable and affordable internet.\n\n**Digital innovations**: We will build digital innovations such as IoT solutions and digital platforms like M-Pesa to contribute to the sustainable development across a range of sectors including manufacturing, transport, health, agriculture, education and energy.\n\nThrough connectivity infrastructure, digital innovations and partnerships, we deliver impact across many of the SDGs:\n\nNotes:\n1. World Bank, 2020.\n2. World Bank, 2021.\nResponsible business\n\nTo underpin the delivery of our purpose, we ensure that we operate in a responsible way. Acting ethically, lawfully and with integrity is critical to our long-term success.\n\nOur Code of Conduct sets out what we expect from every single person working for and with Vodafone, regardless of location. We also expect our suppliers and business partners to uphold the same standards and to abide by our Code of Ethical Purchasing.\n\nClick here to read our Code of Conduct: vodafone.com/code-of-conduct\n\nOur \u2018Doing What\u2019s Right\u2019 training and communication programme is key to embedding a shared understanding of the Code of Conduct across Vodafone. Throughout the year, Doing What\u2019s Right training communications promoted different areas of our Code of Conduct, including Speak Up, anti-bribery and privacy to competition law, security, and health and safety. Training on our Code of Conduct is included in our standard induction processes for new employees. We expect every employee to complete refresher training when assigned, and this is typically every two years. Of those employees assigned induction or refresher training during the period, 84% had completed the training as at 31 March 2021.\n\nA new Code of Conduct module was produced and launched to over 34,000 English speaking employees this financial year\u2014with 88% completing it. The module pushes the boundaries of e-learning with high impact video-based scenarios that are designed to reinforce behaviours rather than just give employees information or test knowledge. The course is currently being translated and will be rolled out to the rest of Vodafone over the next year.\n\nDuring the year, we updated our Global policy portal and the digital version of our Code of Conduct. These new tools provide employees easy access to the information and policies that they need. Since launch, 28,000 users accessed our Global policy portal and 25,000 users accessed the new digital Code of Conduct.\n\nOur Code of Conduct is well understood throughout Vodafone. In our latest Spirit Beat employee survey, 96% of respondents agreed with the statement \u201cOur team lives by the Code of Conduct\u201d.\n\nSpeak Up\n\nEveryone who works for or on behalf of Vodafone has a responsibility to report any behaviour at work that may be unlawful or criminal or could amount to an abuse of our policies, systems or processes and therefore a breach of our Code of Conduct. Employees are able to raise concerns with a line manager, with a colleague from human resources or through our confidential third-party hotline \u2013 Speak Up \u2013 accessible online or by telephone.\n\nSpeak Up operates under a non-retaliatory policy, meaning that everyone who raises a concern in good faith is treated fairly, with no negative consequences for their employment with Vodafone, regardless of the outcome of any subsequent investigation.\n\nAll Speak Up reports are confidentially investigated by local specialist teams, with a senior team in place to triage reports. Each grievance is formally and robustly investigated and is monitored to verify that any corrective action plan or remediation has been conducted. Our Group Risk and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Speak Up process, and the Audit and Risk Committee receives periodic updates.\n\nOur employees trust our Speak Up process, as evidenced by our latest Spirit Beat survey, with 87% of respondents agreeing that they believe appropriate action would be taken as a result of using our Speak Up process. We also track the proportion of \u2018named\u2019 versus \u2018anonymous\u2019 reports as a higher number of named reports suggests higher levels of trust in the Speak Up process. During the year, 64% of reports were \u2018named\u2019 and this was higher than available industry benchmarks.\n\nThis year, 623 separate concerns were reported using Speak Up. Speak Up reports could relate to matters of unlawful behaviour or matters of integrity, such as bribery, fraud, price fixing, a conflict of interest, or a breach of data privacy. Reports could also relate to people issues such as discrimination, bullying or harassment, danger to the health and safety of employees or the public, or potential abuses of human rights.\n\nIf we decide to proceed with an investigation, a qualified expert will investigate, keeping the person who raised the concern informed throughout the process. Where reports made to Speak Up require remedial action, this could include consequences at the individual level, or changes to internal processes and procedures.\n\nSpeak Up topics raised during the year\n\n| Topic                        | Speak Up reports | Requiring remedial action |\n|------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| People issues                | 47%              | 28%                      |\n| Integrity                    | 41%              | 35%                      |\n| Other (e.g. breach of policies) | 11%            | 41%                      |\n| Health and safety            | 1%               | 33%                      |\n\nSpeak Up is also made available to our suppliers and is communicated through our Code of Ethical Purchasing. For suppliers that decide to maintain their own grievance mechanisms, we require that they inform us of any grievances raised relating to work done on behalf of Vodafone directly.\n\nProtecting data\n\nMillions of people communicate and share information over our networks, enabling them to connect, innovate and prosper. Customers trust us with their data and maintaining this trust is at the heart of everything we do.\n\nData privacy\n\nWe believe that everyone has a right to privacy wherever they live in the world, and our commitment to our customers\u2019 privacy goes beyond legal compliance. As a result, our privacy programme applies globally, irrespective of whether there are local data protection or privacy laws.\n\nOur privacy management policy is based on the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and this is applied across Vodafone markets both inside and outside the European Economic Area. Our privacy management policy establishes a framework within which local data protection and privacy laws are respected and sets a baseline for those markets where there are no equivalent legal requirements.\nResponsible business (continued)\n\nWe always seek to respect and protect the right to privacy, including our customers\u2019 lawful rights to hold and express opinions and share information and ideas without interference. At the same time, as a licensed national operator, we are obliged to comply with lawful orders from national authorities and the judiciary, including law enforcement.\n\nPrivacy risks\nAs data volumes continue to grow and regulatory and customer scrutiny increases, it is more important than ever to be clear on the privacy risks we face, as well as how our policies and programmes can mitigate these risks. We separate data privacy risk into three main areas of risk:\n\n- **Collection**: collection of personal data without permissions or excessive collection of data.\n- **Access & Use**: use of personal data for unauthorised purposes, excessive data retention or poor data quality, and\n- **Sharing**: unauthorised disclosure of personal data, including supplier non-compliance.\n\nTo help us identify and manage emerging risks, we constantly evaluate our business strategy, new technologies, products and services as well as government policies and regulation.\n\nPrivacy principles\nOur privacy programme governs how we collect, use and manage our customers\u2019 personal data to ensure we respect the confidentiality of their communications and any choices that they have made regarding the use of their data. Our privacy programme is based on the following principles:\n\n- **Accountability**: We are accountable for living up to our commitments throughout Vodafone and with our partners and suppliers.\n- **Privacy by design**: Respect for privacy is a key component in the design, development and delivery of our products and services.\n- **Fairness and lawfulness**: We comply with privacy laws and act with integrity and fairness. We also actively engage with stakeholders, including civil society, academic institutions, industry and government, in order to share our expertise, learn from others, and shape better, more meaningful privacy laws and standards.\n- **Openness and honesty**: We communicate clearly about our actions that may impact privacy. We ensure our actions reflect our words and we are open to feedback.\n- **Choice and access**: We give people the ability to make simple and meaningful choices about their privacy and allow individuals, where appropriate, to access, update or delete their personal data.\n- **Responsible data management**: We apply appropriate data management practices to govern the processing of personal data. We carefully select external partners and we limit disclosure of personal data to what is described in our privacy notices or to what has been authorised by our customers. We also ensure personal data is not stored for longer than necessary or as is required by applicable laws and to maintain accuracy of data.\n- **Security safeguards**: We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against unauthorised access, use, modification or loss.\n- **Balance**: When we are required to balance the right to privacy against other obligations necessary for a free and secure society, we work to minimise privacy impacts.\n\nUsing customer data\nWe want to enable our customers to get the most out of our products and services. In order to provide these services, we need to use our customers\u2019 personal information. We are committed to looking after our customers\u2019 data, using it for its stated purpose, and we are always open about what we collect.\n\nKey uses of customer data are outlined below.\n\n- **Provision of services**: We process customer personal data to provide our customers with the products and services they have requested, to fulfil our contractual and legal obligations, and to provide customer care. To provide our services and to charge our customers the correct amount, we must process communications metadata regarding calls, texts and data usage.\n- **Quality, development and security of services**: We monitor the quality and use of our connectivity and other services so that we can continually improve and optimise them. This information also helps detect and prevent fraud, as well as keep our networks and services secure. We also do not sell data tied to specific individuals to third parties.\n- **Marketing**: With customer permission, we will use customer data to market our products and services and provide more accurate recommendations. This means we can present our customers with offers when they need them most; for example, when they are about to run out of data.\n- **Permissions**: Our multi-channel permission management platforms, deployed across all our channels (MyVodafone app, website, call centres and retail stores) allow our customers to control how we use their data for marketing and other purposes. For example, customers can express their opt-in consent to the use of their communications metadata for marketing purposes or for receiving third-party marketing messages, or they can opt-out from marketing entirely. All permissions can be revoked and choices can be changed at any time.\n- **Rights of individuals**: Our businesses provide their customers with access to their data through online and physical channels. These channels can be used to request deletion of data that is no longer necessary or correction of outdated or incorrect data. Our customer privacy statements and other customer facing documents provide information on how these rights can be exercised and how to raise complaints. Our frontline staff are trained to respond to the customers\u2019 requests.\n- **Sharing of data**: Where we rely on external suppliers and service providers to process data on our behalf, they are subject to security and privacy due diligence processes, and appropriate data processing agreements govern their activities. We do not share customers\u2019 personal data otherwise, unless required by law or with the consent of the customer.\n\nEach local market publishes a Privacy Statement to provide clear, transparent and relevant information on how we collect and use personal data, what choices are available regarding its use and how customers can exercise their rights.\n\nClick to read more about our privacy policies: vodafone.com/privacy-centre\n\nOperating model\nVodafone has an experienced team of privacy specialists dedicated to ensuring compliance with data protection laws and our policies in the countries where we operate.\n\nWe apply a process-based approach to managing privacy risks across the data life-cycle and teams from across Vodafone ensure end-to-end coverage. Dedicated security teams ensure appropriate technical and organisational information security measures are applied to protect personal data against unauthorised access, disclosure, loss or use during transit and at rest.\n\nRead more about cyber security on page 45-47 and 54\nAll products, services and processes are subject to privacy impact assessments as part of their development and throughout their life-cycle. We maintain Personal Data Processing Records, Supplier Privacy Compliance, Data Breach Management and Individual Rights processes, as well as Internal and International Data Transfer compliance frameworks, and training and awareness programmes.\n\nOur teams monitor and influence regulatory and industry developments and work to build and maintain relationships with local data protection authorities and other key stakeholders.\n\nOur privacy control frameworks are subject to continuous risk-based improvements. In addition to introducing updates to our global privacy controls, we also require every employee and where possible contractors, to complete privacy-specific training within six weeks of joining and then every two years. We have also refined training for high-risk roles aimed at teams with a key role in personal data processing. With this approach we aim to achieve a 90% completion rate on both types of training across all target groups across our global footprint.\n\nThe effectiveness of control implementation is subject to regular reporting and testing by the privacy teams and internal audit. Any findings are subject to remedial actions by the responsible control operator, and completion is monitored.\n\n**Governance**\n\nThe Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, a member of the Group Executive Committee, oversees the global privacy programme. The Group Privacy Officer, reporting to the Group General Counsel, is responsible for managing and overseeing the privacy programme on a day-to-day basis across the markets and provides regular status reports to Group General Counsel and Company Secretary and an annual update to the Group Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nWhilst each employee is responsible for protecting personal data they are trusted with, accountability for compliance sits with each operating company. A member of the local executive committee oversees the local implementation of our privacy programme. Each operating company also has a dedicated privacy officer, privacy legal counsel and other privacy specialists. Local privacy officers provide reports to the Group Privacy Officer throughout the year.\n\nThe Privacy Leadership team brings together Group and local privacy officers. It approves new standards and guidelines and monitors the implementation of global privacy plans. Operating companies also maintain privacy steering committees that bring together privacy and security teams and senior management from relevant business functions.\n\n**Privacy incidents**\n\nWe have a strong culture of data privacy and our assurance and monitoring activities are capable of identifying potential issues before they materialise. However, during the financial year, Vodafone was fined a combined \u20ac20 million for separate data privacy issues in Italy, Spain and Romania. The fines in Italy and Spain related to Vodafone\u2019s use of third-party marketing agencies, some of which had conducted direct marketing activities towards people who had opted-out. These activities were in violation of existing supplier agreements. In limited instances, there were also delays and issues in adding people to opt-out lists as a result of human and system errors, as well as related fraudulent activities which Vodafone reported to the relevant authorities. In addition, we received a fine in Spain due to a supplier\u2019s sub-contractor\u2019s non-compliance with international data transfer rules. The fine in Romania related to a delayed response to a subject access request.\n\nOur rules on telesales have been reviewed and compliance with these rules is subject to increased assurance and monitoring. Where necessary, improved controls have been introduced to monitor and enforce suppliers\u2019 compliance. Such measures include, for example, introduction of tools to automatically prevent or detect calls to opted-out customers, verification that commission is only paid for authorised calls, enforcement of contractual penalties for non-compliance, and discontinuation of contracts with a number of suppliers.\n\nFor detail on how we respond to a data breach, refer to the cyber security section on page 46\n\n**Location Insights**\n\nVodafone provides anonymous and aggregated insights which are based on network location data to our public sector and business customers. The Location Insights product harnesses the power of anonymised geospatial movement data of our customers to give organisations adopting the product a better understanding of how populations move in space and time, all while protecting the privacy of our customers. These insights are being used by Vodafone Business customers for transport or retail planning purposes as cities and urban areas become \u2018smart\u2019. It is important to note that once we have aggregated and anonymised customer-level data, individual customers cannot be identified or targeted with personal advertisements. Our customer privacy statements are open and transparent about this use of data and we allow customers to opt-out.\n\nAnonymous and aggregated location insights were also shared with government authorities to help them understand how populations moved during the COVID-19 pandemic. These initiatives were subject to detailed privacy assessments.\n\nOur Location Insights product received an honourable mention by the International Association of Privacy Professionals in 2018 for the most innovative privacy safeguarding product.\n\n**Cyber security**\n\nOur purpose is to enable connectivity in society and as a provider of critical national infrastructure we recognise the importance of cyber and information security. No organisation, government or person will ever be fully immune to cyber-attacks; however, the telecommunications industry is faced with a unique set of risks as we provide connectivity services and handle private communication data.\n\nOur networks connect millions of people, homes, businesses and things to each other and the internet. The security of our networks, systems and customers is a top priority and a fundamental part of our purpose. Our customers use Vodafone products and services because of our next-generation connectivity, but also because they trust that their information is secure.\n\n**Identification of vulnerabilities & risks**\n\nCyber security is a principal risk. We recognise that if not managed effectively, there could be major customer, financial, reputation or regulatory impacts. Risk and threat management are fundamental to maintaining the security of our services across every aspect of our business. We separate cyber security risk into three main areas of risk:\n\n- **External**: Attackers and criminals targeting our systems, networks, or people to conduct malicious attacks;\n- **Insider**: Accidental leakage of information or malicious misuse of access privileges by our employees; and\n- **Supply chain**: A supplier is breached or used as a conduit to gain access to our systems, data or people.\n\nTo help us identify and manage emerging and evolving risks, we constantly evaluate and challenge our business strategy, new technologies, government policies and regulation, and cyber threats. We conduct regular reviews of the most significant security risks affecting our business and develop strategies to detect, prevent and respond to them. Our cyber security approach focuses on minimising the risk of cyber incidents that affect our networks and services.\nResponsible business (continued)\n\nUnderstanding the threat landscape is key to managing cyber risk. Over the course of the year, two of the biggest cyber security threats faced by all organisations significantly increased \u2013 phishing and ransomware attacks. Cyber criminals exploited the emotion and uncertainty associated with the pandemic to deceive users into engaging with malicious emails or pay a sum of money to regain access to systems. Cyber criminals also increasingly targeted smaller suppliers to large organisations as a way to more easily compromise their targets. Organisations across all industries also continued to experience other forms of threats, such as sophisticated espionage attempts and the exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities.\n\nControls\n\nControls can prevent, detect or respond to risks. Most risks and threats are prevented from occurring and most will be detected before they cause harm and need a response. A small minority will need recovery actions.\n\nWe use a common global framework called the Cyber Security Baseline and it is mandatory across the entire Group. The baseline includes key security controls which significantly reduce cyber security risk, by preventing, detecting or responding to events and attacks. Our framework was initially developed based on an international standard mapped to our key risks in the way that provides the most comprehensive protection. Each year, we review the framework in the light of changing threats and create new or enhanced controls to counter these threats.\n\nA dedicated assurance team reviews and validates the effectiveness of our security controls, and our control environment is subject to regular internal audit. The security of our global networks is also independently tested every year to assure we are maintaining the highest standards and our controls are operating effectively. We maintain independently audited information security certifications, including ISO 27001, which cover our controls are operating effectively. We maintain independently audited information security certifications, including ISO 27001, which cover our global technology function and 15 local markets. We also comply with local requirements or certifications and actively contribute to our global technology function and 15 local markets. We also comply with local requirements or certifications and actively contribute to our global technology function and 15 local markets.\n\nWe also track and monitor potential future threats to our networks, systems and customers, such as quantum computing and its effect on encryption. While such a risk is not specific to Vodafone, we have started work to address the potential negative effects and maintain a robust level of encryption that is quantum safe within our network and systems.\n\nOperating model\n\nWe have implemented an operating model based on the leading industry security standards published by the US Department of Commerce, specifically the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We have an international team of over 800 employees who are focused on constantly monitoring, protecting and defending our systems and our customers\u2019 data. We also work with third-party experts and consultants, to maintain specialist skills and continue to follow leading practice. Our scale means we benefit from global collaboration, technology sharing, deep expertise and ultimately have greater visibility of emerging threats. Although the Cyber team leads on detect, respond and recover, preventative and protective controls are embedded across all of our technology and throughout the entire business.\n\nNew technologies\n\nWe adopt new technologies to better serve our customers and gain operational efficiency. For every technology programme, new or existing, we follow our Security by Design process, evaluating suppliers\u2019 hardware and software, modeling threats and understanding the risks before designing and implementing the necessary security controls and testing them.\n\nEvery new mobile network generation has brought increased performance and capability, along with new opportunities in security. 5G improves existing security, with additional protection against threats such as location tracking, call or message interception and modification of network traffic. Similarly, 5G includes enhanced features to protect signalling between different operators\u2019 networks, which helps prevent tracking or interception while roaming. Vodafone is working at pace to embed these new security features into our 5G network deployments.\n\nGetting the right security by design across all operators is vital as 5G and other mobile technologies will connect billions of devices. Vodafone has helped establish the GSMA IoT Security Guidelines, and the accompanying self-assessment scheme. Where we work with partners or third parties to build and deploy IoT solutions, we also advocate the approach co-developed between Vodafone and Consumers International, as seen in their publication of the Consumer IoT Trust by Design Guidelines.\n\nEvery employee has responsibility for cyber security and must follow the Vodafone Cyber Code; be sensitive to threats and report suspicious activity. Embedded in our Code of Conduct, the Cyber Code is the cornerstone of how we expect all employees to behave when it comes to best practice in cyber security. It consists of seven areas where employees need to follow security good practice. Our cyber security awareness programme is delivered digitally via our internal social media platform, videos and webinars. In addition, we perform regular phishing simulations to raise awareness and train employees. In the last year we sent 161,000 simulated phishing emails across 23 markets and Group functions, and employee reporting improved during 2020.\n\nWe have also performed incident simulations for the senior management team in all markets and the main Group functions. These simulations allowed the CEOs and their teams to experience what a real incident is like and exercise their responsibilities, as well as identifying areas for improvement in internal processes.\n\nClick to read more about Vodafone\u2019s Cyber Code in our Code of Conduct: vodafone.com/code-of-conduct\nProtecting people\n\nWherever we operate, we have an opportunity to contribute to the advancement of fundamental rights for our customers, colleagues and communities. We are also conscious of the risks associated with our operations and we work hard to mitigate negative impacts, ensuring we keep people safe.\n\nHealth and safety\n\nKeeping our people safe is one of the most important responsibilities we hold as an employer. Our ongoing focus is to create a safe working environment for everyone working for and on behalf of Vodafone and the communities in which we operate. We want everyone working with Vodafone to return home safely every day.\n\nOur health and safety framework provides a consistent approach to safety leadership, planning, performance monitoring, governance and assurance. Our commitment to safety does not differentiate between employees, contractors and suppliers, all of whom benefit from the same focus on preventing harm, both on worksites and when working or moving between sites.\n\nHealth and safety risks\n\nWe focus our initiatives on our top health and safety risks, which continue to account for the majority of reported incidents and remain a focus area globally: occupational road risk; falls from height; working with electricity; and fibre operations.\n\nRoad traffic incidents continue to be the primary cause of major injuries and fatalities reported globally, accounting for 60% of all reported incidents within Vodafone. As a result, we have included a specific requirement to focus on road safety and driver behaviour within our health and safety strategy and annual objectives. In addition, local market road risk controls are reviewed as part of our internal assurance plans.\n\nIn recognition of our top risks, we have established the \u2018Vodafone Absolute Rules\u2019. These rules focus on risks that present the greatest potential for harm for anyone working for or on behalf of Vodafone. The Absolute Rules are clear and underpinned by a zero-tolerance approach to unsafe behaviours in all of our businesses. The Absolute Rules must be followed by all Vodafone employees and contractors, as well as our suppliers\u2019 employees and contractors. In the most recent Spirit Beat survey, 96% of employees agreed that the Absolute Rules are taken seriously at Vodafone.\n\nLeadership engagement\n\nThe importance of senior leadership and commitment to health and safety remains key to our approach. Our senior leaders are actively engaged, carrying out regular site tours throughout the year. Despite the restrictions imposed by COVID-19, our senior leaders have continued to carry out tours virtually, recognising the importance of connecting with teams and critical workers as they continued to maintain our networks, work in our retail stores and on customer sites.\n\nHealth and safety governance\n\nHealth and safety is managed through a global safety framework, which includes the monitoring and assessing of risks, setting targets, reviewing progress and reporting performance. Our health and safety management system is based on international standards for occupational health and safety, is aligned to internationally recognised best practice, and always meets local requirements at a minimum. In addition, some of our local markets have chosen to undergo certification to OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001, the international standard for occupational health and safety. Our operations in Albania, Egypt, Greece, Ireland, Italy and the UK are either certified to OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001.\nAll incidents relating to our top risks and breaches of our Vodafone Absolute Rules are reported and investigated in adherence with timescales contained within our Incident Reporting Standard. We ensure that incidents are investigated thoroughly and appropriate remedial actions and improvements are identified and implemented. We strongly believe in the importance of prevention, however we also believe that incidents should be treated as an opportunity for learning.\n\nHealth and safety is a high-risk policy and included within our risk and compliance governance programme. Due to restrictions introduced as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, in-country audits have not been possible this year. However, we have updated our risk control matrix to help enhance the effectiveness of our assurance programme, ensuring a single set of standards and mandatory controls which local markets self-assess against.\n\n**Training**\n\nThis year we introduced our updated health and safety module as part of our mandatory \u2018Doing What\u2019s Right\u2019 training. The training module includes a video from our Group Chief Human Resources Officer demonstrating senior-level support for our Vodafone Absolute Rules. Every employee must complete the training within six weeks of joining and then typically every two years. During 2021, 47,732 employees working for Vodafone completed the health and safety module. Contractors are required to complete separate training relevant to their role and position.\n\nFurthermore, each local market is responsible for delivering health and safety training which supports the development of appropriate safety leadership skills, behaviours and identification of health and safety risks. Additional training is specific to an individual\u2019s role and aligned to each market\u2019s local safety legislation.\n\n**Key performance indicators**\n\nWe have a global set of key performance indicators as part of our safety framework, which are reported monthly to our Executive Committee, and bi-annually to our Board:\n\n- Number of fatalities;\n- Number of employee lost time incidents; and\n- Number of top safety risks, including breaches of our Absolute Rules.\n\nAfter a thorough investigation, we record all fatal incidents related to our operations where we conclude that our controls were not operating as effectively as required and may have prevented the incident from occurring. We also consider circumstances where if our controls could have reasonably been enhanced, the outcome could have been different. Each fatality is presented for review, chaired by the Group Chief Human Resources Officer. We also share any lessons learned from each fatality across the relevant Group functions.\n\nAny injury is one too many and any loss of life related to our operations is unacceptable. It is therefore with great regret that there was sadly one recordable fatality during the year\u2014a road traffic incident involving a member of the public in Mozambique. A thorough investigation was overseen by the respective local market Chief Executive, who is responsible for ensuring that the causes of the incident are widely understood and that any necessary corrective actions are implemented. This incident further reinforces our ongoing focus to reduce the number of road risk related incidents, with a focus on our road safety initiatives and awareness campaigns within our local communities.\n\nWe track and investigate incidents relating to our top risks and breaches of our Vodafone Absolute Rules. During the year, 621 breaches of our Vodafone Absolute Rules and 1,211 incidents relating to our top risks were recorded. Each incident is investigated and we seek to identify the root cause and ensure suitable corrective action is taken where necessary. An investigation into each incident is conducted at a scale proportionate to the indicative level of risk.\n\nLost-time incidents (LTI) is the term we use when an employee is injured while carrying out a work-related task and is consequently unable to perform his or her regular duties for a complete shift or period of time after the incident. Of the seven incidents, five were attributed to slips, trips or falls in and around the workplace and two were vehicle-related.\n\n**Key Performance Indicators**\n\n| Work-related injuries or ill health (excluding fatalities) | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Employees                                                 | 7    | 33   |\n| Suppliers\u2019 employees/contractors                          | 24   | 21   |\n| Lost-time incidents (LTI)                                 |      |      |\n| Number of lost-time employee incidents                    | 7    | 33   |\n| Lost-time incident rate per 1,000 employees               | 0.06 | 0.35 |\n| Total recordable fatalities                               |      |      |\n| Employees                                                 | 0    | 0    |\n| Suppliers\u2019 employees/contractors                          | 0    | 1    |\n| Members of the public                                     | 1    | 2    |\n\n**COVID-19**\n\nOur response to the COVID-19 pandemic has prioritised the safety and wellbeing of our people from the outset. This includes a variety of initiatives deployed across markets, tightly coordinated by the COVID-19 Business Continuity Plan programme management team, chaired by the Chief Human Resources Officer.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we have closely observed World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and control measures, which complement our internal COVID-19 plans, instructions and communications. WHO controls and guidance were implemented as a minimum across all our markets.\n\nA limited number of positive COVID-19 cases amongst employees were reported during the year. All positive cases are reviewed to identify any themes, such as locations or functions requiring additional focus to ensure controls are adequate, or if they require strengthening.\n\nThe majority of our employees (95%) continued to work effectively and safely from home during the year and we continue to monitor the situation. Local requirements and rules differ across our markets and in some countries, there are regional variations. This adds to the complexity as markets review control measures and plans that enable the safe return of employees, contractors and suppliers back to their workplaces.\n\nAs we continue to manage through the pandemic, we have committed to the following to support our employees:\n\n- All our employees will have access to physical, mental health and wellbeing support.\n- We will continue to be flexible with our policies as required by local conditions while exploring other policies that we could adjust/implement to support employees.\n- Digital learning will be available to all our employees and their families.\n- Local plans will ensure all our employees have a safe place to work, whether they are working on site or at home. We will enable employees to access our offices whenever possible, if that is required to better protect their personal safety. As we maintain our guidance for employees with underlying health conditions, we will ensure they are able to engage and connect with their teams productively.\n\nWe will continue to listen to our employees and ensure they are consulted as part of any plans to return to the workplace. We remain confident that our current controls remain appropriate to look after the health, safety and wellbeing of our people and suppliers who work on our sites, however will continue to assess and monitor the risks and follow local market health authority requirements as a minimum.\nMobiles, masts and health\nThe health and safety of our people, customers and the wider public is a priority for Vodafone. We always operate our mobile networks strictly within national regulations, which are typically based on, or go beyond, international guidelines set by the independent scientific body, the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).\n\nIn March 2020, the ICNIRP confirmed that there are no adverse effects on human health from mobile networks, including from 5G frequencies if exposure is within their guidelines. This followed an extensive review of scientific studies published during the last 20 years.\n\nAs well as complying with national regulations, where Vodafone markets have rolled out 5G we have implemented a \u201cSmart PowerLock\u201d (SPL) feature. This innovative technology, designed for use with adaptive antennas used for 5G, ensures that the transmitted radio frequency power of the antenna is always below a threshold when averaged over a predefined time window. This guarantees compliance with electromagnetic field (EMF) regulations under all possible operating conditions for 5G sites. Currently, all our markets that have rolled out 5G have activated the feature in some or all radio sites. During the last year, we have demonstrated the feature to regulators, to evidence compliance with EMF regulations. The feature has been accepted as effective, even in those markets (such as Italy) where EMF regulations are stricter than international science-based guidelines.\n\nCOVID-19\nAt the start of the COVID-19 crisis, it was regrettable that unproven, unsubstantiated theories circulating primarily on social media incited individuals to damage masts and base stations in a number of countries. The levels of misinformation alleging links between COVID-19 and 5G has reduced considerably in Europe over the past year. This is due to improved government public health communications; effective policing from both law enforcement and regulators; improved public education; and social media platforms taking action. We have supported all these actions, both at a global level and in markets where the misinformation has encouraged criminal action.\n\nVodafone markets have used a common strategy to rebut the misinformation and condemn arson attacks on our base stations. The most recent wave of misinformation and criminal damage was in South Africa, in January 2021. By reacting swiftly in partnership with other operators, and providing clear messages that there is no scientific evidence to link the spread of COVID-19 to 5G, we limited further damage.\n\nScience monitoring\nThere has been scientific research on mobile frequencies for decades. Scientific reviews have made a vital contribution to establishing industry guidelines and standards. We follow the results of these independent reviews to understand developments in scientific research related to mobile devices, base stations and health. We consider the opinions of panels commissioned by recognised national or international health agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission\u2019s Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).\n\nOperating model\nWe have robust governance mechanisms in place and conduct regular compliance assessments to ensure that our masts and devices meet the standards set by the Group policy and national regulations. We also conduct network measurements and calculations of EMF exposure from the network masts, and review the test reports we receive on EMF testing on devices. With travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 crisis, we have found new and innovative ways to carry out remote checks on labs that carry out EMF tests on devices. With the use of cameras and one on-site resource, we have successfully checked four labs in China remotely and audited one European lab in person as normal.\n\nHuman rights\nWe want to make sure that we have a positive impact on people and society and bring human rights into everything we do. As a global telecommunications provider, we acknowledge that we can be faced with human rights challenges.\n\nClick to read our Human Rights Policy Statement\nvodafone.com/human-rights-policy-statement\n\nHuman rights risks\nAs a telecommunications operator, our most significant human rights risks relate to our customers\u2019 rights to privacy and freedom of expression. This is because governments in the countries where we operate have the legal right, under certain circumstances, to impose limits on their citizens\u2019 ability to access and use digital networks and services, or to request lawful interception of citizens\u2019 communications. Governments exercise this right through operators\u2019 licence requirements. These requirements can vary significantly from country to country.\n\nOur Freedom of Expression principles, Privacy Management Policy and Law Enforcement Assistance Policy set out our approach to managing these risks.\n\nClick to read more about how we handle Law Enforcement Demands:\nvodafone.com/handling-law-enforcement-demands\n\nOur approach\nWe conduct due diligence to help make sure that we respect human rights. This year, we assessed our approach to children\u2019s rights by piloting UNICEF\u2019s draft revised Mobile Operators Children\u2019s Rights Impact Assessment tool. We found areas of good practice, such as the wide range of programmes that use technology to support the realisation of children\u2019s rights. But there is still more to do to make sure our internal policies consistently reflect our commitment to children.\n\nWe also commissioned external expert guidance on heightened due diligence needed when operating in higher-risk countries such as those affected by conflict. For example, risks to free expression can be particularly pronounced in countries which are politically unstable or going through a time of transition such as an election.\n\nGovernance\nThe Group\u2019s External Affairs Director oversees Vodafone\u2019s human rights programme and is a member of the Executive Committee. A senior human rights manager manages our programme, with the support of a cross-functional internal Human Rights Advisory Group, comprising senior managers responsible for; privacy, security, responsible sourcing, and diversity and inclusion, amongst others. We report regularly on our progress to the Reputation and Policy Steering Committee.\n\nCollaboration\nGlobal business\u2019 understanding of human rights impacts continues to mature. We play our part in the debate by collaborating and learning from others to improve our approach: we are an active member of the Global Network Initiative, alongside other initiatives such as the United Nations B-Tech Project which convenes business, civil society and government to advance implementation of the UN Guiding Principles in the tech sector.\nResponsible business (continued)\n\nResponsible supply chain\nWe spend approximately \u20ac24 billion a year with around 10,500 direct suppliers around the world to meet our businesses\u2019 and customers\u2019 needs. The majority of our external spend is with suppliers that provide us with network infrastructure, IT and related services, fixed lines, mobile masts and data centres that run our networks.\n\nSupply chain risks\nThe main areas of risk in our supply chain relate to three key areas: health and safety matters related to non-compliant fire safety measures; excessive working hours due to needing better demand management; and environmental matters related to non-compliant chemical storage and lack of carbon reduction programmes. This year they made up 74% of all non-compliances found in our supply chain through our assessments. Suppliers that do not meet our standards are provided with a corrective action plan to address any areas for improvement and are required to submit evidence that this has been completed.\n\nPolicy\nEvery supplier that works for Vodafone is required to comply with our Code of Ethical Purchasing. These commitments extend down through the supply chain so that a supplier with which we have a direct contractual relationship (Tier 1 supplier) in turn is required to ensure compliance across its own direct supply chain (Tier 2 supplier from Vodafone\u2019s perspective) and beyond. The Code of Ethical Purchasing is based on international standards including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization\u2019s Fundamental Conventions on Labour Standards. It stipulates the social, ethical, and environmental standards that we expect, including areas such as child and forced labour, health and safety, working hours, discrimination and disciplinary processes.\n\nOur approach\nWhen new suppliers tender for work, they are asked to demonstrate policies and procedures that support safe working, diversity in the workplace and to address carbon reduction, renewable energy, plastic reduction, circular economy and product life-cycle which account for up to 20% of the overall evaluation criteria. Suppliers are assessed on their commitment and performance towards diversity & inclusion (5%), the environment (5%) and health & safety (10%) in categories where there is a safety risk.\n\nOur requirements are backed up by risk assessments, audits and operational improvement processes, which are included in suppliers\u2019 contractual commitments. Some site audits are conducted under the Joint Audit Cooperation (\u2018JAC\u2019) initiative, an association of telecommunications operators established to improve ethical, labour and environmental standards in the ICT supply chain, which Vodafone chairs. This year, 76 site assessments were conducted (either by Vodafone or through JAC).\n\nVodafone has continued to promote Trust Your Supplier (TYS). This is a cross-industry initiative that utilises block chain and external verifiers to evaluate supplier compliance against a number of risk areas. This increases the accuracy of vetting compliance for our supply base and also means suppliers only need to go through the process once. We have a target to on-board over 50% of suppliers by total spend onto the TYS solution by the end of FY22. We currently have 7% of suppliers by total spend on-boarded, with a further 25% already having confirmed they will on-board over the next year.\n\nWe report on our approach to preventing modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chain in our annual Modern Slavery Statement.\n\nGovernance\nThe Group Chief Financial Officer oversees our supply chain and is a member of the Executive Committee and Board. Reporting to the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officer of the Vodafone Procurement Company is responsible for the implementation of our Code of Ethical Purchasing. Progress is reported regularly to the Vodafone Procurement Company Board meeting. Procurement is a highly centralised function within the business and approximately three quarters of our external spend is managed by VPC. This enables us to maintain a consistent approach to supplier management and makes it easier to monitor and improve supplier performance across our markets.\n\nBusiness integrity\nWe are committed to ensuring that our business operates ethically, lawfully and with integrity wherever we operate as this is critical to our long-term success.\n\nTax and economic contribution\nAs a major investor, taxpayer and employer, we make a significant contribution to the economies of all the countries in which we operate. In addition to direct and indirect taxation, our financial contributions to governments also include other areas such as radio spectrum fees and auction proceeds.\n\nTax transparency\nOur most recent tax report sets out our total contribution to public finances on a cash-paid basis for both 2019 and 2020. In 2020, we contributed \u2013 directly and indirectly \u2013 more than \u20ac12.4 billion to public finances worldwide, compared with \u20ac12.7 billion in 2019. The year-on-year decrease was due to lower direct taxes outside of Europe and currency devaluations in some of our markets. In 2020, we paid nearly \u20ac2.6 billion in direct taxes, including more than \u20ac1.0 billion in corporate income taxes, nearly \u20ac2.3 billion via non-taxation based revenue mechanisms, such as payments for the right to use spectrum, and collected \u20ac7.5 billion of indirect taxes for governments around the world.\n\nActing with integrity in the creation and execution of our tax strategy, policies and practices is absolutely core to our approach to tax, as is our commitment to transparency. We disclose our financial contributions to governments at a country level, as we believe this is an important way to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve an effective balance between a company\u2019s responsibilities to society as a whole, through the payment of taxes (and other government revenue-raising mechanisms), and its obligations to its shareholders. The information we share aims to help our stakeholders understand our approach, policies and principles.\n\nWe also share our views on key topics of relevance, including the latest on the taxation of the digital economy, as well as publishing our OECD country-by-country disclosure, as submitted to the UK\u2019s tax authority (HMRC).\n\nOur tax report for 2021 will be published in the next year following the submission of our tax returns and payment of all applicable taxes.\n\nClick to read more about tax and our total economic contribution to public finances: vodafone.com/tax\nAnti-bribery and corruption\nAt Vodafone, we support and foster a culture of zero tolerance towards bribery or corruption in all our activities.\n\nOur anti-bribery policy\nOur policy on this issue is summarised in our Code of Conduct and states that employees or others working on our behalf must never offer or accept any kind of bribe.\n\nOur anti-bribery policy is consistent with the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and provides guidance about what constitutes a bribe and prohibits giving or receiving any excessive or improper gifts and hospitality. Any policy breaches can lead to dismissal or termination of contract.\n\nFacilitation payments are strictly prohibited and our employees are provided with practical training and guidance on how to respond to demands for facilitation payments. The only exception is when an employee\u2019s personal safety is at risk. In such circumstances, when a payment under duress is made, the incident must be reported as soon as possible afterwards.\n\nOne of the ways to help the fight against COVID-19 is through charitable donations and contributions, either monetary or in kind. We have issued guidance to all markets and Foundations to assist them in their assessment of different initiatives, to ensure donations are given in line with our policies.\n\nTo support our approach, Vodafone is also a member of Transparency International UK\u2019s Business Integrity Forum.\n\nGovernance and risk assessment\nOur Chief Executive and Executive Committee oversee our efforts to prevent bribery. They are supported by local market chief executives, who are responsible for ensuring that our anti-bribery programme is implemented effectively in their local market. They in turn are supported by local specialists and by a dedicated Group team that is solely focused on anti-bribery policy and compliance. The Risk and Compliance Committee assists the Executive Committee in fulfilling duties with regards to risk management and policy compliance.\n\nAs part of our anti-bribery programme, every Vodafone business must adhere to minimum global standards, which include:\n\n- ensuring there is a due diligence process for suppliers and business partners at the start of the business relationship;\n- completion of the global e-learning training for all employees, as well as tailored training for higher risk teams; and\n- using Vodafone\u2019s global online gift and hospitality registration platform, as well as ensuring there is a process for approving local sponsorships and charitable contributions.\n\nEngaging employees to raise awareness of bribery risk\nWe run a multi-channel high profile global communications programme, Doing What\u2019s Right, to engage with employees and raise awareness and understanding of the policy. The Doing What\u2019s Right programme also features e-learning training, which includes a specific anti-bribery module. The next module, DWR 3.0, will be launched in 2021 and is a video-based module requiring employees to identify risks they see playing out in the conversations on screen. This will be an engaging and interesting way to raise awareness of bribery risks in the everyday activities of employees.\n\nThe bribery risks we face are constantly evolving. The table below summarises the principal risk categories and the mitigation measures adopted.\n\n| Risk | Response |\n|------|----------|\n| Operating in high-risk markets | We undertake biennial risk assessments in each of our local operating companies and at Group level, so we can understand and limit our exposure to risk. |\n| Business acquisition and integration | Anti-bribery pre and post due diligence is carried out on a target company. Red flags identified during the due diligence process are reviewed and assessed. Following acquisition, we implement our anti-bribery programme. |\n| Spectrum licensing | To reduce the risk of attempted bribery, a specialist spectrum policy team oversees our participation in all negotiations and auctions. We provide appropriate training and guidance for employees who interact with government officials on spectrum matters. |\n| Building and upgrading networks | Our anti-bribery policy makes it clear that we never offer any form of inducement to secure a permit, lease or access to a site. We regularly remind all employees and contractors in network roles of this prohibition, through tailored training sessions and communications. |\n| Working with third parties | Suppliers and other relevant third parties working for or on behalf of Vodafone must comply with the principles set out in our Code of Conduct and Code of Ethical Purchasing, as well as have programmes in place to ensure suppliers\u2019 employees and contractors are aware of these policies. Third-party due diligence is completed at the start of our business relationship with suppliers, other third parties and partners. Through their contracts with us, our suppliers, partners and other third parties make a commitment to implement and maintain proportionate and effective anti-bribery compliance measures. We regularly remind current suppliers of our policy requirements and complete detailed compliance assessments across a sample of higher-risk and higher-value suppliers. Select high-risk third parties are trained to ensure awareness of our zero-tolerance policy. |\n| Winning and retaining business | We provide targeted training for our Vodafone Business and Partner Markets sales teams. In addition, we also maintain and monitor a global register of gifts and hospitality to ensure that inappropriate offers are not accepted or extended by our employees. |\n\nAssurance\nImplementation of the anti-bribery policy is monitored regularly in all local markets as part of the annual Group assurance process, which reviews key anti-bribery controls. The assurance programme was modified during the last financial year due to travel restrictions and instead of local market visits, guided self-assessments were undertaken in Albania, Turkey, South Africa, Mozambique and the DRC. There were no emerging or consistent themes from the reviews undertaken and all identified areas for improvement have action plans to improve the control environment and anti-bribery programme. As we adjust our way of conducting assurance to the new environment, the assurance plan for the coming year will include thematic reviews across the key areas of high risk sales intermediaries and representatives and training to high risk employees. Internal Audit will also undertake a programme of audits covering the anti-bribery programme in a number of local markets in Vodafone and Vodacom.\nNon-financial information\n\nNon-financial information statement\nThe table below outlines where the key content requirements of the non-financial information statement can be found within this document (as required by sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006).\n\nVodafone\u2019s sustainable business reporting also follows other international reporting frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative, the SASB Standards, CDP and GHG Reporting Protocol.\n\nClick to download our ESG Addendum: investors.vodafone.com/esgaddendum\n\nClick to read our SASB disclosures: investors.vodafone.com/sasb\n\n| Reporting requirement                  | Vodafone policies and approach | Section within Annual Report | Page(s) |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|\n| Environmental matters                  | Planet performance            | Planet                      | 38-40   |\n|                                        | Climate change risk           | Risk management             | 53-61   |\n| Employees                              | Code of Conduct               | Responsible business and anti-bribery and corruption | 43,51   |\n|                                        | Occupational health and safety| Health and safety           | 47-48   |\n|                                        | Diversity and inclusion       | Workplace equality          | 36-37   |\n| Social and community matters           | Driving positive societal transformation performance | Inclusion for All | 34-37   |\n|                                        | Stakeholder engagement        | Stakeholder engagement      | 12-13   |\n|                                        | Mobiles, masts and health     | Mobiles, masts and health   | 49      |\n| Human rights                           | Human rights approach         | Human rights                | 49      |\n|                                        | Code of Ethical Purchasing    | Responsible supply chain    | 50      |\n|                                        | Modern Slavery Statement      | Responsible supply chain    | 50      |\n| Anti-bribery and corruption            | Code of Conduct               | Responsible business        | 43      |\n|                                        | Anti-bribery policy           | Anti-bribery and corruption | 51      |\n|                                        | Speak Up process              | Responsible business        | 43      |\n| Policy embedding, due diligence and outcomes | Purpose, sustainability and responsible business | 32-51   |\n|                                        | Risk management               | Risk management             | 53-61   |\n| Description of principal risks and impact of business activity | Risk management | 53-61   |\n| Description of business model          | Business model                | 16                          |\n| Non-financial key performance indicators | Financial and non-financial performance | 4-5      |\n|                                        | Purpose, sustainability and responsible business | 32-51   |\n\nUK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (\u2018SECR\u2019)\nIn accordance with SECR requirements, this provides a summary of GHG emissions and energy data for Vodafone UK, in comparison with global performance.\n\n| Reporting requirement                  | Global (excluding Vodafone UK) | Vodafone UK |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions (m tonnes CO\u2082e)  | 0.25                           | 0.02        |\n| Scope 2 market-based GHG emissions (m tonnes CO\u2082e) | 1.06                           | 0.04        |\n| Scope 2 location-based GHG emissions (m tonnes CO\u2082e) | 1.89                           | 0.14        |\n| GHG emissions per petabyte (PB) of mobile data carried (tonnes of CO\u2082e) | 122                            | 59          |\n| Total energy consumption (GWh)         | 5,131                          | 701         |\nManaging uncertainty in our business\n\nManaging risks and uncertainty is an integral part of successfully delivering on our strategic objectives. We have embedded a global risk management framework which aims to ensure consistency and the right level of oversight is provided across both Group entities and our local markets.\n\nIdentifying our risks\nAll local markets and Group entities identify and assess risks which could affect the local strategy and operations. A consolidated list of these risks is then presented to a selection of Group senior leaders and executives, alongside the outputs from an external environment scan and specialised risk focus groups. Applying a Group-wide perspective, these executives evaluate and determine our top risks and which emerging risks warrant further exploration. The proposed principal risks, emerging risks and risk watchlist are defined and agreed by our Executive Committee (ExCo) before being submitted to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board for the final challenge and approval.\n\nManaging our risks\nDuring the risk evaluation phase, we assign each of our risks to a category (strategic, technological, operational or financial \u2013 see next page) and identify the source of the threat (internal or external). This approach enables a better understanding of how we should treat the risk and ensure the right level of oversight and assurance is provided. The assigned executive risk owners are accountable for confirming adequate controls are in place and that the necessary treatment plans are implemented to bring the risk within an acceptable tolerance. We continue to monitor the status of risk treatment strategies across the year and hold in-depth reviews of our risks.\n\nFor each of the principal risks, we also develop severe but plausible scenarios which provide additional insights into possible threats and enable a better risk treatment strategy. Scenarios are also used for the purpose of assessing our viability.\n\nRead more about our viability statement on page 61\n\nThe diagram below shows a simplified, high-level governance structure for risk management.\nRisk management (continued)\n\n**Risk categorisation and interdependencies**\n\nWe continue to consider risks both individually and collectively in order to fully understand our risk landscape. By analysing the correlation between risks, we can identify those that have the potential to impact or increase other risks and therefore are weighted appropriately. This exercise informs our scenario analysis, particularly the combined scenario used in the Long-Term Viability Statement.\n\nRead more about our viability statement on page 61\n\n**Strategic**\nThe influence of stakeholders and industry players on our business and our response to them:\n\n- A Geo-political risk in the supply chain\n- B Adverse political and regulatory measures\n- C Market disruption\n- D Disintermediation and failure to innovate\n\n**Financial**\nOur financial status, standing and continued growth:\n\n- E Global economic disruption\n\n**Technological**\nThe network, IT systems and platforms that support our business and the data they hold:\n\n- F Cyber threat and information security\n- G Technology failures\n\n**Operational**\nThe ability to achieve our optimal business model:\n\n- H Strategic transformation\n- I Legal and regulatory compliance\n- J IT transformation\n\n---\n\n**Principal risks**\n\n**Cyber threat and information security**\n\n**Description**\nAn external cyber-attack, insider threat or supplier breach could cause service interruption or the loss of confidential data. Cyber threats could lead to major customer, financial, reputational and regulatory impacts.\n\n**Change in risk profile**\n\n**Risk owner** Group Technology Officer\n\n**Our strategy**\n\n**Mitigation activities**\nWe have a risk-based approach to managing cyber security. We actively identify risks and threats, design layers of control and implement controls across all parts of the Company. The approach balances controls that prevent the majority of attacks, detect events and respond quickly to reduce harm.\n\n**Target tolerance**\nSecurity underpins our company purpose to enable connectivity in society and maintain our customers\u2019 trust. A breach with material adverse customer, reputation, financial or regulatory impact is outside our risk tolerance. We will never be fully immune to cyber-attacks, however, layers of effective controls will reduce the likelihood and impact.\n\n**Scenario**\nEach year we model a severe but plausible scenario. These have included attacks on core infrastructure, a bulk data breach and loss of major customer facing systems. We perform regular cyber crisis simulations with senior management in our markets and Group functions using a tailored set of scenarios.\n\n**Emerging threats**\nCyber risk is constantly evolving in line with technological and geo-political developments. We anticipate threats will continue from existing sources, but also evolve in areas such as 5G, IoT, vendor software integrity, quantum computing and the use of AI and machine learning.\n\nRead more about cyber security on pages 45-47\n\n---\n\n**Risk profile change**\n\n- Increasing\n- Decreasing\n- Stable\n\n**Our strategy**\n\n**Customer commitments**\n\n- Best connectivity products & services\n- Leading innovation in digital services\n- Outstanding digital experiences\n\n**Enabling strategies**\n\n- Simplified & most efficient operator\n- Social contract shaping digital society\n- Leading gigabit networks\n### Geo-political risk in supply chain\n\n**Description**\nOur operation is dependent on a wide range of global suppliers. Disruption to our supply chain could mean that we are unable to execute our strategic plans, resulting in increased cost, reduced choice and network quality.\n\n**Mitigation activities**\nPartial mitigation can be achieved through close monitoring of the political situation around key suppliers, engagement with governments, experts and equipment vendors. This enables Vodafone to respond accordingly and to ensure compliance with the latest regulations, economic sanctions and trade rulings. Broader issues of international politics which strongly influence the level of risk are, and will remain, outside Vodafone\u2019s control.\n\n**Target tolerance**\nThe existence of a broader range of scale suppliers of key equipment. A multi-vendor strategy in place across our markets to mitigate against supply chain disruption.\n\n**Scenario**\nDisruption to our supply chain due to geo-political decisions affecting our ability to select or continue to use equipment from specific vendors or decisions that affect trade and supply chains.\n\n**Emerging threats**\nWe operate in a global environment where political landscape changes could influence our operations. The increasing political tension between the US and China shows no sign of easing and this presents a potentially significant risk to our supply chain and customer base.\n\n| Change in risk profile | Risk owner | Our strategy |\n|------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| Increasing             | Group External Affairs Director | ![Icon] |\n| Decreasing             | Group External Affairs Director | ![Icon] |\n| Stable                 | Group External Affairs Director | ![Icon] |\n\n### Adverse political and regulatory measures\n\n**Description**\nAdverse political and regulatory measures impacting our strategy could result in increased costs, create a competitive disadvantage or have negative impact on our return on capital employed.\n\n**Mitigation activities**\nWe actively address issues openly with policy makers and regulatory authorities to find mutually acceptable ways forward. As a last resort we uphold our rights through legal means.\n\n**Target tolerance**\nTo have strategies that are based on common objectives with political, policy and regulatory stakeholders to reduce the risk that our business could be undermined by unpredictable and disproportionate political and regulatory environments and interventions.\n\n**Scenario**\nExposure to additional liabilities by regulatory authorities or if tax laws were to adversely change in the markets in which we operate.\n\n**Emerging threats**\nRegulation is becoming geographically diverse with increases in protectionist behaviours and fragmented regulation. Additionally, governments could seek to recover the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic through tax increases.\n\n| Change in risk profile | Risk owner | Our strategy |\n|------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| Increasing             | Group External Affairs Director and Chief Financial Officer | ![Icon] |\n| Decreasing             | Group External Affairs Director and Chief Financial Officer | ![Icon] |\n| Stable                 | Group External Affairs Director and Chief Financial Officer | ![Icon] |\n\n### Strategic transformation\n\n**Description**\nFailure to execute our strategy as described on pages 18 to 20 including on organisational transformation and portfolio activity (such as integrations, mergers or separations) could result in loss of business value and additional cost.\n\n**Mitigation activities**\nWe have specialist teams executing and monitoring our organisational transformation and portfolio activities. We also have robust governance structures in place to protect the Group\u2019s interests.\n\n**Target tolerance**\nWe are executing our programmes effectively to maximise synergies/benefits realisation; optimising cost and increasing speed of delivery, while ensuring our core organisation and cultural values remains safeguarded throughout.\n\n**Scenario**\nThe inability to achieve the expected benefit through transformation activities whilst evolving to the new generation connectivity and digital services provider for Europe & Africa.\n\n**Emerging threats**\nThe increased pace of change in the organisation means we have to maintain the required culture and skillset to support our transformational initiatives. Externally, as customer behaviours and their preferences change, we might have to accelerate or adapt our transformation programmes.\n\n| Change in risk profile | Risk owner | Our strategy |\n|------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| Increasing             | Group Technology Officer and Group Chief Commercial Officer | ![Icon] |\n| Decreasing             | Group Technology Officer and Group Chief Commercial Officer | ![Icon] |\n| Stable                 | Group Technology Officer and Group Chief Commercial Officer | ![Icon] |\n\n### Risk profile change\n\n- Increasing\n- Decreasing\n- Stable\n\n### Our strategy\n\n- Best connectivity products & services\n- Leading innovation in digital services\n- Outstanding digital experiences\n\n### Enabling strategies\n\n- Simplified & most efficient operator\n- Social contract shaping digital society\n- Leading gigabit networks\nRisk management (continued)\n\nGlobal economic disruption\n\n**Description**\nA global economic crisis could result in reduced telco spend from businesses and consumers, as well as limit our access to financial markets and availability of liquidity, increasing our cost of capital and limiting debt financing options.\n\n**Mitigation activities**\nWe have a relatively resilient business model. Our offers are competitive in the markets in which we operate. We are supporting our business customers\u2019 efficiencies through our innovative products. We have a long average life of debt which minimises refinancing requirements, and the vast majority of our interest costs are fixed.\n\n**Target tolerance**\nConservative management of the balance sheet to avoid potential consequences of unstable economic conditions. Access to sufficient liquidity at favourable terms.\n\n**Scenario**\nA severe contraction in economic activity leads to lower cash flow generation for the Group and disruption in global financial markets impacts our ability to refinance debt obligations as they fall due.\n\n**Emerging threats**\nBecause this is an externally driven risk, the threat environment is continually changing. External factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic or a potential sovereign debt crisis could have future impacts on economic activity across our markets. The financial markets are currently experiencing high levels of volatility and sovereign debts levels have reached record levels. These could lead to a significant change in the availability and cost of financing.\n\nTechnology failures\n\n**Description**\nNetwork, system or platform outages resulting from internal or external events could lead to reduced customer satisfaction, reputational damage and/or regulatory penalties.\n\n**Mitigation activities**\nUnique recovery targets are set for critical assets to limit the impact of service outages. A global policy supports these targets with requisite controls to provide effective resilience.\n\n**Target tolerance**\nOur customer promise is based on reliable availability of our network; therefore, the recovery of key mobile, fixed, IT services and platforms must be fast and robust.\n\n**Scenario**\nWe have a low tolerance to network, IT or platform disruptions which cause significant impact to our customers.\n\n**Emerging threats**\nPotential impact of an increase in extreme weather events caused by climate change may increase the likelihood or frequency of technology failure. New assets inherited from acquired businesses may not be aligned to our target resilience level which may increase the likelihood of a technology failure.\n\nMarket disruption\n\n**Description**\nNew telecoms entering the market could lead to significant price competition and lower margins.\n\n**Mitigation activities**\nWe closely monitor the competitive environment in all markets and react appropriately to both consumer and business needs. We have launched \u2018second\u2019 brands in a number of markets to compete more effectively and efficiently in the value segment. Alongside our speed-tiered, unlimited data plans, we are now competing effectively across all segments of the markets in which we operate. Additionally, we evolve our offers and adopt agile commercial models to mitigate competitive risks using simple, targeted offers, smart pricing models and differentiated customer experience.\n\n**Target tolerance**\nOur tolerance focus is on the loss of market value or market share or margin resulting from competitor pricing or new market entrants.\n\n**Scenario**\nAggressive pricing, accelerated customer losses to MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) and disruptive new market entrants in key European markets result in greater customer churn and pricing pressures impacting our financial position.\n\n**Emerging threats**\nEmerging threats depend on individual market structures and the competitive landscape.\n\nRisk profile change\n\n- Increasing\n- Decreasing\n- Stable\n\nOur strategy\n\n**Customer commitments**\n- Best connectivity products & services\n- Leading innovation in digital services\n- Outstanding digital experiences\n\nEnabling strategies\n\n- Simplified & most efficient operator\n- Social contract shaping digital society\n- Leading gigabit networks\n### Disintermediation and failure to innovate\n\n**Description**\nFailure in product innovation or ineffective response to threats from emerging technology or disruptive business models could lead to a loss of customer relevance, market share and new/existing revenue streams.\n\n| Change in risk profile | Risk owner | Our strategy |\n|------------------------|------------|--------------|\n|                        | Group Chief Commercial Officer |              |\n\n**Mitigation activities**\nWe continually strive to introduce innovative propositions and services, which enable us to deepen customer engagement. We are focused on simplifying our product portfolio, improving our operating model and processes, and accelerating our digital transformation, in order to offer the best customer experience.\n\n**Target tolerance**\nOffer a superior customer experience and continually improve our offering through a wide range of innovative products and services. We also develop innovative new products and explore new growth areas to continue to meet our customers\u2019 needs.\n\n**Scenario**\nLarge technology players invest in products impacting our customer relationships, cannibalising existing revenues and limiting future growth opportunities in digital services in Vodafone Business.\n\n**Emerging threats**\nEmerging risks span both Consumer and Business segments. In the Consumer segment, growing choice of communication solutions could threatening our core, while streaming services could threatening our TV business. In the Business segment, large technology players could attempt to move up further along the telecommunication sectors value chain.\n\n### Legal and regulatory compliance\n\n**Description**\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could lead to a loss of trust, financial penalties and/or suspension of our licence to operate.\n\n| Change in risk profile | Risk owner | Our strategy |\n|------------------------|------------|--------------|\n|                        | Group General Counsel and Company Secretary |              |\n\n**Mitigation activities**\nWe have subject matter experts and a robust policy and control compliance framework.

These training and awareness programmes set out our ethical culture across the organisation and assist employees to understand their role in ensuring compliance.\n\n**Target tolerance**\nWe seek to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all our markets.\n\n**Scenario**\nBreaches of legal compliance could lead to reputational damage, investigation costs, fines and/or personal sanctions.\n\n**Emerging threats**\nChanges to our operating model could require us to adapt our compliance and risk processes. In addition, ongoing changes to workplace dynamics and demographics may challenge our control environment.\n\n*Read more about our Code of Conduct and Speak Up policy on page 43*\n\n### IT transformation\n\n**Description**\nFailure to design and execute IT transformation of our legacy estate could lead to business loss, customer dissatisfaction or reputational exposure.\n\n| Change in risk profile | Risk owner | Our strategy |\n|------------------------|------------|--------------|\n|                        | Group Technology Officer |              |\n\n**Mitigation activities**\nThrough the assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls, we identify the relevant risks for the IT programmes to determine whether they are being effectively mitigated. Where gaps are identified, recommendations for mitigation are raised and followed up to make sure programmes are effectively de-risked.\n\n**Target tolerance**\nDeliver IT transformation programmes with the correct mix of efficient systems, relevant skills and digital expertise in alignment with the original planned spend, timelines and business benefits.\n\n**Scenario**\nFailure to deliver business benefits causes cost escalation, budget overruns and increased customer dissatisfaction which could negatively impact our financial performance.\n\n**Emerging threats**\nLong implementation timelines of transformation programmes and rapidly changing market conditions pose a risk that programme original scope and objectives might not be valid to achieve the expected business benefits defined at the outset of the programme. Ongoing changes to the organisation strategy might also have an impact on transformation programmes which might need to adjust scope and objectives therefore increasing the risk of time and cost overruns.\nKey changes to our principal risks:\n\n- The Adverse political and regulatory measures risk has reduced, as we continue to build relationships with governments and key stakeholders through our social contract. However, against the backdrop of COVID-19, we continue to monitor for any changes in tax regulation.\n- The Technology failure risk has reduced as more of our markets achieve the set recovery targets.\n- The Global economic disruption risk has reduced due to telecommunications proving resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic. We anticipate a similar trend for FY22. However, the full effect of this risk could be delayed, and the risk might increase over a longer time horizon.\n- We have split the IT transformation risk from our Digital transformation risk.\n- We anticipate additional changes to risk exposure as we become a new generation connectivity and digital services provider for Europe & Africa. For this reason, we have expanded the Strategic transformation risk to include all portfolio related changes (integration, mergers, separations) including the transformation to our operating model.\n- We have renamed the Disintermediation risk to include failure to innovate to focus on our success to innovate as well as external disintermediation threats.\n\nWatchlist risk\n\nOur watchlist risk process enables us to monitor material risks to Vodafone Group which fall outside of our top 10 principal risks list. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nEMF (Electromagnetic Field)\n\nThis risk can be broken down into three areas:\n\n- failure to comply with national legislation or international guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) as it applies to EMF, or failure to meet policy requirements;\n- the risk arising from concerted campaigns or negative community sentiment towards location or installation of radio base stations, resulting in planning delays; and\n- changes in the radio technology we use or the body of credible scientific evidence which may impact either of the two risks above.\n\nWe have an established governance for EMF risk management (a Group leadership team that reports to the Board, and a network of EMF leaders across all markets). The EMF task group, which was set up in FY20 to focus on assessing and reporting on the impact of 5G on EMF, has merged with the Group leadership team. The Group leadership team continues to update the Executive Committee twice a year on the impact of EMF restrictions in those markets with limits that do not align with international, science-based guidelines, as well as coordinating engagement with policy makers relating to 5G and EMF and assessing the impact of social media campaigns on public concern.\n\nVodafone continues to advocate for national EMF regulations to be harmonised with international guidelines. The 2020 updated guidelines from ICNIRP confirmed that there are no adverse effects on human health from 5G frequencies if exposure is within their guidelines. Vodafone always operates its mobile networks strictly within national regulations, which are typically based on, or go beyond, ICNIRP\u2019s guidelines, and we regularly monitor our operations in each country to meet those regulations.\n\nBrexit\n\nThe EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which came into effect on 1 January 2021, provides greater clarity on the trading relationship between the UK and the EU. Vodafone\u2019s cross-functional steering committee established early in the Brexit process identified risks and produced a comprehensive mitigation plan. Since the signing of the agreement, any outstanding risks have been managed by operational teams. The impact of the agreement, and any legal challenges to elements of the agreement, continue to be monitored, with further mitigations put in place where necessary.\n\nEmerging risk\n\nWe face a number of uncertainties where an emerging risk may potentially impact us in the longer term. In some cases, there may be insufficient information to understand the likely scale, impact or velocity of the risk. We also might not be able to fully define a mitigation plan until we have a better understanding of the threat.\n\nWe continue to identify new emerging risk trends, using the input from analysis of the external environmental as well as internal participation from key stakeholders.\n\nUsing the identified emerging risks, we evaluate the impact and the effect it would have on our organisation (including the changes to our principal risks). The sub-set of our latest emerging risks are:\n\n- Additional regulations or investor pressure brought on by Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) requirements;\n- Depopulation of city centres;\n- Ageing population; and\n- Next-generation digitalisation.\n\nStrengthening our framework\n\nOver the course of the year, we have:\n\n- Continued to improve our process for the identification and assessment of emerging risks;\n- Further enhanced the process of collecting key risk indicators and monitoring early-warning signals in both the internal and external environment;\n- Continued to align with the TCFD recommendations for climate-related risks and opportunities; and\n- Defined a more dynamic approach to risk identification, assessment and escalation.\nTCFD disclosure\n\nWe recognise that climate change poses a number of physical (i.e. caused by the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events) and transition-related (i.e. economic, technology or regulatory challenges related to moving to a greener economy) risks and opportunities for our business. As part of our commitment to operate ethically and sustainably, we are dedicated to understanding climate-related risks and opportunities and embedding responses to these into our business strategy and operations. We are aligning internal processes with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The summarised progress is detailed in this section as we aim to be fully aligned by 2022.\n\nMore in-depth information on our work to date on climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as further plans as we continue the TCFD programme can be found in our first standalone TCFD report.\n\nClick to read our TCFD report: investors.vodafone.com/tcfd\n\nGovernance\n\nThe Group External Affairs Director, a member of the Group Executive Committee, is the executive-level sponsor for the Planet agenda as part of our purpose-led strategy (pages 38-40) and has overall accountability for the climate change action within the Group. This includes providing updates to the Board on the progress towards our climate-related goals. In addition, at the 2020 AGM shareholders approved the current Remuneration Policy which incorporates our environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities in the executive long-term incentive plan. For FY21, this measure included a specific greenhouse gas reduction ambition linked to our 2025 target of reducing our emissions by 50% from the FY17 baseline. More details can be found in the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report on pages 82-103. Further details on how TCFD is managed at Group and in key markets are available in our TCFD Report.\n\nStrategy\n\nThis year, we have made progress in understanding the current and potential climate-related impacts on our business, strategy, and financial planning.\n\nWe have adopted three scenarios in line with the Bank of England\u2019s reference climate scenarios as outlined in their consultation document released in December 2019. This year, we conducted the required assessments to quantify the business impacts of all material climate-related risks under each scenario and over different time horizons to better understand the financial impact on our business.\n\nTo continue our TCFD programme, we will use the outputs of the scenario analysis to assist us in either adjusting or introducing policies, as well as considering the available opportunities. We continue to review each material climate-related risk and opportunity and build mitigation strategies to improve the resilience across our infrastructure portfolio and our key markets.\n\nRisk management\n\nWe have continued to align the climate-related risk management process with the global risk management framework. The following data sources were used for this year\u2019s process:\n\n- Climate-change publications and data;\n- Relevant literature on the potential impacts of climate change on the ICT sector;\n- Guidance from TCFD on potential risks and opportunities; and\n- CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project\u00ae) data and disclosures from other companies in the ICT sector.\n\nWe evaluated the materiality of the identified risks and opportunities by assessing their likelihood and impact using our global risk management framework. This process helped us determine the relative significance of the climate-related risks in relation to other risks. We are currently working to further embed applicable climate-related risks, controls and monitoring metrics into our risk management framework using our emerging risks process.\n\nMetrics and targets\n\nWe use a wide variety of metrics to measure climate-related current and potential impact. We have been measuring and reporting on energy and carbon emissions since 2001. In addition, we have set a number of ambitious targets to manage climate-related risks and reduce our impact on the environment, such as reaching \u2018net zero\u2019 emissions across our full value chain by 2040 and purchasing 100% renewable electricity in Europe by July 2021, and all markets by 2025. We constantly review whether any additional metrics and key risk indicators can be identified to measure and manage climate-related risks, and track and act on the opportunities resulting from the impact of climate change.\n\nMaterial risks and opportunities\n\nPhysical risks:\n- Damage to infrastructure caused by increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including wildfires, flooding, storms\n- Damage to infrastructure caused by sea level rise\n- Interruption or reduction in the quality of our wireless services due to increased precipitation\n\nTransition risks:\n- Changing consumer preferences impacting our revenues and market share\n- Increasing energy consumption due to increased global temperatures\n- Changing cost of carbon impacting costs to meet Vodafone\u2019s net zero target\n- Increasing risk of litigation around climate action\n- Increase in carbon taxation\n- Changes in regulation over infrastructure efficiency\n\nOpportunities:\n- Change in market valuation as a result of changing investor expectations with regard to climate change and Vodafone\u2019s ESG performance\n- Change in the availability and cost of capital impacted by sustainability performance\n- Increasing consumer attractiveness and ability to meet net zero targets through increased energy efficiency of products and services\nRisk management (continued)\n\nCOVID-19\n\nThe vital role telecommunications companies play in society has become more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telecommunications services are critical in enabling people to work remotely, allowing businesses to remain operational, supporting emergency services and government responses, and providing access to online education. Through our infrastructure, we have kept people and societies connected.\n\nWe have closely monitored the evolution of COVID-19 as it has continued to impact different countries to varying degrees over time and adapted our risk profile as required. We continue to maintain close contact with local health authorities and government agencies in all of our geographies, so that we minimise the risk to Vodafone, our operations and employees.\n\nGovernance\n\nDuring the early stages of the pandemic, we initiated our response to this crisis by invoking the Group\u2019s crisis management process. This process enabled us to prepare a number of planning scenarios based on a range of assumptions and potential outcomes. A Crisis Steering Committee (\u2018Steerco\u2019) continues to meet with representatives from the Group and our local markets. The Steerco receives updates and feedback on measures implemented locally, collects best practice, and assesses the adequacy of the Vodafone response as we monitor changes in the virus patterns and the impact it has on our operations.\n\nImpact on our principal risks\n\nWe do not consider the COVID-19 pandemic as an individual risk but rather monitor how the pandemic amplifies our principal, emerging and operational risks see pages 54-58.\n\nUsing this approach, we are able to manage the \u2018domino effect\u2019 of different risk types while identifying both the negative and positive impacts on our operations. As shown on page 54, we assign each of our risks to a category (strategic, technological, operational and financial) which allows us to prioritise and provide the required assurance. The section below summarises the impact the pandemic had on the different risk categories.\n\nStrategic\n\nGiven the nature of the telecommunications industry and the important role communication services have played during the pandemic, external stakeholders have focused more on our sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have continued to build stronger relationships and partnerships through our social contract with our stakeholders, industry players and governments when managing strategic risks.\n\nWe continue to monitor external impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example we monitor potential adverse changes in regulations or further scrutiny by regulatory authorities which could lead to higher taxes as governments address the potential budget deficit following the pandemic.\n\nMore positively, we have seen an increase in consumers and business customers adopting more data services such as video conferencing and video on demand streaming.\n\nFinancial\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility in the financial markets. This can affect both our access to capital markets and the cost of debt. However, the telecommunications industry has not been as severely impacted. We anticipate a delayed impact as inflation rises due to an expected increase in spending, once countries begin to exit lock-downs. These inflation expectations can drive interest rates higher, which can make long-term borrowing more expensive.\n\nCommercially, the biggest impact was related to our roaming and visitor revenue, however, we expect this to recover as vaccinations programmes are successful and travel restrictions are lifted. We anticipate that as furlough and other government support schemes start to be withdrawn, there might be a decrease in our customers\u2019 spending power.\n\nTechnological\n\nWe have seen a significant increase in data usage during the pandemic and therefore, we have focused on our capacity management processes. Additionally, some of our local markets operate critical national infrastructure which was increasingly needed during the pandemic, and we made sure that we implemented mitigations to better support our infrastructure.\n\nWith travel restrictions implemented in most countries, we were not always able to perform physical site visits for business continuity or to test our EMF exposure and therefore ran either robust desktop exercises or used new innovative ways to remotely evaluate our sites.\n\nOperational\n\nWe prioritised the safety and wellbeing of our people, ensuring that we had the business continuity plans in place to operate while most of our people moved to working from home.\n\nAdditionally, to lessen the potential burden on our suppliers, we have implemented controls to assist them through our COVID-19 payment relief policy.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo be better prepared for future events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, we have updated our risk process. This approach, which runs parallel to our principal risk process, allows for a quicker identification of threats and risks. The process provides better visibility to our internal stakeholders and more oversight and governance across our risks. We continue to monitor the risks and threats arising from COVID-19 and similar events.\nLong Term Viability Statement\n\nThe preparation of the LTVS includes an assessment of the Group\u2019s long-term prospects in addition to an assessment of the ability to meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due over the three-year review period.\n\nAssessment of viability\n\nVodafone continues to adopt a three-year period to assess the Group\u2019s viability, a period in which we believe our principal risks tend to develop. This time horizon is also in line with the structure of long-term management incentives and the outputs from the long range business planning cycle.\n\nFor 2021, as a result of the increased pressures on the global financial markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted financial stress testing and sensitivity analysis, considering revenues at risk as well as the impact of our response plan to the crisis.\n\nThe assessment of the viability started with the available headroom as of 31 March 2021 and considered the plans and projections prepared as part of the forecasting cycle, which include the Group\u2019s cash flows, planned commitments, required funding and other key financial ratios. We also assumed that debt refinancing will remain available in all plausible market conditions.\n\nFinally, we estimated impact of severe but plausible scenarios for all of our principal and emerging risks on the three-year plan and, in addition, stress tested a combined scenario taking into account the risk interdependencies as defined on the diagram on page 54, where the following risks were modelled as materialising in parallel over the three-year period:\n\n- Cyber threat and information security: An external cyber-attack exploits vulnerabilities and leads to a GDPR fine.\n- Geo-political risk in supply chain: International and political decisions may affect our supply chain and restrict our ability to use critical suppliers.\n- Global economic disruption: A global economic crisis could result in reduced telco spend from businesses and consumers, as well as limit our access to financial markets and availability of liquidity.\n\nDisintermediation and failure to innovate: A continued and interrupted growth of technology giants and new entrants could impact our business revenue and overall financial performance.\n\nAssessment of long-term prospects\n\nEach year the Board conducts a strategy session, reviewing the internal and external environment as well as significant threats and opportunities to the sustainable creation of long-term shareholder value (note that known emerging threats related to each principal risk are described in pages 54-57).\n\nConclusions\n\nAs an input to the strategy discussion, the Board considers the principal risks that are longer term in nature, (including Adverse political and regulatory measures, Market disruption and Disintermediation and failure to innovate) with the focus on identifying underlying opportunities and setting the Group\u2019s future strategy. The output from this session is reflected in the strategic section of the Annual Report (pages 8-11), which provides a view of the Group\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nCash and cash equivalents available of \u20ac5.8bn as of 31 March 2021, along with options available to reduce cash outgoings over the period considered, provide the Group with sufficient positive headroom in all scenarios tested. Reverse stress testing on revenue and EBITDA over the review period confirmed that the Group has sufficient headroom available to face uncertainty. The Board deemed the stress test conducted to be adequate and therefore confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will remain in operation and be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due up to 31 March 2024.\nGovernance at a glance\n\nLeadership, governance and engagement\n\nOur Board\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee regularly reviews the Board\u2019s composition to ensure a diverse mix of backgrounds, skills, knowledge and experience as well as deep expertise in technology and telecommunications. Each year, the Board monitors and improves its performance by conducting an annual performance review.\n\nAttendance\n\nSeven scheduled meetings of the Board were held during the year as well as five meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee, four meetings of the Remuneration Committee and three meetings of the Nominations and Governance Committee. Ad hoc meetings of the Board and its Committees were also held during the year, as required.\n\n| Name                  | Board | Nominations and Governance Committee | Audit and Risk Committee | Remuneration Committee |\n|-----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| Sanjiv Ahuja           | 7/7   | \u2013                                    | 5/5                      | \u2013                      |\n| Sir Crispin Davis     | 7/7   | 3/3                                  | 1/1                      | \u2013                      |\n| Margherita Della Valle| 7/7   | \u2013                                    | \u2013                        | \u2013                      |\n| Michel Demare         | 7/7   | \u2013                                    | 5/5                      | 4/4                    |\n| Dame Clara Furse       | 7/7   | \u2013                                    | \u2013                        | 4/4                    |\n| Valerie Gooding       | 7/7   | 3/3                                  | \u2013                        | 4/4                    |\n| Renee James           | 6/7   | 3/3                                  | \u2013                        | 4/4                    |\n| Gerard Kleisterlee    | 4/4   | 1/1                                  | \u2013                        | \u2013                      |\n| Amparo Moraleda       | 7/7   | \u2013                                    | 5/5                      | \u2013                      |\n| David Nish            | 7/7   | \u2013                                    | 5/5                      | \u2013                      |\n| Nick Read             | 7/7   | \u2013                                    | \u2013                        | \u2013                      |\n| David Thodey          | 1/1   | \u2013                                    | \u2013                        | \u2013                      |\n| Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer | 5/5 | 2/2                                  | \u2013                        | \u2013                      |\n\nNotes:\n1. The number of attendances is shown next to the maximum number of meetings the Director was entitled to attend.\n2. Renee James was unable to attend one scheduled meeting of the Board due to a prior business engagement.\n\nBoard evaluation\n\nProgress in the year\n\n- Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 succession to the Chairman role completed and induction progressed.\n- Presentations to the Board to enhance understanding of emerging risks and opportunities.\n- The Board\u2019s strategy meeting was successfully held via video conference where a range of senior managers presented to the Board.\n\nActions for coming year\n\n- Varied forms of engagement between Directors.\n- Review the mix of skills in light of the next phase of our strategy.\n- Concentration on organic improvement and growth.\n- Monitoring progress on ESG and cultural change.\nCommittee activities\n\nThe Committees undertake focused oversight of Board composition and performance, internal processes and controls and remuneration practices. On 11 May 2021, the Board approved the establishment of an ESG Committee to enhance its oversight of the ESG programme.\n\nESG Committee\n\nThe objective of our new ESG Committee is to provide oversight of Vodafone\u2019s ESG programme: Purpose (Inclusion for All; Planet; and Digital Society), sustainability and responsible business practices as well as Vodafone\u2019s contribution to the societies we operate in under the social contract. The Committee also monitors progress against key performance indicators and external ESG index results.\n\nNomination and induction\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee is normally responsible for the nomination of Directors, however the Chairman search was conducted by a sub-committee led by Valerie Gooding. An overview of the process for the nomination and induction of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois is shown below. At the date of this report, Step 7 was completed.\n\nAudit and risk: In-depth reviews\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee regularly performs deep dive reviews of our principal risks and key markets and operations. In addition to being provided with regular updates in these areas, deep dives were undertaken in legal and regulatory compliance, including our Group procurement company, Vodafone Business, Vodacom and M-Pesa, Germany and the UK, global economic disruption, cyber threat and information security, strategic transformation, technology failure, and geo-political risk in supply chain.\n\nRemuneration across the Group\n\nThe Remuneration Committee takes account of the pay policies in place across the wider business. Remuneration arrangements were reviewed across the business to ensure they fully aligned with our strategy, supported our purpose, and celebrated the Vodafone Spirit.\n\nPrinciples of fair pay:\n\n1. Market competitive\n2. Free from discrimination\n3. Ensure a good standard of living\n4. Share in our successes\n5. Provide benefits for all\n6. Open and transparent\n\n96% shareholder support for the current Remuneration Policy\n\nNew Non-Executive Director\n\nIt is intended that Olaf Swantee will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director following the AGM on 27 July 2021, subject to shareholder approval. Olaf has extensive experience of the telecommunications sector and a consistent record of creating shareholder value.\n\nRead more on page 68\nChairman\u2019s governance statement\n\nStrong corporate governance supports our continued strategy execution, business resilience and contribution to societies in which we operate\n\nI am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report for the year ended 31 March 2021 on behalf of the Board.\n\nAn effective and diverse Board\n\nI was honoured to become Chairman of the Board on 3 November 2020 when Gerard Kleisterlee retired after a decade of service to Vodafone. I am grateful to him for the quality of the Board I have joined.\n\nThe restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have meant my introduction to Vodafone has been almost entirely digital. This has reinforced for me the immense value of the connectivity Vodafone provides to customers, businesses, governments and society, enabling them to run their daily lives and operate smoothly and efficiently.\n\nThe restrictions on travel during the year meant that we held all our Board and Committee meetings by video conference. I am pleased that we were able to hold our meetings with the same cadence as usual, adjusting meeting times to account for different time zones. We also held a number of ad hoc meetings in the early days of the pandemic to ensure the Company was adapting quickly to the rapidly evolving situation.\n\nThis past year, we have seen the way the world works change profoundly and I have been impressed with the flexibility, creativity and dynamism of Vodafone in its response to the significant challenges we\u2019ve faced. During the year, the Board worked with the executive team to ensure Vodafone developed and executed its strategy as well as contributing meaningfully to the efforts of governments and communities to manage the pandemic and to support our customers and employees during this unprecedented period.\n\nThe last year has been extremely challenging and I am grateful to my fellow Directors, the executive team and the people of Vodafone for their hard work and strong spirit throughout.\n\nMy colleagues on the Board are experienced business leaders who bring a wealth of knowledge and experience from diverse sectors and countries. This supports the Board\u2019s discussions on the strategic, operational and sustainability issues which affect the Company today or may do so in the future. As Vodafone moves ahead at pace with its strategy, I am working with my fellow Directors on the Nominations and Governance Committee to ensure our Board continues to comprise a mix of people who have diverse backgrounds, experiences, cultures and thinking styles and deep knowledge of the telecommunications and technology sectors. I am therefore pleased that shareholders will have the opportunity at our 2021 annual general meeting to appoint a new Director to our Board, Olaf Swantee, who has a wealth of experience in the telecommunications sector. I would also like to thank Renee James, ahead of her retirement from the Board on 27 July 2021, for her many valuable contributions to Vodafone during her tenure.\n\nPurpose\n\nVodafone is a purpose led company. We connect for a better future, enabling inclusive and sustainable digital societies. The relevance of our purpose became very apparent during 2020, a year of pandemic, extreme climate events, and demands for more inclusive societies. Vodafone can, and will, play an important role in working with governments and others to address these issues. We have clear plans with targets for enabling inclusive digital societies and helping to tackle climate change. In the shorter term, we are committed to playing a key role in supporting the post-COVID economic and social recovery in the countries where we operate.\n\nOpportunities and risks\n\nAs described in the Strategic Report, we see opportunities to grow Vodafone\u2019s business by deepening our relationship with customers and by developing new products and services for them. We are driving forward energetically to capture these opportunities and doing so whilst also maintaining a strong focus on risk management. The Board and the Audit and Risk Committee have reviewed each of the Company\u2019s top 10 risks and during the year received detailed updates on risks relating to, amongst other topics, technology failure, geo-political risk in the supply chain, cyber threats, and information security. Furthermore, additional financial stress testing and liquidity impact analyses were carried out to reflect the impact of COVID-19 and to inform the Group\u2019s long-term viability statement.\n\nContinued stakeholder engagement\n\nIn March, I had individual meetings with 20 of the Company\u2019s largest shareholders. Topics discussed included Vodafone\u2019s strategy, challenges and opportunities, the Company\u2019s portfolio of assets, our Board and my induction into the Company.\n\nOur annual general meeting was held as a closed meeting on 28 July 2020 due to the restrictions imposed by the UK government at that time. It was disappointing for the Board not to be able to engage with shareholders in person. Nonetheless, the former Chairman, Gerard Kleisterlee, delivered a presentation to shareholders online and answers to questions submitted by shareholders were published on our website. These materials are available to view at vodafone.com/agm.\n\nValerie Gooding continues to serve as the Board\u2019s Workforce Engagement Lead, gathering the views of employees through a number of employee consultative committees across all our European and African markets. As well as COVID-19 impacting the format for those meetings, it also dominated discussion at the forums. Valerie was impressed by employees\u2019 overwhelming support for Vodafone\u2019s efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCulture\nThe Board regards culture as a key enabling factor for our strategic, organisational and digital transformation. The Vodafone Spirit campaign was launched successfully in December 2019, galvanising our culture with our purpose and strategy. One of our key values \u2018Get it done, together\u2019 could not have been more important during the last year as our employees worked tirelessly to keep our customers and others connected during the pandemic and to keep our people safe.\n\nBy April 2020, our global workforce had successfully transitioned to remote working and eight global employee feedback surveys conducted during the year showed that our employees were extremely satisfied they had the tools and support they needed to work safely at home and elsewhere.\n\nInduction\nBefore succeeding Gerard Kleisterlee as Chairman, on 28 July 2020 I joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director. This three-month period of orderly transition and thorough handover was hugely valuable for me to draw from Gerard\u2019s knowledge and experience. Due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, my induction has been largely digital. It began with the executives compiling for me a comprehensive briefing document about the Group. Each section was written by an expert in their part of the business so I gained a valuable perspective in advance of my induction meetings.\n\nDuring my induction I\u2019ve been able to meet each of my fellow Board members and attended 16 meetings with executives and senior managers to discuss various topics, including technology, people and culture, strategy, commercial, finance, Vodafone Business, internal controls, risk and compliance, corporate governance and shareholders and investors. As travel restrictions ease, I look forward to visiting our key local markets. Of course, the Board cycle continued alongside my induction and I have attended 12 Board and Committee meetings to date.\n\nThe year ahead\nDuring the coming year, the Board\u2019s focus will be on maintaining resilient financial performance through the execution of our strategy at pace.\n\nReflecting its ownership of environmental, social and governance matters, the Board has approved the establishment of a new ESG Committee as a Committee of the Board and the Board will benefit from its dedicated oversight of our ESG programme.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer\nChairman of the Board\n\nCompliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the \u2018Code\u2019)\nIn respect of the year ended 31 March 2021 Vodafone Group Plc was subject to the Code (available from www.frc.org.uk). The Board is pleased to confirm that Vodafone applied the principles and complied with all of the provisions of the Code throughout the year. Further information on compliance with the Code can be found as follows:\n\n| Board leadership and Company purpose | Read more |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Long-term value and sustainability   | 32-51 59 66 69-70 |\n| Culture                              | 12 21-22 43 66 71-72 |\n| Shareholder engagement               | 12-13 71-72 |\n| Other stakeholder engagement         | 12-13 71-72 |\n| Conflicts of interest                | 75 |\n\n| Division of responsibilities | Read more |\n|------------------------------|-----------|\n| Role of the Chairman         | 67 69 |\n| Division of responsibilities | 62 69-70 |\n| Non-Executive Directors      | 67-69 |\n| Independence                 | 62 74 |\n\n| Composition, succession and evaluation | Read more |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Appointments and succession planning   | 63 73-75 |\n| Skills, experience and knowledge       | 62 67-68 |\n| Length of service                      | 62 67-68 75 |\n| Evaluation                             | 62 73 |\n| Diversity                              | 22 56-37 62 75 |\n\n| Audit, risk and internal control      | Read more |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Committee                             | 76-77 |\n| Integrity of financial statements     | 61 77-78 109 |\n| Fair, balanced and understandable     | 77 108-109 |\n| Internal controls and risk management | 79-80 |\n| External auditor                      | 80 |\n| Principal and emerging risks          | 53-61 77 |\n\n| Remuneration                          | Read more |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Policies and practices                 | 82-103 |\n| Alignment with purpose, values and long-term strategy | 82-86 |\n| Independent judgement and discretion  | 83 91 |\n\nDisclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules\nWe comply with the Corporate Governance Statement requirements pursuant to the FCA\u2019s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules by virtue of the information included in this \u201cGovernance\u201d section of the Annual Report together with information contained in the \u201cShareholder information\u201d section on pages 227 to 232.\nBoard leadership and Company purpose\n\nThe Board is collectively responsible for ensuring leadership through effective oversight and review. It sets the strategic direction with the goal of delivering sustainable stakeholder value over the longer term, and has oversight of cultural and ethical programmes.\n\nThe Board also oversees the implementation of appropriate risk assessment systems and processes to identify, manage and mitigate Vodafone\u2019s principal risks. It is also responsible for matters relating to finance, audit and internal control, reputation, listed company management, corporate governance and effective succession planning, much of which is overseen through its principal Committees.\n\nFull details of the Committees\u2019 responsibilities are detailed within the respective Committee reports starting on pages 74, 76 and 82.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Board established our purpose pillars: Digital Society, Inclusion for All and Planet. Our purpose is aligned with our culture and strategy, placed at the forefront of our decision-making and strategy development, and the Board considers how the initiatives progressed by management throughout the year have advanced our purpose. This oversight ensures that product innovation realises our ambition, our services continue to improve people\u2019s lives with better connectivity, and our operations continue to be enhanced to reduce our impact on the environment.\n\nRead in detail about our purpose on pages 32 to 42.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe Board monitors the Company\u2019s progress against established strategic objectives and performance against competitors. Board meetings are planned with reference to the Company\u2019s strategic priorities and meeting agendas are constructed to deliver information at appropriate junctures, and from a broad range of management, to ensure the Board\u2019s effective review and challenge. In furtherance of the 2019 Board effectiveness review, sufficient time continues to be allocated to items relating to the execution of the strategy to allow time for deeper discussion.\n\nDuring the year, this was particularly important for matters related to the shape of Vodafone (for example, the carve-out of our new Vantage Towers business), developing and launching new consumer products and services (such as 5G and Curve), our \u2018big four\u2019 markets in Europe (Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) and Vodacom in Africa, and the competitive, legal and regulatory landscape in which we operate (particularly in the light of COVID-19).\n\nRead about the next phase of our strategy on pages 18 to 22.\n\nValues and culture\n\nThe Board has a critical role in setting the tone of our organisation and championing the behaviours we expect to see. Having launched in December 2019, the Vodafone Spirit galvanises our culture with our purpose and strategy. Eight global employee surveys were conducted during FY21 and the survey data was shared widely with employees and the Board. It was encouraging to see a very strong, positive response amongst employees to the Vodafone Spirit launch and that over 50,000 employees had engaged with local plans. The Board were interested in the areas measured by the surveys, the desire indicated by employees to improve \u2018Earn Customer Loyalty\u2019, and plans to attach indicators from surveys to business KPIs.\n\nThe cultural climate in Vodafone is comprehensively measured through a number of mechanisms including policy and compliance processes, internal audit and formal and informal channels for employees to raise concerns (including our annual people survey and our whistleblowing programme, Speak Up, which is also available to the contractors and suppliers working with us). The Board is appraised of any material whistleblowing incidents.\n\nMore information on Speak Up is provided on page 43.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe Board ensures the highest standard of corporate governance is maintained by regularly reviewing developments in governance best practice and ensuring these are adopted by the Company. The Board dedicated time during the year to thoroughly consider the independence and time commitment of all Directors, the arrangements in place to monitor conflicts of interest, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of the Board and each of the Directors.\n\nAll Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters.\n\nRead about our governance structure and roles and responsibilities on pages 69 to 70.\nExtensive and diverse skills, knowledge and experience\n\nOur business is led by our Board of Directors.

Some were supportive of businesses retaining cash to protect themselves from the prolonged period of uncertainty, whilst others preferred that cash returns be maintained where appropriate.\n- **Governments and regulators**: during COVID-19, the UK government expressed concerns over the long-term viability of businesses and encouraged businesses to consider retaining cash to \u2018weather the storm\u2019.\n\nDecision-making:\nThe concerns of our key stakeholders were considered by the Board. The Board\u2019s decision was supported by a robust assessment of the position, performance and viability of the business carried out by management. The Board was mindful that the Directors had continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts and was also cognisant of available reserves to support the dividend.\n\nOn 16 November 2020, we announced a dividend of 4.5 eurocents per share and have recommended a dividend of 4.5 eurocents per share to be paid on 6 August 2021. This was consistent with dividends declared during FY20 and the expectations of our shareholders.\n\nOther\n\nSystem of internal control\nDetails of the operation of our internal risk and compliance processes informed the Board\u2019s discussions on cultural change and operational matters.\n\nRisk tolerance and risk management\nThe Board reviewed management\u2019s identification and assessment of the top 10 principal risks and their impact on strategy and commercial initiatives.\n\nRegulatory landscape\nExecutives provided regular and detailed updates on various regulatory matters, including the classification of the telecommunications sector as an \u2018essential service\u2019 during COVID-19, restrictions on our key suppliers, and spectrum auction structures.\n\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has created an unprecedented challenge for the global economy. The Board was provided with comprehensive updates on the financial and business impact on Vodafone and the changes to the regulatory environment. The Board endorsed management\u2019s five-point plan which was launched in Spring 2020 to contribute to public efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board kept under review the action taken by management to protect the health and safety of our people and continue to provide critical services to our customers, the emergency services and wider society.\n\nBrexit\nThe Board considered the likelihood and potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on the Company and its stakeholders, with particular focus on Vodafone UK and Business. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2021, the Board continued to monitor any potential impact on our business.\n\nESG Committee\nOn 11 May 2021, the Board formally approved the establishment of a new Committee of the Board, the ESG Committee. The objectives of the ESG Committee include the oversight of Vodafone\u2019s ESG programme: Purpose (Inclusion for All; Planet; and Digital Society), sustainability and responsible business practices, as well as Vodafone\u2019s contribution to the societies we operate in under the social contract. The Committee also monitors progress against key performance indicators and external ESG index results.\n\nKey stakeholder interests considered:\n\n- **Investors**: strong ESG governance has become a key requirement of an ESG programme.\n- **Governments and regulators**: ensure compliance with local and international legal and regulatory obligations.\n- **Local Communities and NGOs**: ESG matters affect the day-to-day lives of the people in our local communities.\n- **Suppliers and customers**: seek high ethical standards to be upheld end-to-end in the supply chain.\n- **Employees**: seek protection from health and safety risks, but also take pride in being part of our commitment to ESG matters.\n\nDecision-making:\nThe Board believed that the ESG Committee will promote the long-term success of Vodafone, for the benefit of its members as a whole and our key stakeholders, by providing the Board with enhanced oversight of ESG matters.\n\nThe establishment of a new ESG Committee is a strong signal to all our key stakeholders, and wider society, of the strength of Vodafone\u2019s commitment to its ESG programme and goals, and enhances the commitments made in the social contract.\nEffective use of our skills and experience and improving our performance\n\nThe Board recognises that it needs to continually monitor and improve its performance. This is achieved through the annual performance evaluation, full induction of new Board members and ongoing Board development. The conclusions of this year\u2019s review have been positive and confirmed that the Board remains effective.\n\nProcess undertaken for our Board evaluation\n\nSince the appointment of a new Chairman of the Board in 2020, the Board decided to have an externally facilitated review of its effectiveness early in the new Chairman\u2019s tenure. Therefore it appointed Consilium Limited, an independent board review firm, to conduct the 2021 Board evaluation. Consilium had conducted the last externally facilitated review in 2019. The Board asked Consilium to assess whether the recommendations it had made in its 2019 review had been implemented and to make a new assessment of the Board\u2019s current effectiveness. Consilium is considered fully independent as it does not have a relationship with the Board or any Director.\n\nConsilium took input from the Chairman, Senior Independent Director, Chief Executive and Company Secretary on the design of the review process and the areas to be covered by the questionnaire that was used to gather input to enable a rigorous review of the Board as a whole, its Committees and individual Directors\u2019 contributions to Board discussions and decision-making. The objectives of the review were to provide an assessment of Vodafone Group\u2019s Board effectiveness and governance.\n\nA tailored Board questionnaire was compiled to gather and distil feedback. Consilium collated the responses from Directors, held interviews with selected Directors and the Company Secretary, made an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the Board and presented a report on its findings and recommendations to the Board which was considered at Board and Committee meetings in March 2021.\n\nThe evaluation was designed in part to evaluate the progress made on the four actions identified by the 2020 evaluation. Those were:\n\n- Developing the Board\u2019s understanding of relevant regulatory authorities and further attention on customers.\n- The effective induction of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer and seamless transfer of the Chairman role.\n- A better understanding of customer insights and the development of its understanding and oversight of Vodafone Business.\n- Enhancing the Board\u2019s Strategy meeting.\n\nSummary of findings\n\nProgress against 2020 actions\n\nThe evaluation determined that Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 succession to the Chairman role had been successfully completed and the comprehensive induction could be improved only with personal visits to Vodafone\u2019s main operating locations once travel restrictions are eased.\n\nPresentations to the Board on regulatory developments and consumer behaviours had enhanced the Board\u2019s understanding of emerging risks and opportunities for Vodafone.\n\nThe Board\u2019s Strategy meeting could not be held in person because of the COVID-19 pandemic but was successfully held via video conference and the Board benefited from receiving a range of presentations from senior managers.\n\nActions for the FY22 financial year\n\nThe 2021 Board review reported that virtual working had somewhat blunted the liveliness of discussions and the Directors, recognising the need to continue to improve the quality of conversations, agreed with Consilium\u2019s recommendations for:\n\n- more and different forms of engagement between Directors, with and without the Executive Directors;\n- refreshing the Board\u2019s composition and reviewing the mix of skills and experience on the Board in light of the next phase of strategy;\n- continuing to ensure Board agendas concentrate on the specifics of organic improvement and growth and their underlying drivers; and\n- understanding closely the organisation\u2019s capacity, capabilities and cultural change and monitoring progress on new proposition developments, ESG and culture change.\n\nDetails of the next Board evaluation and progress made on the above actions will be reported in the 2022 Governance Report.\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee (\u2018the Committee\u2019) continues to focus on evaluating the composition of the Board. The Committee ensures that the Board is comprised with an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity so that it is effective in discharging its responsibilities and in having oversight of all matters relating to corporate governance.\n\nChairman\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer\n\nMembers\nSir Crispin Davis\nValerie Gooding\nRenee James\n\nKey Responsibilities\n- Assessing the composition, structure and size of the Board and its Committees and leading the process for appointments to the Board;\n- Succession planning for the Board and Executive Committee, taking into account diversity and the need for an orderly succession;\n- Overseeing the performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors; and\n- Monitoring developments in all matters relating to corporate governance, bringing any issues to the attention of the Board.\n\nThe Committee is comprised solely of independent Non-Executive Directors. The Committee had four scheduled meetings during the year which were fully attended by all members.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Committee meetings were attended virtually by Committee members with other individuals and external advisers invited to attend all or part of the meetings as appropriate. The Committee\u2019s key areas for its focus in the coming year are set out below.\n\nKey focus for the year\nThe key areas of focus for the next year:\n- The completion of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer\u2019s induction;\n- Subject to shareholder approval, the onboarding and induction of Olaf Swantee;\n- Board and Executive Committee succession planning in order to maintain their necessary balance of skills, knowledge and experience to remain effective;\n- Continuing to review Board independence and ensuring Directors have sufficient time to fulfil their Board responsibilities;\n- Continuing to monitor compliance with the Code and future regulatory updates.\n\nLetter from Committee Chairman\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present my first Nominations and Governance Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2021. This past year, the main focus of the Committee has been Board and Executive Committee composition, succession planning and corporate governance matters, with a continued focus on the appointment of Non-Executive Directors with telecoms and technology expertise. I joined the Board on 28 July 2020 and was appointed Chair of the Board and joined the Committee with effect from 3 November 2020.\n\nAs Chairman of the Committee, I take an active role in overseeing the progress made towards improving diversity on the Board and the Executive Committee. Succession planning and the appointment process are key in promoting diversity in a way that is consistent with the long-term strategy of the Group. The Committee ensures we have sufficiently diverse, deep and broad expertise on the Board.\n\nOur commitment to diversity and technology skills extends beyond the Board and Executive Committee. The Committee reviews initiatives which aim to develop the talent pipeline.\n\nFurther details of our programmes to manage talent can be found on page 22.\n\nChanges to the Board and Executive Committee\nOn 27 July 2020, David Thodey stepped down from the Board. Following the AGM and effective from 28 July 2020, I joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director, becoming Chairman on 3 November 2020 following Gerard Kleisterlee\u2019s resignation after 10 years of service.\n\nI am pleased that shareholders will have the opportunity to appoint Olaf Swantee as a new Non-Executive Director at the AGM on 27 July 2021. Olaf has extensive experience of the telecommunications sector and a consistent record of creating shareholder value.\n\nRenee James will not be standing for re-election at the AGM on 27 July 2021. Over her 10-year tenure, Renee has provided invaluable expertise and contribution to the Board and as a Committee member. On behalf of the Board I would like to extend my gratitude and thanks to Renee.\n\nThe Committee is regularly informed on succession planning and changes on the membership of the Executive Committee. During the year the following changes were made:\n- On 1 November 2020, Colman Deegan was appointed as CEO Vodafone Spain and a member of the Executive Committee replacing Antonio Coimbra.\n- Effective 15 February 2021, Nick Jeffery resigned as CEO Vodafone UK and a member of the Executive Committee. On the same date, Ahmed Essam became CEO of Vodafone UK, retaining his place on the Executive Committee, and Alex Froment-Curtil became Group Chief Commercial Officer and joined the Executive Committee.\n\nAssessment of the independence of the Non-Executive Directors\nAll Non-Executive Directors have submitted themselves for re-election at the 2021 AGM, other than Renee James who will retire from the Board at the 2021 AGM.\n\nIn accordance with the Code, the independence of all the Non-Executive Directors was considered by the Committee, including the circumstances for Gerard Kleisterlee and Renee James\u2019 tenures exceeding nine years to support succession planning and maintain diversity on the Board. All Non-Executive Directors are considered independent and they continue to make independent contributions and effectively challenge management.\n\nThe Executive Directors\u2019 service contracts and Non-Executive Directors\u2019 appointment letters are available for inspection at our registered office and will be available on display at the 2021 AGM.\nManagement of conflicts of interest\n\nThe Companies Act 2006 provides that directors have a duty to avoid a situation in which they have or may have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or might conflict with the interests of the Company. This duty is in addition to the existing duty owed to the Company to disclose to the Board any interest in a transaction or arrangement under consideration by the Company.\n\nOur Directors must report any changes to their commitments to the Board, immediately notify the Company of actual or potential conflicts or a change in circumstances relating to an existing authorisation and complete an annual conflicts questionnaire. Any conflicts or potential conflicts identified are considered and, as appropriate, authorised by the Board in accordance with the Company\u2019s Articles of Association. A register of authorised conflicts is also reviewed periodically.\n\nThe Committee and the Board are satisfied that the external commitments of the Non-Executive Directors and of me, your Chairman, do not conflict with our duties and commitments as Directors of the Company, and that each Non-Executive Director is able to dedicate sufficient time to the Company\u2019s affairs. During the financial year, the Board noted that Sanjiv Ahuja, who is the Chairman of Tillman Global Holdings (\u2018Tillman\u2019) which provides tower/fibre constructions ownership and maintenance, has a potential conflict of interest which has arisen as a result of Tillman operating in Europe where Vantage Towers also operates. The conflict of interest has been, and will continue to be, monitored and managed by Mr Ahuja not receiving materials or taking part in decisions relating to the Company\u2019s interest in Vantage Towers or towers matters generally.\n\nThe Committee is comfortable that it has adequate measures in place to manage and mitigate any actual or potential conflicts of interests that may arise in the future.\n\nBoard evaluation\n\nIn accordance with the Code, Vodafone conducts an annual evaluation of the performance of Board and Board Committee, which every Director engages in. This year an external evaluation took place; the outcome of the evaluation and the actions to be addressed during the financial year ending 31 March 2021 can be found on page 73.\n\nTime commitment\n\nIn accordance with the Code, the Committee actively reviews the time commitments of the Board. All Directors are engaged in providing their external commitments to establish that they have sufficient time to meet their Board responsibilities. The Committee is satisfied that the Board does meet this requirement and all Directors provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance and hold the management to account.\n\nSuccession planning\n\nAn overview of my search and induction process can be found on page 63. The search and appointment process for your new Chairman began in 2019 via a sub-committee of the Committee, led by our Senior Independent Director, Valerie Gooding. Two external search consultancies were engaged to support, MWM Consulting and Spencer Stuart (both have no other connections with Vodafone or our Directors). The sub-committee recommended to the Board that I be appointed because it had concluded that I enhanced the mix of diversity, skills and experience for the Board, due to my extensive international experience, particularly across Europe and Africa, and for my expertise at Heineken for managing transformation and creating shareholder value.\n\nThe Committee monitors the length of tenure and the skills and experience of the Non-Executive Directors to assist in succession planning. Details of the length of tenure of each Director and summary of the skills and experience of the Non-Executives can be found on pages 67 and 68. The Committee is confident that the Board has the necessary mix of skills and experience to contribute to the Company\u2019s strategic objectives.\n\nDiversity\n\nIn line with Vodafone\u2019s Board Diversity Policy, the Committee is firmly committed to supporting diversity and inclusion in the boardroom in compliance with the Code and acknowledges the importance of diversity and inclusion to the effective functioning of the Board.\n\nAs set out in our Board Diversity Policy, Vodafone\u2019s long-term ambition is to increase diversity on our Board in all its forms. The Committee annually reviews and agrees the Board Diversity Policy and monitors the progress made at Board and senior management levels during the financial year.\n\nFor the technology sector to reach its full social and economic potential it needs to move fairly reflect the world in which we operate. Diversity at Vodafone extends beyond the Board to the global workforce. The Committee has been and continues to monitor Vodafone\u2019s compliance with targets and best practice recommendations set for gender diversity by the Hampton-Alexander Review and for ethnic diversity by the Parker Review.\n\nThe Hampton-Alexander Review recommended that by 2020 there would be at least 33% female representation at the Board, Executive Committee positions and direct reports of the Executive Committee (the \u2018Senior Leadership Team\u2019). We are pleased to report that as at 31 March 2021, five women and six men served on the Board, which meant that 45.5% of our Board were female. Our Executive Committee has four positions held by women (28.6%). In the Senior Leadership Team, 50 roles are held by women (30.7%), which is an increase from 2020 (28.9%). We are confident that the initiatives detailed on page 37 will support us to reach the Hampton-Alexander Review target and to achieve our ambition to have 40% of women holding management and leadership roles by 2030.\n\nThe Committee is mindful of the recommendation of the Parker Review Report to have at least one Director from a non-white ethnic minority by 2021 and is satisfied that our Board currently meets this recommendation, with 9.1% of the Board being ethnically diverse. Vodafone has implemented a self-declaration process on diversity characteristics including ethnicity on our people system to improve visibility in this area and inform decisions on actions required to support ethnic diversity within the organisation.\n\nGoverance\n\nThe Committee continues to review action taken to comply with the Code and other legal and regulatory obligations during the year. The Committee received regular governance updates and is satisfied that Vodafone has complied with the Code in full during the year.\n\nThe Matters Reserved for the Board and the terms of reference of the Nominations and Governance Committee, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee were reviewed in March 2021.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer\nOn behalf of the Nominations and Governance Committee\n18 May 2021\nThe Committee plays a key role in the governance of the Group\u2019s financial reporting, risk management, internal control and assurance processes and the external audit. Cyber threat and information security remained a key focus for the Committee along with the impact of COVID-19 and the IPO readiness of Vantage Towers prior to its listing on 18 March 2021.\n\nChairman and financial expert\nDavid Nish\n\nMembers\nSanjiv Ahuja\nMichel Demar\u00e9\nAmparo Moraleda\n\nI am pleased to present our report to you as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. This report provides an overview of how the Committee operates, an insight into the Committee\u2019s activities and its role in ensuring the integrity of the Group\u2019s published financial information and the effectiveness of its risk management, controls and related processes.\n\nThe membership of the Committee changed during the year. Sir Crispin Davis stepped down to become a member of the Remuneration Committee. I would like to thank Sir Crispin for his significant contribution to the work of the Committee.\n\nThis year, the Committee focused on the following areas:\n\n- Cyber threat and information security. External threats in this area continue to grow. The Committee met with the cyber security leadership team twice during the year to challenge the cyber security operating model and to ensure the security risks across the IT landscape are assessed and managed;\n- Monitored progress before the initial public offering (IPO) of Vantage Towers A.G. on 18 March 2021;\n- The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on Group risk management, cash flow and funding, accounting, disclosure and financial controls;\n- Ongoing assessment of the risk and control environments at selected business units; and\n- Deep-dive reviews with management on a range of topics related to the Committee\u2019s accountabilities and which are summarised in this report on page 81.\n\nThe Committee met seven times during the year, five times as part of its regular schedule of meetings and two supplementary meetings in December and February to review the IPO readiness of Vantage Towers. The attendance by members at Committee meetings can be seen on page 62. The external auditor is invited to each meeting.\n\nEach regular meeting included reviews of risk and compliance related matters, although these areas received particular focus at the January meeting. At the September and March meetings we considered the anticipated matters impacting the Group\u2019s half-year and year-end reporting and approved the principal and emerging risks. In November and May, we concluded our risk assessment and advised the Board of the outcome prior to the release of the Group\u2019s half-year and year-end financial results.\n\nOur external auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (EY), completed its second annual audit. EY continues to provide robust challenge to management and provides its independent view to the Committee on specific financial reporting judgements and the control environment.\n\nEvery three years the Board appoints an external organisation to perform an independent review of the Committee to evaluate its performance. The last review was performed in March 2019 and concluded that the Board members considered the Committee to be thorough and fully effective in meeting its objectives. A finding of the Board effectiveness review conducted by Consilium in March 2021 was that the Committee was operating effectively.\n\nDavid Nish\nOn behalf of the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nObjective\nThe Committee\u2019s objective is the provision of effective governance over the appropriateness of financial reporting of the Group, including the adequacy of related disclosures, the performance of both the Internal Audit function and the external auditor and oversight of the Group\u2019s systems of internal control, business risks and related compliance activities.\n\nKey responsibilities\nThe responsibilities of the Committee are to:\n\n- Monitor the integrity of the financial statements, including the review of significant financial reporting judgements;\n- Provide advice to the Board on whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and on the appropriateness of the long-term viability statement;\n- Review and monitor the external auditor\u2019s independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the external audit;\n- Review the system of internal financial control and compliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n- Review and provide advice to the Board on the approval of the Group\u2019s US annual report on Form 20-F;\n- Monitor the activities and review the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function; and\n- Monitor the Group\u2019s risk management system, review of the principal risks and the management of those risks.\n\nCommittee governance\nCommittee meetings normally take place the day before Board meetings. The Chair reports to the Board, as a separate agenda item, on the activity of the Committee and matters of particular relevance. The Board has access to the Committee\u2019s papers and receives copies of the Committee minutes.\n\nThe Committee regularly meets separately with the external auditor, the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Audit Director without others being present. The Chair also meets regularly with the external lead audit partner throughout the year outside of the formal Committee process.\nThe Chair is designated as the financial expert on the Committee for the purposes of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee continues to have competence relevant to the sector in which the Group operates. The skills and experience of Committee members is detailed on pages 67 and 68.\n\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a range of implications on risk management and corporate reporting in the year. The key considerations are summarised below.\n\nPrincipal and emerging risks\nThe impact of COVID-19 has been accounted for in the assessment of the Group\u2019s principal and emerging risks and uncertainties.\n\nCorporate governance\nThe financial close process and external audit\nAs restrictions regarding social distancing and travel remained mostly in place during the year, the Group\u2019s employees involved in the preparation of ongoing management information, financial reporting and supporting the external audit continue to work from home, as do the external auditor teams. Our second year-end close process under restrictions benefited from the increase in our capabilities and the efficiencies we have developed over the year, working away from our offices.\n\nInternal controls systems\nThe controls we implemented last year to support remote working remain in place.\n\nFinancial reporting\nThe impact of COVID-19 on current trading conditions has been factored into significant financial reporting judgements, notably our business plans used in impairment testing and amounts provided against receivables and contract assets for expected credit losses. See significant reporting judgements on page 78.\n\nLong-term viability statement and going concern assessment\nThe Committee provides advice to the Board on the form and basis of conclusion underlying the long-term viability statement as set out on page 61 and the going concern assessment on page 109.\n\nThe Committee challenged management on its financial risk assessment as part of its consideration of the long-term viability statement. This included scrutiny of forecast liquidity, balance sheet stress tests, the availability of cash and cash equivalents through new or existing financing facilities and a review of counter-party risk to assess the likelihood of third parties not being able to meet contractual obligations. Certain elements of this exercise supplemented the normal annual process and assessment of the Group\u2019s prospects made by management, and included consideration of:\n\n- The review period and alignment with the Group\u2019s internal long-term forecasts;\n- The assessment of the capacity of the Group to remain viable after consideration of future cash flows, expected debt service requirements, undrawn facilities and access to capital markets;\n- The modelling of the financial impact of certain of the Group\u2019s principal risks materialising using severe but plausible scenarios;\n- Ensuring clear and enhanced disclosures in the Annual Report as to why the assessment period selected was appropriate to the Group, what qualifications and assumptions were made and how the underlying analysis was performed, consistent with FRC pronouncements; and\n- Comprehensive disclosure in relation to the Group\u2019s liquidity provided in the consolidated financial statements. See note 22 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d.\n\nFinancial reporting\nThe Committee\u2019s primary responsibility in relation to the Group\u2019s financial reporting is to review, with management and the external auditors, the appropriateness of the half-year and annual consolidated financial statements. The Committee focuses on:\n\n- The quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;\n- Material areas in which significant judgements have been applied or where significant issues have been discussed with the external auditor;\n- An assessment of whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and whether our US annual report on Form 20-F complies with relevant US regulations;\n- The clarity of the disclosures and compliance with financial reporting standards and relevant financial and governance reporting requirements;\n- Providing advice to the Board on the form and basis underlying the long-term viability statement; and\n- Any correspondence from regulators in relation to our financial reporting.\n\nAccounting policies and practices\nThe Committee received reports from management in relation to:\n\n- The identification of critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty;\n- Significant accounting policies; and\n- Proposed disclosures of these in the 2021 Annual Report.\n\nFollowing discussions with management and the external auditor, the Committee approved the disclosures of the accounting policies and practices set out in note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d and within other notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFair, balanced and understandable\nThe Committee assessed whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company\u2019s position and performance, business model and strategy. The Committee reviewed the processes and controls that underpin its preparation, ensuring that all contributors, the core reporting team and senior management are fully aware of the requirements and their responsibilities. This included the financial reporting responsibilities of the Directors under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as well as considering the interests of other stakeholders which will have an impact on the Company\u2019s long-term success of the entity.\n\nThe Committee reviewed a draft of the Annual Report to enable input and comment. The Committee also reviewed the results announcements, supported by the work of the Group\u2019s Disclosure Committee, which also reviews and assesses the Annual Report and investor communications.\n\nThis work enabled the Committee to provide positive assurance to the Board to assist them in making the statement required by the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.\n## Governance (continued)\n\n### Significant financial reporting judgements\n\nThe areas considered and actions taken by the Committee in relation to the 2021 Annual Report are outlined below. For each area, the Committee was satisfied with the accounting and disclosures in the financial statements.\n\n| Area of focus | Actions taken |\n|---------------|---------------|\n| **Revenue recognition** | The accounting policy for, and related disclosure requirements of IFRS 15 that have been presented in the Annual Report, were reviewed in March and May 2021. The Committee challenged EY on the scope of their revenue audit processes as part of the agreement of the audit plan. |\n| **M&A transactions** | The Committee reviewed and discussed the accounting of these transactions with management at the September 2020, March 2021 and May 2021 meetings. The Committee also received detailed reporting from the external auditor on its assessment on the accounting judgements and disclosures made by management in both the half-year and annual consolidated financial statements. |\n| **Vodafone Idea** | The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the Group\u2019s provisioning in relation to potential liabilities under the payment mechanism agreed with VIL considering VIL\u2019s ability to make any further material payments of its AGR judgement debt. These reviews occurred at the September 2020, March 2021 and May 2021 Committee meetings. |\n| **Indus Towers** | The Committee reviewed the classification of Indus as held for sale during the May 2021 Committee meeting considering (i) VIL\u2019s commitments to Indus and its ability to settle its obligations, (ii) the terms of the pledges contained within the security package, and (iii) the Group\u2019s obligations with respect to the loan secured against the Group\u2019s interests in VIL and Indus. |\n| **Liability provisioning** | The Committee met with the Director of Litigation in November 2020 and May 2021 in advance of the half-year and year-end reporting, respectively. The Committee reviewed and challenged management\u2019s assessment of the current status of the most significant claims, together with relevant legal advice received by the Group, to form a view on the level of provisioning and disclosure in the financial statements. |\n| **Impairments** | The Committee reviewed and discussed detailed reporting with management and challenged the appropriateness of the assumptions made, including: |\n| | \u2013 The consistent application of management\u2019s methodology; |\n| | \u2013 The achievability of the business plans; |\n| | \u2013 Assumptions in relation to terminal growth in the businesses at the end of the plan period; and |\n| | \u2013 Discount rates. |\n| | The ongoing impact of COVID-19 has been factored into the latest business plans. The Group Head of Planning presented the output of the impairment exercise at the May meeting. During the year, the Group recorded no impairments in respect of its investments. |\n| **Taxation** | The Committee met with the Group Tax Director in November 2020 and May 2021 in advance of the half-year and year-end reporting, respectively. The Committee challenged the judgements underpinning both the provisioning and disclosures adopted for the most significant components of contingent taxation liabilities and the underlying assumptions for the recognition of deferred tax assets, principally the assessment of the amount of tax losses and the availability of future taxable profits in Luxembourg. The Group tax charge includes a \u20ac2.8 billion charge from the utilisation of deferred tax assets in Luxembourg as a result of a reduction in tax losses arising from an increase in the valuation of investments in local GAAP accounts. |\n\n---\n\n**Note:**\n- **Revenue recognition:** Revenue is a risk area given the inherent complexity of IFRS 15 accounting requirements and the underlying billing and related IT systems. See note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d.\n- **M&A transactions:** There have been a range of transactions in the year requiring accounting consideration. These include:\n  - Vantage Towers related matters, focused mostly around lease accounting and goodwill allocation;\n  - The buy-out offer to KDG minority shareholders;\n  - The combination of the Group\u2019s interest in Indus Towers with Bharti Infratel;\n  - The merger of Vodafone Hutchison Australia with TPG Telecom;\n  - The sale of a portion of the Group\u2019s interest in NWIT;\n  - The combination of the tower infrastructure assets of Vodafone Greece with Wind Hellas Telecommunications SA; and\n  - Reversal of held for sale accounting for Vodafone Egypt.\n- **Vodafone Idea:** The disclosure and accounting judgements in relation to the impacts of Vodafone Idea Limited\u2019s (VIL) adjusted gross revenue (AGR) judgement debt on the Group\u2019s conditional and capped obligations to make certain payments to VIL under a payment mechanism agreed at the time of the merger between Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in 2017.

The classification of the investment in Indus as held for sale. See note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d.\n- **Liability provisioning:** The Group is subject to a range of claims and legal actions from a number of sources, including competitors, regulators, customers, suppliers and, on occasion, fellow shareholders in Group subsidiaries. See note 16 \u201cProvisions\u201d and note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d.\n- **Impairments:** Judgements in relation to impairment testing relate primarily to the assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use of the Group\u2019s businesses, being the achievability of the long-term business plans and the macroeconomic and related modelling assumptions underlying the valuation process. See note 4 \u201cImpairment losses\u201d.\n- **Taxation:** The Group is subject to a range of tax claims and related legal actions in a number of jurisdictions where it operates. Further, the Group has extensive accumulated tax losses and a key management judgement is whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised in respect of those losses. See note 6 \u201cTaxation\u201d and note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d.\n\n---\n\n**See note 4 \u201cImpairment losses\u201d**\n\n**See note 16 \u201cProvisions\u201d and note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d**\nRegulators and our financial reporting\nThe FRC publishes thematic reviews to help companies improve the quality of corporate reporting around new accounting standards and also provides guidance and reviews the quality of reporting across public companies. The Group routinely reviews FRC publications, the most relevant publications for the 2021 financial close process being:\n- Year-end advice to Audit Committee Chairs, CEOs and CFOs;\n- Thematic review on existing disclosure requirements for IFRS 15 and IFRS 16; and\n- Consolidated COVID-19 disclosure requirements issued in December 2020 which superseded previous publications on this topic.\n\nThe Group already complied with the majority of the recommendations and the 2021 Annual Report has been updated to adopt best practice where applicable.\n\nIn March 2021, the Corporate Reporting Review department of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) advised that our Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2020 had been subject to their review and explanations were requested on certain accounting and disclosure matters. Our responses were accepted by the FRC and their review was closed in May 2021. This review resulted in enhancements to our disclosures which are reflected within this Annual Report.\n\nAlso in March 2021, the US Securities and Exchange Commission raised a number of matters in relation to disclosures within our Form 20-F for the year ended 31 March 2020. We submitted our written responses to the SEC and, as a result, our US Form 20-F for the year ended 31 March 2021 will reflect enhancements to our disclosures.\n\nInternal control and risk management\nThe Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of the Group\u2019s system of internal control, including the risk management framework, the compliance framework and the work of the Internal Audit function.\n\nInternal Audit\nThe Internal Audit function provides independent and objective assurance over the design and operating effectiveness of the system of internal control, through a risk based approach. The function reports into the Committee and, administratively, to the Group Chief Financial Officer. The function is composed of teams across Group functions and local markets. This enables access to specialist skills through centres of excellence and ensures local knowledge and experience. Cooperation with professional bodies and an information technology research firm has ensured access to additional specialist skills and an advanced knowledge base.\n\nInternal Audit activities are based on a robust methodology and the internal quality assurance improvement programme ensures compliance with the Standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors. The function has invested in several initiatives to improve its effectiveness, particularly in the adoption of new technologies. The increased use of data analytics has provided broader and deeper audit testing and driven increased insights.\n\nThe Committee has a standing agenda item to cover Internal Audit related topics. Prior to the start of each financial year, the Committee reviews and approves the annual audit plan, assesses the adequacy of the budget and resources and reviews the operational initiatives for the continuous improvement of the function\u2019s effectiveness. The audit plan was revisited in April 2020 to reflect the risks from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Committee reviews the progress against the approved audit plan and the results of audit activities, with a focus on unsatisfactory audit results and \u201ccross-entity audits\u201d which are audits that are performed across multiple markets with the same scope. Audit results are analysed by process and geography to highlight changes in the control environment and areas that require attention.\n\nDuring the year, Internal Audit coverage focused on principal risks, which included: Global economic disruption, Cyber threat and information security, Legal and regulatory compliance and Technology failure. Relevant audit results are reported at the same time as the Committee\u2019s in-depth review with the risk owner, which allows the Committee to have an integrated view on the way the risk is managed. Assurance was also provided across a range of areas, including data loss prevention and phishing, data privacy, network change management, sourcing, tariff and discounts management, credit vetting and collection, Vodafone Business solution delivery and M-Pesa. The activities performed by the shared service organisation also received attention due to their significant bearing on the effectiveness of global processes.\n\nManagement is responsible for ensuring that issues raised by Internal Audit are addressed within an agreed timetable, and the Committee reviews their timely completion.\n\nAssessment of Group\u2019s system of internal control, including the risk management framework\nThe Group\u2019s risk assessment process and the way in which significant business risks are managed is an area of focus for the Committee. The Committee\u2019s activity here was led primarily, but not solely, by the Group\u2019s assessment of its principal and emerging risks and uncertainties, as set out on pages 53 to 58. In particular, Cyber threat and information security remains a major focus for the Committee given the ongoing risks in this area.\n\nThe Group has an internal control environment designed to protect the business from the material risks which have been identified. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls and the Committee has responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of those controls.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the process by which Group management assessed the control environment, in accordance with the requirements of the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and related Financial and Business Reporting published by the FRC. Activity here was driven by reports from the Group Audit Director, the Director of Risk and a range of functional specialists covering areas such as anti-money laundering and policy compliance on the effectiveness of internal controls. Although not relevant in the financial period, this would include any identified incident of fraud, including those involving management or employees with a significant role in internal controls.\n\nThe Committee has completed its review of the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s system of internal control, including risk management, during the year and up to the date of this Annual Report. The review covered all material controls including financial, operating and compliance controls. The Committee confirms that the system of internal control operated effectively for the 2021 financial year. Where specific areas for improvement were identified, mitigating alternative controls and processes were in place. This allows us to provide positive assurance to the Board to help fulfil its obligations under the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nCompliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nOversight of the Group\u2019s compliance activities in relation to section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and policy compliance reviews also falls within the Committee\u2019s remit.\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting and we have responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of these controls. The Committee received updates on the Group\u2019s work in relation to section 404 compliance and the Group\u2019s broader financial control environment during the year. As the Group continues to centralise processes and controls into shared service centres, we continue to challenge management on ensuring the nature and scope of control activities change to ensure key risks continue to be adequately mitigated. The deeper use of automated\ncontrols embedded within our systems is part of this ongoing evolution in the control environment.\n\nThe Committee also took an active role in monitoring the Group\u2019s compliance activities, including receiving reports from management in the year covering programme-level changes, the scope of compliance work performed and the results of controls testing. The external auditor also reports the status of its work in relation to controls in its reports to the Committee.\n\n**External audit**\n\nThe Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (EY). This includes making the recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditor, assessing their independence on an ongoing basis and approving the statutory audit fee, the scope of the statutory audit and the appointment of the lead audit engagement partner. Alison Duncan has held this role since the appointment of EY in the prior financial year.\n\nEY presented to the Committee its detailed audit plan for the 2021 financial year, which outlined its audit scope, planning materiality and its assessment of key audit risks. The identification of key audit risks is critical in the overall effectiveness of the external audit process and these are outlined in the Audit Report on pages 110 to 120.\n\nThe Committee also received reports from EY on its assessment of the accounting and disclosures in the financial statements and financial controls.\n\nThe Committee will continue to review the auditor appointment and anticipates that the audit will be put out to tender at least every 10 years. The Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 for the financial year under review. The last external audit tender took place in 2019 which resulted in the appointment of EY.\n\n**Independence and objectivity**\n\nIn its assessment of the independence of the auditor, and in accordance with the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\u2019s (PCAOB) standard on independence, the Committee received details of all relationships between the Company and EY that may have a bearing on their independence and received confirmation from EY that it is independent of the Company in accordance with US federal securities law and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the PCAOB.\n\n**Effectiveness of the external audit process**\n\nThe Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit throughout the year and considered the performance of EY, taking into account the Committee\u2019s own assessment, feedback, and the results of a detailed survey of senior finance personnel across the Group. Based on these reviews, the Committee concluded that there had been appropriate focus and challenge by EY on the primary areas of the audit and that EY had applied robust challenge and scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nIn January 2021, the FRC notified the Group that an audit quality review was completed in respect of the EY audit of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2020. The FRC\u2019s findings were reviewed by the Committee with EY. No issues were identified in the report and certain areas of good practice were noted.\n\n**EY audit and non-audit fees**\n\nTotal fees payable to EY for audit and non-audit services in the year ended 31 March 2021 amounted to \u20ac28 million (2020: \u20ac29 million). This included fees of \u20ac9 million which were incurred as part of the IPO of Vantage Towers A.G. This comprised fees of \u20ac1 million for financial statement audit services and non-audit fees of \u20ac8 million for IPO services and Reporting Accountant procedures.\n\n**Audit fees**\n\nThe Committee reviewed and discussed the fee proposal, was engaged in agreeing audit scope changes and, following the receipt of formal assurance that their fees were appropriate for the scope of the work required, agreed an audit fee of \u20ac20 million for statutory audit services in the year (2020: \u20ac22 million).\n\n**Non-audit fees**\n\nTo protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, the Committee has a policy for the engagement of the external auditor to provide non-audit services. The policy prohibits EY from playing any part in management or decision-making, providing certain services such as valuation work and the provision of accounting services. The Group\u2019s non-audit services policy incorporates the requirements of the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard, including a \u2018whitelist\u2019 of permitted non-audit services which mirrors the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard.\n\nThe Committee has pre-approved that EY can be engaged by management, subject to the policies set out above, and subject to:\n\n- A \u20ac60,000 fee limit for individual engagements;\n- A \u20ac500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no legal alternative; and\n- A \u20ac500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no practical alternative supplier.\n\nFor those permitted services that exceed these specified fee limits, the Committee Chair pre-approves the service.\n\nNon-audit fees were \u20ac8 million (2020: \u20ac7 million) and represented 40% of audit fees for the 2021 financial year (2020: 32%). See note 3 \u201cOperating profit/(loss)\u201d for further details.\nIn-depth reviews\n\nThe Committee requested management to provide in-depth reviews as part of the meeting agendas. These reviews are summarised below, together with the Group\u2019s principal risk to which the review relates.\n\nSubject of in-depth review\n\n| Principal risk (see pages 54 to 57) |\n|-------------------------------------|\n| Principal risk deep-dive with the Group External Affairs Director, the Global Supply Chain Director and the Group Corporate Security Director. | Geo-political risk in supply chain |\n| Business risk impact of COVID-19 which considered risks around supply chain management and the impact of the pandemic on the Group\u2019s principal risks. | Global economic disruption |\n| This was undertaken with the Group Strategy Director, the Global Supply Chain Director and the Group Head of Risk. | |\n| Review of the Long Term Viability Statement and the going concern assessment including the financial risk impact of COVID-19. | Global economic disruption |\n| This was undertaken with the Group Financial Controller, the Group Treasury Director, the Group Corporate Finance Director and the Group Head of FR&A. | |\n| Principal risk deep-dive and mitigating measures that are being taken. | Global economic disruption. |\n| Cyber security briefings provided by the Group CTO and the Cyber Security Director.

For example, we have not furloughed any of our employees and have continued our all-employee global reward review in both 2020 and 2021, including the delivery of performance related pay in line with our normal approach. We have also continued to pay a dividend throughout this period.\n\nSuch actions formed part of the Committee\u2019s consideration when determining a number of matters in the year including executive salaries, incentive outcomes, and package structures for the year ahead. The Committee has also continued to work within the spirit of its principles which aim to ensure our pay arrangements drive the behaviours critical to the delivery of our strategy, are aligned with performance, encourage shareholder alignment, and support our Fair Pay principles. Further details of the Committee\u2019s principles can be found online as part of our new digital content using the link on this page.\n\nThe remainder of this letter and report provides further information on the nature of and reasons for such decisions.\n\nStakeholder engagement during the year\n\nAs set out in last year\u2019s letter, we launched our remuneration policy consultation with our largest shareholders in November 2019 and the Committee would like to thank all shareholders who took the time to provide feedback during the period leading up to the shareholder vote at our 2020 AGM. Our Policy Report was approved by over 96% of shareholders, reflecting the importance and effectiveness of genuine two-way dialogue during such consultations. The intention continues to be for the current Policy Report to remain in place for its full three-year regulatory life-cycle.\n\nIn terms of engaging the employee voice, whilst COVID-19 prevented our European and South African employee forums from meeting face-to-face, both were able to take place online. As Senior Independent Director I attended one meeting with each forum, with feedback from the meetings subsequently reported back directly to the Board. The key topics raised by employee representatives this year focused on our response to COVID-19 including matters of remote working, employee well-being and communication during the period. I would like to thank the representatives from both forums for inviting me and demonstrating enthusiasm and diligence in our discussions.\n\nWhen looking at the feedback from these forums and our other channels of engagement (including senior leader \u2018town hall\u2019 webinars/ Q&A sessions, regular pulse surveys, and engagement through our digital collaboration platforms) it is clear that our colleagues valued the open and regular updates the business had given throughout the year in respect of our response to COVID-19. Colleagues have also expressed their pride in working for Vodafone during a period when our services have proved critical to so many areas of society.\n\nFurther details on our stakeholder engagement activities can be found on pages 12 and 13 of this Annual Report.\n\nArrangements for 2022\n\nBase salary and pension arrangements\n\nNeither the Chief Executive nor the Chief Financial Officer have received a salary increase since their appointment to their current roles in 2018. In light of their strong performance and growing experience in role, the Committee agreed an increase would be justified. However, in line with the restraint on salary increases for the wider leadership team, the Committee felt that salaries for both Executive Directors should remain unchanged for the year ahead. The Committee acknowledges the importance of our arrangements remaining fair and competitive and will review this situation again next year.\n\nPension arrangements for both Executive Directors will continue to remain aligned with the wider UK workforce at 10% of base salary.\n\nAnnual bonus (\u2018GSTIP\u2019)\n\nGiven the importance of growth to our strategy, the Committee agreed it was appropriate to re-introduce service revenue as a performance measure for the 2022 short-term incentive. As set out in last year\u2019s report this measure had been removed from the 2021 plan due to the difficulty in setting an appropriate target given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 at the time.\n\nIn light of the evolving external circumstances and our renewed confidence in being able to set a robust target for 2022 it was agreed this measure should be restored in the 2022 plan with a weighting of 25%. The remaining measures of free cash flow, EBIT, and customer appreciation KPIs which have been retained from the 2021 structure, will also be equally weighted at 25% for the 2022 plan.\n\nGlobal long-term incentive (\u2018GLTI\u2019)\n\nFollowing the approval of the Policy Report at our 2020 AGM, the first grant under our new GLTI structure which incorporates an ESG measure was made in November 2020. For 2022 the intention is to keep the same structure in line with our agreed normal policy. The intention is for such awards to be made in August 2021 with the Committee reviewing both internal and external considerations prior to formally approving the awards at the July 2021 meeting. Further details can be found on pages 101 and 102.\nPerformance outcomes during 2021\n\nGSTIP performance (1 April 2020 \u2013 31 March 2021)\nAnnual bonus performance during the year was measured against both financial and strategic measures. Due to the difficulty in setting a service revenue target in light of the uncertainty created by COVID-19 at the start of the financial year the financial measures were adjusted free cash flow and adjusted EBIT whilst the strategic measure was assessed against customer appreciation KPIs. All three measures were equally weighted at 1/3 of total bonus opportunity.\n\nPerformance under both of the financial measures and the strategic measure was above the mid-point of the target range. The combined performance resulted in an overall bonus payout of 62.0% of maximum. Further details on performance can be found on pages 91 and 92.\n\nGLTI performance (1 April 2018 \u2013 31 March 2021)\nThe 2019 GLTI award (granted June 2018) was subject to free cash flow (2/3 of total award) and relative TSR (1/3 of total award) performance. Both performance conditions were measured over the three-year period ending 31 March 2021.\n\nFinal FCF performance finished below the mid-point of the target range resulting in 33.6% of the FCF element vesting. TSR performance was below the median of the peer group resulting in no vesting under this element. This resulted in an overall vesting percentage of 22.4% of maximum. Further details of this vesting calculation can be found on pages 92 and 93.\n\nConsideration of discretion\nThe Committee reviewed the outcomes of both the annual bonus and long-term incentive plan and considered the results both against the relevant performance targets and the wider internal and external context. As set out at the start of this letter, it was noted that the business had remained resilient during the pandemic and that the bonus outcome for the year reflected this. The Committee also agreed that the outcome under the long-term incentive was appropriate given performance against the three-year targets, particularly noting that the TSR element would lapse in full. The Committee therefore concluded discretion was not required. Further details can be found on page 91.\n\nLooking forward\nRenee James will be stepping down from the Board at the 2021 AGM. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Renee for her service to both this Committee and the wider Board.\n\nThis year has once again been one of disruption and adaptation as our colleagues, customers and societies have dealt with the developing COVID-19 pandemic. Our people and business alike have shown resilience and strength in the face of these challenges and it is this dedication and commitment which will enable the next stage of our transformation towards becoming the new generation connectivity and digital services provider for Europe and Africa.\n\nThe rest of this report sets out both our Policy Report, as approved at the 2020 AGM, and our Annual Report on Remuneration which sets out the decisions and outcomes summarised in this letter in further detail.\n\nValerie Gooding\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee\n18 May 2021\n\nRemuneration at a glance\n\n| Component | 2021 (year ending 31 March 2021) | 2022 (year ending 31 March 2022) |\n|-----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Fixed pay** | | |\n| Base salary | Effective 1 July 2020: | Effective 1 July 2021: |\n| | Chief Executive: \u00a31,050,000 (no increase). | Chief Executive: \u00a31,050,000 (no increase). |\n| | Chief Financial Officer: \u00a3700,000 (no increase). | Chief Financial Officer: \u00a3700,000 (no increase). |\n| Benefits | Travel related benefits and private medical cover. | Travel related benefits and private medical cover. |\n| Pension | Pension contribution of 10% of salary for all Executive Directors. | Pension contribution of 10% of salary for all Executive Directors. |\n| **Annual bonus** | | |\n| GSTIP | Opportunity (% of salary): | Opportunity (% of salary): |\n| | Target: 100%/Maximum: 200% | Target: 100%/Maximum: 200% |\n| | Measures: | Measures: |\n| | Adjusted EBIT (1/3), adjusted FCF (1/3), and customer appreciation KPIs (1/3). | Service revenue (25%), adjusted EBIT (25%), adjusted FCF (25%), and customer appreciation KPIs (25%). |\n| **Long-term incentive** | | |\n| GLTI | Opportunity (% of salary \u2013 maximum): | Opportunity (% of salary \u2013 maximum): |\n| | Chief Executive: 500%/Other Executive Directors: 450% | Chief Executive: 500%/Other Executive Directors: 450% |\n| | Measures: | Measures: |\n| | Adjusted free cash flow (60%), relative TSR (30%), and ESG (10%). | Adjusted free cash flow (60%), relative TSR (30%), and ESG (10%). |\n| | Performance/holding periods: | Performance/holding periods: |\n| | Three-year performance + two-year holding period. | Three-year performance + two-year holding period. |\nRemuneration Policy\n\nRemuneration Policy \u2013 notes to reader\n\nNo changes have been made to our policy since its approval at the 2020 Annual General Meeting which was held on 28 July 2020. Our approved Policy Report is available on our website at vodafone.com, and has been reproduced below in the shaded boxes exactly as it was set out in the 2020 Annual Report. As such, some of the policy wording is now out of date: this includes references to the 2020 Annual General Meeting and page number references.\n\nRemuneration Policy\n\nIn this forward-looking section we describe our Remuneration Policy for the Board. This includes our considerations when determining policy, a description of the elements of the reward package, including an indication of the potential future value of this package for each of the Executive Directors, and the policy applied to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors.\n\nWe will be seeking shareholder approval for our Remuneration Policy at the 2020 AGM and we intend to implement it at that point. A summary and explanation of the proposed changes to the current Remuneration Policy is provided on page 100. Subject to approval, we will review our policy each year to ensure that it continues to support our company strategy and if it is necessary to make a change to our policy within the next three years, we will seek shareholder approval.\n\nConsiderations when determining our Remuneration Policy\n\nOur remuneration principles which are outlined on page 97 guide the Remuneration Committee when making decisions on our policy and its implementation. A critical consideration for the Remuneration Committee when determining our Remuneration Policy is to ensure that it supports our company purpose, strategy, and business objectives.\n\nA variety of stakeholder views are taken into account when determining executive pay, including those of our shareholders, colleagues, and external bodies. Further details on how we engage with, and consider the views of, each of these stakeholders are set out on page 115.\n\nIn advance of submitting our policy for shareholder approval we ran a thorough consultation exercise with our major shareholders. We invited our top 20 shareholders and a number of key governance stakeholders to comment on remuneration at Vodafone and to provide feedback on the proposed changes to the current policy which was approved at the 2017 AGM. A number of meetings between shareholders and the Remuneration Committee Chairman took place during this consultation period. Further details of this consultation are provided on pages 97 and 98 whilst a summary of the proposed changes to our current policy, which are incorporated in this revised Remuneration Policy report, is provided on page 100.\n\nListening to and consulting with our employees is very important and the Committee is supportive of the growing focus on engaging the employee voice, which has accompanied recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code. Our engagement with colleagues can take different forms in different markets but includes a variety of channels and approaches including our annual people survey which attracts very high levels of participation and engagement, regular business leader Q&A sessions, and a number of internal digital communication platforms.\n\nOur Senior Independent Director also undertakes an annual attendance at our European employee forum, and a similar body in South Africa, with any questions or concerns raised by the employee representatives fed back directly to the Board for consideration and discussion.\n\nWe do not formally consult directly with employees on the executive Remuneration Policy nor is any fixed remuneration comparison measurement used. However, when determining the policy for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee is briefed on pay and employment conditions of employees in Vodafone Group as a whole, with particular reference to the market in which the executive is based. Further information on our approach to remuneration for other employees is given on page 105.\n\nPerformance measures and targets\n\nOur Company strategy and business objectives are the primary consideration when we are selecting performance measures for our incentive plans. The targets within our incentive plans that are related to internal financial measures (such as revenue, profit and cash flow) are typically determined based on our budgets. Targets for strategic and external measures (such as customer appreciation KPIs, ESG measures, and total shareholder return (\u2018TSR\u2019)) are set based on company objectives and in light of the competitive marketplace. The threshold and maximum levels of performance are set to reflect minimum acceptable levels at threshold and very stretching levels at maximum.\n\nAs in previous Remuneration Reports we will disclose the details of our performance targets for our short and long-term incentive plans. However, our annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and therefore we will only disclose our targets in the Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year. We will normally disclose the targets for each long-term award in the Remuneration Report for the financial year preceding the start of the performance period \u2013 where this is not possible, such targets will be disclosed at the time of grant and published in the next Remuneration Report.\n\nAt the end of each performance period we review performance against the targets, using judgement to account for items such as (but not limited to) mergers, acquisitions, disposals, foreign exchange rate movements, changes in accounting treatment, material one-off tax settlements etc. The application of judgement is important to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.\nMalus and clawback\n\nIn addition, the Remuneration Committee reviews the incentive plan results before any payments are made to executives or any shares vest and has full discretion to adjust the final payment or vesting downwards if they believe circumstances warrant it. In particular, the Committee has the discretion to use either malus or clawback as it sees appropriate. In the case of malus, the award may lapse wholly or in part, may vest to a lesser extent than it would otherwise have vested or vesting may be delayed.\n\nIn the case of clawback, the Committee may recover bonus amounts that have been paid up to three years after the relevant payment date, or recover share awards that have vested up to five years after the relevant grant date. The key trigger events for the use of the clawback arrangements include material misstatement of performance, material miscalculation of performance condition outcomes, gross misconduct, and reputational damage.\n\nSubject to approval of this Remuneration Policy, these arrangements will be applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, following the 2020 AGM. The current clawback arrangements, which are set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM, have been applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, since the 2017 AGM.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy table\n\nThe table below summarises the main components of the reward package for Executive Directors.\n\n| Fixed pay: Base salary | Purpose and link to strategy | To attract and retain the best talent |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Operation              | Salaries are usually reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months commencing 1 July. Decision is influenced by: |\n|                        | - level of skill, experience and scope of responsibilities of individual; |\n|                        | - business performance, scarcity of talent, economic climate and market conditions; |\n|                        | - increases elsewhere within the Group; and |\n|                        | - external comparator groups (which are used for reference purposes only) made up of companies of similar size and complexity to Vodafone. |\n| Opportunity            | Average salary increases for existing Executive Committee members (including Executive Directors) will not normally exceed average increases for employees in other appropriate parts of the Group. Increases above this level may be made in specific situations. These situations could include (but are not limited to) internal promotions, changes to role, material changes to the business and exceptional company performance. |\n| Performance metrics    | None. |\n\n| Fixed pay: Pension | Purpose and link to strategy | To remain competitive within the marketplace |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Operation         | Executive Directors may choose to participate in the defined contribution pension scheme or to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension. |\n| Opportunity       | The pension contribution or cash payment is equal to the maximum employer contribution available to our UK employees under our Defined Contribution scheme (currently 10% of annual gross salary). |\n| Performance metrics | None. |\n\n| Fixed pay: Benefits | Purpose and link to strategy | To aid retention and remain competitive within the marketplace |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operation           | - Travel related benefits. This may include (but is not limited to) company car or cash allowance, fuel and access to a driver where appropriate; |\n|                     | - Private medical, death and disability insurance and annual health checks. |\n|                     | - In the event that we ask an individual to relocate we would offer them support in line with Vodafone\u2019s relocation or international assignment policies. This may cover (but is not limited to) relocation, cost of living allowance, housing, home leave, education support, tax equalisation and advice; |\n|                     | - Legal fees if appropriate; |\n|                     | - Other benefits are also offered in line with the benefits offered to other employees, for example, our all-employee share plan, mobile phone discounts, maternity/paternity benefits, sick leave, paid holiday, etc. |\n| Opportunity         | - Benefits will be provided in line with appropriate levels indicated by local market practice in the country of employment. |\n|                     | - We expect to maintain benefits at the current level but the value of benefit may fluctuate depending on, amongst other things, personal situation, insurance premiums and other external factors. |\n| Performance metrics | None. |\nRemuneration Policy (continued)\n\n**Annual bonus \u2013 Global Short-Term Incentive Plan (\u2018GSTIP\u2019)**\n\n**Purpose and link to strategy**\nTo drive behaviour and communicate the key priorities for the year.\nTo motivate employees and incentivise delivery of performance over the one year operating cycle.\n\nThe financial metrics drive our growth strategies whilst also focusing on improving operating efficiencies. The strategic measures aim to ensure a great customer experience remains at the heart of what we do.\n\n**Operation**\n- Bonus levels and the appropriateness of measures and weightings are reviewed annually to ensure they continue to support our strategy.\n- Performance over the financial year is measured against stretching financial and non-financial performance targets set at the start of the financial year.\n- The annual bonus is usually paid in cash in June each year for performance over the previous year. A mandatory deferral of 25% of post-tax bonus earned into shares for two years will normally apply except where an executive has met or exceeded their share ownership requirement.\n\n**Opportunity**\n- Bonuses can range from 0\u2013200% of base salary, with 100% paid for on-target performance. Maximum is only paid out for exceptional performance.\n\n**Performance metrics**\n- Performance over each financial year is measured against stretching targets set at the beginning of the year.\n- The performance measures normally comprise a mix of financial and strategic measures. Financial measures may include (but are not limited to) profit, revenue and cash flow with a weighting of no less than 50%. Strategic measures may include (but are not limited to) customer appreciation KPIs such as churn, revenue market share, and NPS.\n\n**Long-term incentive \u2013 Global Long-Term Incentive Plan (\u2018GLTI\u2019)**\n\n**Purpose and link to strategy**\nTo motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained performance over the long term.\nTo support and encourage greater shareholder alignment through a high level of personal share ownership.\n\nThe use of free cash flow as the principal performance measure ensures we apply prudent cash management and rigorous capital discipline to our investment decisions.\n\nThe use of TSR along with a performance period of not less than three years means that we are focused on the long-term interests of our shareholders.\n\n**Operation**\n- Award levels and the framework for determining vesting are reviewed annually.\n- Long-term incentive awards consist of shares subject to performance conditions which are granted each year.\n- Awards will normally vest not less than three years after the respective award grant date based on Group performance against the performance metrics set out below. In exceptional circumstances, such as but not limited to where a delay to the grant date is required, the Committee may set a vesting period of less than three years, although awards will continue to be subject to a performance period of at least three years.\n- All post-tax shares are subject to a mandatory two year holding from the date of vest prior to release.\n- Dividend equivalents are paid in cash after the vesting date.\n\n**Opportunity**\n- Maximum long-term incentive face value at award of 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% for other Executive Directors.\n- Threshold long-term incentive face value at award is 20% of maximum opportunity. Minimum vesting is 0% of maximum opportunity. Awards vest on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum.\n- The Committee has the discretion to reduce long-term incentive grant levels for Directors who have neither met their shareholding guideline nor increased their shareholding by 100% of salary during the year.\n- The awards that vest accrue cash dividend equivalents over the three year vesting period.\n- Awards vest to the extent performance conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Performance metrics**\n- Performance is measured against stretching targets set at the time of grant.\n- Vesting is determined based on the following measures: adjusted free cash flow as our operational performance measure, relative TSR against a peer group of companies as our external performance measure, ESG as a measure of our external impact and commitment to our purpose.\n- Weightings will be determined each year and will normally constitute 60% on adjusted free cash flow, 30% on relative total shareholder return, and 10% on ESG. The Committee will determine the actual weighting of an award prior to grant, taking into account all relevant information.\nNotes to the Remuneration Policy table\n\nExisting arrangements\nWe will honour existing awards, incentives, benefits and contractual arrangements made to individuals prior to their promotion to the Board and/or prior to the approval and implementation of this policy. For the avoidance of doubt this includes payments in respect of any award granted under any previous Remuneration Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest (or lapse) or the benefits or contractual arrangements no longer apply.\n\nLong-term incentive (\u2018GLTI\u2019)\nWhen referring to our long-term incentive awards we use the financial year end in which the award was made. For example, the \u201c2020 award\u201d was made in the financial year ending 31 March 2020. The awards are usually made in the first half of the financial year.\n\nThe extent to which awards vest depends on three performance conditions:\n\n- underlying operational performance as measured by adjusted free cash flow;\n- relative Total Shareholder Return (\u2018TSR\u2019) against a peer group median; and\n- performance against our Environmental, Social, and Governance (\u2018ESG\u2019) targets.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow\nThe free cash flow performance is based on the cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure over the performance period. The detailed targets and the definition of adjusted free cash flow are determined each year as appropriate. The target adjusted free cash flow level is set by reference to our long-range plan and market expectations. We consider the targets to be critical to the Company\u2019s long-term success and its ability to maximise shareholder value, and to be in line with the strategic goals of the Company. The Remuneration Committee sets these targets to be sufficiently demanding with significant stretch where only outstanding performance will be rewarded with a maximum payout.\n\nThe cumulative adjusted free cash flow vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear interpolation between points):\n\n| Performance          | Vesting percentage (% of FCF element) |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold      | 0%                                    |\n| Threshold            | 20%                                   |\n| Maximum              | 100%                                  |\n\nTSR outperformance of a peer group median\nWe have a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile. As such, the outperformance of the median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure. The peer group for the performance condition is reviewed each year and amended as appropriate.\n\nThe TSR vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear interpolation between points):\n\n| Performance                                      | Vesting percentage (% of TSR element) |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Below median                                     | 0%                                    |\n| Median                                           | 20%                                   |\n| Percentage outperformance of the peer group median equivalent to 80th percentile | 100%                                  |\n\nIn order to determine the percentages for the equivalent outperformance levels above median, the Remuneration Committee seeks independent external advice.\n\nESG performance\nOur ESG targets will be set on an annual basis (as per the approach for our other performance measures), and will be aligned to our externally communicated ambitions in this area. Where performance is below the agreed ambition, the Committee will use its discretion to assess vesting based on performance against the stated ambition and any other relevant information.\n\nRemuneration policy for other employees\nWhile our remuneration policy follows the same fundamental principles across the Group, packages offered to employees reflect differences in market practice in the different countries, role and seniority.\n\nFor example, the remuneration package elements for our Executive Committee are essentially the same as for the Executive Directors with some minor differences; for example smaller levels of share awards and local variances where appropriate. The remuneration for the next level of management, our senior leadership team, again follows the same principles with local and individual performance aspects in the annual bonus targets and performance share awards. They also receive lower levels of share awards which are partly delivered in conditional share awards without performance conditions.\nRemuneration Policy (continued)\n\nEstimates of total future potential remuneration from 2021 pay packages\n\nThe tables below provide estimates of the potential future remuneration for each of the Executive Directors based on the remuneration opportunity to be granted in the 2021 financial year. Potential outcomes based on different performance scenarios are provided for each Executive Director.\n\nThe assumptions underlying each scenario are described below:\n\n- **Fixed**: Consists of base salary, benefits and pension.\n  - Base salary is at 1 July 2020.\n  - Benefits are valued using the figures in the total remuneration for the 2020 financial year table on page 109 (of the 2020 report).\n  - Pensions are valued by applying cash allowance rate of 10% of base salary at 1 July 2020.\n\n| Base (\u00a3'000) | Benefits (\u00a3'000) | Pension (\u00a3'000) | Total fixed (\u00a3'000) |\n|--------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Chief Executive | 1,050 | 42 | 105 | 1,197 |\n| Chief Financial Officer | 700 | 22 | 70 | 792 |\n\n- **Mid-point**: Based on what a Director would receive if performance was in line with plan.\n  - The opportunity for the annual bonus (\u2018GSTIP\u2019) is 100% of base salary under this scenario.\n  - The opportunity for the long-term incentive (\u2018GLTI\u2019) reflects assumed achievement mid-way between threshold and maximum performance.\n\n- **Maximum**: The maximum award opportunity for the GSTIP is 200% of base salary.\n  - The maximum GLTI opportunity reflects full vesting based on the maximum award levels set out in this Remuneration Policy (i.e. 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer).\n\nAll scenarios: Long-term incentives consist of share awards only which are measured at face value i.e. no assumption for cash dividend equivalents payable.\n\nNick Read Chief Executive \u00a3'000\n\nMargherita Della Valle Chief Financial Officer \u00a3'000\n\nRecruitment remuneration\n\nOur approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary and appropriate to attract the right talent to the role.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy table (pages 103 and 104) sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the appointment of an Executive Director. Any new Director\u2019s remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject to the same constraints, as those of the existing Directors performing similar roles. This means a potential maximum bonus opportunity of 200% of base salary and long-term incentive maximum face value of opportunity at award of 500% of base salary.\n\nWhen considering the remuneration arrangements of individuals recruited from external roles to the Board, we will take into account the remuneration package of that individual in their prior role. We only provide additional compensation to individuals for awards foregone. If necessary we will seek to replicate, as far as practicable, the level and timing of such remuneration, taking into account also any remaining performance requirements applying to it. This will be achieved by granting awards of cash or shares that vest over a timeframe similar to those forfeited and if appropriate based on performance conditions. A commensurate reduction in quantum will be applied where it is determined that the new awards are either not subject to performance conditions or subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those of the awards forfeited.\n\nService contracts of Executive Directors\n\nExecutive Directors\u2019 contracts have rolling terms and are terminable on no more than 12 months\u2019 notice.\n\nThe key elements of the service contract for executives relate to remuneration, payments on loss of office (see below), and restrictions during active employment (and for 12 months thereafter). These restrictions include non-competition, non-solicitation of customers and employees etc.\nTreatment of corporate events\n\nAll of the Company\u2019s share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied and pro-rated to reflect the acceleration of vesting, unless the Committee determines otherwise.\n\nIn the event of a demerger, distribution (other than an ordinary dividend) or other transaction which would affect the current or future value of any award, the Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a change of control described above. Alternatively, an adjustment may be made to the number of shares if considered appropriate.\n\nPayments for departing Executive Directors\n\nIn the table below we summarise the key elements of our policy on payment for loss of office. We will of course, always comply both with the relevant plan rules and local employment legislation.\n\n| Provision | Policy |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Notice period and compensation for loss of office in service contracts | - 12 months\u2019 notice from the Company to the Executive Director.  \n- Up to 12 months\u2019 base salary (in line with the notice period). Notice period payments will either be made as normal (if the executive continues to work during the notice period or is on gardening leave) or they will be made as monthly payments in lieu of notice (subject to mitigation if alternative employment is obtained). |\n| Treatment of annual bonus (CGSTIP) on termination under plan rules | - The annual bonus will be pro-rated for the period of service during the financial year and will reflect the extent to which Company performance has been achieved.  \n- The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce the entitlement to an annual bonus to reflect the individual\u2019s performance and the circumstances of the termination. |\n| Treatment of unvested long-term incentive awards (GLITT) on termination under plan rules | - An Executive Director\u2019s award will vest in accordance with the terms of the plan and satisfaction of performance conditions measured at the normal completion of the performance period, with the award pro-rated for the proportion of the vesting period that had elapsed at the date of cessation of employment.  \n- The Remuneration Committee has discretion to vary the level of vesting as deemed appropriate, and in particular to determine that awards should not vest for reasons which may include, at their absolute discretion, departure in case of poor performance, departure without the agreement of the Board, or detrimental competitive activity. |\n| Pension and benefits | - Generally pension and benefit provisions will continue to apply until the termination date.  \n- Where appropriate other benefits may be receivable, such as (but not limited to) payments in lieu of accrued holiday and legal fees or tax advice costs in relation to the termination.  \n- Benefits of relative small value may continue after termination where appropriate, such as (but not limited to) mobile phone provision. |\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, an arrangement may be established specifically to facilitate the exit of a particular individual albeit that any such arrangement would be made within the context of minimising the cost to the Group. We will only take such a course of action in exceptional circumstances and where it is considered to be in the best interests of shareholders.\n\nChairman and Non-Executive Directors\u2019 remuneration\n\nOur policy is for the Chairman to review the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors annually following consultation with the Remuneration Committee Chairman. Fees for the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n| Element | Policy |\n|---------|--------|\n| Fees | - We aim to pay competitively for the role including consideration of the time commitment required. We benchmark the fees against an appropriate external comparator group. We pay a fee to our Chairman which includes fees for chairmanship of any committees. We pay a fee to each of our other Non-Executive Directors and they receive an additional fee if they chair a committee and/or hold the position of Senior Independent Director. Non-executive fee levels are set within the maximum level as approved by shareholders as part of our Articles of Association. We review the structure of fees from time to time and may, as appropriate, make changes to the manner in which total fees are structured, including but not limited to any additional chair or membership fees. |\n| Allowances | - Under a legacy arrangement, an allowance is payable each time certain non-Europe-based Non-Executive Directors are required to travel to attend Board and committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved. |\n| Incentives | - Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive plans. |\n| Benefits | - Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any benefit plans. The Company does not provide any contribution to their pension arrangements. The Chairman is entitled to the use of a car and a driver whenever and wherever he is providing his services to or representing the Company. We have been advised that for Non-Executive Directors, certain travel and accommodation expenses in relation to attending Board meetings should be treated as a taxable benefit therefore we also cover the tax liability for these expenses. |\n\nNon-Executive Director letters of appointment\n\nNon-Executive Directors are engaged on letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. The appointment of Non-Executive Directors may be terminated without compensation. Non-Executive Directors are generally not expected to serve for a period exceeding nine years. For further information refer to the Nominations and Governance Committee section of the Annual Report.\nRemuneration Committee\n\nIn this section we give details of the composition of the Remuneration Committee and activities undertaken during the 2021 financial year. The Committee\u2019s function is to exercise independent judgement and consists only of the following independent Non-Executive Directors:\n\nChairman: Valerie Gooding\nCommittee members: Michel Demar\u00e9, Dame Clara Furse and Renee James\n\nThe Committee regularly consults with Nick Read, the Chief Executive, and Leanne Wood, the Chief Human Resources Officer, on various matters relating to the appropriateness of awards for Executive Directors and senior executives, though they are not present when their own compensation is discussed. In addition, Adrian Jackson, the Group Reward and Policy Director, provides a perspective on information provided to the Committee, and requests information and analysis from external advisers as required. Rosemary Martin, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, advises the Committee on corporate governance guidelines and is Secretary to the Committee.\n\nExternal advisers\n\nThe Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. The appointed advisers, Willis Towers Watson, were selected following a thorough process led by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee at the time and were appointed by the Committee in 2007. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee has direct access to the advisers as and when required, and the Committee determines the protocols by which the advisers interact with management in support of the Committee. The advice and recommendations of the external advisers are used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Committee member. Advisers attend Committee meetings occasionally, as and when required by the Committee.\n\nWillis Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants\u2019 Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Remuneration Consultants\u2019 Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. This is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. Willis Towers Watson has confirmed that it adheres to that Code of Conduct throughout the year for all remuneration services provided to Vodafone and therefore the Committee is satisfied that it is independent and objective. The Remuneration Consultants\u2019 Group Code of Conduct is available at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.\n\nAdviser Appointed by Services provided to the Committee Fees for services provided to the Committee \u00a3\u2019000 Other services provided to the Company\n\n| Adviser | Appointed by | Services provided to the Committee | Fees for services provided to the Committee \u00a3\u2019000 | Other services provided to the Company |\n|---------|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Willis Towers Watson Remuneration Committee in 2007 | Advice on market practice; governance; provision of market data on executive reward; reward consultancy; advice specific to remuneration matters in the context of COVID-19; and performance analysis. | \u00a3158 | Reward and benefits consultancy; provision of benchmark data; outsourced pension administration; and insurance consultancy services. |\n\nNote:\n1.

In addition, informal conference calls can also take place. The principal agenda items at the formal meetings were as follows:\n\n| Meeting | Agenda items |\n|---------|--------------|\n| May 2020 | \u2013 2020 annual bonus achievement and 2021 targets/ranges  \n\u2013 2018 long-term incentive award vesting and 2021 targets/ranges  \n\u2013 External market update  \n\u2013 2020 Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report |\n| July 2020 | \u2013 2020 AGM update  \n\u2013 Vantage Towers update |\n| November 2020 | \u2013 2021 long-term incentive award grant  \n\u2013 Share plan update |\n| January 2021 | \u2013 Share plan update  \n\u2013 Gender Pay Gap reporting |\n| March 2021 | \u2013 Risk assessment of incentive plans  \n\u2013 2022 short-term incentive structure  \n\u2013 Remuneration arrangements across Vodafone  \n\u2013 Committee\u2019s terms of reference  \n\u2013 Chairman and Non-Executive Director fee levels  \n\u2013 2022 reward packages for the Executive Committee  \n\u2013 Remuneration Committee performance review  \n\u2013 2021 Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report |\n2021 remuneration\n\nIn this section we summarise the pay packages awarded to our Executive Directors for performance in the 2021 financial year versus 2020. Specifically we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total remuneration figure for the year. The value of the annual bonus (GSTIP) reflects what was earned in respect of the year but will be paid out in cash in the following year. Similarly the value of the long-term incentive (GLTI) reflects the share awards which will vest in June 2021 as a result of the performance through the three-year period ended at the completion of our financial year on 31 March 2021.\n\nConsideration of the use of discretion\n\nThe Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate. If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting downwards.\n\nThe Committee reviewed incentive outcomes at the May 2021 meeting and determined them to be appropriate in light of business performance across the relevant performance periods. The Committee agreed that the business had remained resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic, noting how the business had responded in an agile and effective manner during the year under review. In particular the Committee noted that no employees had been furloughed (either in the year under review, or the prior year), the business was continuing to maintain a dividend, and wider employee pay reviews, including the delivery of performance-related pay, had been carried out in both years of the pandemic. It was subsequently agreed that no adjustments were required to either the short-term or long-term incentive outcomes this year.\n\nTotal remuneration for the 2021 financial year (audited)\n\n|                      | 2021 \u00a3\u2019000 | 2020 \u00a3\u2019000 | 2021 \u00a3\u2019000 | 2020 \u00a3\u2019000 |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Salary/fees          | 1,050      | 1,050      | 700        | 700        |\n| Taxable benefits1    | 32         | 42         | 21         | 22         |\n| Annual bonus: GSTIP  | 1,301      | 1,090      | 867        | 727        |\n| GLTI awards3         | 1,126      | 1,241      | 686        | 257        |\n| GLTI dividends4      | 952        | 995        | 580        | 218        |\n| Pension/cash in lieu of pension | 105 | 105 | 70 | 70 |\n| Other5               | 1          | 1          | \u2013          | \u2013          |\n| **Total**            | **3,615**  | **3,529**  | **2,344**  | **1,776**  |\n| **Total Fixed Remuneration** | 1,188 | 1,198 | 791 | 792 |\n| **Total Variable Remuneration** | 2,427 | 2,331 | 1,553 | 984 |\n\nNotes:\n1.

The share prices used for both the 2021 and 2020 values, as set out in note 3 below, are lower than the grant prices for both respective awards. As such no amount of the values shown in either column are attributable to share price appreciation during the performance or vesting periods.\n3. The value shown in the 2020 column is the award which vested on 4 August 2020 in respect of Nick Read and 26 June 2020 in respect of Margherita Della Valle, and is valued using the respective execution share prices on 4 August 2020 of 118.02 pence and on 26 June 2020 of 127.28 pence. The value shown in the 2020 column for Margherita Della Valle reflects the vesting of a share award granted in June 2017 prior to her appointment to the Board. The value shown in the 2021 column is the award which vests on 26 June 2021 and is valued using an average closing share price over the last quarter of the 2021 financial year of 129.73 pence.\n4. Nick Read and Margherita Della Valle receive a cash award equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period on any shares that vest. The dividend value shown in 2021 relates to awards vesting on 26 June 2021. The value in the 2020 column for Margherita Della Valle reflects the value of dividend equivalent shares accrued during the performance period in respect of the award which vested on 26 June 2020 (which was granted prior to her appointment to the Board).\n5.

These figures are adjusted for the impact of IAS foreign exchange movements and any changes in accounting treatment.\nAnnual Report on Remuneration (continued)\n\nFinancial metrics\nAs set out in the table above, free cash flow and EBIT finished above the midpoints of the respective target ranges reflecting strong performance in markets including Germany, Spain, Turkey and South Africa.\n\nCustomer appreciation KPIs\nAn assessment of performance under the customer appreciation KPIs measure was conducted on a market by market basis. Each market was assessed against a number of different metrics which included:\n\n- Churn is defined as total gross customer disconnections in the period divided by the average total customers in the period.\n- Revenue market share is based on our total service revenue and that of our competitors in the markets we operate in.\n- Net Promoter Score (NPS) for both Consumer and Vodafone Business \u2013 defined as the extent to which our customers would recommend us.\n\nAll measures utilise data from our local markets which is collected and validated for quality and consistency by independent third-party agencies where possible.\n\nOur overall customer appreciation KPI outcome reflects good performance during the year including in a number of our largest markets (most notably Germany and the UK). Further details on performance against each key metric are set out below. The Committee agreed that a final payout slightly above the mid-point of the target range was appropriate for this measure.\n\nIn respect of churn, the business recorded very strong Group results with year-on-year underlying performance also showing an improvement. Such improvement was primarily driven by strong performance in Germany and the UK. Italy and Spain also finished the year off well despite increased competition in these markets.\n\nRevenue market share in our four largest European markets improved slightly during the year with the increases recorded in Germany and the UK offset by less favourable performance in Spain and Italy. The gap to the market leader reduced in all four of these markets, with the UK also improving its position to joint second. Our market position in Germany and Spain remained stable whilst our position in Italy fell.\n\nElsewhere in the business, performance was mixed with a number of markets gaining market share and reducing the gap to the leader (with Portugal improving in both of these areas) albeit a number of others, including Turkey, recording a fall in market share and a widening in the gap to the market leader. Market position across these operations remained stable with the exception of Romania where we improved our position to second.\n\nConsumer NPS performance during the year saw us becoming the new market leader or co-leader in Germany and Italy, with the UK also moving into second place in the market for the first time. In Turkey we closed the gap to our competitors (albeit in the context of declining NPS scores across all local competitors) whilst in South Africa increased pressure saw us move from outright leader to co-leader in this market.\n\nBusiness NPS performance remained strong during the year and we continue to hold leadership or co-leadership positions in the large majority of our markets including Italy, Spain and South Africa. In Spain we became the market leader for the first time in four years following a significant improvement against our competition, whilst in Germany and Turkey we retained second place whilst also reducing the gap to our competitors. During the year the UK lost its co-leadership position in what is an extremely close and competitive market.\n\nIt is within this context that overall performance against our customer appreciation KPIs metrics during the year was judged to be above the mid-point of the target range. The aggregated performance for the Group is calculated on a revenue-weighted average to give an overall achievement. The overall Group achievement for the year was 60.4% which reflects consistently good performance across our largest markets in both Europe and Africa.\n\nOverall outcome\n\n| 2021 annual bonus (GSTIP) amounts | Base salary \u00a3\u2019000 | Maximum bonus % of base salary | 2021 payout % of maximum | Actual payment \u00a3\u2019000 |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Nick Read                         | 1,050            | 200%                          | 62.0%                    | 1,301                |\n| Margherita Della Valle            | 700              | 200%                          | 62.0%                    | 867                  |\n\nIn line with our shareholder approved Remuneration Policy, as Margherita Della Valle is still building towards her shareholding requirement 25% of her post-tax bonus will be deferred into shares for two years. Further details on shareholding requirements can be found on pages 94 and 95.\n\nLong-term incentive (GLTI) award vesting in June 2021 (audited)\n\nVesting outcome\nThe 2019 long-term incentive (GLTI) awards which were made to executives in June 2018 will vest at 22.4% of maximum in June 2021. The performance conditions for the three-year period ending in the 2021 financial year are as follows:\n\n| Adjusted FCF performance \u2013 2/3 of total award | TSR outperformance \u2013 1/3 of total award |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold <15.15                        | Below threshold Below median            |\n| Threshold 15.15                               | Threshold Median                       |\n| Maximum 18.85                                 | Maximum 100% p.a.                      |\n\n| TSR peer group | Bharti | Orange | BT Group | Royal KPN | Deutsche Telekom | Telecom Italia | Liberty Global | Telef\u00f3nica | MTN |\n|----------------|--------|--------|----------|-----------|------------------|---------------|----------------|------------|-----|\n\nGovernance Financials Other information\nThe adjusted free cash flow for the three-year period ended on 31 March 2021 was \u20ac16.5 billion and equates to vesting under the FCF element of 33.6% of maximum.\n\nThe chart to the right shows that our TSR performance over the three-year period ended on 31 March 2021 was below that of the median of our comparator group resulting in no vesting under the TSR element.\n\nWhen the weighting of each condition is applied to the respective performance outcomes, this results in a calculated payout of 22.4% of overall maximum.\n\nThe vesting impact of this outcome when applied to the number of shares granted is set out in the table below.\n\n| 2019 GLTI share awards subject to performance conditions vesting in June 2021 | Maximum number of shares | Adjusted free cash flow performance payout % of maximum | Relative TSR performance payout % of maximum | Weighted performance payout % of maximum | Number of shares vesting | Value of shares vesting (\u00a3'000) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Nick Read | 3,278,043 | 33.6% | 0.0% | 22.4% | 733,953 | \u00a3952 |\n| Margherita Della Valle | 1,995,330 | 33.6% | 0.0% | 22.4% | 446,754 | \u00a3580 |\n\nSpecified procedures are performed by our internal audit team over the adjusted free cash flow to assist with the Committee\u2019s assessment of performance. The performance assessment in respect of the TSR measure is undertaken by Willis Towers Watson. Details of how the plan works can be found in the Remuneration Policy.\n\n**Long-term incentive (\u2018GLTI\u2019) awarded during the year (audited)**\n\nAs set out in last year\u2019s Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report, due to the exceptional market conditions created by COVID-19, the Committee agreed to delay the grant of the 2021 award, including any decision on the exact weightings of the performance measures, until November 2020.\n\nThe Committee met shortly prior to the grant to agree the details of the November 2020 award. During its discussion the Committee agreed that the business had continued to show resilience despite COVID-19 as illustrated through how no employees had been furloughed, the business had continued to pay a dividend and the share price was stable.\n\nThe Committee therefore agreed it was appropriate to grant the 2021 award in line with what had been communicated as the normal policy approach and approved by shareholders as part of the Policy Report at the July 2020 AGM. This included balancing the performance conditions in line with the expected normal weightings (as set out below), granting awards in line with the newly reduced maximum opportunity levels for both Executive Directors, and calculating awards using the closing share price of the day immediately prior to grant, as per the Committee\u2019s normal approach.\n\nThe independent performance conditions for the 2021 long-term incentive awards made in November 2020, and subject to a three-year performance period ending 31 March 2023, are adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award) and ESG (10% of total award) performance as follows:\n\n| Adjusted FCF performance (60% of total award) | Adjusted FCF performance (60%) | Vesting percentage (% of FCF element) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Below threshold | <14.70 | 0% |\n| Threshold | 14.70 | 20% |\n| Maximum | 16.70 | 100% |\n\n| TSR performance (30% of total award) | TSR performance (30%) | Vesting percentage (% of TSR element) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Below threshold | Below median | 0% |\n| Threshold | Median | 20% |\n| Maximum | 8.50% p.a.

Face value calculated based on the closing share price on 29 November 2020 (day immediately preceding the date of grant) of 124.9 pence.\n\nDividend equivalents on the shares that vest are paid in cash after the vesting date.\n\nOutstanding awards\nThe structure for awards made in June 2019 (vesting June 2022) and November 2020 (vesting August 2023) is set out on the previous page. Further details on the structure of these awards, and relevant targets, can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration of the relevant year.\n\nAll-employee share plans\nDuring the year the Executive Directors were eligible to participate in the Vodafone Group Sharesave Plan which is open to all UK employees.\n\nThe Vodafone Sharesave Plan is an HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved scheme open to all staff permanently employed by a Vodafone company in the UK as of the eligibility date. Options under the plan are granted at up to a 20% discount to market value. Executive Directors\u2019 participation is included in the option table on page 96.\n\nPensions (audited)\nDuring the 2021 financial year Nick Read received a cash allowance of 10% of base salary. Margherita Della Valle accrued benefits under the defined contribution pension plan of \u00a33,999.96 with the remainder of her 10% of base salary pension benefit for the year delivered as a cash allowance.\n\nNick Read is a deferred member of the Vodafone Group Pension Scheme which closed to future accrual in 2010 before he was an Executive Director. Margherita Della Valle has not participated in a Vodafone sponsored defined benefit scheme during her employment.\n\nThe Executive Directors are provided benefits in the event of death in service. In the event of ill health, an entitlement to benefit of 2/3 of base salary, up to a maximum benefit determined by the insurer, may be provided up until State Pension Age. In respect of the Executive Committee members, the Group has made aggregate contributions of \u00a3194,955 (2020: \u00a3273,771) into defined contribution pension schemes.\n\nAlignment to shareholder interests (audited)\nCurrent levels of ownership by the Executive Directors, and the date by which the goal should be or should have been achieved, are shown below.\n\nBased on a share price of 129.73 pence, Nick Read is currently above, and Margherita Della Valle currently below, the respective shareholding requirement. As shown in the charts below, both Executive Directors increased their shareholding levels during the year. Margherita Della Valle joined the Board on 27 July 2018 and will continue to work towards achieving her goal prior to July 2023.\n\n| Nick Read | Margherita Della Valle |\n|---|---|\n| Actual holding (number of shares) | Actual holding (number of shares) |\n| Goal Deadline: July 2023 | Goal Deadline: July 2023 |\n| Holding scenario (% of salary) | Holding scenario (% of salary) |\n| 25% increase | 43% increase |\n| 3.5m | 1.0m |\n| 4.4m | 1.5m |\n| 500% | 400% |\n| 545% | 275% |\n| 654% | 330% |\n| 31/03 2021 | 31/03 2020 |\n| 31/03 2021 | 31/03 2020 |\n| Illustrative 20% SP increase | Illustrative 20% SP decrease |\n| 20% SP increase | 20% SP decrease |\n| 25% increase | 43% increase |\n| 3.5m | 1.0m |\n| 4.4m | 1.5m |\n| 500% | 400% |\n| 545% | 275% |\n| 654% | 330% |\n| 31/03 2021 | 31/03 2020 |\n| 31/03 2021 | 31/03 2020 |\nThe shareholding requirements include a post employment condition whereby the Executive Directors will need to continue to hold shares equivalent to the value of their requirement at the date of departure (or actual holding on departure if the requirement has not been reached during employment) for a further two years post employment. The Committee has a number of processes in place to ensure this condition is met, including executives agreeing to these terms prior to receiving an award, executives holding the majority of their shares (and at least up to the value of their requirement) in a nominee rather than a personal account, and the Committee having the ability to lapse any unvested GLTI awards if the condition is not met.\n\nCollectively the Executive Committee including the Executive Directors owned 24,478,674 Vodafone shares at 31 March 2021, with a value of over \u00a331.7 million. None of the Executive Committee members\u2019 shareholdings amounts to more than 1% of the issued shares in that class of share, excluding treasury shares.\n\n**Directors\u2019 interests in the shares of the Company (audited)**\n\nA summary of interests in shares and scheme interests of the Directors who served during the year is given below. More details of the outstanding shares subject to award and options are set out in the table below and on page 96.\n\n| Executive Directors | Total number of interests in shares (at maximum) | Unvested with performance conditions (at target) | Unvested with performance conditions (at maximum) | SAYE (unvested without performance conditions) |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Nick Read           | 15,791,982                                    | 5,386,288                                     | 11,369,041                                    | 13,292                                        |\n| Margherita Della Valle | 8,368,355                                    | 3,257,896                                     | 6,883,734                                     | \u2014                                             |\n| **Total**           | **24,160,337**                                | **8,646,184**                                 | **18,252,775**                                | **13,292**                                    |\n\nNote:\n1.

During the year the Committee was informed that Vittorio Colao (who retired from the Board on 30 September 2018) had been appointed as Minister for Technological Innovation and Digital Transition within the Italian government. In order to avoid any conflicts of interest, Mr Colao was required to sell his shareholding in Vodafone Group Plc. This included 122,075 vested shares due to be released on 1 July 2021 and a further 141,799 vested shares due to be released on 4 August 2022. In light of the circumstances, the Committee agreed to release these shares from their respective holding periods early in order to allow Mr Colao to meet the compliance requirements of his new role.\n\n| Non-Executive Directors | Total number of interests in shares |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Sanjiv Ahuja             | 14,000 (ADR)\u00b3                     |\n| Sir Crispin Davis       | 34,500                            |\n| Michel Demar\u00e9           | 100,000                           |\n| Dame Clara Furse         | 75,000                            |\n| Valerie Gooding         | 28,970                            |\n| Renee James             | 27,272                            |\n| Gerard Kleisterlee (position at retirement) | 220,000 |\n| Maria Amparo Moraleda Martinez | 30,000 |\n| David Nish              | 107,018                           |\n| David Thodey (position at retirement) | 303,653 |\n| Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer\u00b2 | \u2014                                |\n\nNotes:\n1.

Salary/fees for 2020 include an additional allowance of \u00a36,000 per meeting for Directors based outside of Europe.\nPay in the wider context\n\nFair pay at Vodafone\n\nAs part of its review of executive remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes account of the pay policies in place across the wider business. This includes considering the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business to ensure there is a strong rationale for how packages evolve across the different levels of the organisation.\n\nDuring the year the Committee was updated on how a revised remuneration structure had been implemented across the business to ensure arrangements fully aligned with our strategy, supported our purpose, and celebrated our spirit. The update also set out the growing use of our digital recognition tools across the business including our peer to peer \u2018Thank You\u2019 awards and instant \u2018Vodafone Star\u2019 cash awards \u2013 the latter of which are primarily focused on rewarding our non-management colleagues. The Committee was also updated on the results of the latest annual fair pay review, including where the key focus areas were and what actions had been agreed locally to implement any required adjustments. In addition to being a core principle of the Committee, there is a clear culture in our business of ensuring we offer competitive and fair pay to all employees. Our approach, across our business, is guided by the following six principles:\n\n1. Market competitive\n   The pay of our people is reflective of their skills, role and function and the external market.\n   We annually review the pay of each employee and actively manage any who fall below the market competitive range.\n\n2. Free from discrimination\n   Our pay should not be affected by gender, age, disability, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, cultural heritage or belief.\n   We annually compare the average position of our men and women against their market benchmark, grade and function to identify and understand any differences, and take action if necessary.\n\n3. Ensure a good standard of living\n   We work with the independent organisation, the Fair Wage Network, to assess how our pay compares to the \u201cliving wage\u201d in each of our markets because we are committed to providing a good standard of living for our people and their family.\n\n4. Share in our successes\n   All our people should have the opportunity to share in our success by being eligible to receive some form of performance related pay, e.g. a bonus, shares or sales incentive.\n\n5. Provide benefits for all\n   Our global standards to offer all our people life insurance, parental leave and access to either Company or state provided healthcare and pension provision.\n\n6. Open and transparent\n   We ensure that our people understand their pay. We do this through a series of user-friendly guides, webpages and an annual reward statement, which help explain our peoples\u2019 pay and outline the value of their core reward package.\n   In addition, they also receive monthly or weekly payslips and a payment schedule.\n\nClick to read more about Fair Pay at Vodafone:\n\nvodafone.com/fair-pay\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\nThe Committee considers all stakeholder groups when setting executive pay including:\n\nColleagues\nThe Committee is fully briefed on pay arrangements across the business to ensure any decisions on executive pay are made within our wider business context. We engage with our employees through a variety of means including employee forums, town hall meetings (including with our executives), global Spirit Beat surveys and digital platforms \u2013 all of which give our people the chance to voice their opinion on any area of interest \u2013 including executive pay.\n\nShareholders\nThe Committee values the active participation of our shareholders during our consultations and fully considers all feedback as part of the review process. Last year we started our consultation in November 2019 (for the July 2020 AGM) to ensure all parties had adequate time for engagement.\n\nGovernment\nThe Committee actively engages with external professional bodies/government departments when they issue consultations on proposed changes to legislation/reporting guidelines.\n\nWider society\nThe Committee is fully aware that society has grown increasingly concerned about executive pay in the wider market. The Committee believes that through transparent reporting and active engagement in explaining both the operation of, and rationale for, executive pay decisions, trust in this area can be rebuilt.\nUK Gender Pay Gap reporting\n\nEach year we publish our UK Gender Pay Gap in line with the statutory UK methodology. The nature of the statutory calculation means the gap will fluctuate year on year, influenced by changes in our business structure, Company performance and the percentage of men and women at all levels and positions. The existence of a UK gender pay gap in our business is primarily a consequence of more men than women holding senior or specialist, and therefore higher-paid, roles.\n\nWith our commitment to embed an inclusive culture, we continue our work to reduce the gap and have made good progress since the publication of the first report in 2017. Our global programmes aim to support all women across different roles, areas, and geographies of our business and will, over time, reduce our specific UK Gender Pay Gap (which this year was calculated as 12.0% \u2013 a slight increase from our 2019 figure of 10.9% but below our 2018 figure of 16.1%). While we have made progress, we are committed to doing more.\n\nClick to learn more about our initiatives, case studies, and key statistics on our dedicated UK Gender Pay Gap webpage at vodafone.com/uk-gender-pay-gap\n\nRelative spend on pay\n\nThe chart below shows both the dividends distributed in the year and the total cost of remuneration in the Group.\n\nFor more details on dividends and expenditure on remuneration for all employees, please see pages 152 and 184 respectively.\n\n\u20acm\n\nCEO pay ratio\n\nThe following table sets out our CEO pay ratio figures in respect of 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| Year | CEO single figure | Method | 25th percentile pay ratio | Median pay ratio | 75th percentile pay ratio |\n|------|------------------|--------|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| 2021 | \u00a33,615k          | Option B | 108:1                    | 88.1            | 421                      |\n| 2020 | \u00a33,529k          | Option B | 113.1                    | 69.1            | 45.1                     |\n| 2019 | \u00a34,359k          | Option B | 154:1                    | 107.1           | 56.1                     |\n\nNote:\n1. The CEO single figure used in the calculation of the 2019 ratios reflects a blended figure for Vittorio Colao and Nick Read, recognising the change in incumbency for the role during this year.\n\nThe pay ratio figures in the above table are calculated using the following total pay and benefits information:\n\n| Year | Supporting information | 25th percentile pay ratio | Median pay ratio | 75th percentile pay ratio |\n|------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| 2021 | Salary                 | \u00a330.0k                   | \u00a337.1k          | \u00a371.2k                   |\n|      | Total pay and benefits | \u00a333.5k                   | \u00a341.0k          | \u00a385.3k                   |\n| 2020 | Salary                 | \u00a328.0k                   | \u00a342.8k          | \u00a365.0k                   |\n|      | Total pay and benefits | \u00a331.3k                   | \u00a351.1k          | \u00a378.6k                   |\n| 2019 | Salary                 | \u00a323.1k                   | \u00a336.4k          | \u00a365.0k                   |\n|      | Total pay and benefits | \u00a328.3k                   | \u00a340.8k          | \u00a378.2k                   |\n\nThe calculation methodology used reflects Option B as defined under the relevant regulations. In line with the relevant regulations this utilises the most recently collected and disclosed data analysed within our Gender Pay Gap report, with employees at the three quartiles identified from this analysis and their respective single figure values calculated.\n\nTo ensure this data accurately reflects individuals at such quartiles, the single figure values for individuals immediately above and below the identified employee at each quartile within the Gender Pay Gap analysis were also reviewed.\n\nThis year our ratios have remained relatively stable when viewed on a year-on-year basis. This reflects how the single figures for both the Chief Executive and employees at the quartile positions have remained consistent when viewed over the period set out in the table above. We expect the ratios to be primarily driven by the valuation of the long-term incentive that is included in the Chief Executive\u2019s single figure for the year.\nChange in remuneration for Directors and all employees between 2020 and 2021\n\nIn line with the new regulatory requirements, the table below calculates the percentage change in Directors\u2019 remuneration (salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus payment) between the 2020 and 2021 financial years compared to the average remuneration for other Vodafone Group employees who are measured on comparable business objectives and who have been employed in the UK since 2021 (per capita). Vodafone has employees based all around the world and some of these individuals work in countries with very high inflation; therefore a comparison to Vodafone\u2019s UK-based Group employees is deemed the most appropriate employee group for this comparison.\n\n| Executive Directors | Percentage change from 2020 to 2021 |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Nick Read           | 0.0% -23.8% 19.4%                   |\n| Margherita Della Valle | 0.0% -4.5% 19.3%                   |\n\n| Non-Executive Directors | Percentage change from 2020 to 2021 |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer (appointed 28 July 2020) | -- -- -- |\n| Valerie Gooding         | 0.0% -100.0% -- |\n| Sanjiv Ahuja             | 0.0% -66.7% -- |\n| Sir Crispin Davis       | 0.0% -95.7% -- |\n| Michel Demar\u00e9           | 0.0% -100.0% -- |\n| Dame Clara Furse         | 0.0% -100.0% -- |\n| Renee James             | -13.5% -100.0% -- |\n| Maria Amparo Moraleda Martinez | 0.0% -100.0% -- |\n| David Nish              | 0.0% -96.8% -- |\n\n| Former Non-Executive Directors | Percentage change from 2020 to 2021 |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| David Thodey (stepped down 27 July 2020) | -43.3% -100.0% -- |\n| Gerard Kleisterlee (stepped down 3 November 2020) | -40.8% -92.5% -- |\n\n| Other Vodafone Group employees employed in the UK | Percentage change from 2020 to 2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 3.8%                                            | 0.2% 30.2% |\nAssessing pay and performance\n\nIn the table below we summarise the Chief Executive\u2019s single figure remuneration over the past 10 years, as well as how our variable pay plans have paid out in relation to the maximum opportunity. This can be compared with the historic TSR performance over the same period. The chart below shows the performance of the Company relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Index over a 10-year period. The STOXX Europe 600 Index was selected as this is a broad-based index that includes many of our closest competitors. It should be noted that the TSR element of the 2019 GLTI is based on the TSR performance shown in the chart on page 93 and not this chart.\n\n### 10-year historical TSR performance\n\nGrowth in the value of a hypothetical \u20ac100 holding over 10 years\n\n| Year | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Vodafone Group | 100 | 112 | 127 | 155 | 196 | 182 | 171 | 171 | 181 | 159 | 137 |\n| STOXX Europe 600 index | 99 | 115 | 135 | 166 | 146 | 168 | 162 | 128 | 106 | 106 | 106 |\n\n### Financial year remuneration for Chief Executive\n\n| Year | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Single figure of total remuneration \u00a3\u2019000 | 15,767 | 11,099 | 8,014 | 2,810 | 5,224 | 6,332 | 7,389 | 2,740 | 3,529 | 3,615 |\n| Annual bonus (actual award versus max opportunity) | 47% | 33% | 44% | 56% | 58% | 47% | 64% | 44% | 52% | 62% |\n| Long-term incentive (vesting versus max opportunity) | 100% | 57% | 37% | 0% | 23% | 44% | 67% | 40% | 50% | 22% |\n\nNotes:\n1.

This included a detailed discussion on the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business and how pay at these levels is determined. The Committee also considered the wider external context in light of the developing COVID-19 situation, and the commitments made to our wider employee population.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these discussions was that the Committee was able to make decisions in respect of executive remuneration within the context of how, and appreciating the rationale for why, remuneration arrangements evolve across the different levels within the organisation.\n\n2022 Base salaries\n\nIn March 2021 the Committee reviewed executive remuneration arrangements against the following comparator groups:\n\n1. A EuroTop peer group constituting the top 50 European companies (excluding financial services companies) and a few other select companies relevant to the telco sector; and\n2. The FTSE 30 (excluding financial services companies).\n\nAs set out on page 82 in the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman, neither the Chief Executive nor the Chief Financial Officer have received a salary increase since their appointment to their current roles in 2018. In the light of their strong performance and growing experience in role the Committee agreed an increase would be justified. However, in line with the restraint on salary increases for the wider leadership team, the Committee felt that salaries for both Executive Directors should remain unchanged for the year ahead at the current levels of:\n\n- Chief Executive: Nick Read \u00a31,050,000; and\n- Chief Financial Officer: Margherita Della Valle \u00a3700,000.\n\nThe Committee acknowledges the importance of our arrangements remaining fair and competitive and will review this situation again next year.\n\nThe Committee further determined that salaries for Executive Committee members will also remain unchanged.\n\nPension\n\nPension arrangements for both the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer will remain unchanged at 10% of salary, in line with the maximum employer contribution level for the wider UK population.\n\n2022 Annual Bonus (GSTIP)\n\nIn light of the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and the subsequent difficulty to set an accurate one-year service revenue target for the 2021 financial year, the decision was taken to remove the service revenue condition from the 2021 plan and retain the remaining three measures.\n\nAs set out on page 82 of the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman, for the 2022 plan the Committee has agreed to re-introduce service revenue given the strategic importance of growth to our business and our ability to now accurately forecast an appropriate target.\n\nThe performance measures and weightings for 2022, are outlined below:\n\n- service revenue (25%);\n- adjusted EBIT (25%);\n- adjusted free cash flow (25%); and\n- customer appreciation KPIs (25%). This includes an assessment of churn, revenue market share and Net Promoter Score1 (NPS).\n\nNote:\n1. The assessment of NPS utilises data collected in our local markets which is validated for quality and consistency by independent third party agencies.\n\nDue to the potential impact on our commercial interests, annual bonus targets are considered commercially sensitive and therefore will be disclosed in the 2022 Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year.\n\nLong-term incentive (GLTI) awards for 2022\n\nAwards for 2022 will be made in line with the arrangements described in our policy on pages 86 and 87. Vesting of the 2022 award will be subject to adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award), and ESG (10% of total award) performance. Performance will be measured over the three financial years ending 31 March 2024, and any net vested shares will be subject to an additional two-year holding period (i.e. the \u20183+2\u2019 model). It is anticipated that the final awards will be reviewed by the Committee at the July 2021 meeting and, subject to the Committee\u2019s approval, will be granted shortly after in August 2021.\nFurther details for the 2022 award targets are provided below.\n\n**Adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award)**\n\nDetails of the three-year adjusted FCF target for the 2022 award are set out in the table below.\n\n| Adjusted FCF performance (% of total award) | Adjusted FCF performance (\u20acbn) | Vesting percentage (% of FCF element) |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold                            | <15.00                        | 0%                                   |\n| Threshold                                  | 15.00                         | 20%                                  |\n| Maximum                                    | 17.00                         | 100%                                 |\n\n**Relative TSR (30% of total award)**\n\nFollowing the annual review of the performance measures which included a review of analysis provided by the Committee\u2019s external advisers, the Committee determined that the TSR outperformance range for the 2022 award should continue to be set at the 80th percentile equivalent for maximum performance. For the 2022 award, this equates to outperformance of 8.50% p.a. at maximum.\n\nThe Committee further determined that the TSR peer group should remain unchanged for the 2022 award. Further details are set out in the tables below.\n\n| Relative TSR (30% of total award) | TSR outperformance | Vesting (% of relative TSR element) |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold                  | Below median       | 0.0%                                |\n| Threshold                        | Median             | 20.0%                               |\n| Maximum                          | 8.50% p.a. (80th percentile equivalent) | 100.0% |\n\n**TSR peer group**\n\n- BT Group\n- Deutsche Telekom\n- Liberty Global\n- MTN\n- Orange\n- Royal KPN\n- Telecom Italia\n- Telef\u00f3nica\n- Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland\n\nLinear interpolation (i.e. straight-line vesting) occurs for performance between threshold and maximum.\n\n**ESG (10% of total award)**\n\nThe table below sets out how performance under the ESG measure for the 2022 award will be assessed against three quantitative ambitions:\n\n| Purpose pillar | Metric for 2022 GLTI | Overall ambition | Baseline position for 2022 GLTI | Ambition for 2022 GLTI (10% of total award) |\n|----------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Planet         | Greenhouse gas reduction | 50% reduction from FY17 baseline by 2025 | 37% reduction from FY17 baseline at 31 March 2021 | 60% reduction from FY17 baseline by 31 March 2024 |\n| Inclusion for All | Female representation in management | 40% representation of women in management by 2030 | 32% representation of women in management at 31 March 2021 | 35% representation of women in management by 31 March 2024 |\n| Digital Society / Inclusion for All | M-Pesa connections | Connect >50m people and their families to mobile money by 2025 | 48.3m connections at 31 March 2021 | 68.2m connections by 31 March 2024 |\n\nEach ambition for the 2022 award has been set by considering both our externally communicated targets and our internal progress as at 31 March 2021. Where we are ahead of our originally communicated external ambition we have set our target recognising this so as to ensure all ambitions remain stretching against actual current performance.\n\nAt the end of the performance period the Committee will assess achievement across the three metrics against the stated ambitions and determine vesting under this element. Full disclosure of the rationale for the final vesting decision will be provided in the relevant Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report.\n2022 remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors\n\nFees for our Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have been benchmarked against the FTSE 30 (excluding financial services companies). Following this year\u2019s review it was agreed that no changes will be made to the current fee levels which are set out in the table below.\n\n| Position/Role                                                                 | Fee payable (\u00a3'000) |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Chairman\u00b9                                                                    | 650                 |\n| Non-Executive Director                                                       | 115                 |\n| Additional combined fee for Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee | 50                  |\n| Additional fee for Chairmanship of Audit and Risk Committee                   | 25                  |\n\nNote:\n1. The Chairman\u2019s fee also includes the fee for the Chairmanship of the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\nFor 2022 the allowance payable each time a non-Europe-based Non-Executive Director eligible for this legacy arrangement is required to travel to attend Board and Committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved is \u00a36,000.\n\nFurther remuneration information\n\nDilution\n\nAll awards are made under plans that incorporate dilution limits as set out in the guidelines for share incentive schemes published by the Investment Association. The current estimated dilution from subsisting executive awards is approximately 2.6% of the Company\u2019s share capital at 31 March 2021 (2.6% at 31 March 2020), whilst from all-employee share awards it is approximately 0.3% (0.3% at 31 March 2020). This gives a total dilution of 2.9% (2.9% at 31 March 2020).\n\nService contracts\n\nThe terms and conditions of appointment of our Directors are available for inspection at the Company\u2019s registered office during normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting). The Executive Directors have notice periods in their service contracts of 12 months. The Non-Executive Directors\u2019 letters of appointment do not contain provision for notice periods or for compensation if their appointments are terminated.\n\nThis report on remuneration has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by:\n\nValerie Gooding\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee\n18 May 2021\nOur US listing requirements\n\nAs Vodafone\u2019s American depositary shares are listed on NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (NASDAQ), we are required to disclose a summary of any material differences between the corporate governance practices we follow and those of US companies listed on NASDAQ. Vodafone\u2019s corporate governance practices are primarily based on UK requirements but substantially conform to those required of US companies listed on NASDAQ.\n\nThe material differences are set out in the following table:\n\n| Board member independence | Different tests of independence for Board members are applied under the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the \u2018Code\u2019) and the NASDAQ listing rules. The Board is not required to take into consideration NASDAQ\u2019s detailed definitions of independence as set out in the NASDAQ listing rules. The Board has carried out an assessment based on the independence requirements of the Code and has determined that, in its judgement, each of Vodafone\u2019s Non-Executive Directors is independent within the meaning of those requirements. |\n| Committees | The NASDAQ listing rules require US companies to have a nominations committee, an audit committee and a compensation committee, each composed entirely of independent directors, with the nominations committee and the audit committee each required to have a written charter which addresses the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, and the compensation committee having sole authority and adequate funding to engage compensation consultants, independent legal counsel and other compensation advisers. |\n| | \u2013 Our Nominations and Governance Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board and its other members are independent Non-Executive Directors. |\n| | \u2013 Our Remuneration Committee is composed entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors. |\n| | \u2013 Our Audit and Risk Committee is composed entirely of Non-Executive Directors, each of whom (i) the Board has determined to be independent based on the independence requirements of the Code and (ii) meets the independence requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. |\n| | \u2013 We have terms of reference for our Nominations and Governance Committee, Audit and Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee, each of which comply with the requirements of the Code and are available for inspection on our website at vodafone.com/governance. |\n| | \u2013 These terms of reference are generally responsive to the relevant NASDAQ listing rules, but may not address all aspects of these rules. |\n| Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct | Under the NASDAQ listing rules, US companies must adopt a Code of Conduct applicable to all directors, officers and employees that complies with the definition of a \u201ccode of ethics\u201d set out in section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. |\n| | \u2013 We have adopted a Code of Ethics that complies with section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable only to the senior financial and principal executive officers, and which is available on our website at vodafone.com/governance. |\n| | \u2013 We have also adopted a separate Code of Conduct which applies to all employees. |\n| Quorum | The quorum required for shareholder meetings, in accordance with our Articles of Association, is two shareholders, regardless of the level of their aggregate share ownership, while US companies listed on NASDAQ are required by the NASDAQ listing rules to have a minimum quorum of 33.33% of the shareholders of ordinary shares for shareholder meetings. |\n| Related party transactions | In lieu of obtaining an independent review of related party transactions for conflicts of interests in accordance with the NASDAQ listing rules, we seek shareholder approval for related party transactions that (i) meet certain financial thresholds or (ii) have unusual features in accordance with the Listing Rules issued by the FCA in the UK (the \u2018Listing Rules\u2019), the Companies Act 2006 and our Articles of Association. |\n| | Further, we use the definition of a transaction with a related party as set out in the Listing Rules, which differs in certain respects from the definition of related party transaction in the NASDAQ listing rules. |\n| Shareholder approval | When determining whether shareholder approval is required for a proposed transaction, we comply with both the NASDAQ listing rules and the Listing Rules. Under the NASDAQ listing rules, whether shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, among other things, the percentage of shares to be issued or sold in connection with the transaction. Under the Listing Rules, whether shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, among other things, whether the size of a transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the size of the listed company undertaking the transaction. |\nDirectors\u2019 report\n\nThe Directors of the Company present their report together with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with requirements outlined within The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and forms part of the management report as required under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.

Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate business risks and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. This is described in more detail in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 76 to 81.\n\nThe Board has implemented in full the FRC \u201cGuidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and related Financial and Business Reporting\u201d for the year and to the date of this Annual Report. The resulting procedures, which are subject to regular monitoring and review, provide an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Company\u2019s principal risks (which can be found on pages 53 to 61).\n\nCorporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Corporate Governance Statement setting out how the Company complies with the Code and which includes a description of the main features of our internal control and risk management arrangements in relation to the financial reporting process is set out on page 65.

Neither our indemnity nor the insurance provides cover in the event that a Director is proven to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently.\n\nDisclosures required under Listing Rule 9.8.4\n\nThe information on the amount of interest capitalised and the treatment of tax relief can be found in notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements respectively.

Detailed below are statements made by the Directors in relation to their responsibilities, disclosure of information to the Company\u2019s auditor, going concern and management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting.\n\nFinancial statements and accounting records\n\nCompany law of England and Wales requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements the Directors are required to:\n\n- select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;\n- make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;\n- state whether the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, International Financial Reporting Standards (\u2018IFRS\u2019) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\u2018IASB\u2019);\n- state for the Company\u2019s financial statements whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed; and\n- prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. They are also responsible for the system of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and, hence, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company\u2019s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nDirectors\u2019 responsibility statement\n\nEach of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 67 and 68, confirms that, to the best of his or her knowledge:\n\n- the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, International Financial Reporting Standards (\u2018IFRS\u2019) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\u2018IASB\u2019), give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group;\n- the parent company financial statements, prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company; and\n- the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description and robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\n\nThe Directors are also responsible under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole and in doing so have regard for the needs of wider society and stakeholders, including customers, consistent with the Group\u2019s core and sustainable business objectives.\n\nHaving taken advice from the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board considers the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company\u2019s position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nNeither the Company nor the Directors accepts any liability to any person in relation to the Annual Report except to the extent that such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person who has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading statement or omission shall be determined in accordance with section 90A and schedule 10A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.\n\nDisclosure of information to the auditors\n\nHaving made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company\u2019s auditor is unaware and the Directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company\u2019s auditor is aware of that information.\nGoing concern\n\nThe Group\u2019s business activities, performance, position, principal risks and uncertainties and the Directors\u2019 assessment of its long term viability are set out on page 61.\n\nIn addition, the funding position of the Group is included in \u201cBorrowings\u201d and \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d in notes 21 and 22, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements. Notes 21 and 22 include disclosure in relation to the Group\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing as well as details regarding its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. As noted on page 176, the Group has access to substantial cash and financing facilities.\n\nThe Group also believes it adequately manages or mitigates its solvency and liquidity risks through two primary processes, described below.\n\nBusiness planning process and performance management\n\nThe Group\u2019s forecasting and planning cycle consists of three in-year forecasts, a budget and a long-range plan. These generate income statement, cash flow and net debt projections for assessment by Group management and the Board. Each forecast is compared with prior forecasts and actual results so as to identify variances and understand the drivers of the changes and their future impact so as to allow management to take action where appropriate. Additional analysis is undertaken to review and sense check the key assumptions underpinning the forecasts.\n\nCash flow and liquidity reviews\n\nThe business planning process provides outputs for detailed cash flow and liquidity reviews, to ensure that the Group maintains adequate liquidity throughout the forecast periods. The prime output is a liquidity forecast which is prepared and updated at least on a monthly basis which highlights the extent of the Group\u2019s liquidity based on controlled cash flows and the headroom under the Group\u2019s undrawn revolving credit facility. The key inputs into this forecast are:\n\n- free cash flow forecasts with information taken from the business planning process;\n- bond and other debt maturities; and\n- expectations for shareholder returns, spectrum auctions and M&A activity.\n\nThe liquidity forecast is reviewed by the Group Chief Financial Officer and included in each of her reports to the Board. In addition, the Group continues to manage its foreign exchange and interest rate risks within the framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the Board, with oversight provided by the Treasury Risk Committee.\n\nThe Group\u2019s financial performance has been resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing impact has been considered as part of the business planning process and reflected in the Group\u2019s cash flow forecasts. The Directors have also considered sensitivities in respect of potential downside scenarios in concluding that the Group is able to continue in operation for the period to 30 June 2022 from the date of approving the consolidated financial statements. Those sensitivities include the non-refinancing of debt maturities in the assessment period and the repayment of the EIB loans which have covenants. A reverse stress test was also reviewed to understand how severe conditions would have to be to breach liquidity including the required reduction in EBITDA. In addition to the liquidity forecasts, downside scenarios and reverse stress test prepared, the Director\u2019s considered the availability of the Group\u2019s \u20ac7.4 billion revolving credit facilities, undrawn as at 31 March 2021.\n\nIn reaching their conclusion on the going concern assessment, the Directors also considered the findings of the work performed to support the statement on the long-term viability of the Group. As noted on page 61, this included key changes to relevant principal risks in light of global economic and political uncertainty, sensitivity analysis, scenario assessments, and combinations thereof, including that of a longer-term global recession post the COVID-19 pandemic over the viability assessment period.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the review, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and accounts.\n\nControls over financial reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Group.\n\nThe Group\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:\n\n- pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets;\n- are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and IFRS as issued by the IASB, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorisation of management and the Directors of the Company; and\n- provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Group\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nAny internal control framework, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures, and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nBy Order of the Board\n\nRosemary Martin\nGroup General Counsel and Company Secretary\n18 May 2021\nIndependent auditor\u2019s report to the members of Vodafone Group plc\n\nOpinion\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n\u2013 Vodafone Group Plc\u2019s Consolidated financial statements and Company financial statements (the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group\u2019s and of the Company\u2019s affairs as at 31 March 2021 and of the Group\u2019s profit for the year then ended;\n\n\u2013 the Consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union;\n\n\u2013 the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and\n\n\u2013 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of Vodafone Group Plc for the year ended 31 March 2021 which comprise:\n\nGroup\n\nConsolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2021\nConsolidated income statement for the year then ended\nConsolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended\nConsolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended\nConsolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended\nRelated notes 1 to 32 to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies\n\nCompany\n\nCompany statement of financial position as at 31 March 2021\nCompany statement of changes in equity for the year then ended\nRelated notes 1 to 11 to the financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies\n\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law, International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 \u201cReduced Disclosure Framework\u201d (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\n\nBasis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nConclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors\u2019 assessment of the Group and Company\u2019s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n\u2013 confirming our understanding of the directors\u2019 going concern assessment process, including the controls over the review and approval of the budget and long-range plan;\n\n\u2013 assessing the appropriateness of the duration of the going concern assessment period to 30 June 2022 and considering the existence of any significant events or conditions beyond this period based on our procedures on the Group\u2019s long-range plan and from knowledge arising from other areas of the audit;\n\n\u2013 verifying inputs against board-approved forecasts and debt facility terms and reconciled the opening liquidity position to the prior year end and half year interim going concern assessments;\n\n\u2013 reviewing borrowing facilities to confirm both their availability to the Group and the forecast debt repayments through the going concern assessment period and to validate that there is a financial covenant solely in relation to a single loan arrangement;\n\n\u2013 evaluating management\u2019s historical forecasting accuracy and the consistency of the going concern assessment with information obtained from other areas of the audit, such as our audit procedures on the long range plans which underpin management\u2019s goodwill impairment assessments;\n\n\u2013 testing the assessment, including forecast liquidity under base and downside scenarios, for clerical accuracy;\n\n\u2013 assessing whether assumptions made were reasonable and in the case of downside scenarios, appropriately severe, in light of the Group\u2019s relevant principal risks and uncertainties and our own independent assessment of those risks;\n\n\u2013 evaluated the amount and timing of identified mitigating actions available to respond to a severe downside scenario, and whether those actions are feasible and within the Group\u2019s control;\n\n\u2013 considering the appropriateness of management\u2019s \u2018reverse stress test\u2019 downside scenario, to understand how severe conditions would have to be to breach liquidity and whether the reduction in EBITDA required has no more than a remote possibility of occurring.\nAn overview of the scope of the Company and Group audits\n\nTailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Consolidated financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the Consolidated financial statements, of the 364 reporting components of the Group, we identified 21 components covering entities within Germany, South Africa, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain, Turkey, Greece, Romania, Egypt, Luxembourg and corporate entities which represent the principal business units within the Group.\n\nFull scope components \u2013 Of the 21 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 9 components (\u201cfull scope components\u201d) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.\n\nSpecified procedures components \u2013 For the remaining 12 components (\u201cspecified procedures components\u201d), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within those components that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the Group financial statements, either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile, in order to ensure that, at the overall Group level, we reduced and appropriately covered the residual risk of error. Depending on the component or type of procedures, these procedures were undertaken by the Primary audit team or separate component audit team.\n\nThe remaining 355 components where we did not perform full audit procedures together represent 24% of the Group\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA, none are individually greater than 5% of the Group\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nFor the remaining components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review at both the Group and individual component levels, inquiry of management, testing entity level controls, testing group wide controls and testing of journals across the Group to respond to potential risks of material misstatement to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIndependent auditor\u2019s report to the members of Vodafone Group plc (continued)\n\nThe table below illustrates the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.\n\n| Reporting components | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n|                      | Number | % of Group Adjusted EBITDA* | % of Group Revenue | Note | Number | % of Group Adjusted EBITDA* | % of Group Revenue |\n| Full scope           | 9     | 76% | 71% | 1,2,4 | 10     | 80% | 76% |\n| Specified procedures | 12    | 0%  | 8%  | 2,3,4 | 9      | 0%  | 5%  |\n| Full and specified procedures coverage | 21 | 76% | 79% | 19 | 80% | 81% |\n| Remaining components | 343   | 24% | 21% | 5,6,7 | 243   | 20% | 19% |\n| Total reporting components | 364 | 100% | 100% | 262 | 100% | 100% |\n\nNotes\n1. 2 of the 9 full scope components relate to the Company and another corporate entity whose activities include consolidation adjustments which are audited by the Primary audit team. Procedures on 3 of the other full scope locations are undertaken by component audit teams based in Germany and the remaining 4 full scope components are Italy, South Africa, Spain, and the UK.\n2. The Group audit risks in relation to revenue recognition were subject to audit procedures at each of the full and specified procedures scope locations with significant revenue streams (being 7 full scope components and 3 specific scope components).\n3. For the Turkey, Greece and Romania components, specified procedures were defined by the Group team in respect of Revenue, Cost of sales, Intangible assets, Property, Plant and Equipment, Trade receivables, Trade and other payables and Cash. For the Egypt component specified procedures were performed in respect of certain Intangible Assets and Cash. Specified procedures were also performed over Right of use assets and Lease liabilities within 2 components established in the year as part of the formation of Vantage Towers. The Primary Audit team also performed specified procedures over a further 6 Finance and corporate entities across a range of significant accounts. The audit procedures did not include testing of all significant accounts of the components but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts selected for testing by the Primary audit team, including those within Group Adjusted EBITDA.\n4. The Group audit risks in relation to Caming value of cash generating units, including goodwill and Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses \u2013 Luxembourg were subject to audit procedures by the Primary audit team on the entire balance, with support from component audit teams on certain procedures.\n5. The contribution of specified procedures components to Group Adjusted EBITDA is included within \u2018remaining components\u2019 as audit procedures were performed on certain, but not all, significant accounts of the specified procedures component contributing to Group Adjusted EBITDA.\n6. Included within the 364 reporting components are the Group\u2019s joint venture investments in Vodafone Ziggo and INWIT, and Safaricom, an associate, which were subject to review procedures.\n7. Changes in the number of \u2018remaining components\u2019 compared to prior year reflect increases in the number of entities within the Group\u2019s consolidation system.\n\n* Adjusted EBITDA as defined in Our application of materiality section of this report.\n\nChanges from the prior year\nThe approach to audit scoping is similar to the prior year audit with the rotation of a number of markets designated specified procedures scope for selected significant accounts to extend the Group audit procedures beyond the Group\u2019s main markets and to introduce a level of unpredictability through rotational testing. This approach resulted in:\n\n- a specified procedure scope being assigned to components in Romania, Greece and Egypt which were not subject to direct audit procedures in the prior year;\n- Turkey being reassessed as specified procedures in the current year (FY20: full scope); and\n- following the carve out of tower assets into Vantage Towers Group during the year we designated 2 components, Vantage Towers Germany and Vantage Towers Spain, as specified procedures scope in respect of the Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability balances.\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 audit logistics\n- Consistent with the prior year-end audit, the performance of the entire FY21 audit remotely at both component and Group locations was supported through remote user access to the Group\u2019s financial systems and the use of EY software collaboration platforms for the secure and timely delivery of requested audit evidence.\n- We were alert to instances requiring physical verification of original documents and we used secure encrypted data exchanges. In instances when physical access to site was restricted due to social distancing measures, we conducted inventory counts remotely using mobile video technology. There was no significant impact in the execution of our controls testing from the remote working environment.\n- We engaged with Vodafone throughout the audit, using video calls and share-screen functionality. Key meetings, such as closing meetings and Audit and Risk Committees, were performed via video conference calls.\n\nInvolvement with component audit teams\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the Primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the 9 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 2 of these directly by the Primary audit team, with the remaining 7 being performed by component audit teams. For 6 specified procedures scope components work was performed directly by the Primary audit team with the remaining 6 being performed by component audit teams. Where the work was performed by component audit teams we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.\n\nVodafone has centralised processes and controls over certain areas within its Vodafone Intelligent Solutions (\u201cVOIS\u201d) finance shared service centre locations. The Primary audit team provide direct oversight, review, and coordination of the EY audit teams at VOIS locations whose work includes centralised testing for certain controls and accounts, including specified procedures on revenue, leases, cash and centralised purchase to pay processes.\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 direction, supervision and review of component audit teams\nDue to the ongoing travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, no physical site visits were possible throughout the FY21 audit. We replaced the planned site visits with alternative procedures, including video conference call meetings and virtual reviews of our local audit teams\u2019 working papers. The Senior Statutory Auditor, and other members of the Primary Team, completed their reviews remotely for the component audit teams in Germany, Italy, Spain, South Africa, UK, Turkey, Greece, Romania, Egypt, Hungary and India.\nWe used our global audit software, screen sharing or the provision of copies of work papers direct to the Primary audit team, to enable the Senior Statutory Auditor, and other members of the Primary audit team, to complete reviews of key component audit team working papers, particularly focussing on the Group\u2019s risk areas. We conducted meetings using video conferencing to discuss the audit approach and execution with the component audit teams and to discuss audit issues arising from their work. The Senior Statutory Auditor, or other members of the Primary audit team, attended key meetings with local management via video conference, to discuss the component\u2019s business performance and matters relating to the local finance organisation including the internal financial control environment.\n\nThe Primary audit team interacted regularly with the local EY component audit teams during each stage of the audit and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. We maintained continuous and open dialogue with the component audit teams in addition to holding formal meetings to ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and the results of their procedures. Close meetings for full and specified procedures components were held via tele and video conference in April 2021 and were attended by the Senior Statutory Auditor and other members of the Primary audit team. These activities, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.\n\nBased upon the above approach we are satisfied that we have been able to perform sufficient and appropriate oversight of our component audit teams.\n\n**Key audit matters**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nIndependent auditor\u2019s report to the members of Vodafone Group plc (continued)\n\n**Risk**\n\n**Revenue recognition**\n\nAs more fully described in Note 2, Note 14 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group reported revenue of \u20ac43,809 million (FY20: \u20ac44,974 million), contract assets of \u20ac3,566 million (FY20: \u20ac3,563 million) and contract liabilities of \u20ac2,450 million (FY20: \u20ac2,603 million) at 31 March 2021. Management records revenue according to the principles of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, including following the 5-step model therein. Under IFRS 15, management must determine if there are separate performance obligations for the services and goods it provides to customers and assign values thereto, based on the selling prices of goods or services in separate transactions under similar conditions to similar customers (the \u201cstand-alone selling price\u201d).\n\nAuditing the revenue recorded by the Group is complex due to the multiple IT systems and tools utilised in the initiation, processing and recording of transactions, which includes a high volume of individually low monetary value transactions. Furthermore, judgement was required to determine the audit approach to evaluate the relevant data that was captured and aggregated, and to assess the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained. IT professionals were utilised in the design of the audit approach and testing of IT systems and automated processes.\n\n**Our response to the risk**\n\nWe performed full or specified audit procedures over this risk area in 7 full scope and 3 specified procedure components with significant revenue streams, which covered 79% of the Group\u2019s revenue.\n\nOur audit procedures at full scope component locations included, among others, obtaining an understanding of, evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls over the Group\u2019s revenue recognition process, which includes management\u2019s review of contracts, their identification of performance obligations, the estimation of the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation, and the determination of the timing of revenue recorded. We also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the processing of relevant billing data, assisted by our IT professionals. For specified procedures components, we obtained an understanding of the design of controls over the revenue recognition process and at certain locations tested operating effectiveness. Where there had been migrations of IT systems which support the revenue recognition process during the year, we tested controls over access and change management for the new IT systems.\n\nWe evaluated management\u2019s accounting policies and the methodology used by management to determine the standalone selling price, where relevant to the requirements of IFRS 15.\n\nFor significant revenue streams, our audit procedures included the following, on a sample basis:\n\n- We obtained a list of new propositions/tariff plans introduced during the period and tested the completeness of the listing. We evaluated management\u2019s assessment of the accounting treatment for new propositions/tariff plans for compliance with IFRS 15.\n\n- For each significant revenue stream, we obtained the billing data to general ledger reconciliation which included the relevant adjustments to deferred and accrued revenue balances. We reperformed these end-to-end reconciliations, including validating the accuracy of the data inputs to underlying source documentation including contractual agreements where applicable. In addition, we tested the mathematical accuracy and completeness of the reconciliations and any material reconciling items including significant revenue postings outside of the billing systems.\n\n- We recalculated the revenue recognised to evaluate that the processing of the revenue recognition engines was materially correct.\n\n- We corroborated the standalone selling price allocated to individual elements of bundled contracts, including to observable market pricing where available.\n\n- We used data analytic tools to identify revenue related manual journals posted to the general ledger and traced these back to source systems. This included analytical procedures to consider the completeness of journal postings. We obtained and evaluated underlying source documentation to test the completeness and accuracy of the postings, including those journals we considered unusual in nature.\n\nIn respect of the IT systems migrations which support the revenue recognition process, we:\n\n- obtained an understanding of the IFRS 15 transformation process in the new IT systems related to the revenue accounting process flow;\n\n- reviewed process documentation under the new IT system and for a sample of transactions confirmed that the transaction flow was consistent with that included in process documentation;\n\n- considered the impact of changes on the IT general control environment and performed testing as required; and\n\n- tested the reconciliation of opening balance between the legacy IT system and the new IT system to assess completeness and accuracy of the data migration.\n\nWe also assessed the adequacy of the Group\u2019s disclosures in respect to the accounting policies on revenue recognition.\n\n**Key observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee**\n\nBased on the procedures performed, including those in respect of manual adjustments to revenue, we did not identify any evidence of material misstatement in the revenue recognised in the year nor in amounts capitalised or deferred at 31 March 2021.\nCarrying value of cash generating units, including goodwill\n\nAs more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group calculates the value in use (VIU) for cash generating units (CGU) to determine whether an adjustment to the carrying value of the CGU, and therefore, goodwill, is required. As of 31 March 2021, the Group has recorded \u20ac31,731 million of goodwill, primarily in respect of Germany and Italy.\n\nThe Group\u2019s assessment of the VIU of its CGUs involves estimation about the future performance of the local market businesses. In particular, the determination of the VIUs was sensitive to the significant assumptions of projected adjusted EBITDA growth, long-term growth rates, and discount rates.\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThe recoverability of the Group\u2019s goodwill balances was subject to full scope audit procedures performed by the Primary audit team with support from relevant component audit teams on certain procedures.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Group\u2019s goodwill impairment review process. This included testing management\u2019s controls over the significant assumptions, including projected adjusted EBITDA growth, long-term growth rates, and discount rates and, in the current year, controls over the allocation of goodwill to the newly created Vantage Tower CGUs.\n\nTo test the determination of the VIU of the Group\u2019s goodwill, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the CGUs identified and testing the allocation of assets and liabilities to the carrying value of each CGU. For the newly created Vantage Tower CGUs we:\n\n- evaluated the judgement applied in determining the quantum of existing goodwill in certain markets that should be subject to the allocation process based on our assessment of the sources of the goodwill balances and their relevance to the tower assets; and\n- with the support of EY Valuation specialists, we tested the methodology and inputs utilised to perform the allocation exercise on a relative basis for consistency with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.\n\nAuditing the Group\u2019s annual impairment test was complex, given the significant judgment related to assumptions described above and data used in the VIU models and the sensitivity of the VIU models to fluctuations in assumptions. We focussed our procedures on those CGUs with the most significant goodwill balances, history of recent impairments or other factors which resulted in low headroom.\n\nIn the current year, determining the quantum of existing goodwill to be allocated to the newly created Vantage Towers CGUs in certain markets involved complex judgements and estimation techniques.\n\nFor the annual impairment assessment as at 31 March 2021, we also tested the methodology applied in the VIU models, as compared to the requirements of IAS 36, including the mathematical accuracy of management\u2019s model. We performed audit procedures to test and assess the significant assumptions used in the VIU models, including:\n\n- evaluating projected adjusted EBITDA growth, for example by comparing underlying assumptions to external data such as economic and industry forecasts for the relevant markets and for consistency with findings from other areas of our audit;\n- comparing long-term growth rates and discount rates to EY independently determined acceptable ranges;\n- performing sensitivity analyses on certain assumptions in the model to evaluate the parameters that, should they arise, would cause an impairment of the CGU or indicated additional disclosures were appropriate; and\n- for management\u2019s assessment of implied recoverable value, we compared CGU EBITDA multiples to market listed peers.\n\nFor each CGU, we compared the cash flow projections used in the VIU models to the information approved by the Group\u2019s Board of Directors and evaluated the historical accuracy of management\u2019s business plans, which underpin the VIU models.\n\nWe involved a valuation specialist in our team to assist us with certain of these audit activities.\n\nWe also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures provided in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, in particular the sensitivity disclosures in relation to reasonably possible changes in assumptions that could result in impairment.\n\nKey observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nThe judgements and methodology applied in allocating goodwill to the newly created Vantage Towers CGUs are reasonable. Furthermore, we agree with management\u2019s conclusion that the carrying value of the Group\u2019s CGUs are supportable as at 31 March 2021 and that no impairment charge is required to be recognised in the year.\nIndependent auditor\u2019s report to the members of Vodafone Group plc (continued)\n\nRisk\n\nRecognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses \u2013 Luxembourg\n\nAs more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recognises deferred tax assets in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes based on their estimated recoverability and whether management judge that it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future.\n\nA deferred tax asset in Luxembourg of \u20ac17,394 million (FY20: \u20ac20,544 million) has been recognised in respect of losses, as management concluded it is probable that the Luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which they can utilise these assets. Management estimates that the losses will be utilised over a period of between 59-62 years.\n\nThe Luxembourg companies\u2019 income is derived from the Group\u2019s internal financing and procurement and roaming activities. The forecast future finance income can vary based on forecast interest rates and intercompany debt levels which in turn impacts the timeframe over which the deferred tax asset is forecast to be recovered.\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nAudit procedures on the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses in Luxembourg were performed by the Primary audit team and its tax professionals with support from Luxembourg tax and transfer pricing specialists on certain procedures.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management\u2019s controls around the recognition of deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, including the calculation of the gross amount of deferred tax assets recorded, the preparation of the prospective financial information used to determine the Group\u2019s future taxable income, the future reversal of any existing taxable temporary differences, and management\u2019s identification and use of available commercial strategies.\n\nTo test the realizability of the deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, with the support of tax specialists, our audit procedures included, among others;\n\n\u2013 validating the existence of available losses including the impact of current year taxable profits resulting from operating and finance income and the reversal of previously recognised impairments within the local statutory financial statements;\n\n\u2013 evaluating management\u2019s position on the recoverability of the losses with respect to local tax law and tax planning strategies adopted;\n\n\u2013 re-performing the calculation of the reversal of previous impairments by agreeing the value in use calculations to our goodwill impairment audit work and confirming the Luxembourg ownership structure. This included agreeing that changes to the ownership structure during the year as a result of Vantage Towers had been appropriately reflected in the calculation;\n\n\u2013 corroborating the reasonableness of the forecast procurement and roaming taxable profits with reference to historical actual profits and with knowledge arising from other areas of our audit;\n\n\u2013 evaluating the forecast finance income by comparing future interest rates utilised in the forecasts to relevant external benchmarks and the assumed reductions in intergroup debt for consistency with our understanding of relevant guidance in respect of transfer pricing of financial transactions;\n\n\u2013 assessing whether contrary evidence exists that is not consistent with either management\u2019s stated intention that the financing structures will remain in place or that it is probable that future taxable profits will exist; and\n\n\u2013 reviewing the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of the recognition of the deferred tax asset which explain the evidence supporting the recognition, judgements in respect of the utilisation profile including longer term uncertainties and the key drivers of changes in the carrying value of the asset and the utilisation period.\n\nWe also considered the adequacy of the Group\u2019s disclosures in Note 6 of the Consolidated financial statements as to the basis for recognition of the asset and the forecast utilisation period.\n\nKey observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nWe agree with the recognition of the deferred tax assets, and consequently the long recoverability period, on the basis of forecast profits which are considered probable given management\u2019s intention to retain current activities in Luxembourg over the long term and the track record of historical profitability in these operations.\n\nWe consider that the enhanced disclosures included within Note 6:\n\n\u2013 provide greater clarity as to the impact of impairment losses and reversal on both the deferred tax asset balance and utilisation timeframe; and\n\n\u2013 acknowledges both the judgement made in respect of the timing and profile of the utilisation of the losses in the short to medium term and the longer term uncertainties in relation to the carrying value of the related deferred tax asset.\nIn the prior year, our auditor\u2019s report included the following key audit matters, which have not been included as key audit matters for the current year audit:\n\n- Assessment of contingent liabilities \u2013 The developments in the current fiscal year in respect of (i) Indian withholding taxes on the acquisition of Hutchison Essar Limited; and (ii) the Group\u2019s exposure under a contingent liability mechanism agreed on the formation of Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) and the knowledge gained as part of our first year audit in FY20 meant that the effect of these matters on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the wider engagement team was reduced relative to the prior year and accordingly, the assessment of contingent liabilities is not considered a key audit matter for the current year audit.\n\n- Valuation of identifiable assets for the acquisition of European Liberty Global assets \u2014 this key audit matter related to the purchase price allocation exercise for this acquisition which was concluded upon during the prior year audit.\n\n**Our application of materiality**\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n**Materiality**\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be \u20ac280 million (2020: \u20ac282 million), which is 2% (2020: 2%) of Adjusted EBITDA modified to include the impact of certain restructuring costs and certain elements of \u2018Other income and expenses\u2019 which we have assessed as recurring in nature. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides us with the most relevant performance measure on which to determine materiality, given the prominence of this metric throughout the Annual Report and Consolidated financial statements, investor presentations, profit metrics focussed on by analysts and its alignment to the management remuneration metric of adjusted EBIT.\n\n**Starting basis**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of \u20ac14,386 million*\n\n**Adjustments**\n\nAdd back adjustments\n\n- Group restructuring costs (\u20ac356 million)\n\n**Materiality**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for materiality basis: \u20ac14,030 million\n\nMateriality of \u20ac280 million (2% of materiality basis)\n\n* See Note 2 to the Consolidated financial statements and definition of this Alternative Performance Measure at page 218.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Company to be \u20ac445 million (2020: \u20ac471 million), which is 1% (2020: 1%) of the Company\u2019s equity. However, since the Company was a full scope component, for accounts that were relevant for the Group financial statements, a performance materiality of \u20ac39 million was applied.\n\nDuring the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality with the only change in the final materiality from our original assessment at planning, being to reflect the actual reported performance during the year.\nPerformance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group\u2019s overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% (2020: 50%) of our planning materiality, calculated as \u20ac140m (2020: \u20ac141m). This was based upon a combination of risk factors including:\n\n\u2013 the level of corporate activity in the period, and specifically the carve out of the Group\u2019s towers infrastructure from the operating companies in certain local markets and the formation and IPO of the Vantage Towers Group;\n\u2013 the audit findings from the prior year audit; and\n\u2013 the ongoing uncertainty in relation to the macro economic environment across the Group\u2019s markets, in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was \u20ac28m to \u20ac140m (2020: \u20ac15m to \u20ac138m).\n\nReporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u20ac14m (2020: \u20ac14m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\nOther information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report set out on pages 1 to 109, other than the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the directors\u2019 remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n\u2013 the information given in the strategic report and the directors\u2019 report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u2013 the strategic report and the directors\u2019 report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors\u2019 report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n\u2013 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u2013 the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u2013 certain disclosures of directors\u2019 remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u2013 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nCorporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors\u2019 statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group and Company\u2019s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- Directors\u2019 statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 109;\n- Directors\u2019 explanation as to its assessment of the Company\u2019s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 61;\n- Directors\u2019 statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 108;\n- Board\u2019s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 105;\n- The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on pages 79-80; and\n- The section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee set out on pages 76-81.\n\nResponsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors\u2019 responsibilities statement set out on pages 108-109, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nAuditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nExplanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company and management.\n\n- We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 101, the UK Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), the relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n- We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit and Risk Committee, correspondence received from regulatory bodies and attendance at all meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee, as well as consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the Group.\nWe assessed the susceptibility of the Group\u2019s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business including management and finance teams of the local markets designated as full and specified procedures scope locations, Head Office, the Audit and Risk Committee, the internal audit function, the Group legal function and individuals in the fraud and compliance department to understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud; and assessing whistleblowing incidences for those with a potential financial reporting impact. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions of analysts. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud, and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls.\n\nBased on our understanding, at a Group level our procedures involved: enquiries of Group management and those charged with governance, legal counsel, the corporate security team, the fraud investigation team and the whistleblowing and investigation team; journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions, based on our understanding of the business; and challenging the assumptions and judgements made by management in respect of significant one-off transactions in the financial year and significant accounting estimates as referred to in the key audit matters section above. At a component level, our full and specified procedure scope component audit teams\u2019 procedures included enquiries of component management; journal entry testing; and focused testing, including in respect of the key audit matter of revenue recognition. We also leveraged our data analytics capabilities in performing work on the purchase to pay process and property, plant and equipment balances, to assist in identifying higher risk transactions and balances, respectively, for testing.\n\nWhere the risk was considered to be higher, including areas impacting Group key performance indicators or management remuneration, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk or other risk of material misstatement. These procedures included those on revenue recognition referred to in the key audit matter section above and testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor\u2019s report.\n\nOther matters we are required to address\n\nFollowing the recommendation from the Audit and Risk Committee we were appointed by the Company on 23 July 2019 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2020 and subsequent financial periods.\n\nThe period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is two years, covering the years ending 31 March 2020 to 31 March 2021.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Company in conducting the audit.\n\nThe audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.\n\nUse of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company\u2019s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company\u2019s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor\u2019s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company\u2019s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\nAlison Duncan (Senior statutory auditor)\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP,\nStatutory Auditor\nLondon\n18 May 2021\nConsolidated income statement\nfor the years

In the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2020, the Group\u2019s 55% interest in Vodafone Egypt was presented within assets and liabilities held for sale following the announcement on 29 January 2020 that the Group had signed a memorandum of understanding to sell its interest to Saudi Telecom. On 21 December 2020, the Group announced that its discussions with Saudi Telecom had ended and the memorandum of understanding had been terminated.

See note 17 \u201cCalled up share capital\u201d.\n2. Includes share premium, capital reserve, capital redemption reserve, merger reserve and share-based payment reserve. The merger reserve was derived from acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2004 and subsequently allocated to additional paid-in capital on adoption of IFRS.\n3. The currency reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the assets and liabilities of foreign operations. The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.\n4. The revaluation surplus derives from acquisitions of subsidiaries made before the Group\u2019s adoption of IFRS 3 (Revised) on 1 April 2010 and comprises the amounts arising from recognising the Group\u2019s pre-existing equity interest in the acquired subsidiary at fair value.\n5. Principally includes the impact of the Group\u2019s cash flow hedges with \u00a35,992 million net loss deferred to other comprehensive income during the year (2020: \u00a34,113 million net gain; 2019: \u00a31,555 million net gain) and \u20ac1,226 million net loss (2020: \u20ac408 million net gain; 2019: \u20ac1,279 million net gain) recycled to the income statement. These hedges primarily relate to foreign exchange exposure on fixed borrowings, with any foreign exchange on nominal balances directly impacting income statement in each period but interest cash flows unwinding to the income statement over the life of the hedges (up to 2059). See note 22 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d for further details.\n6. Movements include the re-issue of 799.1 million shares (\u00a31.742 million) in February 2019 to satisfy the second tranche of the Mandatory Convertible Bond issued in February 2016 and the re-issue of 1,426.8 million shares (\u00a31.944 million) in March 2021 to satisfy the first tranche of the Mandatory Convertible Bond issued in March 2019.\n7. Includes the equity component of the subordinated mandatory convertible bonds which were compound instruments issued in the year ended 31 March 2019.\n8. Represents the irrecoverable and non-discretionary share buyback programme announced on 28 January 2019.\n9. Impact on adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019.\n10. Principally relates to the IPO of Vantage Towers AG, see note 27 for details.\n11.

See note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d for further details.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n1. Basis of preparation\n\nThis section describes the critical accounting judgements and estimates that management has identified as having a potentially material impact on the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements and sets out our significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note. We have also detailed below the new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our current view of the impact they will have on our financial reporting.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK companies Act 2006 (the Act), International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis (see page 109).\n\nVodafone Group Plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales (registration number 1833679). The registered address of the Company is Vodafone House, The Connection, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 2FN, England.\n\nIFRS requires the Directors to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group\u2019s circumstances. These have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. In determining and applying accounting policies, Directors and management are required to make judgements and estimates in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting judgement, estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the Group\u2019s reported financial position, results or cash flows and disclosure of contingent assets or liabilities during the reporting period; it may later be determined that a different choice may have been more appropriate.\n\nThe Group\u2019s critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty are detailed below. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nManagement regularly reviews, and revises as necessary, the accounting judgements that significantly impact the amounts recognised in the financial statements and the estimates that are considered to be \u201ccritical estimates\u201d due to their potential to give rise to material adjustments in the Group\u2019s financial statements in the year to 31 March 2022. As at 31 March 2021, management has identified critical judgements in respect of revenue recognition, lease accounting, valuing assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, the accounting for tax disputes in India, the classification of joint arrangements and whether to recognise provisions or to disclose contingent liabilities. In addition, management has identified critical accounting estimates in relation to the recovery of deferred tax assets, post employment benefits and impairments; estimates have also been identified that are not considered to be critical in respect of the allocation of revenue to goods and services, the useful economic lives of finite lived intangibles and property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe majority of the Group\u2019s provisions are either long-term in nature (such as asset retirement obligations) or relate to shorter-term liabilities (such as those relating to restructuring and property) where there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year. Critical judgements exercised in respect of tax disputes in India, include the cases relating to our acquisition of Hutchison Essar Limited (Vodafone India).\n\nThese critical accounting judgements, estimates and related disclosures have been discussed with the Group\u2019s Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nRevenue recognition\n\nRevenue recognition under IFRS 15 necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data and the use of management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant accounting judgements and source of estimation uncertainty are disclosed below.\n\nGross versus net presentation\n\nIf the Group has control of goods or services when they are delivered to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer; otherwise the Group is acting as an agent. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue and operating expenses (see note 2 \u201cRevenue disaggregation and segmental analysis\u201d) but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows. Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or an agent include, for example, those where the Group delivers third-party branded services (such as premium music or TV content) to customers.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n1. Basis of preparation (continued)\n\nAllocation of revenue to goods and services provided to customers\nRevenue is recognised when goods and services are delivered to customers (see note 2 \u201cRevenue disaggregation and segmental analysis\u201d). Goods and services may be delivered to a customer at different times under the same contract, hence it is necessary to allocate the amount payable by the customer between goods and services on a \u2018relative standalone selling price basis\u2019; this requires the identification of performance obligations (\u2018obligations\u2019) and the determination of standalone selling prices for the identified obligations. The determination of obligations is, for the primary goods and services sold by the Group, not considered to be a critical accounting judgement; the Group\u2019s policy on identifying obligations is disclosed in note 2 \u201cRevenue disaggregation and segmental analysis\u201d. The determination of standalone selling prices for identified obligations is discussed below.\n\nIt is necessary to estimate the standalone price when the Group does not sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a standalone basis. When estimating the standalone price the Group maximises the use of external inputs; methods for estimating standalone prices include determining the standalone price of similar goods and services sold by the Group, observing the standalone prices for similar goods and services when sold by third parties or using a cost-plus reasonable margin approach (which is sometimes the case for devices and other equipment). Where it is not possible to reliably estimate standalone prices due to a lack of observable standalone sales or highly variable pricing, which is sometimes the case for services, the standalone price of an obligation may be determined as the transaction price less the standalone prices of other obligations in the contract. The standalone price determined for obligations materially impacts the allocation of revenue between obligations and impacts the timing of revenue when obligations are provided to customers at different times \u2013 for example, the allocation of revenue between devices, which are usually delivered up-front, and services which are typically delivered over the contract period. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying value of contract-related assets or liabilities in the 12 months after the balance sheet date if these estimates were revised.\n\nLease accounting\nLease accounting under IFRS 16 is complex and necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data and the increased use of management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant accounting judgements are disclosed below.\n\nLease identification\nWhether the arrangement is considered a lease or a service contract depends on the analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the arrangement between the Group and the counter-party to determine if control of an identified asset has been passed between the parties; if not, the arrangement is a service arrangement. Control exists if the Group obtains substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the asset, and has the ability to direct its use, for a period of time. An identified asset exists where an agreement explicitly or implicitly identifies an asset or a physically distinct portion of an asset which the lessor has no substantive right to substitute.\n\nThe scenarios requiring the greatest judgement include those where the arrangement is for the use of fibre or other fixed telecommunication lines. Generally, where the Group has exclusive use of a physical line it is determined that the Group can also direct the use of the line and therefore leases will be recognised. Where the Group provides access to fibre or other fixed telecommunication lines to another operator on a wholesale basis the arrangement will generally be identified as a lease, whereas when the Group provides fixed line services to an end-user, generally control over such lines is not passed to the end-user and a lease is not identified.\n\nThe impact of determining whether an agreement is a lease or a service depends on whether the Group is a potential lessee or lessor in the arrangement and, where the Group is a lessor, whether the arrangement is classified as an operating or finance lease. The impacts for each scenario are described below where the Group is potentially:\n\n- A lessee. The judgement impacts the nature and timing of both costs and reported assets and liabilities. A lease results in an asset and a liability being reported and depreciation and interest being recognised; the interest charge will decrease over the life of the lease. A service contract results in operating expenses being recognised evenly over the life of the contract and no assets or liabilities being recorded (other than trade payables, prepayments and accruals).\n- An operating lessor. The judgement impacts the nature of income recognised. An operating lease results in lease income being recognised whilst a service contract results in service revenue. Both are recognised evenly over the life of the contract.\n- A finance lessor. The judgement impacts the nature and timing of both income and reported assets. A finance lease results in the lease income being recognised at commencement of the lease and an asset (the net investment in the lease) being recorded.\n\nLease term\nWhere leases include additional optional periods after an initial lease term, significant judgement is required in determining whether these optional periods should be included when determining the lease term. The impact of this judgement is significantly greater where the Group is a lessee. As a lessee, optional periods are included in the lease term if the Group is reasonably certain it will exercise an extension option or will not exercise a termination option; this depends on an analysis by management of all relevant facts and circumstances including the leased asset\u2019s nature and purpose, the economic and practical potential for replacing the asset and any plans that the Group has in place for the future use of the asset. Where a leased asset is highly customised (either when initially provided or as a result of leasehold improvements) or it is impractical or uneconomic to replace then the Group is more likely to judge that lease extension options are reasonably certain to be exercised. The value of the right-of-use asset and lease liability will be greater when extension options are included in the lease term. The normal approach adopted for lease term by asset class is described below.\nThe lease terms can vary significantly by type and use of asset and geography. In addition, the exact lease term is subject to the non-cancellable period and rights and options in each contract. Generally, lease terms are judged to be the longer of the minimum lease term and:\n\n- Between 5 and 10 years for land and buildings (excluding retail), with terms at the top end of this range if the lease relates to assets that are considered to be difficult to exit sooner for economic, practical or reputational reasons;\n- To the next contractual lease break date for retail premises (excluding breaks within the next 12 months);\n- Where leases are used to provide internal connectivity the lease term for the connectivity is aligned to the lease term or useful economic life of the assets connected;\n- The customer service agreement length for leases of local loop connections or other assets required to provide fixed line services to individual customers; and\n- Where there are contractual agreements to provide services using leased assets, the lease term for these assets is generally set in accordance with the above principles or for the lease term required to provide the services for the agreed service period, if longer.\n\nIn most instances the Group has options to renew or extend leases for additional periods after the end of the lease term which are assessed using the criteria above.\n\nLease terms are reassessed if a significant event or change in circumstances occurs relating to the leased assets that is within the control of the Group; such changes usually relate to commercial agreements entered into by the Group, or business decisions made by the Group. Where such changes change the Group\u2019s assessment of whether it is reasonably certain to exercise options to extend, or not terminate leases, then the lease term is reassessed and the lease liability is remeasured, which in most cases will increase the lease liability.\n\n**Taxation**\n\nThe Group\u2019s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. The calculation of the Group\u2019s total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters, being principally:\n\n**Recognition of deferred tax assets**\n\nSignificant items on which the Group has exercised accounting estimation and judgement include the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses in Luxembourg, Germany and Spain as well as capital allowances in the United Kingdom. The recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether management judge that it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future. The Group assesses the availability of future taxable profits using the same undiscounted five year forecasts for the Group\u2019s operations as are used in the Group\u2019s value in use calculations (see note 4 \u201cImpairment losses\u201d).\n\nWhere tax losses are forecast to be recovered beyond the five year period, the availability of taxable profits is assessed using the cash flows and long-term growth rates used for the value in use calculations.\n\nThe estimated cash flows inherent in these forecasts include the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business including the potential impacts of changes in the market structure, trends in customer pricing, the costs associated with the acquisition and retention of customers, future technological evolutions and potential regulatory changes, such as our ability to acquire and/or renew spectrum licences.\n\nChanges in the estimates which underpin the Group\u2019s forecasts could have an impact on the amount of future taxable profits and could have a significant impact on the period over which the deferred tax asset would be recovered.\n\nThe Group only considers substantively enacted tax laws when assessing the amount and availability of tax losses to offset against the future taxable profits. See note 6 \u201cTaxation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Uncertain tax positions**\n\nThe tax impact of a transaction or item can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process. The Group uses in-house tax experts when assessing uncertain tax positions and seeks the advice of external professional advisors where appropriate. The most significant judgement in this area relates to the Group\u2019s tax disputes in India, including the cases relating to the Group\u2019s acquisition of Hutchison Essar Limited (Vodafone India) and the impact of the European Commission\u2019s challenge to the UK\u2019s Controlled Foreign Company rules. Further details of the tax disputes in India are included in note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d and further information on the European Commission\u2019s challenge are included in note 6 \u201cTaxation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Business combinations and goodwill**\n\nWhen the Group completes a business combination, the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, are recognised. The determination of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management\u2019s judgement. If the purchase consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired then the incremental amount paid is recognised as goodwill. If the purchase price consideration is lower than the fair value of the assets acquired then the difference is recorded as a gain in the income statement.\n\nAllocation of the purchase price between finite lived assets (discussed below) and indefinite lived assets such as goodwill affects the subsequent results of the Group as finite lived intangible assets are amortised, whereas indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortised.\n\nSee note 27 \u201cAcquisitions and disposals\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n1. Basis of preparation (continued)\n\nJoint arrangements\nThe Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with one or more other parties. Judgement is required to classify joint arrangements in a separate legal entity as either a joint operation or as a joint venture, which depends on management\u2019s assessment of the legal form and substance of the arrangement taking into account relevant facts and circumstances such as whether the owners have rights to substantially all the economic outputs and, in substance, settle the liabilities of the entity.\n\nThe classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group\u2019s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows of joint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis, whereas the Group\u2019s investment and share of results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated income statement respectively. See note 12 \u201cInvestments in associates and joint arrangements\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFinite lived intangible assets\nOther intangible assets include amounts spent by the Group acquiring licences and spectrum, customer bases and the costs of purchasing and developing computer software.\n\nWhere intangible assets are acquired through business combinations and no active market for the assets exists, the fair value of these assets is determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset. Estimates relating to the future cash flows and discount rates used may have a material effect on the reported amounts of finite lived intangible assets.\n\nEstimation of useful life\nThe useful life over which intangible assets are amortised depends on management\u2019s estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. Useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate. Management\u2019s estimates of useful life have a material impact on the amount of amortisation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying values of intangible assets in the year to 31 March 2022 if these estimates were revised. The basis for determining the useful life for the most significant categories of intangible assets are discussed below.\n\nCustomer bases\nThe estimated useful life principally reflects management\u2019s view of the average economic life of the customer base and is assessed by reference to customer churn rates. An increase in churn rates may lead to a reduction in the estimated useful life and an increase in the amortisation charge.\n\nCapitalised software\nFor computer software, the estimated useful life is based on management\u2019s view, considering historical experience with similar products as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes in technology. The useful life will not exceed the duration of a licence.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment represents 26.6% of the Group\u2019s total assets (2020: 23.7%, re-presented from 23.3% to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale, see note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d). Estimates and assumptions made may have a material impact on their carrying value and related depreciation charge. See note 11 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nEstimation of useful life\nThe depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its expected useful life and expected residual value, which are reviewed annually. Management\u2019s estimates of useful life have a material impact on the amount of depreciation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying values of property, plant and equipment in the year to 31 March 2022 if these estimates were revised.\n\nManagement determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking into account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology.\n\nPost employment benefits\nManagement uses estimates when determining the Group\u2019s liabilities and expenses arising for defined benefit pension schemes. Management is required to estimate the future rates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have a material impact on the defined benefit obligations that are recorded. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 25 \u201cPost employment benefits\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nContingent liabilities\nThe Group exercises judgement to determine whether to recognise provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigations or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities (see note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements). Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise.\nImpairment reviews\n\nIFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets, for finite lived assets and for equity accounted investments, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\nImpairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows that they generate. Calculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including management\u2019s expectations of:\n\n- growth in adjusted EBITDA, calculated as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;\n- timing and amount of future capital expenditure, licence and spectrum payments;\n- long-term growth rates; and\n- appropriate discount rates to reflect the risks involved.\n\nA lack of observable market data on fair values for equivalent assets means that the Group\u2019s valuation approach for impairment testing focuses primarily on value in use. For a number of reasons, transaction values agreed as part of any business acquisition or disposal may be higher than the assessed value in use. Where the Group has interests in listed entities, market data, such as share price, is used to assess the fair value of those interests.\n\nManagement prepares formal five year forecasts for the Group\u2019s operations, which are used to estimate their value in use; a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of:\n\n- the nominal GDP growth rates for the country of operation; and\n- the long-term compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA in years six to ten, as estimated by management.\n\nManagement continues to review the impact of COVID-19 and the impairment review is based on expected cash flows that include management\u2019s best estimate of potential COVID-19 impacts.\n\nChanging the assumptions selected by management, in particular the adjusted EBITDA and growth rate assumptions used in the cash flow projections, could significantly affect the Group\u2019s impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profits or losses. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 4 \u201cImpairment losses\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor operations that are classified as held for sale, management is required to determine whether the carrying value of the discontinued operation can be supported by the fair value less costs to sell. Where not observable in a quoted market, management has determined fair value less costs to sell by reference to the outcomes from the application of a number of potential valuation techniques, determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n\nSignificant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as a whole\n\nAccounting convention\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain financial and equity instruments that have been measured at fair value.\n\nBasis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, subsidiaries controlled by the Company (see note 31 \u201cRelated undertakings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements), joint operations that are subject to joint control and the results of joint ventures and associates (see note 12 \u201cInvestments in associates and joint arrangements\u201d to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nForeign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is also the Company\u2019s functional currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the respective functional currency of the entity at the rates prevailing on the reporting period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the initial transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nChanges in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency are analysed between translation differences and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nTranslation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as investments in equity securities classified at fair value through other comprehensive income, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nShare capital, share premium and other capital reserves are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction and are not retranslated.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than euro are expressed in euro using exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period date.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n1. Basis of preparation (continued)\n\nIncome and expense items and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates for each month and exchange differences arising are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative amount previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated accordingly.\n\nThe net foreign exchange loss recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2021 is \u20ac13 million (31 March 2020: \u20ac146 million loss; 2019: \u20ac2,277 million loss). The net gains and net losses are recorded within operating profit (2021: \u20ac1 million charge; 2020: \u20ac24 million credit; 2019: \u20ac1 million charge), non-operating expense (2021: \u20ac4 million credit; 2020: \u20ac37 million credit; 2019: \u20acnil), investment income (2021: \u20ac23 million charge 2020: \u20ac205 million charge; 2019: \u20ac190 million charge), income tax expense (2021: \u20ac7 million credit; 2020: \u20ac2 million charge; 2019: \u20ac7 million charge) and loss for the financial year from discontinued operations (2021: \u20acnil, 2020: \u20acnil, 2019: \u20ac2,079 million charge). The foreign exchange gains and losses included within other income and expense and non-operating expense arise on the disposal of subsidiaries, interests in joint ventures, associates and investments from the recycling of foreign exchange gains and losses previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nCurrent or non-current classification\n\nAssets are classified as current in the consolidated statement of financial position where recovery is expected within 12 months of the reporting date. All assets where recovery is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date and all deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments in associates and joint ventures are reported as non-current.\n\nLiabilities are classified as current unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. For provisions, where the timing of settlement is uncertain, amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date. In addition, deferred tax liabilities and post-employment benefits are reported as non-current.\n\nInventory\n\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the basis of weighted average costs and comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\nNew accounting pronouncements adopted on 1 April 2020\n\nThe Group adopted the following new accounting policies on 1 April 2020 to comply with amendments to IFRS. The accounting pronouncements, none of which had a material impact on the Group\u2019s financial reporting on adoption, are:\n\n- Amendments to IFRS 3 \u201cDefinition of a Business\u201d;\n- Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 \u201cDefinition of Material\u201d; and\n- Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 \u201cInterest Rate Benchmark Reform\u201d.\n\nNew accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2021\n\nThe IASB has issued the following pronouncements for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021.\n\n- Amendments to IFRS 16 \u201cCovid-19-Related Rent Concessions\u201d and \u201cCovid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021\u201d;\n- Amendments to IFRS 4 \u201cExtension of the Temporary Exemption from Applying IFRS 9\u201d; and\n- Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 4, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16 \u201cInterest Rate Benchmark Reform \u2013 Phase 2\u201d.\n\nThese amendments have either been endorsed by the EU before 31 December 2020 or by the UK Endorsement Board thereafter. The Group\u2019s financial reporting will be presented in accordance with the above new standards from 1 April 2021. The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of financial position or consolidated cash flow statement.\n\nNew accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2022\n\nThe following narrow-scope amendments have been issued by the IASB and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022; they were not endorsed by the EU at 31 December 2020 and have not yet been endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board.\n\n- Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020;\n- Amendments to IAS 16 \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use\u201d;\n- Amendments to IAS 37 \u201cOnerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\u201d; and\n- Amendment to IFRS 3 \u201cReference to the Conceptual Framework\u201d.\n\nThe following new standards have also been issued by the IASB and are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023; they were not endorsed by the EU at 31 December 2020 and have not yet been endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board.\n\n- IFRS 17 \u201cInsurance Contracts\u201d and Amendments to IFRS 17 \u201cInsurance Contracts\u201d;\n- Amendments to IAS 1 \u201cClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current\u201d (including deferral of its effective date);\n- Amendments to IAS 1 \u201cDisclosure of Accounting Policies\u201d and Amendments to IAS 8 \u201cDefinition of Accounting Estimates\u201d; and\n- Amendment to IAS 12 \u201cDeferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\u201d.\n\nThe Group is assessing the impact of these new standards and the Group\u2019s financial reporting and will be presented in accordance with these standards from 1 April 2022 or 1 April 2023 as applicable.\n2. Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis\n\nThe Group\u2019s businesses are managed on a geographical basis. Selected financial data is presented on this basis below.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nRevenue\n\nWhen the Group enters into an agreement with a customer, goods and services deliverable under the contract are identified as separate performance obligations (\u2018obligations\u2019) to the extent that the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own and that the separate goods and services are considered distinct from other goods and services in the agreement. Where individual goods and services do not meet the criteria to be identified as separate obligations they are aggregated with other goods and/or services in the agreement until a separate obligation is identified. The obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts, but might typically be separately identified for mobile handsets, other equipment such as set-top boxes and routers provided to customers and services provided to customers such as mobile and fixed line communication services. Where goods and services have a functional dependency (for example, a fixed line router can only be used with the Group\u2019s services) this does not, in isolation, prevent those goods or services from being assessed as separate obligations. Activities relating to connecting customers to the Group\u2019s network for the future provision of services are not considered to meet the criteria to be recognised as performance obligations except to the extent that the control of related equipment passes to customers.\n\nThe Group determines the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled in return for providing the promised obligations to the customer based on the committed contractual amounts, net of sales taxes and discounts. Where indirect channel dealers, such as retailers, acquire customer contracts on behalf of the Group and receive commission, any commissions that the dealer is compelled to use to fund discounts or other incentives to the customer are treated as payments to the customer when determining the transaction price and consequently are not included in contract acquisition costs.\n\nThe transaction price is allocated between the identified obligations according to the relative standalone selling prices of the obligations. The standalone selling price of each obligation deliverable in the contract is determined according to the prices that the Group would achieve by selling the same goods and/or services included in the obligation to a similar customer on a standalone basis; where standalone selling prices are not directly observable, estimation techniques are used maximising the use of external inputs. See \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 for details. Revenue is recognised when the respective obligations in the contract are delivered to the customer and cash collection is considered probable. Revenue for the provision of services, such as mobile airtime and fixed line broadband, is recognised when the Group provides the related service during the agreed service period.\n\nRevenue for device sales to end customers is generally recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer. For device sales made to intermediaries such as indirect channel dealers, revenue is recognised if control of the device has transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no right to return the device to receive a refund; otherwise revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return.\n\nWhere refunds are issued to customers they are deducted from revenue in the relevant service period.\n\nWhen the Group has control of goods or services prior to delivery to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer. As a principal, receipts from, and payments to, suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If another party has control of goods or services prior to transfer to a customer, then the Group is acting as an agent for the other party and revenue in respect of the relevant obligations is recognised net of any related payments to the supplier and recognised revenue represents the margin earned by the Group. See \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 for details.\n\nCustomers typically pay in advance for prepay mobile services and monthly for other communication services. Customers typically pay for handsets and other equipment either up-front at the time of sale or over the term of the related service agreement.\n\nWhen revenue recognised in respect of a customer contract exceeds amounts received or receivable from a customer at that time a contract asset is recognised; contract assets will typically be recognised for handsets or other equipment provided to customers where payment is recovered by the Group via future service fees. If amounts received or receivable from a customer exceed revenue recognised for a contract, for example if the Group receives an advance payment from a customer, a contract liability is recognised.\n\nWhen contract assets or liabilities are recognised, a financing component may exist in the contract; this is typically the case when a handset or other equipment is provided to a customer up-front but payment is received over the term of the related service agreement, in which case the customer is deemed to have received financing. If a significant financing component is provided to the customer, the transaction price is reduced and interest revenue is recognised over the customer\u2019s payment period using an interest rate reflecting the relevant central bank rates and customer credit risk.\n\nContract-related costs\n\nWhen costs directly relating to a specific contract are incurred prior to recognising revenue for a related obligation, and those costs enhance the ability of the Group to deliver an obligation and are expected to be recovered, then those costs are recognised on the statement of financial position as fulfilment costs and are recognised as expenses in line with the recognition of revenue when the related obligation is delivered.\n\nThe direct and incremental costs of acquiring a contract including, for example, certain commissions payable to staff or agents for acquiring customers on behalf of the Group, are recognised as contract acquisition cost assets in the statement of financial position when the related payment obligation is recorded. Costs are recognised as an expense in line with the recognition of the related revenue that is expected to be earned by the Group; typically this is over the customer contract period as new commissions are payable on contract renewal. Certain amounts payable to agents are deducted from revenue recognised (see above).\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n2. Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis (continued)\n\nRevenue disaggregation\n\nRevenue reported for the year includes revenue from contracts with customers, comprising service and equipment revenue, as well as other revenue items including revenue from leases and interest revenue arising from transactions with a significant financing component.

Other revenue includes lease revenue recognised under IFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d for the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 and under IAS 17 for the year ended 31 March 2019 (see note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d).\n2. Comprises central teams and business functions.\n\nThe total future revenue from the Group\u2019s contracts with customers with performance obligations not satisfied at 31 March 2021 is \u20ac21,038 million (2020: \u20ac20,336 million; 2019: \u20ac18,447 million); of which \u20ac14,110 million (2020: \u20ac13,456 million; 2019: \u20ac12,566 million) is expected to be recognised within the next year and the majority of the remaining amount in the following 12 months.\nSegmental analysis\n\nThe Group\u2019s operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the Group that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group has determined the chief operating decision maker to be its Chief Executive Officer. The Group has a single group of similar services and products, being the supply of communications services and related products. Revenue is attributed to a country based on the location of the Group company reporting the revenue. Transactions between operating segments are charged at arm\u2019s-length prices.\n\nWith the exception of Vodacom, which is a legal entity encompassing South Africa and certain other smaller African markets, segment information is primarily provided on the basis of geographic areas, being the basis on which the Group manages its worldwide interests.\n\nThe operating segments for Germany, Italy, UK, Spain, and Vodacom are individually material for the Group and are each reporting segments for which certain financial information is provided. The aggregation of smaller operating segments into the Other Europe and Other Markets reporting segments reflects, in the opinion of management, the similar local market economic characteristics and regulatory environments for each of those operating segments as well as the similar products and services sold and comparable classes of customers. In the case of the Other Europe region this largely reflects membership or a close association with the European Union, while the Other Markets segment largely includes developing economies with less stable economic or regulatory environments. Common Functions is a separate reporting segment and comprises activities which are undertaken primarily in central Group entities that do not meet the criteria for aggregation with other reporting segments.\n\nA reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, the Group\u2019s measure of segment profit, to the Group\u2019s profit or loss before taxation for the financial year is shown below.\n\n| Segmental analysis | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA    | 14,386  | 14,881  | 13,918  |\n| Restructuring costs| (356)   | (695)   | (460)   |\n| Interest on lease liabilities | 374 | 330 | \u2013 |\n| Loss on disposal of owned assets | (30) | (54) | (33) |\n| Depreciation and amortisation on owned assets | (10,187) | (10,454) | (9,795) |\n| Share of results in equity accounted associates and joint ventures | 342 | (2,505) | (908) |\n| Impairment losses | \u2013 | (1,685) | (3,525) |\n| Other income/(expense) | 568 | 4,281 | (148) |\n| Operating profit/(loss) | 5,097 | 4,099 | (951) |\n| Non-operating expense | \u2013 | (3) | (7) |\n| Investment income | 330 | 248 | 433 |\n| Finance costs | (1,027) | (3,549) | (2,088) |\n| Profit/(loss) before taxation | 4,400 | 795 | (2,613) |\n\nNote:\n1.

All services that were prohibited by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) or Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a statutory auditor to provide ceased by 31 March 2019. All engagements that were not prohibited by the FRC or SEC but were not in accordance with the Group\u2019s own internal approval policy for non-audit services, ceased early in the financial year ended 31 March 2020 to enable a smooth transition to alternative suppliers, where required.\n4. Impairment losses\n\nImpairment occurs when the carrying value of assets is greater than the present value of the net cash flows they are expected to generate. We review the carrying value of assets for each country in which we operate at least annually. For further details of our impairment review process see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nGoodwill\n\nGoodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as cash-generating units. The determination of the Group\u2019s cash-generating units is primarily based on the geographic area where the Group supplies communications services and products. If cash flows from assets within one jurisdiction are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets in that same jurisdiction and management monitors performance separately, multiple cash-generating units are identified within that geographic area.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversible in subsequent periods.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nManagement prepares formal five year plans for the Group\u2019s cash-generating units, which are the basis for the value in use calculations.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, finite lived intangible assets and equity accounted investments\n\nAt each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment, finite lived intangible assets and equity-accounted investments to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nWhere there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount; not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nImpairment losses\n\nFollowing our annual impairment review, the impairment charges recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating profit are stated below. Further detail on the events and circumstances that led to the recognition of the impairment charges is included below.\n\n| Cash-generating unit          | Reportable segment | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Spain                        | Spain              | \u2013       | 840     | 2,930   |\n| Ireland                      | Other Europe       | \u2013       | 630     | \u2013       |\n| Romania                      | Other Europe       | \u2013       | 110     | 310     |\n| Vodafone Automotive          | Common Functions   | \u2013       | 105     | 30      |\n| Vodafone Idea                | Other Markets      | \u2013       | \u2013       | 255     |\n|                              |                    | \u2013       |         | 1,685   | 3,525   |\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2019, the Group recorded a loss on disposal of Vodafone India of \u20ac3,420 million, including a loss on disposal of \u20ac1,276 million and a foreign exchange loss of \u20ac2,079 million which is included in discontinued operations.

The Other Markets segment is also expected to benefit from increased usage and penetration of M-Pesa in Africa; and |\n|                                  | \u2022 Margins are expected to be impacted by negative factors such as the cost of acquiring and retaining customers in increasingly competitive markets and by positive factors such as the efficiencies expected from the implementation of Group initiatives. |\n| Projected capital expenditure     | The cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based on past experience and include the ongoing capital expenditure required to maintain our networks, provide products and services in line with customer expectations, including of higher data volumes and speeds, and to meet the population coverage requirements of certain of the Group\u2019s licences. In Europe, capital expenditure is required to roll out capacity-building next generation 5G and gigabit networks. Outside of Europe, capital expenditure will be required for the continued rollout of current and next generation mobile networks in emerging markets. Capital expenditure includes cash outflows for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and computer software. |\n| Projected licence and spectrum payments | To enable the continued provision of products and services, the cash flow forecasts for licence and spectrum payments for each relevant cash-generating unit include amounts for expected renewals and newly available spectrum. Beyond the five year forecast period, a long-run cost of spectrum is assumed. |\n| Long-term growth rate             | For the purposes of the Group\u2019s value in use calculations, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity is applied immediately at the end of the five year forecast period and is based on the lower of: |\n|                                  | \u2022 the nominal GDP growth rate forecasts for the country of operation; and |\n|                                  | \u2022 the long-term compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA as estimated by management. Long-term compound annual growth rates determined by management may be lower than forecast nominal GDP growth rates due to the following market-specific factors: competitive intensity levels, maturity of business, regulatory environment or sector-specific inflation expectations. |\n| Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate | The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Group\u2019s cash-generating units is generally based on the risk free rate for ten year bonds issued by the government in the respective market. Where government bond rates contain a material component of credit risk, high-quality local corporate bond rates may be used. These rates are adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific cash-generating unit. In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium (that is the required return over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole) and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific cash-generating unit relative to the market as a whole. |\n\nIn determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management has applied an adjustment for the systematic risk to each of the Group\u2019s cash-generating companies determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed telecommunications companies and, where available and appropriate, across a specific territory. Management has used a forward-looking equity market risk premium that takes into consideration both studies by independent economists, the long-term average equity market risk premium and the market risk premiums typically used by valuations practitioners.\n\nThe risk adjusted discount rate is also based on typical leverage ratios of telecommunications companies in each cash-generating unit\u2019s respective market or region.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n4. Impairment losses (continued)\n\nYear ended 31 March 2021\n\nFollowing the carve-out of Vodafone\u2019s tower infrastructure to Vantage Towers A.G. (\u2018Vantage Towers\u2019) during the year in Germany, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Romania, Czech Republic and Hungary and the acquisitions by Vantage Towers of Vodafone UK\u2019s 50% shareholding in Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited (\u2018CTIL\u2019) and the remaining shareholding in the Vantage Towers Greece, management considers Vodafone\u2019s operating companies and Vantage Tower\u2019s operating companies in the affected geographical areas to represent two cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing as at 31 March 2021. Vodafone\u2019s investment in Infrastructure Wireless Italiane S.p.A. (\u2018INWIT\u2019) was also transferred to Vantage Towers during the year.\n\nGoodwill has been allocated on a relative values basis to the Vantage Towers cash-generating units, where applicable, as part of the tower business carve out from Vodafone\u2019s operations. The cash-generating units described below relate to Vodafone\u2019s mobile and fixed line trading businesses, unless otherwise indicated as being part of Vantage Towers.\n\nValue in use assumptions\n\nThe table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculations.\n\n| Assumptions used in value in use calculation | Germany % | Italy % | Spain % | Ireland % | Romania % | Vantage Towers Germany % |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate          | 7.4       | 10.5    | 9.2     | 7.7       | 9.9       | 6.0                      |\n| Long-term growth rate                       | 0.5       | 0.5     | 0.5     | 0.5       | 1.0       | 1.5                      |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA\u00b9                  | 1.2       | 2.1     | 4.9     | 0.5       | 0.9       | 8.4                      |\n| Projected capital expenditure\u00b2              | 19.7-21.5 | 14.4-15.9 | 15.7-17.6 | 12.6-15.1 | 12.3-15.2 | 39.1-56.2                |\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nThe estimated recoverable amounts of the Group\u2019s operations in Germany, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Romania and Vantage Towers Germany exceed their carrying values by \u20ac7.4 billion, \u20ac0.6 billion, \u20ac0.3 billion, \u20ac0.1 billion, \u20ac0.1 billion and \u20ac3.5 billion, respectively. If the assumptions used in the impairment review were changed to a greater extent than as presented in the following table, the changes would, in isolation, lead to an impairment loss being recognised for the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\n| Change required for carrying value to equal recoverable amount | Germany pps | Italy pps | Spain pps | Ireland pps | Romania pps | Vantage Towers Germany pps |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|\n| Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate                           | 1.3         | 0.7       | 0.4       | 0.7         | 0.7         | 5.2                       |\n| Long-term growth rate                                         | (1.3)       | (0.8)     | (0.5)     | (0.7)       | (0.9)       | (4.9)                     |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA\u00b9                                    | (4.0)       | (1.5)     | (1.5)     | (1.6)       | (1.9)       | (19.3)                    |\n| Projected capital expenditure\u00b2                                | 12.7        | 3.0       | 1.6       | 2.8         | 1.9         | 162.6                     |\nManagement considered the following reasonably possible changes in key assumptions for projected adjusted EBITDA\\(^1\\) and long-term growth rate, leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Consistent with the prior year, and due to the uncertainty of future COVID-19 impacts, management\u2019s range of reasonably possible changes in projected adjusted EBITDA is plus or minus 5 percentage points (2020: +/- 5 percentage points). The sensitivity analysis presented is prepared on the basis that the reasonably possible change in each key assumption would not have a consequential impact on other assumptions used in the impairment review. The associated impact on the impairment assessment is presented in the table below.\n\nManagement believes that no reasonably possible or foreseeable change in the pre-tax adjusted discount rate or projected capital expenditure\\(^2\\) would cause the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount for any cash-generating unit to be materially different from the base case disclosed below.\n\n| Recoverable amount less carrying value | Germany \u20acbn | Italy \u20acbn | Spain \u20acbn | Ireland \u20acbn | Romania \u20acbn | Vantage Towers Germany \u20acbn |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|\n| Base case as at 31 March 2021          | 7.4         | 0.6       | 0.3       | 0.1         | 0.1         | 3.5                       |\n| Change in projected adjusted EBITDA\\(^1\\) |             |           |           |             |             |                           |\n| Decrease by 5pps                       | (1.6)       | (1.3)     | (0.6)     | (0.2)       | (0.1)       | 2.4                       |\n| Increase by 5pps                       | 18.2        | 2.9       | 1.4       | 0.5         | 0.3         | 5.0                       |\n| Change in long-term growth rate        |             |           |           |             |             |                           |\n| Decrease by 1pps                       | 1.5         | (0.1)     | (0.3)     | \u2013           | \u2013           | 2.2                       |\n| Increase by 1pps                       | 16.0        | 1.6       | 1.0       | 0.3         | 0.2         | 6.1                       |\n\nThe carrying values for Vodafone UK, Portugal, Czech Republic, and Hungary include goodwill arising from acquisitions and/or the purchase of operating licences or spectrum rights.

A pro-rata adjustment has been made to true up 31 March 2021 adjusted EBITDA to a full year where the towers business carve-out occurred during the year.\n2. Projected capital expenditure, which excludes licences and spectrum, is expressed as capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n4. Impairment losses (continued)\n\nYear ended 31 March 2020\n\nThe disclosures below for the year ended 31 March 2020 are as previously disclosed in the 31 March 2020 Annual Report.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2020, the Group recorded impairment charges of \u20ac0.8 billion, \u20ac0.6 billion, \u20ac0.1 billion and \u20ac0.1 billion with respect to the Group\u2019s investments in Spain, Ireland, Romania and Vodafone Automotive respectively. The impairment charges relate solely to goodwill and are recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating profit/(loss). The recoverable amounts for Spain, Ireland, Romania and Vodafone Automotive are \u20ac3.6 billion, \u20ac1.2 billion, \u20ac0.9 billion and \u20ac0.0 billion respectively, and based on value in use calculations.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak developed rapidly in early 2020. Many countries have required businesses to limit or suspend operations and implemented travel restrictions and quarantine measures. The measures taken to contain the virus have adversely affected economic activity and disrupted many businesses. As the outbreak continues to progress and evolve, it is extremely challenging to predict the full extent and duration of its impact on Vodafone\u2019s businesses and the countries where Vodafone operates. Based on information available as at 31 March 2020, management made additional adjustments to the five year business plans used in the Group\u2019s impairment testing in order to reflect the estimated impact. The impairment charges recognised and discussed immediately below, were based on expected cash flows after applying these adjustments.\n\nChallenging trading and economic conditions in Spain materialised in the prior financial year and management recognised an impairment charge following a reduction in projected cash flows. During the year ended 31 March 2020 there was an observable repositioning towards low-cost brands and competitive intensity within the multi-branded market was expected to remain elevated in the medium term. These factors led to management projecting lower cash flows and recognising an impairment charge with respect to the Group\u2019s investment in Spain.\n\nThe impairment charge recognised with respect to Ireland was attributable to increased competition and the aforementioned increased economic uncertainty. As a consequence, growth and ARPU\u2019s were expected to be lower. Management reflected these assumptions in expected cash flows.\n\nThe impairment charges recognised with respect to Romania and Vodafone Automotive reflect management\u2019s latest assessment of likely trading and economic conditions in the five year business plan. Management\u2019s view of the long-term potential in these markets remains unchanged.\n\nThe European Liberty Global assets acquired in July 2019 (see note 27 \u2018Acquisitions and disposals\u2019) were subsumed within existing cash-generating units in Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. The primary reason for acquiring the businesses was to create a converged national provider of digital infrastructure in Germany, together with creating converged communications operators in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. Following the integration of the acquired businesses, management considered the cash flows within these cash-generating units to be largely interdependent and monitors performance on a country-level basis.\n\nOn 31 March 2020, the Group merged its passive tower infrastructure in Italy with INWIT (see note 27 \u2018Acquisitions and disposals\u2019). On the date of the merger, management monitored performance of its operations in Italy on a country-wide basis and considered Vodafone Italy, including its passive tower infrastructure, to be one cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing as at 31 March 2020. No impairment in relation to Vodafone Italy would be necessary if impairment testing was performed on a post-merger basis at 31 March 2020.\n\nValue in use assumptions\n\nThe table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculations.\n\n| Assumptions used in value in use calculation | Germany | Italy | Spain | Ireland | Romania | Vodafone Automotive |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------------------|\n| Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate          | 7.5     | 10.3  | 9.2   | 7.6     | 10.2    | 9.1                 |\n| Long-term growth rate                       | 0.5     | 0.5   | 0.5   | 0.5     | 1.0     | 1.9                 |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA\u00b9                  | 3.8     | 0.2   | 8.2   | 3.0     | 8.0     | 31.3                |\n| Projected capital expenditure\u00b2              | 20.1-20.7 | 12.5-13.4 | 16.2-18.1 | 10.7-15.2 | 13.7-18.5 | 14.1-23.4 |\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nThe estimated recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s operations in Germany and Italy exceed their carrying values by \u20ac6.6 billion and \u20ac1.8 billion respectively. If the assumptions used in the impairment review were changed to a greater extent than as presented in the following table, the changes would, in isolation, lead to an impairment loss being recognised for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\n| Change required for carrying value to equal recoverable amount | Germany | Italy |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|\n| Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate                            | 1.1     | 1.7   |\n| Long-term growth rate                                         | (1.0)   | (2.0) |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA\u00b9                                    | (3.2)   | (3.1) |\n| Projected capital expenditure\u00b2                                | 11.4    | 7.9   |\nManagement considered the following reasonably possible changes in the key adjusted EBITDA\\(^1\\) and long-term growth rate assumptions, leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Due to increased uncertainty following the COVID-19 outbreak, management has widened the range of reasonably possible changes in the key adjusted EBITDA growth rate assumption to plus or minus 5 percentage points (2019: 2 percentage points). The sensitivity analysis presented is prepared on the basis that the reasonably possible change in each key assumption would not have a consequential impact on other assumptions used in the impairment review. The associated impact on the impairment assessment is presented in the table below, with the exception of Vodafone Automotive, where no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would materially change the impairment charge recognised.\n\nManagement believes that no reasonably possible or foreseeable change in the pre-tax adjusted discount rate or projected capital expenditure\\(^2\\) would cause the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount for any cash-generating unit to be materially different to the base case disclosed below.\n\n| Recoverable amount less carrying value (prior to recognition of impairment charge) | Germany | Italy | Spain | Ireland | Romania |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Base case as at 31 March 2020 | 6.6 | 1.8 | (0.8) | (0.6) | (0.1) |\n| Change in projected adjusted EBITDA\\(^1\\) | | | | | |\n| Decrease by 5pps | (3.3) | (1.0) | (2.3) | (1.1) | (0.3) |\n| Increase by 5pps | 18.4 | 5.1 | 0.9 | \u2013 | 0.1 |\n| Change in long-term growth rate | | | | | |\n| Decrease by 1pps | 0.2 | 0.8 | (1.5) | (0.8) | (0.2) |\n| Increase by 1pps | 15.8 | 3.0 | \u2013 | (0.4) | \u2013 |\n\nThe carrying values for Vodafone UK, Portugal, Czech Republic and Hungary include goodwill arising from acquisitions and/or the purchase of operating licences or spectrum rights. While the recoverable amounts for these operating companies are not materially greater than their carrying value, each has a lower risk of giving rise to an impairment that would be material to the Group given their relative size or the composition of their carrying value.\n\nIf the assumptions used in the impairment review were changed to a greater extent than as presented in the following table, the changes would, in isolation, lead to an impairment loss being recognised in the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\n| Change required for carrying value to equal recoverable amount | UK pps | Portugal pps | Czech Republic pps | Hungary pps |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate | 1.1 | 1.5 | 1.7 | 1.9 |\n| Long-term growth rate | (1.3) | (1.6) | (1.8) | (2.2) |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA\\(^1\\) | (2.3) | (3.4) | (4.0) | (3.9) |\n| Projected capital expenditure\\(^2\\) | 4.5 | 7.1 | 12.5 | 9.1 |\n\nNotes:\n1. Projected adjusted EBITDA is expressed as the compound annual growth rates in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\n2. Projected capital expenditure, which excludes licences and spectrum, is expressed as capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\n\n**VodafoneZiggo**\n\nThe recoverable amount for VodafoneZiggo is not materially greater than its carrying value. If adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause significant deterioration in the operations of VodafoneZiggo and the entity\u2019s expected future cash flows, this may lead to an impairment loss being recognised.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n4. Impairment losses (continued)\n\nYear ended 31 March 2019\n\nThe disclosures below for the year ended 31 March 2019 are as previously disclosed in the 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2020 Annual Reports. For the year ended 31 March 2019, the Group recorded impairment charges of \u00a32.9 billion, \u20ac0.3 billion, and \u20ac0.3 billion in respect of the Group\u2019s investments in Spain, Romania and Vodafone Idea respectively. The impairment charges with respect to Spain and Romania relate solely to goodwill and the impairment charge with respect to Vodafone Idea relates to the joint venture\u2019s carrying value. All impairment charges are recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating (loss)/profit. The recoverable amounts for Spain and Romania are \u20ac7.1 billion and \u20ac0.7 billion respectively and are based on value in use calculations. The recoverable amount for the Group\u2019s stake in Vodafone Idea is \u20ac1.6 billion and is based on its fair value less costs of disposal.\n\nFollowing challenging current trading and economic conditions, management reassessed the expected future business performance in Spain. Following this reassessment, projected cash flows are lower and this led to an impairment charge with respect to the Group\u2019s investment in Spain. The impairment charge with respect to the Group\u2019s investment in Romania was driven by an increase in the yield on Romanian government bonds which increased the discount rate and management\u2019s reassessment of the long-term growth rate applied beyond the five year business plan.\n\nVodafone Idea Limited\n\nThe Group\u2019s investment in Vodafone Idea was tested for impairment at 31 March 2019 in accordance with applicable IFRS. Impairment testing was considered appropriate as a result of market conditions and declines in the quoted share price of the company during the period.\n\nThe market environment in India remained highly challenging with significant pricing pressure, which led to industry consolidation but a significantly lower level of profitability and greater pressure on financing. Management continues to consider it reasonable to assume an overall significantly lower level of profitability and greater pressure on financing, however the timing and magnitude remains highly uncertain. Accordingly, there are a wide range of potential outcomes in deriving a current view of future business performance, cash flows and debt financing requirements for value in use purposes.\n\nManagement concluded that the fair value less costs of disposal based on an observable share price is the appropriate basis to determine the recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s investment in Vodafone Idea for the purpose of impairment testing for the year ended 31 March 2019. Where the recoverable amount is less than the investment\u2019s carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and an impairment is recognised.\n\nThe investment in Vodafone Idea was also tested for impairment as at 30 September 2018. The share price of INR38.55 implied a recoverable amount of INR152 billion (\u20ac1.6 billion) which was lower than the carrying value of the investment at the same date. An impairment charge of \u20ac0.3 billion was recognised to reduce the carrying value of the joint venture in the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nFollowing the formal announcement of the terms of Vodafone Idea\u2019s rights issue on 20 March 2019, the Vodafone Idea share price went \u2018ex-rights\u2019 on 29 March 2019 and closed at INR18.25. Based on information available to management on 31 March 2019, the recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s investment in Vodafone Idea was determined based on key assumptions relating to the number of new shares to which management intended to subscribe (8.8 billion) and the associated cost under the terms of the rights issue (INR12.5 per share). After taking into account these key assumptions and the quoted share price, the recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s interest in Vodafone Idea was determined to be INR123 billion (\u20ac1.6 billion) as at 31 March 2019.\n\nVodafone Idea\u2019s share price is observable in a quoted market and is considered a level 1 input under the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. As management also considered the observable and unquoted inputs related to the number and cost of the new shares to be issued under the rights issue, the recoverable amount quoted above is considered to be a level 2 valuation under the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe recoverable amount is \u20ac0.2 billion higher than the carrying value of the investment as at 31 March 2019 and no further changes to the carrying value or impairment charge recognised in September 2018 are required.\n\nThe carrying value of Vodafone Idea that was tested for impairment was dependent on a wide range of assumptions, including the level of market pricing and the realisation of anticipated merger-related operating expenses and capital expenditure synergies. Should any of the assumptions not materialise, in whole or in part, these will impact the entity\u2019s expected future cash flows and may result in a future impairment. The carrying value is also dependent on the ability of the entity to refinance its liabilities as they fall due. Should this not be achievable, this will impact the liquidity of Vodafone Idea and will result in a future impairment, in whole or in part, of the Group\u2019s investment.\n\nBased solely on the closing share price of Vodafone Idea on 13 May 2019, the recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s 45.2% interest would be \u20ac0.6 billion lower than the recoverable amount as at 31 March 2019. No adjustment was made to the carrying value of the Vodafone Idea joint venture as this was considered a non-adjusting event.\n\nValue in use assumptions\n\nThe table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculations.\n\n| Assumptions used in value in use calculation | Germany | Italy | Spain | Romania |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Pre-tax adjusted discount rate              | 8.3     | 10.5  | 9.3   | 11.1    |\n| Long-term growth rate                       | 0.5     | 1.0   | 0.5   | 1.0     |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA\u00b9                 | 2.9     | (0.1) | 9.2   | 3.8     |\n| Projected capital expenditure\u00b2             | 16.9\u201319.9 | 12.2\u201312.5 | 17.1\u201318.4 | 12.1\u201312.7 |\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Projected adjusted EBITDA is expressed as the compound annual growth rates in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\n\n2. Projected capital expenditure, which excludes licences and spectrum, is expressed as capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\nSensitivity analysis\n\nThe estimated recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s operations in Germany, Italy, Spain and Romania exceed their carrying values by \u20ac7.4 billion, \u20ac2.7 billion, \u20ac0.5 billion and \u20ac0.1 billion respectively. If the assumptions used in the impairment review were changed to a greater extent than as presented in the following table, the changes would, in isolation, lead to an impairment loss being recognised for the year ended 31 March 2019.\n\n| Change required for carrying value to equal recoverable amount | Germany | Italy | Spain | Romania |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Pre-tax adjusted discount rate                                | 2.1     | 2.5   | 0.5   | 1.2     |\n| Long-term growth rate                                         | (2.2)   | (2.9) | (0.7) | (1.5)   |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA                                    | (4.9)   | (4.6) | (1.3) | (2.0)   |\n| Projected capital expenditure                                 | 15.4    | 11.2  | 2.7   | 3.3     |\n\nNotes:\n1. Projected adjusted EBITDA is expressed as the compound annual growth rates in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\n2. Projected capital expenditure, which excludes licences and spectrum, is expressed as capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\n\nManagement considered the following reasonably possible changes in the key EBITDA assumption while leaving all other assumptions unchanged. The associated impact on the impairment assessment is presented in the table below.\n\nManagement believes that no reasonably possible or foreseeable change in any of the other assumptions included in the table above would cause the carrying value of any cash-generating unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.\n\n| Recoverable amount less carrying value | Decrease by 2pps | Base case | Increase by 2pps |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Germany                               | 4.2              | 7.4       | 10.8            |\n| Italy                                 | 1.5              | 2.7       | 4.1             |\n| Spain                                 | (0.3)            | 0.5       | 1.4             |\n| Romania                               | \u2013                | 0.1       | 0.2             |\n\nNote:\n1. Projected adjusted EBITDA is expressed as the compound annual growth rates in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\n\nThe carrying values for Vodafone UK, Portugal and Ireland include goodwill arising from their acquisition by the Group and/or the purchase of operating licences or spectrum rights. While the recoverable amounts for these operating companies are not materially greater than their carrying value, each has a lower risk of giving rise to impairment that would be material to the Group given their relative size or the composition of their carrying value.\n\nThe changes in the following table to assumptions used in the impairment review would have, in isolation, led to an impairment loss being recognised in the year ended 31 March 2019.\n\n| Change required for carrying value to equal recoverable amount | UK | Ireland | Portugal |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----|---------|----------|\n| Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate                            | 0.7| 1.2     | 0.7      |\n| Long-term growth rate                                         | (0.9)| (1.4) | (0.7)   |\n| Projected adjusted EBITDA                                    | (1.9)| (2.7) | (1.4)   |\n| Projected capital expenditure                                 | 3.3| 8.4     | 3.4      |\n\nNotes:\n1. Projected adjusted EBITDA is expressed as the compound annual growth rates in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\n2. Projected capital expenditure, which excludes licences and spectrum, is expressed as capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.\n\nVodafoneZiggo\n\nFollowing the merger, the recoverable amount for VodafoneZiggo is not materially greater than its carrying value. If adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause significant deterioration in the operations of VodafoneZiggo and the entity\u2019s expected future cash flows, this may lead to an impairment loss being recognised.\n5. Investment income and financing costs\n\nInvestment income comprises interest received from short-term investments and other receivables. Financing costs mainly arise from interest due on bonds and commercial paper issued, bank loans and the results of hedging transactions used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate movements.\n\n|                      | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Investment income:** |         |         |         |\n| Financial assets measured at amortised cost | 306     | 157     | 286     |\n| Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss | 24      | 91      | 147     |\n| **Total investment income** | **330** | **248** | **433** |\n| **Financing costs:** |         |         |         |\n| Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost |         |         |         |\n| Bonds | 1,722 | 1,580 | 1,194 |\n| Lease liabilities | 374 | 330 | \u2013 |\n| Bank loans and other liabilities | 463 | 626 | 419 |\n| Interest on derivatives | (485) | (354) | (139) |\n| Mark-to-market on derivatives | (1,070) | 1,162 | 424 |\n| Foreign exchange | 23 | 205 | 190 |\n| **Total financing costs** | **1,027** | **3,549** | **2,088** |\n| **Net financing costs** | **697** | **3,301** | **1,655** |\n\nNotes:\n1. Components of financing costs for 2020 and 2019 have been represented to align with the 2021 presentation, primarily combining interest costs on derivatives that were previously shown as items within hedging relationships and other liabilities. There is no impact on total financing costs.\n2. Interest capitalised for the year ended 31 March 2021 was \u20ac17 million (2020: \u20ac25 million, 2019: \u20acnil)\n6. Taxation\n\nThis note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.\n\nCurrent tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group\u2019s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate either using management\u2019s estimate of the most likely outcome where the issues are binary, or the expected value approach where the issues have a range of possible outcomes. The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and any penalties, if applicable, as part of the income tax expense.\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nSuch assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group\u2019s assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nTax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nTax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.\n\n| Income tax expense | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| United Kingdom corporation tax expense/(credit): | | | |\n| Current year | 24 | 42 | 21 |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years | 3 | (6) | (9) |\n| **Total** | **27** | **36** | **12** |\n| Overseas current tax expense/(credit): | | | |\n| Current year | 872 | 900 | 1,098 |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years | (30) | 80 | (48) |\n| **Total** | **842** | **980** | **1,050** |\n| **Total current tax expense** | **869** | **1,016** | **1,062** |\n| Deferred tax on origination and reversal of temporary differences: | | | |\n| United Kingdom deferred tax | (94) | (318) | (232) |\n| Overseas deferred tax | 3,089 | 552 | 666 |\n| **Total deferred tax expense** | **2,995** | **234** | **434** |\n| **Total income tax expense** | **3,864** | **1,250** | **1,496** |\n\nUK operating profits are more than offset by statutory allowances for capital investment in the UK network and systems plus ongoing interest costs including those arising from the \u20ac10.7 billion of spectrum payments to the UK government in 2000, 2013 and 2018.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n6.

Deferred tax liability | (2,103) |\n| **31 March 2020** | **21,503** |\n\nNotes:\n1. Comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2020 have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. See note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d.\n2. The Group does not discount its deferred tax assets. This is in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n6. Taxation (continued)\n\nFactors affecting the tax charge in future years\n\nThe Group\u2019s future tax charge, and effective tax rate, could be affected by several factors including: tax reform in countries around the world, including any arising from the OECD\u2019s or European Commission\u2019s work on the taxation of the digital economy and European Commission initiatives such as the proposed tax and financial reporting directive or as a consequence of state aid investigations, future corporate acquisitions and disposals, any restructuring of our businesses and the resolution of open tax issues (see below).\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the European Commission published its full decision in relation to its investigation into the \u2018group financing exemption\u2019 (GFE) in the UK\u2019s controlled foreign company rules and whether the GFE constituted unlawful State Aid. It concluded the GFE does not constitute unlawful state aid when the managing of the financing activities is outside the UK. As the Group\u2019s Luxembourg financing activities are properly established and operate in accordance with EU and local law as well as the OECD\u2019s transfer pricing guidelines, we do not anticipate any significant impact as a result of the Commission\u2019s findings.\n\nIn March 2021, the UK government announced its intention to increase the corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% effective from 1 April 2023. The increased rate is not yet substantively enacted but when it does this will increase the value of our deferred tax assets by approximately \u20ac350 million.\n\nThe Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. The Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise. As at 31 March 2021, the Group holds provisions for such potential liabilities of \u20ac606 million (2020: \u20ac638 million). These provisions relate to multiple issues, across the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.\n\nAs the tax impact of a transaction can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the Group\u2019s overall profitability and cash flows in future periods. See note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows:\n\n| Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised | Expiring within 5 years \u00a3m | Expiring beyond 6 years \u00a3m | Unlimited \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised     | 63                        | 222                       | 86,623       | 86,908  |\n|                                                   | 245                       | 13,217                    | 23,479       | 36,941  |\n|                                                   | **308**                   | **13,439**                | **110,102**  | **123,849** |\n\nAt 31 March 2020, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward were as follows:\n\n| Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised | Expiring within 5 years \u00a3m | Expiring beyond 6 years \u00a3m | Unlimited \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised     | 531                       | 143                       | 99,828       | 100,502 |\n|                                                   | 759                       | 9,404                     | 22,772       | 32,935  |\n|                                                   | **1,290**                 | **9,547**                 | **122,600**  | **133,437** |\n\nDeferred tax assets on losses in Luxembourg\n\nIncluded in the table above are losses of \u20ac69,742 million (2019: \u20ac82,372 million) that have arisen in Luxembourg companies. A deferred tax asset of \u20ac17,394 million (2020: \u20ac20,544 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses, as we conclude it is probable that the Luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. These tax losses principally arose from historical impairments, primarily following the acquisition of the Mannesmann Group in 2000. These losses arose prior to the 2017 tax reform in Luxembourg and are available to carry forward indefinitely.\n\nThe Luxembourg companies hold investments in the Group\u2019s operating companies which are assessed for impairment for local GAAP financial statements using the Group\u2019s value in use calculations (see note 4 \u201cImpairment losses\u201d). Impairments and reversals of impairments are recorded in the local GAAP financial statements and therefore carrying values and valuation methodology differs from the goodwill assessment for the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements. This assessment can give rise to tax deductible impairments or taxable reversals of previous impairments.\n\nFollowing the 2017 tax reform in Luxembourg, tax losses expire after 17 years and are only used after any pre-existing losses. In the years ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2020 the Luxembourg companies had tax deductible impairments resulting in additional tax losses. No deferred tax asset is recognised for these losses on the basis that they are not forecast to be used prior to the expiry of their 17 year life. In a period where pre-existing tax losses are not utilised due to impairments arising the forecast utilisation timeframe extends by one year.\n\nThe reversal of impairments can result in a significant reduction to our deferred tax assets and the period over which these assets can be utilised. In the year ended 31 March 2021 a reversal of previous impairments of \u20ac12 billion has arisen in Luxembourg. This represents taxable income against which the brought forward losses can be used. This is the main driver of the reduction in the losses, and the associated deferred tax asset, compared to the prior period.\nThe Luxembourg companies\u2019 recurring profits are derived from the Group\u2019s internal financing, centralised procurement and international roaming activities. These activities have consistently generated taxable profits of over \u20ac1bn per annum throughout their existence. The Group has reviewed the latest 5 year forecasts for the Luxembourg companies, including their ability to continue to generate income beyond this period. The forecasts consider the impact of the current market conditions on the existing financing activities, including the current view of interest rates, levels of intragroup financing, as well as the future profits generated from the procurement and roaming activities. The value in use calculations take into account all information at the balance sheet and the Group does not forecast potential future impairments or reversals of impairments.\n\nThis assessment also included a review of the commercial structures supporting the profits generated from these activities and considered the factors, under the Group\u2019s control, which could impact the ability of these activities to generate taxable profits. We have assessed that the current structure continues to be sustainable under the tax laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and the Group\u2019s intentions to keep these activities in Luxembourg remains unchanged.\n\nBased on the current forecasts, \u20ac2,881 million of the deferred tax asset is forecast to be used within the next 10 years, and \u20ac4,891 million used within 20 years. The losses are projected to be fully utilised over the next 59 to 62 years. The increase in the recovery period over the prior year is principally a result of market conditions, including lower interest rates, driving margins lower on existing financing activities and the impact of a forecast reduction in levels of intercompany debt over the 5 year period as the Group\u2019s operating companies align their debt metrics more closely to those of Vodafone Group Plc.\n\nAn increase or decrease in the forecast income in Luxembourg in each year of 5%-10% would change the period over which the losses will be fully utilised by 2 to 5 years. The Group uses a change in forecast income to understand the impact that a change in interest rates or level of debt advanced by the Luxembourg companies could have on the recovery period of the losses.\n\nAny future changes in tax law, including those driven by OECD, EU or domestic tax reforms or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect on the use of the Luxembourg losses, including the period over which these losses can be utilised. On the basis that future changes in tax laws are unknown, the profit forecasts assume that existing tax laws continue.\n\nBased on the above factors the Group concludes that it is probable that the Luxembourg companies will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which it will use these losses.\n\nIn addition to the above, \u20ac12,975 million (2020: \u20ac9,242 million) of the Group\u2019s Luxembourg losses expire after 13 to 17 years and no deferred tax asset is recognised as they will expire before we can use these losses. The remaining losses do not expire. We also have \u20ac9,136 million (2020: \u20ac9,136 million) of Luxembourg losses in a former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group company, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised.\n\n**Deferred tax assets on losses in Germany**\n\nThe Group has tax losses of \u20ac16,296 million (2020: \u20ac17,160 million) in Germany arising on the write down of investments in Germany in 2000. The losses are available to use against both German federal and trade tax liabilities and they do not expire.\n\nA deferred tax asset of \u20ac2,529 million (2020: \u20ac2,662 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the German business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the German business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business. In the period beyond the 5 year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent in the terminal period and based on these and our expectations for the German business we believe it is probable the German losses will be fully utilised.\n\nBased on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 8 to 16 years. A 5%-10% change in the forecast profits of the German business would alter the utilisation period by 1 to 2 years.\n\n**Deferred tax assets on losses in Spain**\n\nThe Group has tax losses of \u20ac4,334 million (2020: \u20ac4,281 million) in Spain which are available to offset against the future profits of the Grupo Corporativo ONO business. The losses do not expire and no deferred tax asset is recognised for these losses due to the trading environment in Spain.\n\n**Other tax losses**\n\nThe Group has losses amounting to \u20ac8,285 million (2020: \u20ac7,500 million) in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised, in line with the prior year.\n\nThe remaining losses relate to a number of other jurisdictions across the Group. There are also \u20ac2,092 million (2020: \u20ac1,514 million) of unrecognised temporary differences relating to treasury items and other items.\n\nNo deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further \u20ac7,522 million (2020: \u20ac7,130 million) of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n7. Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nThe Group classifies certain of its assets that it expects to dispose as either discontinued operations or as held for sale.\n\nThe Group classifies non-current assets and liabilities within disposal groups (\u2018assets\u2019) as held for sale if the assets are available immediately for sale in their present condition, management is committed to a plan to sell the assets under usual terms, it is highly probable that their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of the initial classification.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the consolidated statement of financial position and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale; this also applies in respect of assets held by equity accounted associates and joint ventures.\n\nWhere operations constitute a separately reportable segment (see note 2 \u201cRevenue disaggregation and segmental analysis\u201d) and have been disposed of, or are classified as held for sale, the Group classifies such operations as discontinued.\n\nDiscontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations in the Group consolidated income statement. Discontinued operations are also excluded from segment reporting. All other notes to the financial statements include amounts for continuing operations, unless indicated otherwise.\n\nDiscontinued operations\n\nOn 20 March 2017, Vodafone announced the agreement to combine its subsidiary, Vodafone India Limited (excluding its 42% stake in Indus Towers Limited), with Idea Cellular in India. Consequently, Vodafone India Limited has been accounted for as a discontinued operation for the period up to 31 August 2018, the date the transaction completed, the results of which are detailed below.\n\n### Income statement and segment analysis of discontinued operations\n\n|                      | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Revenue              | \u2013       | \u2013       | 1,561   |\n| Cost of sales        | \u2013       | \u2013       | (1,185) |\n| Gross profit         | \u2013       | \u2013       | 376     |\n| Selling and distribution expenses | \u2013       | \u2013       | (92)    |\n| Administrative expenses | \u2013       | \u2013       | (134)   |\n| Operating profit     | \u2013       | \u2013       | 150     |\n| Financing costs      | \u2013       | \u2013       | (321)   |\n| Loss before taxation | \u2013       | \u2013       | (171)   |\n| Income tax credit    | \u2013       | \u2013       | 56      |\n| Loss after tax of discontinued operations | \u2013       | \u2013       | (115)   |\n| Loss on sale of disposal group | \u2013       | \u2013       | (3,420) |\n| Loss for the financial year from discontinued operations | \u2013       | \u2013       | (3,535) |\n\n### Loss per share from discontinued operations\n\n|                      | 2021 eurocents | 2020 eurocents | 2019 eurocents |\n|----------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| \u2013 Basic              | \u2013              | \u2013              | (12.80)c       |\n| \u2013 Diluted            | \u2013              | \u2013              | (12.80)c       |\n\n### Total comprehensive expense for the financial year from discontinued operations\n\n|                      | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2019 \u20acm |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Attributable to owners of the parent | \u2013       | \u2013       | (3,535) |\n\nNote:\n1. Results for the five months ended 31 August 2018 when the transaction completed.\n**Assets and liabilities held for sale**\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2021 comprise the Group\u2019s 28.1% interest in Indus Towers. The Group\u2019s interest in Indus Towers has been provided as security against both certain bank borrowings (see note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d) and partly to the pledges provided to the new Indus Towers entity under the terms of the merger between erstwhile Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel (see note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d).\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2020 comprised a 24.95% interest in Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited (VHA) and the Group\u2019s 55% interest in Vodafone Egypt. On 26 June 2020, VHA and TPG Telecom Limited completed their merger (see note 12 \u201cInvestments in associates and joint arrangements\u201d for further details). On 21 December 2020, the Group announced that its discussions with Saudi Telecom Company had ended. Consequently, the prior year comparatives in the consolidated statement of financial position have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. There is no net impact on either Total assets or Total equity and liabilities, although certain line items have been re-presented, as detailed below.\n\n**Assets and liabilities held for sale and the impact of the reclassification of Vodafone Egypt**\n\nThe table below discloses the impacted line items only.

Intangible assets\n\nThe statement of financial position contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill and licences and spectrum. Goodwill, which arises when we acquire a business and pay a higher amount than the fair value of its net assets primarily due to the synergies we expect to create, is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews. Licences and spectrum are amortised over the life of the licence. For further details see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised at fair value when the Group completes a business combination. The determination of the fair values of the separately identified intangibles, is based, to a considerable extent, on management\u2019s judgement.\n\nGoodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group\u2019s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.\n\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is evidence that it may be impaired. Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing exchange rate at each reporting period date.\n\nNegative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.\n\nOn disposal of a subsidiary or a joint arrangement, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss recognised in the income statement on disposal.\n\nFinite lived intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets with finite lives are stated at acquisition or development cost, less accumulated amortisation. The amortisation period and method is reviewed at least annually. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.\n\nLicence and spectrum fees\n\nAmortisation periods for licence and spectrum fees are determined primarily by reference to the unexpired licence period, the conditions for licence renewal and whether licences are dependent on specific technologies. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives from the commencement of related network services.\n\nComputer software\n\nComputer software comprises software purchased from third parties as well as the cost of internally developed software. Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and are probable of producing future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs of software development include employee costs and directly attributable overheads.\n\nSoftware integral to an item of hardware equipment is classified as property, plant and equipment.\n\nCosts associated with maintaining software programs are recognised as an expense when they are incurred.\n\nAmortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life from the date the software is available for use.\n\nOther intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets, including brands and customer bases, are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortisation is charged to the income statement, over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date they are available for use, on a straight-line basis. The amortisation basis adopted for each class of intangible asset reflects the Group\u2019s consumption of the economic benefit from that asset. From 1 April 2019, the Group revised the method of allocating the amortisation of acquired customer base intangibles over their useful economic lives from a sum of digits calculation to a straight-line basis.\n\nEstimated useful lives\n\nThe estimated useful lives of finite lived intangible assets are as follows:\n\n| Intangible Asset                  | Useful Life |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|\n| Licence and spectrum fees        | 3 - 25 years|\n| Computer software                | 3 - 5 years |\n| Brands                           | 1 - 10 years|\n| Customer bases                   | 2 - 32 years|\n### 10.

Customer bases and Other elements of intangible assets have been presented separately for the current reporting period and the comparative period has been re-presented on the same basis.\n2. The comparative balances as at 31 March 2020 have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. See note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d. The impact of the re-presentation is to increase the net book value of Goodwill by \u20ac107 million, licence and spectrum fees by \u20ac324 million, Computer software by \u20ac57 million and decrease Other by \u20ac2 million compared to amounts previously reported.\n\nFor licences and spectrum and other intangible assets, amortisation is included within the cost of sales line within the consolidated income statement.\n\nThe net book value and expiry dates of the most significant licences are as follows:\n\n| Expiry dates | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|--------------|---------|---------|\n| Germany      | 2025/2033/2040 | 3,564 | 4,208 |\n| Italy        | 2029/2037 | 3,429 | 3,683 |\n|              | 2022/2023/2033/2038/ | 1,383 | 1,801 |\n\nThe remaining amortisation period for each of the licences in the table above corresponds to the expiry date of the respective licence. A summary of the Group\u2019s most significant spectrum licences can be found on pages 238 and 239.\n11. Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group makes significant investments in network equipment and infrastructure \u2014 the base stations and technology required to operate our networks \u2014 that form the majority of our tangible assets. All assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives. For further details on the estimation of useful economic lives, see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nLand and buildings held for use are stated in the statement of financial position at their cost, less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nAmounts for equipment, fixtures and fittings, which includes network infrastructure assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nAssets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment losses. Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.\n\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.\n\nDepreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives, as follows:\n\n| Land and buildings          | 25 - 50 years |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|\n| Freehold buildings          | 25 - 50 years|\n| Leasehold premises          | the term of the lease |\n\n| Equipment, fixtures and fittings | 1 - 35 years |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|\n| Network infrastructure and other | 1 - 35 years |\n\nDepreciation is not provided on freehold land.\n\nRight-of-use assets arising from the Group\u2019s lease arrangements are depreciated over their reasonably certain lease term, as determined under the Group\u2019s leases policy (see note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d and \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 for details).\n\nThe gain or loss arising on the disposal, retirement or granting of a finance lease on an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between any proceeds from sale or receivables arising on a lease and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.\n### 11.

The comparative balances as at 31 March 2020 have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. See note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d. The impact of the re-presentation is to increase the net book value of owned assets including Land and buildings by \u20ac37 million and Equipment, fixtures and fittings by \u20ac818 million, compared to amounts previously reported.\n\nIncluded in the net book value of land and buildings and equipment, fixtures and fittings are assets in the course of construction, which are not depreciated, with a cost of \u20ac15 million (2020: \u20ac34 million) and \u20ac2,243 million (2020: \u20ac1,914 million) respectively. Also included in the book value of equipment, fixtures and fittings are assets leased out by the Group under operating leases, with a cost of \u20ac2,930 million (2020: \u20ac2,966 million), accumulated depreciation of \u20ac1,828 million (2020: \u20ac1,678 million) and net book value of \u20ac1,102 million (2020: \u20ac1,288 million).\n\nRight-of-use assets arising from the Group\u2019s lease arrangements are recorded within property, plant and equipment:\n\n|                      | 2021 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| Property, plant and equipment (owned assets) | 28,670 | 28,364 |\n| Right-of-use assets\u00b2 | 12,573  | 11,749  |\n| **31 March**         | **41,243** | **40,113** |\n\n**Note:**\n\n2.

The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. See Note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d. The impact of the re-presentation is to increase the net book value of right-of-use assets by \u20ac61 million, compared to amounts previously reported.\n12. Investments in associates and joint arrangements\n\nThe Group holds interests in associates in Kenya and in India, where we have significant influence, as well as in a number of joint arrangements in the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, India and Australia, where we share control with one or more third parties. For further details see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nInterests in joint arrangements\n\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control; that is, when the relevant activities that significantly affect the investee\u2019s returns require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint ventures.\n\nGains or losses resulting from the contribution or sale of a subsidiary as part of the formation of a joint arrangement are recognised in respect of the Group\u2019s entire equity holding in the subsidiary.\n\nJoint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement or that other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case. The Group\u2019s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis.\n\nAny goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Group\u2019s interest in a joint operation is accounted for in accordance with the Group\u2019s accounting policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary.\n\nJoint ventures\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nAt the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group\u2019s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the joint venture is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures, other than those joint ventures or part thereof that are held for sale (see note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d), are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group\u2019s share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment. The Group\u2019s share of post-tax profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group\u2019s interest in that joint venture are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.\n\nAssociates\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint arrangement.\n\nSignificant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but where the Group does not have control or joint control over those policies.\n\nAt the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group\u2019s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the same equity method of accounting used for joint ventures, described above.\n\nJoint operations\n\nThe Company\u2019s principal joint operation has share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares and is indirectly held, and principally operates in the UK. The financial and operating activities of the operation are jointly controlled by the participating shareholders and are primarily designed for all but an insignificant amount of the output to be consumed by the shareholders.\n\n| Name of joint operation | Principal activity | Country of incorporation or registration | Percentage shareholdings 2021 | Percentage shareholdings 2020 |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited | Network infrastructure | UK | 50.0 | 50.0 |\n\nNote:\n\n1 Effective ownership percentages of Vodafone Group Plc rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n12.

Effective ownership percentages of Vodafone Group Plc rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent.\n2. At 31 March 2021 the fair value of the Group\u2019s interest in Vodafone Idea Limited was INR 118 billion (\u20ac1,375 million) (2020: INR 40 billion (\u20ac476 million)) based on the quoted share price on the National Stock Exchange of India.\n3. At 31 March 2021 the fair value of the Group\u2019s interest in INWIT SpA was \u20ac3,026 million (2020: \u20ac3,345 million) based on the quoted share price on the Milan Stock Exchange.\n4. On 26 June 2020, Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited and TPG Telecom Limited completed their merger. The merged entity was admitted to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on 30 June 2020 and is known as TPG Telecom Limited. At 31 March 2021 the fair value of the Group\u2019s interest in TPG Telecom Limited was AUD 2,946 million (\u20ac1,911 million), based on the quoted share price on ASX.\n\nVodafone Idea Limited\n\nThe Group\u2019s carrying value in Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) reduced to \u20acnil at 30 September 2019. The Group\u2019s share of VIL\u2019s losses not recognised at 31 March 2021 is \u20ac3,562 million (31 March 2020: \u20ac1,804 million). Significant uncertainties exist in relation to VIL\u2019s ability to generate the cash flow it requires to settle or its ability to refinance its liabilities and guarantees as they fall due, including those relating to the AGR judgement (see note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d).\n\nThe value of the Group\u2019s 28.1% shareholding in Indus Towers Limited is, in part, dependent on the income generated by Indus Towers Limited from tower rentals to major customers, including VIL. Any inability of these major customers to pay such amounts in the future may result in an impairment in the carrying value (31 March 2021: \u20ac1.3 billion) of the Group\u2019s investment in Indus Towers Limited.\n\nTPG Telecom Limited / Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited\n\nOn 26 June 2020, Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited (VHA) and TPG Telecom Limited (TPG) completed their merger to establish a fully integrated telecommunications operator in Australia. The merged entity was admitted to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on 30 June 2020 and is known as TPG Telecom Limited. Vodafone and Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Limited each own an economic interest of 25.05% in the merged unit, with the remaining 49.9% listed as free float on the ASX. The Group recorded a gain of \u20ac1,043 million in relation to the merger, which is reported in Other income/(expense) within the Consolidated income statement. The financial information presented in the tables below includes debt held within the structure that holds the Group\u2019s interest in TPG.\n\nThe following table provides aggregated financial information for the Group\u2019s joint ventures as it relates to the amounts recognised in the income statement, statement of comprehensive income and statement of financial position.\n\n| Name of joint venture | Investment in joint ventures 2021 | Investment in joint ventures 2020 | (Loss)/profit from continuing operations 2021 | (Loss)/profit from continuing operations 2020 | (Loss)/profit from continuing operations 2019 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Vodafone Idea Limited | \u2013                                 | \u2013                                 | (2,546)                                       | (903)                                         |\n| VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V. | 1,190                             | 1,630                             | (232)                                         | (64)                                          | (239)                                         |\n| INWIT S.p.A.          | 2,920                             | 3,345                             | 3                                             | \u2013                                             | \u2013                                             |\n| TPG Telecom Limited   | 104                               | (466)                             | 98                                            | (35)                                          | (23)                                          |\n| Indus Towers Limited  | \u2013                                 | 766                               | \u2013                                             | 19                                            | 55                                            |\n| Other                | 35                                | 48                                | (15)                                          | (125)                                         | (14)                                          |\n| Total                | 4,249                             | 5,323                             | (146)                                         | (2,751)                                       | (1,124)                                       |\n\nNotes:\n1.

Other investments\n\nThe Group holds a number of other listed and unlisted investments, mainly comprising managed funds, deposits and government bonds.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nOther investments comprising debt and equity instruments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs.\n\nDebt securities that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Debt securities that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost are measured at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nEquity securities are classified and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following derecognition of the investment.\n\n| Included within non-current assets: | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Equity securities\u00b9                 | 128     | 77      |\n| Debt securities\u00b2                   | 797     | 715     |\n| **Total**                          | **925** | **792** |\n\nDebt securities include \u20ac0.8 billion (2020: \u20ac0.7 billion) of loan notes issued by VodafoneZiggo Holding B.V.\n\nCurrent other investments comprise the following:\n\n| Included within current assets: | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|---------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Short-term investments:         |         |         |\n| Bonds and debt securities\u00b3\u2074     | 1,053   | 1,681   |\n| Managed investment funds\u00b9       | 2,954   | 2,451   |\n| **Total**                       | **4,007** | **4,132** |\n| Collateral assets\u2074              | 3,107   | 1,115   |\n| Other investments\u2075              | 2,045   | 1,842   |\n| **Total**                       | **9,159** | **7,089** |\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 2 classification, which comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n2. Items are measured at amortised cost and the carrying amount approximates fair value.\n3. Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 1 classification, which comprises financial instruments where fair value is determined by unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n4. Collateral assets are measured at amortised cost and were previously presented as part of short-term investments within bonds and debt securities.\n5. \u20ac1,057 million (2020: \u20ac1,017 million) is measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 1. The remaining items are measured at amortised cost and the carrying amount approximates fair value.\n\nThe Group invests surplus cash positions across a portfolio of short-term investments to manage liquidity and credit risk whilst achieving suitable returns. Collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments result in cash being paid/(held), repayable when the derivatives are settled. These assets do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents but are included in the Group\u2019s net debt based on their liquidity.\n\nBonds and debt securities includes \u20acnil (2020: \u20ac194 million) of highly liquid Japanese; \u20ac499 million (2020: \u20acnil) German and \u20ac554 million (2020: \u20acnil) French government securities; \u20acnil (2020: \u20ac1,016 million) of German government backed securities and \u20acnil (2020: \u20ac471 million) of UK government bonds.\n\nManaged investment funds of \u20ac2,954 million (2020: \u20ac2,451 million) are in funds with liquidity of up to 90 days.\n\nCollateral assets of \u20ac3,107 million (2020: \u20ac1,115 million) represents collateral paid on derivative financial instruments.\n\nOther investments are excluded from net debt based on their liquidity and primarily consist of restricted debt securities including amounts held in qualifying assets by Group insurance companies to meet regulatory requirements.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n14. Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance. Derivative financial instruments with a positive market value are reported within this note as are contract assets, which represent an asset for accrued revenue in respect of goods or services delivered to customers for which a trade receivable does not yet exist, and finance lease receivables recognised where the Group acts as a lessor. See note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d for more information on the Group\u2019s leasing activities.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nTrade receivables represent amounts owed by customers where the right to receive payment is conditional only on the passage of time. Trade receivables that are recovered in instalments from customers over an extended period are discounted at market rates and interest revenue is accreted over the expected repayment period. Other trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value. When the Group establishes a practice of selling portfolios of receivables from time to time these portfolios are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income; all other trade receivables are recorded at amortised cost.\n\nThe carrying value of all trade receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables recorded at amortised cost is reduced by allowances for lifetime estimated credit losses. Estimated future credit losses are first recorded on the initial recognition of a receivable and are based on the ageing of the receivable balances, historical experience and forward looking considerations. Individual balances are written off when management deems them not to be collectible.\n\n| Included within non-current assets: | 2021 | 2020 Re-presented |\n|-----------------------------------|------|-------------------|\n| Trade receivables                 | 52   | 68                |\n| Trade receivables held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 278  | 261               |\n| Net investment in leases          | 104  | 118               |\n| Contract assets                   | 528  | 583               |\n| Contract-related costs            | 580  | 628               |\n| Other receivables                 | 76   | 84                |\n| Prepayments                       | 247  | 227               |\n| Derivative financial instruments\u00b2| 2,912| 8,424             |\n| **Total**                         | **4,777** | **10,393** |\n\n| Included within current assets:   | 2021 | 2020 Re-presented |\n|-----------------------------------|------|-------------------|\n| Trade receivables                 | 3,625| 3,848             |\n| Trade receivables held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 466  | 556               |\n| Net investment in leases          | 36   | 32                |\n| Contract assets                   | 3,038| 3,012             |\n| Contract-related costs            | 1,364| 1,293             |\n| Amounts owed by associates and joint ventures | 184  | 362               |\n| Other receivables                 | 889  | 916               |\n| Prepayments                       | 1,082| 953               |\n| Derivative financial instruments\u00b2| 239  | 752               |\n| **Total**                         | **10,923** | **11,724** |\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. See note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d.

Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 2 classification, which comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n\nThe Group\u2019s trade receivables and contract assets are classified at amortised cost unless stated otherwise and are measured after allowances for future expected credit losses, see note 22 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d for more information on credit risk.\n\nThe carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, which are measured at amortised cost, approximate their fair value and are predominantly non-interest bearing.\n\nThe Group\u2019s contract-related costs comprise \u20ac1,883 million (2020: \u20ac1,855 million) relating to costs incurred to obtain customer contracts and \u20ac61 million (2020: \u20ac66 million) relating to costs incurred to fulfil customer contracts; an amortisation and impairment expense of \u20ac1,497 million (2020: \u20ac1,475 million) was recognised in operating profit during the year.\n\nIn February 2020 \u20ac357m of trade receivables were reclassified from amortised cost to fair value through other comprehensive income as the balances may now be sold to a third party. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March.\n15. Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables mainly consist of amounts owed to suppliers that have been invoiced or are accrued and contract liabilities relating to consideration received from customers in advance. They also include taxes and social security amounts due in relation to the Group\u2019s role as an employer. Derivative financial instruments with a negative market value are reported within this note.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nTrade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.\n\n| Included within non-current liabilities: | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Other payables                          | 424  | 340  |\n| Accruals                                | 47   | 60   |\n| Contract liabilities                    | 519  | 612  |\n| Derivative financial instruments\u00b2      | 3,919| 4,177|\n| **Total**                               | **4,909** | **5,189** |\n\n| Included within current liabilities:   | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Trade payables                         | 6,739| 6,696|\n| Amounts owed to associates and joint ventures | 36   | 51   |\n| Other taxes and social security payable | 1,196| 1,185|\n| Other payables                         | 2,349| 2,040|\n| Accruals\u00b2                              | 5,688| 5,077|\n| Contract liabilities                   | 1,971| 2,081|\n| Derivative financial instruments\u00b2      | 91   | 589  |\n| **Total**                               | **18,070** | **17,719** |\n\nNotes:\n1.

Provisions\n\nA provision is a liability recorded in the statement of financial position, where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount that will be paid, and is therefore often estimated. The main provisions we hold are in relation to asset retirement obligations, which include the cost of returning network infrastructure sites to their original condition at the end of the lease and claims for legal and regulatory matters.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors\u2019 best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Where the timing of settlement is uncertain amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date.\n\nAsset retirement obligations\n\nIn the course of the Group\u2019s activities, a number of sites and other assets are utilised which are expected to have costs associated with decommissioning. The associated cash outflows are substantially expected to occur at the dates of decommissioning of the assets to which they relate, and are long term in nature.\n\nLegal and regulatory\n\nThe Group is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including where the Group has received notifications of possible claims. The Directors of the Company, after taking legal advice, have established provisions considering the facts of each case. For a discussion of certain legal issues potentially affecting the Group see note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOther provisions\n\nOther provisions comprise various amounts including those for restructuring costs. The associated cash outflows for restructuring costs are primarily less than one year.\n\n|                      | Asset retirement obligations \u20acm | Legal and regulatory \u20acm | Restructuring \u20acm | Other \u20acm | Total \u20acm |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|----------|----------|\n| 31 March 2019        | 757                             | 507                     | 434              | 619      | 2,317    |\n| Exchange movements   | (16)                            | (2)                     | (2)              | 5        | (15)     |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries | 56                          | 18                      | 33               | 71       | 178      |\n| Disposal of subsidiaries | (69)                         | \u2013                       | (4)              | (2)      | (75)     |\n| Amounts capitalised in the year | 270                         | \u2013                       | \u2013                | \u2013        | 270      |\n| Amounts charged to the income statement | \u2013                          | 122                     | 549              | 163      | 834      |\n| Utilised in the year - payments | (34)                        | (98)                    | (452)            | (127)    | (711)    |\n| Amounts released to the income statement | (9)                         | (45)                    | (13)             | (199)    | (266)    |\n| 31 March 2020\u00b9       | 955                             | 502                     | 545              | 530      | 2,532    |\n| Exchange movements   | 6                               | (11)                    | 4                | 7        | 6        |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries | 6                            | \u2013                       | \u2013                | \u2013        | 6        |\n| Amounts capitalised in the year | 294                         | \u2013                       | \u2013                | \u2013        | 294      |\n| Amounts charged to the income statement | \u2013                          | 138                     | 153              | 167      | 458      |\n| Utilised in the year - payments | (32)                        | (54)                    | (243)            | (175)    | (504)    |\n| Amounts released to the income statement | (7)                         | (47)                    | (33)             | (66)     | (153)    |\n| 31 March 2021        | 1,222                           | 528                     | 426              | 463      | 2,639    |\n\nNote:\n\n\u00b9 The comparative balances as at 31 March 2020 have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale.

The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. See Note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d. The impact of the re-presentation is to increase cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statement of financial position by \u20ac273 million.\n2. Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 1 classification, which comprises financial instruments where fair value is determined by unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe carrying amount of balances at amortised cost approximates their fair value.\n\nCash and cash equivalents of \u20ac1,741 million (2020: \u20ac1,460 million) are held in countries with restrictions on remittances but where the balances could be used to repay subsidiaries\u2019 third party liabilities. In addition, those balances could also be used to repay \u20ac879 million (2020: \u20ac885 million) of intercompany liabilities as at 31 March 2021.\n20. Leases\n\nThe Group leases assets from other parties (the Group is a lessee) and also leases assets to other parties (the Group is a lessor). This note describes how the Group accounts for leases and provides details about its lease arrangements.\n\nLease accounting policy under IFRS 16\n\nAs a lessee\n\nWhen the Group leases an asset, a \u2018right-of-use asset\u2019 is recognised for the leased item and a lease liability is recognised for any lease payments to be paid over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, being the present value of the lease payments paid or payable, plus any initial direct costs incurred in entering the lease and less any lease incentives received.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the asset\u2019s useful life or the end of the lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any periods for which the Group is \u2018reasonably certain\u2019 to exercise any extension options (see below). The useful life of the asset is determined in a manner consistent to that for owned property, plant and equipment (as described in note 11). If right-of-use assets are considered to be impaired, the carrying value is reduced accordingly.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the value of the lease payments over the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date and are usually discounted using the incremental borrowing rates of the applicable Group entity (the rate implicit in the lease is used if it is readily determinable). Lease payments included in the lease liability include both fixed payments and in-substance fixed payments during the term of the lease.\n\nAfter initial recognition, the lease liability is recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate (e.g. an inflation related increase) or if the Group\u2019s assessment of the lease term changes; any changes in the lease liability as a result of these changes also results in a corresponding change in the recorded right-of-use asset.\n\nAs a lessor\n\nWhere the Group is a lessor, it determines at inception whether the lease is a finance or an operating lease. When a lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset then the lease is a finance lease; otherwise the lease is an operating lease.\n\nWhere the Group is an intermediate lessor, the interests in the head lease and the sub-lease are accounted for separately and the lease classification of a sub-lease is determined by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.\n\nIncome from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Income from finance leases is recognised at lease commencement with interest income recognised over the lease term.\n\nLease income is recognised as revenue for transactions that are part of the Group\u2019s ordinary activities (primarily leases of handsets or other equipment to customers, leases of wholesale access to the Group\u2019s fibre and cable networks). The Group uses IFRS 15 principles to allocate the consideration in contracts between any lease and non-lease components.\n\nAccounting policies under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 for the year ended 31 March 2019\n\nThe Group adopted IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and comparative information was not restated. Financial information for the year ended 31 March 2019 is reported in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4, as described below.\n\nAs a lessee\n\nLeases were classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the lessee; all other leases were classified as operating leases.\n\nAssets held under finance leases were recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments as determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor was included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments were apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Depreciation and finance charges were recognised in the income statement.\n\nRentals payable under operating leases were charged, and lease incentives received, were credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\n\nAs a lessor\n\nLessor accounting applied for the year ended 31 March 2019 was consistent with that described for IFRS 16 above, except for the lease classification, as a finance or operating lease, of a sub-lease which was determined by reference to the underlying asset.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n20. Leases (continued)\n\nThe Group\u2019s leasing activities\n\nAs a lessee\nThe Group leases buildings for its retail stores, offices and data centres, land on which to construct mobile base stations, space on mobile base stations to place active RAN equipment and network space (primarily rack space or duct space). In addition, the Group leases fibre and other fixed connectivity to provide internal connectivity for the Group\u2019s operations and on a wholesale basis from other operators to provide fixed connectivity services to the Group\u2019s customers.\n\nThe Group\u2019s general approach to determining lease term by class of asset is described in note 1 under critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty.\n\nMost of the Group\u2019s leases include future price increases through fixed percentage increases, indexation to inflation measures on a periodic basis or rent review clauses. Other than fixed percentage increases the lease liability does not reflect the impact of these future increases unless the measurement date has passed. The Group\u2019s leases contain no material variable payments clauses other than those related to the number of operators sharing space on third party mobile base stations.\n\nThe Group sub-leases excess retail and office properties under both operating and finance leases; see disclosure on the Group\u2019s leasing activities as a lessor below.\n\nOperational lease periods\nWhere practicable the Group seeks to include extension or break options in leases to provide operational flexibility, therefore many of the Group\u2019s lease contracts contain optional periods. The Group\u2019s policy on assessing and reassessing whether it is reasonably certain that the optional period will be included in the lease term is described in note 1 under critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty.\n\nAfter initial recognition of a lease, the Group only reassesses the lease term when there is a significant event or a significant change in circumstances, which was not anticipated at the time of the previous assessment. Significant events or significant changes in circumstances could include merger and acquisition or similar activity, significant expenditure on the leased asset not anticipated in the previous assessment, or detailed management plans indicating a different conclusion on optional periods to the previous assessment. Where a significant event or significant change in circumstances does not occur, the lease term and therefore lease liability and right-of-use asset value, will decline over time.\n\nThe Group\u2019s cash outflow for leases in the year ended 31 March 2021 was \u20ac4,234 million (2020: \u20ac3,902 million) and, absent significant future changes in the volume of the Group\u2019s activities or strategic changes to use more or fewer owned assets this level of cash outflow from leases would be expected to continue for future periods, subject to contractual price increases. The future cash outflows included within lease liabilities are shown in the maturity analysis below on page 171. The maturity analysis only includes the reasonably certain payments to be made; cash outflows in these future periods will likely exceed these amounts as payments will be made on optional periods not considered reasonably certain at present and on new leases entered into in future periods.\n\nThe Group\u2019s leases for customer connectivity are normally either under regulated access or network sharing or similar preferential access arrangements and as a result the Group normally has significant flexibility over the term it can lease such connections for; generally the notice period required to cancel the lease is less than the notice period included in the service contract with the end customer. As a result, the Group does not have any significant cash exposure to optional periods on customer connectivity as the Group can cancel the lease when the service agreement ends. In some circumstances the Group is committed to minimum spend amounts for connectivity leases, which are included within reported lease liabilities.\n\nSale and leaseback\nIn the year ended 31 March 2020, the Group sold its Italian mobile base station assets to Infrastruttura Wireless Italiane S.p.A. (\u2018INWIT\u2019) (see note 27 \u201cAcquisitions and disposals\u201d for additional details), and entered into an agreement to lease back space on these and other INWIT mobile base station towers to locate network equipment for 8 years (see note 30 \u201cRelated party transactions\u201d). The Group de-recognised assets related to the mobile base stations with a net book value of \u20ac548 million. A total gain on disposal of \u20ac4,100 million was realised as a result of the disposal; \u20ac744 million of this gain, reflecting the gain on the proportion of sold towers that has been retained through the leaseback, was recorded in the year ended 31 March 2020 as a reduction in the value of the right-of-use asset recognised for the leaseback of tower space and will be realised as a reduction in depreciation over the lease term.\n\nOther sale and leaseback transactions entered into by the Group were not material, individually or in aggregate.\nAmounts recognised in the primary financial statements in relation to lessee transactions\n\nRight-of-use assets\nThe carrying value of the Group\u2019s right-of-use assets, depreciation charge for the year and additions during the year are disclosed in note 11 \u201cProperty, plant and equipment\u201d.\n\nLease liabilities\nThe Group\u2019s lease liabilities are disclosed in note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d. The maturity profile of the Group\u2019s lease liabilities is as follows:\n\n| Maturity                        | 2021  | 2020 Re-presented |\n|---------------------------------|-------|-------------------|\n| Within one year                 | 3,419 | 3,198             |\n| In more than one year but less than two years | 2,142 | 2,018             |\n| In more than two years but less than three years | 1,661 | 1,542             |\n| In more than three years but less than four years | 1,457 | 1,337             |\n| In more than four years but less than five years | 1,316 | 1,128             |\n| In more than five years         | 4,696 | 4,443             |\n| **Total**                       | **14,691** | **13,666** |\n\nEffect of discounting\nLease liability (note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d)\n\n|                  | 2021  | 2020 Re-presented |\n|------------------|-------|-------------------|\n| (1,659)          | (1,548) |                  |\n| **Total**        | **13,032** | **12,118** |\n\nNote:\n1. The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. See Note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d. The impact of the re-presentation is to increase total undiscounted lease liabilities by \u20ac75 million and total discounted lease liabilities by \u20ac55 million, respectively, compared to the amount previously reported.\n\nAt 31 March 2021 the Group has entered into lease contracts with payment obligations with an undiscounted value of \u20ac82 million (2020: \u20ac67 million) that had not commenced at 31 March 2021.\n\nInterest expense on lease liabilities for the year is disclosed in note 5 \u201cInvestment income and financing costs\u201d.\n\nThe Group has no material liabilities under residual value guarantees and makes no material payments for variable payments not included in the lease liability. The Group does not apply either the short term or low value expedient options in IFRS 16.\n\nAs a lessor\nThe Group has a wide range of lessor activities with consumer and enterprise customers, other telecommunication companies and other companies. With consumer and enterprise customers, the Group generates lease income from the provision of handsets, routers and other communications equipment. The Group provides wholesale access to the Group\u2019s fibre and cable networks and leases out space on the Group\u2019s owned mobile base stations to other telecommunication companies. In addition, the Group sub-leases retail stores to franchise partners in certain markets and leases out surplus assets (e.g. vacant offices and retail stores) to other companies.\n\nLessor transactions are classified as operating or finance leases based on whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset. Leases are individually assessed, but generally, the Group\u2019s lessor transactions are classified as:\n\n- Operating leases where the Group is lessor of space on owned mobile base stations, provides wholesale access to its fibre and cable networks or provides routers or similar equipment to fixed customers; and\n- Finance leases where the Group is sub-lessee of handsets or similar items in back-to-back arrangements or where surplus assets are sublet out for all or substantially all of the remaining head lease term.\n\nThe Group\u2019s income as a lessor in the year is as follows:\n\n|                  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|------------------|-------|-------|\n| Operating leases |       |       |\n| Lease revenue (note 2 \u201cRevenue disaggregation and segmental analysis\u201d) | 559   | 502   |\n| Income from leases not recognised as revenue | 180   | 203   |\n\nThe Group\u2019s net investments in leases are disclosed in note 14 \u201cTrade and other receivables\u201d. The committed amounts to be received from the Group\u2019s operating leases are as follows:\n\n| Maturity                        | 31 March 2021 | 31 March 2020 |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Within one year                 | 510           | 442           |\n| In one to two years             | 261           | 211           |\n| In two to three years           | 175           | 114           |\n| In three to four years          | 134           | 53            |\n| In four to five years           | 115           | 44            |\n| In more than five years         | 395           | 223           |\n| **Total**                       | **1,590**     | **1,087**     |\n\nThe Group has no material lease income arising from variable lease payments.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n21. Borrowings\n\nThe Group\u2019s sources of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes come from a range of committed bank facilities and through short-term and long-term issuances in the capital markets including bond and commercial paper issues and bank loans. Liabilities arising from the Group\u2019s lease arrangements are also reported in borrowings; see note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d. We manage the basis on which we incur interest on debt between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates depending on market conditions using interest rate derivatives. The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements on certain monetary items.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nInterest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception), and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated fair value hedge relationship, fair value adjustments are recognised in accordance with our policy (see note 22 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d). Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing. Where bonds issued with certain conversion rights are identified as compound instruments they are initially measured at fair value with the nominal amounts recognised as a component in equity and the fair value of future coupons included in borrowings. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nBorrowings\n\n|                      | 2021  | 2020  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|\n|                      | Re-presented | \u20acm | \u20acm |\n| Non-current borrowings |       |      |\n| Bonds                | (44,634) | (47,500) |\n| Bank loans           | (761)   | (1,500) |\n| Lease liabilities (note 20) | (9,909) | (9,134) |\n| Bank borrowings secured against Indian assets | (385) | (1,346) |\n| Other borrowings2    | (3,583) | (3,469) |\n|                      | (59,272) | (62,949) |\n| Current borrowings   |       |      |\n| Bonds                | (2,251) | (1,912) |\n| Bank loans           | (658)   | (1,380) |\n| Lease liabilities (note 20) | (3,123) | (2,984) |\n| Collateral liabilities | (962)   | (5,292) |\n| Bank borrowings secured against Indian assets | (862) | \u2013 |\n| Other borrowings     | (632)   | (408)  |\n|                      | (8,488) | (11,976) |\n| Borrowings           | (67,760) | (74,925) |\n\nNotes:\n1. The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. See Note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d. The impact of the re-presentation is to increase current borrowings and non-current borrowings by \u20ac150 million and \u20ac57 million, respectively, compared to amounts previously reported.\n2. Includes \u20ac3,312 million (2020: \u20ac3,215 million) of spectrum licence payables.\n\nThe fair value of the Group\u2019s financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost approximate to fair value with the exception of long-term bonds with a carrying value of \u20ac44,634 million (2020: \u20ac47,500 million) which have a fair value of \u20ac48,630 million (2020: \u20ac48,216 million). Fair value is based on level 1 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices.\n\nThe Group\u2019s borrowings include certain bonds which have been designated in hedge relationships, which are carried at \u20ac1.4 billion higher than their euro equivalent redemption value. In addition, where bonds are issued in currencies other than euros, the Group has entered into foreign currency swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption. The impact of these swaps are not reflected in borrowings and would decrease the euro equivalent redemption value of the bonds by \u20ac0.1 billion.\n\nCommercial paper programmes\n\nWe currently have US and euro commercial paper programmes of US$15 billion and \u20ac8 billion respectively which are available to be used to meet short-term liquidity requirements. At 31 March 2021 \u20acnil (2020: \u20acnil) was drawn under the euro commercial paper programme. The US commercial paper programme remained undrawn.\n\nThe commercial paper facilities were supported by US$4.0 billion (\u20ac3.4 billion) and \u20ac4.0 billion of syndicated committed bank facilities. No amounts had been drawn under these facilities.\nBonds\nWe have a \u20ac30 billion euro medium-term note programme and a US shelf programme which are used to meet medium to long-term funding requirements. At 31 March 2021 the total amounts in issue under these programmes split by currency were USD22.9 billion, \u20ac18.4 billion, \u00a33 billion, AUD1.2 billion, HKD2.1 billion, NOK2.2 billion, CHF0.7 billion and JPY10 billion.\n\nAt 31 March 2021 the Group had bonds outstanding with a nominal value equivalent to \u20ac45.4 billion. During the year ended 31 March 2021, bonds with a nominal value of \u20ac2 billion were issued under stand-alone documentation and bonds with a nominal value \u20ac2.2 billion were issued by Vantage Towers A.G. under their own \u20ac5 billion debt issuance programme.\n\nIn March 2021, the Group also repurchased its own bonds with a nominal value of \u20ac1.5 billion and USD2.1 billion.\n\nBonds mature between 2021 and 2059 (2020: 2020 and 2059) and have interest rates between 0.0% and 7.875% (2020: 0.0% and 7.875%).\n\nMandatory convertible bonds\nOn 12 March 2019 the Group issued \u00a33.4 billion of subordinated mandatory convertible bonds (\u2018MCBs\u2019) split into two equal tranches of \u00a31.7 billion, the first tranche matured on 12 March 2021 and the second tranche matures on 12 March 2022 with coupons of 1.2% and 1.5% respectively. These were recognised as compound instruments with nominal values of \u00a33.4 billion (\u00a33.8 billion) recognised as a component of shareholders\u2019 funds in equity and the fair value of future coupons \u00a30.1 billion (\u00a30.1 billion) recognised as a financial liability in borrowings. At 31 March 2021, the conversion price of the bonds was \u00a31.2055 per share. The Group\u2019s strategy is to hedge the equity risk associated with the MCB issuance to any future movement in its share price by an option strategy designed to hedge the economic impact of share price movements during the term of the bonds. Should the Group decide to buy back ordinary shares to mitigate dilution resulting from the conversion the hedging strategy will provide a hedge for the repurchase price.\n\nTreasury shares\nThe Group held a maximum of 2,043,732,147 (2020: 2,091,894,691) of its own shares during the year which represented 7.1% (2020: 7.3%) of issued share capital at that time.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n22. Capital and financial risk management\n\nThis note details the treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well as the exposure and sensitivity of the Group to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange risk, and the policies in place to monitor and manage these risks.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nFinancial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that provides a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.\n\nFinancial liabilities under put option arrangements\n\nThe Group has an obligation to pay a fixed rate of return to minority equity shareholders in the Group\u2019s subsidiary Kabel Deutschland AG, under the terms of a court-imposed domination and profit and loss transfer agreement. This agreement also provides the minority shareholders the option to put their shareholding to Vodafone at a fixed price per share. The obligation to purchase the shares has been recognised as a financial liability and no non-controlling interests are recognised in respect of minority shareholders. Interest costs are accrued at the agreed rate of return and recognised in financing costs.\n\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group\u2019s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative financial instruments. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group\u2019s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group\u2019s risk management strategy. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as:\n\n- hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (\u2018fair value hedges\u2019);\n- hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments (\u2018cash flow hedges\u2019); or\n- hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship or a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations when the effective portion of changes in value are deferred to other comprehensive income. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. For fair value hedges, the carrying value of the hedged item is also adjusted for changes in fair value for the hedged risk, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement for the period.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.\n\nFor cash flow hedges, when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nFor net investment hedges, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.\nCapital management\n\nThe following table summarises the capital of the Group at 31 March:\n\n|                                | 2021  | 2020  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|\n|                                | \u20acm    | \u20acm    |\n| Borrowings (note 21)           | 67,760| 74,925|\n| Cash and cash equivalents (note 19) | 5,821 | (13,557) |\n| Derivative financial instruments included in trade and other receivables (note 14) | (3,151) | (9,176) |\n| Derivative financial instruments included in trade and other payables (note 15) | 4,010 | 4,767 |\n| Short-term investments (note 13) | (4,007) | (4,132) |\n| Collateral assets (note 13)     | (3,107) | (1,115) |\n| Financial liabilities under put option arrangements | 492 | 1,850 |\n| Equity                          | 57,816| 62,625|\n| Capital                         | 113,992| 116,187|\n\nNote:\n1. The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale, as outlined in the notes referenced above.\n\nThe Group\u2019s policy is to borrow centrally using a mixture of long-term and short-term capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet anticipated funding requirements. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries.\n\nDividends from associates and to non-controlling shareholders\n\nDividends from our associates are generally paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors or shareholders of the individual operating and holding companies, and we have no rights to receive dividends except where specified within certain of the Group\u2019s shareholders\u2019 agreements. Similarly, other than ongoing dividend obligations to the Kabel Deutschland A.G. minority shareholders, should they continue to hold their minority stake, we do not have existing obligations under shareholders\u2019 agreements to pay dividends to non-controlling interest partners of our subsidiaries or joint ventures. The amount of dividends received and paid in the year are disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nPotential cash outflows from option agreements and similar arrangements\n\nPut options issued as part of the hedging strategy for the MCBs permit the holders to exercise against the Group at maturity of the option if there is a decrease in our share price. Under the terms of the options, settlement must be made in cash which will equate to the reduced value of shares from the initial conversion price, adjusted for dividends declared, on 2,494 million shares.\n\nSale of trade receivables\n\nDuring the year, the Group sold certain trade receivables to a number of financial institutions. Whilst there are no repurchase obligations in respect of these receivables, the Group provided credit guarantees which would only become payable if default rates were significantly higher than historical rates. The credit guarantee is not considered substantive and substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to the purchaser at the date of sale, therefore the receivables were derecognised. The maximum payable under the guarantees at 31 March 2021 was \u20ac1,503 million (2020: \u20ac1,283 million). No provision has been made in respect of these guarantees as the likelihood of a cash outflow has been assessed as remote.\n\nSupplier financing arrangements\n\nThe Group offers suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain financing (SCF). SCF allows suppliers that decide to use it to receive funding earlier than the invoice due date. At 31 March 2021, the financial institutions that run the SCF programmes had purchased \u20ac2.3 billion (2020: \u20ac2.4 billion) of supplier invoices, principally from larger suppliers. The Group does not provide any financial guarantees to the financial institutions under this programme and continues to cash settle supplier payables in accordance with their contractual terms. As such, the programme does not change the Group\u2019s net debt, trade payable balances or cash flows.\n\nThe Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues to hold the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as borrowings; these indicators include whether the payment terms exceed the shorter of customary payment terms in the industry or 180 days. At 31 March 2021, none of the payables subject to supplier financing arrangements met the criteria to be reclassified as borrowings.\n\nFinancial risk management\n\nThe Group\u2019s treasury function centrally manages the Group\u2019s funding requirement, net foreign exchange exposure, interest rate management exposures and counterparty risk arising from investments and derivatives. Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the Board, most recently in May 2021. A treasury risk committee comprising of the Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Group Financial Controller, Group Corporate Finance Director, Group Treasury Director and Group Director of Financial Controlling and Operations meets three times a year to review treasury activities and its members receive management information relating to treasury activities on a quarterly basis. The Group\u2019s accounting function, which does not report to the Group Treasury Director, provides regular update reports of treasury activity to the Board. The Group\u2019s Internal Auditor reviews the internal control environment regularly.\n\nNo bonds issued by the Group or the Revolving Credit Facilities are subject to financial covenant ratios. Approximately \u20ac35 billion of issued bonds have a change of control clause. Only \u20ac350 million of EIB loans have a financial covenant requirement, which broadly equates to a net debt to EBITDA calculation. As at 31 March 2021, Vodafone was compliant with this financial covenant. The Group uses a number of derivative instruments for currency and interest rate risk management purposes only that are transacted by specialist treasury personnel. The Group mitigates banking sector credit risk by the use of collateral support agreements.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n22. Capital and financial risk management (continued)\n\nCOVID-19\nThe Group did not experience any significant issues as a result of disruption to financial markets as a result of COVID in FY21. The ongoing macro economic impact appears to be reducing, but remains uncertain. The Group\u2019s financial risk management policies seek to reduce the Group\u2019s exposure to any future disruption to financial markets, including any future impacts from COVID.\n\nThe Group has combined cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments of \u20ac9.8 billion, providing significant headroom over short-term liquidity requirements. Additionally the Group maintains undrawn revolving credit facilities of \u20ac7.4 billion euro equivalent. As at 31 March 2021 and after hedging, substantially all the Group\u2019s borrowings are held on a fixed interest basis, mitigating exposure to interest rate risk. The Group has no significant currency exposures other than positions in economic hedging relationships. The Group\u2019s credit risk under financing activities is spread across a portfolio of highly rated institutions to reduce counterparty exposures and derivative balances are substantially all collateralised. The Group\u2019s operating activities result in customer credit risk, for which provisions for expected credit losses are recognised. This customer related credit risk is generally short-term in duration and while COVID impacts on our customers had no material impact on credit loss provisioning at 31 March 2021.\n\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial asset leading to a financial loss for the Group. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and from its financing activities, the Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March to be:\n\n| Financial asset | 2021 (\u20acm) | 2020 (Re-presented) (\u20acm) |\n|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand (note 19) | 2,705 | 2,220 |\n| Repurchase agreements and bank deposits (note 19) | \u2013 | 2,202 |\n| Money market funds (note 19) | 3,116 | 9,135 |\n| Managed investment funds (note 13) | 2,954 | 2,451 |\n| Current bonds and debt securities (note 13) | 1,053 | 1,681 |\n| Non-current debt securities (note 13) | 797 | 715 |\n| Collateral assets (note 13) | 3,107 | 1,115 |\n| Other investments (note 13) | 2,045 | 1,842 |\n| Derivative financial instruments (note 14) | 3,151 | 9,176 |\n| Trade receivables (note 14) | 5,924 | 6,017 |\n| Contract assets and other receivables (note 14) | 4,531 | 4,595 |\n| Performance bonds and other guarantees (note 29) | 2,728 | 3,322 |\n| **Total** | **32,111** | **44,471** |\n\nNote:\n1 The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale and to include guarantees on trade receivables, performance bonds and other guarantees.\n2 Includes amounts guaranteed under sales of trade receivables.\n\nExpected credit loss\nThe Group has financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income that are subject to the expected credit loss model requirements of IFRS 9. Cash at bank and in hand and certain other investments are both classified and measured at amortised cost and subject to these impairment requirements. However, the identified expected credit loss is considered to be immaterial.\n\nInformation about expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets can be found under \u201coperating activities\u201d on page 177.\n\nFinancing activities\nThe Group invests in government securities on the basis they generate a fixed rate of return and are amongst the most creditworthy of investments available.\n\nMoney market investments are made in accordance with established internal treasury policies which dictate that an investment\u2019s long-term credit rating is no lower than mid BBB. Additionally, the Group invests in AAA unsecured money market mutual funds where the investment is limited to 10% of each fund.\n\nThe Group has two managed investment funds that hold fixed income euro securities with an average credit quality of AA.\n\nIn respect of financial instruments used by the Group\u2019s treasury function, the aggregate credit risk the Group may have with one counterparty is limited by (i) reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moody\u2019s, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor\u2019s; (ii) that counterparty\u2019s five year credit default swap (\u2018CDS\u2019) spread; and (iii) the sovereign credit rating of that counterparty\u2019s principal operating jurisdiction. Furthermore, collateral support agreements reduce the Group\u2019s exposure to counterparties who must post cash collateral when there is value due to the Group under outstanding derivative contracts that exceeds a contractually agreed threshold amount. When value is due to the counterparty the Group is required to post collateral on identical terms. Such cash collateral is adjusted daily as necessary.\nIn the event of any default, ownership of the cash collateral would revert to the respective holder at that point. Detailed below is the value of the cash collateral, which is reported within current borrowings, held by the Group at 31 March:\n\n| Collateral liabilities | 2021 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                        | 962     | 5,292   |\n\nAs discussed in note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d, the Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of the trustee of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme in respect of the funding deficit in the scheme and pledged security in relation to the Indus Towers merger. The Group has also pledged cash as collateral against derivative financial instruments as disclosed in note 13 \u201cOther investments\u201d.\n\n**Operating activities**\n\nCustomer credit risk is managed by the Group\u2019s business units which each have policies, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding trade receivables and contract assets are regularly reviewed to monitor any changes in credit risk with concentrations of credit risk considered to be limited given that the Group\u2019s customer base is large and unrelated. The Group applies the simplified approach and records lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets. Expected credit losses are measured using historical cash collection data for periods of at least 24 months wherever possible and grouped into various customer segments based on product or customer type. The historical loss rates are adjusted where macroeconomic factors, for example changes in interest rates or unemployment rates, or other commercial factors are expected to have a significant impact when determining future expected credit loss rates. For trade receivables the expected credit loss provision is calculated using a provision matrix, in which the provision increases as balances age, and for receivables paid in instalments and contract assets a weighted loss rate is calculated to reflect the period over which the amounts become due for payment by the customer. Trade receivables and contract assets are written off when each business unit determines there to be no reasonable expectation of recovery and enforcement activity has ceased.\n\nMovements in the allowance for expected credit losses during the year were as follows:\n\n|                  | Contract assets | Trade receivables held at amortised cost | Trade receivables held at fair value through other comprehensive income |\n|------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                  | 2021 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m | 2021 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m | 2021 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m |\n| 1 April          | 137     | 129     | 1,431   | 1,347   | 51      | 40      |\n| Exchange movements| 2       | (2)     | (47)    | (26)    | \u2013       | \u2013       |\n| Amounts charged to credit losses on financial assets | 63     | 73      | 592     | 576     | 9       | 11      |\n| Other1           | (101)   | (63)    | (496)   | (466)   | (3)     | \u2013       |\n| 31 March2        | 101     | 137     | 1,480   | 1,431   | 57      | 51      |\n\nNotes:\n1. Primarily utilisation of the provision.\n2. The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. See Note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d. The impact of the re-presentation is to increase the allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables held at amortised cost by \u00a365 million compared to amounts previously reported.\n\nExpected credit losses are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit and subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n22. Capital and financial risk management (continued)\n\nThe majority of the Group\u2019s trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days and largely comprise amounts receivable from consumers and business customers.\n\nThe following table presents information on trade receivables past due\u00b9 and their associated expected credit losses:\n\n| 31 March 2021 | Trade receivables at amortised cost past due |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|               | Due | 30 days or less | 31\u201360 days | 61\u2013180 days | 180 days+ | Total |\n| Gross carrying amount | 2,568 | 717 | 177 | 405 | 1,290 | 5,157 |\n| Expected credit loss allowance | (30) | (72) | (62) | (211) | (1,105) | (1,480) |\n| Net carrying amount | 2,538 | 645 | 115 | 194 | 185 | 3,677 |\n\n| 31 March 2020\u00b2 | Trade receivables at amortised cost past due |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|               | Due | 30 days or less | 31\u201360 days | 61\u2013180 days | 180 days+ | Total |\n| Gross carrying amount | 2,513 | 836 | 236 | 513 | 1,249 | 5,347 |\n| Expected credit loss allowance | (64) | (76) | (56) | (215) | (1,020) | (1,431) |\n| Net carrying amount | 2,449 | 760 | 180 | 298 | 229 | 3,916 |\n\nNote:\n1. Contract assets relate to amounts not yet due from customers. These amounts will be reclassified as trade receivables before they become due. Trade receivables at fair value through other comprehensive income are not materially past due.\n2. The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect that Vodafone Egypt is no longer held for sale. See Note 7 \u201cDiscontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\u201d. The impact of the re-presentation is to increase the gross carrying amount, expected credit loss allowance and net carrying amount of trade receivables held at amortised cost by \u20ac207 million, \u20ac65 million and \u20ac142 million, respectively, compared to amounts previously reported.\n\nLiquidity risk\n\nLiquidity is reviewed daily on at least a 12 month rolling basis and stress tested on the assumption that any commercial paper outstanding matures and is not reissued. The Group maintains substantial cash and cash equivalents which at 31 March 2021 amounted to cash \u20ac5.8 billion, \u20ac4.0 billion and US$4.0 billion (\u20ac3.4 billion) which mature in 2025 and 2026 respectively.\n\nThe Group manages liquidity risk on non-current borrowings by maintaining a varied maturity profile with a cap on the level of debt maturity in any one calendar year, therefore minimising refinancing risk. Non-current borrowings mature between 1 and 38 years.\n\nThe maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Group\u2019s non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:\n\n| Maturity profile\u00b3 | Bank loans | Bonds | Lease liabilities | Other\u2074 | Total borrowings | Trade payables and other financial liabilities | Total |\n|-------------------|------------|-------|------------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Within one year   | 674        | 3,774 | 3,419            | 2,516  | 10,383          | 15,304                                      | 25,687|\n| In one to two years | 174       | 3,329 | 2,142            | 2,575  | 8,220           | 49                                          | 8,269 |\n| In two to three years | 440       | 5,964 | 1,661            | 399    | 8,464           | \u2013                                           | 8,464 |\n| In three to four years | 173      | 2,784 | 1,457            | 166    | 4,580           | \u2013                                           | 4,580 |\n| In four to five years | 2        | 5,506 | 1,316            | 199    | 7,023           | \u2013                                           | 7,023 |\n| In more than five years | 23       | 45,538| 4,696            | 986    | 51,243          | \u2013                                           | 51,243|\n| **Total**         | **1,486** | **66,895** | **14,691** | **6,841** | **89,913** | **15,353** | **105,266** |\n\nEffect of discount/financing rates\n\n| 31 March 2021 | Bank loans | Bonds | Lease liabilities | Other\u2074 | Total borrowings | Trade payables and other financial liabilities | Total |\n|---------------|------------|-------|------------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Within one year | 1,500      | 3,617 | 3,198            | 5,750  | 14,065          | 15,250                                      | 29,315|\n| In one to two years | 746       | 4,682 | 2,018            | 316    | 7,762           | 67                                          | 7,829 |\n| In two to three years | 279       | 3,852 | 1,542            | 3,270  | 8,943           | \u2013                                           | 8,943 |\n| In three to four years | 369      | 8,242 | 1,337            | 390    | 10,338          | \u2013                                           | 10,338|\n| In four to five years | 181      | 2,845 | 1,128            | 166    | 4,320           | \u2013                                           | 4,320 |\n| In more than five years | 47,947   | 4,443 | 1,185            | 53,575 | \u2013               | \u2013                                           | 53,575|\n| **Total**         | **3,075** | **71,185** | **13,666** | **11,077** | **99,003** | **15,317** | **114,320** |\n\nEffect of discount/financing rates\n\n| 31 March 2020\u2074 | Bank loans | Bonds | Lease liabilities | Other\u2074 | Total borrowings | Trade payables and other financial liabilities | Total |\n|---------------|------------|-------|------------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Within one year | 2,880      | 49,412| 12,118           | 10,515 | 74,925          | 15,311                                      | 90,236|\n\nNotes:\n1.

There would be no material impact on equity.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the Group had limited exposure through interest rate derivatives and floating rate bonds referencing LIBOR and other interbank offered rates (IBORs).\n\n**Foreign exchange management**\n\nAs Vodafone\u2019s primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange its share price is quoted in sterling. Since the sterling share price represents the value of its future multi-currency cash flows, principally in euro, South African rand and sterling, the Group maintains the currency of debt and interest charges in proportion to its expected future principal cash flows and has a policy to hedge external foreign exchange risks on transactions denominated in other currencies above a certain de minimis level.\n\nAt 31 March 2021 13% of net debt was denominated in currencies other than euro (9% sterling, 3% South African rand and 1% other). This allows sterling, South African rand and other debt to be serviced in proportion to expected future cash flows and therefore provides a partial economic hedge against income statement translation exposure, as interest costs will be denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nUnder the Group\u2019s foreign exchange management policy, foreign exchange transaction exposure in Group companies is generally maintained at the lower of \u20ac5 million per currency per month or \u20ac15 million per currency over a six month period.\n\nThe Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances treated as investments in foreign operations. However, there is no net impact on equity for exchange rate movements on net investment hedging instruments as there would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation. At 31 March 2021 the Group held financial liabilities in a net investment hedge against the Group\u2019s South African rand operations. Sensitivity to foreign exchange movements on the hedging liabilities, analysed against a strengthening of the South African rand by 15% (2020: 11%) would result in a decrease in equity of \u20ac285 million (2020: \u20ac212 million) which would be fully offset by foreign exchange movements on the hedged net assets. In addition, cash flow hedges of principally US dollar borrowings would result in an increase in equity of \u20ac469 million (2020: \u20ac713 million) against a strengthening of US dollar by 6% (2020: 5%).\n\nThe Group profit and loss account is exposed to foreign exchange risk within both operating profit and financing income and expense. The principal reporting segment not generating income in euro is Vodacom, whose functional currency is predominantly South African Rand. Financing income and expense includes foreign currency gains/losses incurred on the translation of balance sheet items not held in functional currency. These are principally on certain borrowings, derivatives, and other investments denominated in sterling and US dollar.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n22. Capital and financial risk management (continued)\n\nThe following table details the Group\u2019s sensitivity to foreign exchange risk. The percentage movement applied to the currency is based on the average movements in the previous three annual reporting periods.\n\n| Currency | 2021 (\u20acm) | 2020 (\u20acm) |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| ZAR 15% change (2020: 11%) | Increase in operating profit | 152 | 126 |\n| USD 6% change (2020: 9%) | (Decrease) in profit before taxation | (46) | (64) |\n| GBP 3% change (2020: 2%) | (Decrease)/increase in profit before taxation | (23) | 63 |\n\nEquity risk\nThere is no material equity risk relating to the Group\u2019s equity investments which are detailed in note 13 \u201cOther investments\u201d.\n\nThe Group has hedged its exposure under the subordinated mandatory convertible bonds to any future movements in its share price by an option strategy designed to hedge the economic impact of share price movements during the term of the bonds. As at 31 March 2021 the Group\u2019s sensitivity to a movement of 7% (2020: 23%) in its share price would result in an increase or decrease in profit before tax of \u20ac283 million (2020: \u20ac767 million).\n\nRisk management strategy of hedge relationships\nThe risk strategies of the designated cash flow, fair value, and net investment hedges reflect the above market risk strategies.\n\nThe objective of the cash flow hedges is principally to convert foreign currency denominated fixed rate borrowings in US dollar, pound sterling, Australian dollar, Swiss Franc, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Norwegian krona and euro and US dollar floating rate borrowings into euro fixed rate borrowings and hedge the foreign exchange spot rate and interest rate risk. Derivative financial instruments designated in cash flow hedges are cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps. The swap maturity dates and liquidity profiles of the nominal cash flows match those of the underlying borrowings.\n\nThe objective of the net investment hedges is to hedge foreign exchange risk in foreign operations. Derivative financial instruments designated in net investment hedges are cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps. The hedging instruments are rolled on an ongoing basis as determined by the nature of the business.\n\nThe objective of the fair value hedges is to hedge a proportion of the Group\u2019s fixed rate euro denominated borrowing to a euro floating rate borrowing. The swap maturity dates match those of the underlying borrowing and the nominal cash flows are converted to quarterly payments.\n\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nFor hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings and investments, the Group uses a combination of cross-currency and foreign exchange swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk and enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match with the terms of the hedged item. Therefore the Group expects a highly effective hedging relationship with the swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items to change systematically in the opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying exchange rates and interest rates. The Group therefore performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness may occur due to:\n\na) The fair value of the hedging instrument on the hedge relationship designation date if the fair value is not nil;\n\nb) Changes in the contractual terms or timing of the payments on the hedged item; and\n\nc) A change in the credit risk of the Group or the counterparty with the hedging instrument.\n\nThe hedge ratio for each designation will be established by comparing the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item to determine their relative weighting; for all of the Group\u2019s existing hedge relationships the hedge ratio has been determined as 1:1.\n\nThe fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March. The valuation basis is level 2. This classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly. Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables in the statement of financial position.\nThe following table represents the carrying values and nominal amounts of derivatives in a continued hedge relationship as at 31 March.\n\n### At 31 March 2021\n\n| Cash flow hedges - foreign currency risk | Other comprehensive income | Weighted average |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| Cross-currency and foreign exchange swaps | Opening balance 1 April 2020 | Closing balance 31 March 2021 |\n| US dollar bonds | (3,922) | 501 | 2036 | 1.18 | 2.82 |\n| Australian dollar bonds | (26) | 104 | 2024 | 1.56 | 0.92 |\n| Swiss franc bonds | 28 | 26 | 2026 | 1.08 | 1.26 |\n| Pound sterling bonds | 94 | 228 | 2047 | 0.89 | 2.59 |\n| Hong Kong dollar bonds | (4) | 17 | 2028 | 9.08 | 1.48 |\n| Japanese yen bonds | 6 | 13 | 2037 | 128.53 | 2.47 |\n| Norwegian krona bonds | (3) | 29 | 2026 | 9.15 | 1.12 |\n\n### At 31 March 2020\n\n| Cash flow hedges - foreign currency risk | Other comprehensive income | Weighted average |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| Cross-currency and foreign exchange swaps | Opening balance 1 April 2019 | Closing balance 31 March 2020 |\n| US dollar bonds | (179) | 490 | 2035 | 1.18 | 2.67 |\n| Australian dollar bonds | (17) | 86 | 2024 | 1.56 | 0.92 |\n| Swiss franc bonds | 22 | 33 | 2026 | 1.08 | 1.26 |\n| Pound sterling bonds | 38 | 79 | 2043 | 0.85 | 2.04 |\n| Hong Kong dollar bonds | (13) | 8 | 2028 | 9.08 | 1.48 |\n| Japanese yen bonds | 2 | 4 | 2037 | 128.53 | 2.47 |\n| Norwegian krona bonds | 1 | 34 | 2026 | 9.15 | 1.12 |\n\n### Notes:\n1.

The carrying value of the bond includes \u00a376 million loss (2020: \u00a395 million loss) of cumulative fair value adjustment for the hedged interest rate risk. Net ineffectiveness on the fair value hedges, \u00a38 million gain (2020: \u00a38 million gain) is recognised in the income statement. The carrying value of bonds includes an additional \u00a374 million loss (2020: \u00a3689 million loss) in relation to fair value of bonds previously designated in fair value hedge relationships.\n4.

Amounts for the year ended 31 March 2020 have been re-presented to provide further disaggregation and to additionally include \u20ac170 million (1 April 2019: \u20ac949 million) of other financial liabilities. The prior year comparatives for borrowings have also been re-presented for Vodafone Egypt (see note 21).\n2. Includes \u20ac10,040 million recognised on transition to IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019.\n3. Primarily includes the recognition of spectrum licence payables.\nFair value and carrying value information\n\nThe carrying value and valuation basis of the Group\u2019s financial assets are set out in notes 13 \u201cOther investments\u201d, 14 \u201cTrade and other receivables\u201d and 19 \u201cCash and cash equivalents\u201d.

The carrying values approximate fair value for the Group\u2019s trade payables and other payables categories. For other financial liabilities a comparison of fair value and carrying value is disclosed in note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d.\n\nNet financial instruments\n\nThe table below shows the Group\u2019s financial assets and liabilities that are subject to offset in the balance sheet and the impact of enforceable master netting or similar agreements.\n\n| At 31 March 2021 | Gross amount \u00a3m | Amount set off \u00a3m | Amounts presented in balance sheet \u00a3m | Right of set off with derivative counterparties \u00a3m | Collateral assets/liabilities \u00a3m | Net amount \u00a3m |\n|------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| Derivative financial assets | 3,151 | \u2013 | 3,151 | (1,989) | (962) | 200 |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | (4,010) | \u2013 | (4,010) | 1,989 | 2,194 | 173 |\n| Total | (859) | \u2013 | (859) | \u2013 | 1,232 | 373 |\n\n| At 31 March 2020 | Gross amount \u00a3m | Amount set off \u00a3m | Amounts presented in balance sheet \u00a3m | Right of set off with derivative counterparties \u00a3m | Collateral assets/liabilities \u00a3m | Net amount \u00a3m |\n|------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| Derivative financial assets | 9,176 | \u2013 | 9,176 | (3,556) | (5,292) | 328 |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | (4,767) | \u2013 | (4,767) | 3,556 | 1,115 | (96) |\n| Total | 4,409 | \u2013 | 4,409 | \u2013 | (4,177) | 232 |\n\nNote:\n1. Excludes collateral of \u20ac913 million (2020: \u20acnil) pledged as initial margin that does not offset against existing mark to market balances as at 31 March.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for offset could be settled net in certain circumstances under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default from the other. Collateral may be offset and net settled against derivative financial instruments in the event of default by either party. The aforementioned collateral balances are recorded in \u201cother investments\u201d or \u201ccurrent borrowings\u201d respectively.\n\n23.

Post employment benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution retirement plans for our employees. The Group\u2019s largest defined benefit plan is in the UK. For further details see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nFor defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position. Defined benefit plan liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.\n\nOther movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group\u2019s share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group\u2019s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.\n\nBackground\n\nAt 31 March 2021 the Group operated a number of retirement plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group\u2019s philosophy is to provide access to defined contribution retirement plans where feasible and to manage legacy defined benefit retirement arrangements. Defined benefit plans provide benefits based on the employees\u2019 length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution plans offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit plans in Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States and the Group operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey. Defined contribution plans are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and the UK.\n\nIncome statement expense\n\n|                      | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Defined contribution plans | 204   | 180   | 166   |\n| Defined benefit plans  | 31    | 46    | 57    |\n| **Total amount charged to income statement (note 24)** | **235** | **226** | **223** |\n\nDefined benefit plans\n\nThe Group\u2019s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location. The Group\u2019s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution (DC) arrangements and/or State provision for future service.\n\nThe Group\u2019s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (Vodafone UK plan). Since June 2014 the Vodafone UK plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (CWW Section). Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the plans.\n\nThe main defined benefit plans are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Group. The trustee boards of the pension plans are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding regimes.\n\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension plans are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\n\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. The 31 March 2019 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan showed a net deficit of \u00a378 million (\u00a390 million) on the funding basis, comprising of a \u00a3173 million (\u00a3200 million) deficit for the Vodafone Section and a \u00a395 million (\u00a3110 million) surplus for the CWW Section.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n25. Post employment benefits (continued)\n\nThese plan-specific actuarial valuations will differ to the IAS 19 accounting basis, which is used to measure pension assets and liabilities presented in the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nFollowing the 2019 triennial valuation, the Group and trustees of the Vodafone UK plan agreed a funding plan to address the valuation deficit in the Vodafone Section over the period to 31 March 2025 and made a cash contribution on 4 September 2020 of \u00a380 million (\u20ac90 million) into the Vodafone Section. This cash payment was invested into an annuity policy issued by a third party insurance company which in turn entered into a reinsurance policy covering these risks with the Group\u2019s captive insurance company, see note 15 \u201cTrade and other payables\u201d. No further contributions are due in respect of the deficit revealed at the 2019 valuation.\n\nFunding plans are individually agreed for each of the Group\u2019s other defined benefit plans with the respective trustees or governing board, taking into account local regulatory requirements. It is expected that ordinary contributions of \u20ac78 million will be paid into the Group\u2019s defined benefit plans during the year ending 31 March 2022. The Group has also provided certain guarantees in respect of the Vodafone UK plan; further details are provided in note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe investment strategy for the UK plans is controlled by the trustees in consultation with the Group and the plans have no direct investments in the Group\u2019s equity securities or in property or other assets currently used by the Group. The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the trustee investment policy. The trustees aim to achieve the plan\u2019s investment objectives through investing partly in a diversified mix of growth assets which, over the long term, are expected to grow in value by more than the low risk assets. The low risk assets include cash and gilts, inflation and interest rate hedging and in substance insured pensioner annuity policies in both the Vodafone Section and CWW Sections of the Vodafone UK plan. A number of investment managers are appointed to promote diversification by assets, organisation and investment style and current market conditions and trends are regularly assessed, which may lead to adjustments in the asset allocation.\n\nActuarial assumptions\n\nThe Group\u2019s plan liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit method using the principal actuarial assumptions set out below:\n\n| Weighted average actuarial assumptions used at 31 March\u00b9: | 2021 % | 2020 % | 2019 % |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Rate of inflation\u00b2 | 2.9    | 2.2    | 2.9    |\n| Rate of increase in salaries | 2.7    | 2.5    | 2.7    |\n| Discount rate | 1.8    | 2.0    | 2.3    |\n\nNotes:\n1. Figures shown represent a weighted average assumption of the individual plans.\n2. The rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred revaluation are dependent on the rate of inflation.\n\nMortality assumptions used are based on recommendations from the individual local actuaries which include adjustments for the experience of the Group where appropriate. The Group\u2019s largest plan is the Vodafone UK plan. Further life expectancies assumed for the UK plans are 23.4/25.4 years (2020: 23.2/25.2 years) for a male/female pensioner currently aged 65 years and 25.4/27.4 (2020: 25.1/27.2 years) from age 65 for a male/female non-pensioner member currently aged 40.\n\nCharges made to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income (\u2018SOCI\u2019) on the basis of the assumptions stated above are:\n\n| 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|------|------|------|\n| Current service cost | 37 | 37 | 31 |\n| Past service costs\u00b9 \u00b2 | 2 | \u2013 | 16 |\n| Net interest (income)/charge | (8) | 9 | 10 |\n| **Total included within staff costs** | **31** | **46** | **57** |\n| Actuarial (losses)/gains recognised in the SOCI | (686) | 640 | (33) |\n\nNotes:\n1. Following a High Court judgement on 21 October 2018 which concluded that affected defined benefit plans should equalise pension benefits for men and women in relation to guaranteed minimum pension (\u2018GMP\u2019) benefits the Group has recorded a pre-tax past service cost of \u20ac16 million (\u00a314 million) in the year ended 31 March 2019.\n2. Following a further judgement on 20 November 2020 which concluded that affected defined benefit plans should also equalise transfer value payments for men and women in relation to guaranteed minimum pension (\u2018GMP\u2019) benefits the Group has recorded a pre-tax past service cost of \u20ac2 million (\u00a32 million) in the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nDuration of the benefit obligations\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 March 2021 is 21 years (2020: 21 years).\nFair value of the assets and present value of the liabilities of the plans\n\nThe amount included in the statement of financial position arising from the Group\u2019s obligations in respect of its Defined benefit plans is as follows:\n\n|                  | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m | Net deficit \u00a3m |\n|------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|\n| **1April 2019**  | 6,974     | (7,431)        | (457)          |\n| Service cost     | \u2013         | (37)           | (37)           |\n| Interest income/(cost) | 154     | (163)          | (9)            |\n| Return on plan assets excluding interest income | 108 | \u2013 | 108 |\n| Actuarial gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions | \u2013 | 252 | 252 |\n| Actuarial gains arising from changes in financial assumptions | \u2013 | 383 | 383 |\n| Actuarial losses arising from experience adjustments | \u2013 | (103) | (103) |\n| Employer cash contributions | 42 | \u2013 | 42 |\n| Member cash contributions | 10 | (10) | \u2013 |\n| Benefits paid | (237) | 237 | \u2013 |\n| Exchange rate movements | (143) | 156 | 13 |\n| Other movements | (2) | (38) | (40) |\n| **31 March 2020** | 6,906 | (6,754) | 152 |\n| Service cost | \u2013 | (39) | (39) |\n| Interest income/(cost) | 137 | (129) | 8 |\n| Return on plan assets excluding interest income | 466 | \u2013 | 466 |\n| Actuarial losses arising from changes in financial assumptions | \u2013 | (1,118) | (1,118) |\n| Actuarial losses arising from experience adjustments | \u2013 | (34) | (34) |\n| Employer cash contributions | 125 | \u2013 | 125 |\n| Member cash contributions | 10 | (10) | \u2013 |\n| Benefits paid | (243) | 243 | \u2013 |\n| Exchange rate movements | 244 | (249) | (5) |\n| Other movements | (13) | 5 | (8) |\n| **31 March 2021** | 7,632 | (8,085) | (453) |\n\nAn analysis of the net (deficit)/surplus is provided below for the Group as a whole.\n\n| Analysis of net (deficit)/surplus: | 2021 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Total fair value of plan assets   | 7,632   | 6,906   |\n| Present value of funded plan liabilities | (7,968) | (6,641) |\n| **Net (deficit)/surplus for funded plans** | (336) | 265 |\n| Present value of unfunded plan liabilities | (117) | (113) |\n| **Net (deficit)/surplus** | (453) | 152 |\n\n**Net (deficit)/surplus is analysed as:**\n\n| Assets | 60 | 590 |\n| Liabilities | (513) | (458) |\n\nNote:\n\n1.

Post employment benefits (continued)\n\nAn analysis of net surplus/(deficit) is provided below for the Vodafone UK plan, which is a funded plan. As part of the merger of the Vodafone UK plan and the Cable and Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan (CWWRP) plan on 6 June 2014 the assets and liabilities of the CWW Section are segregated from the Vodafone Section and hence are reported separately below.\n\n| Analysis of net surplus/(deficit): | CWW Section | Vodafone Section |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Total fair value of plan assets  | 2,912 \u20acm     | 3,298 \u20acm        |\n| Present value of plan liabilities| (2,852) \u20acm   | (3,457) \u20acm      |\n| Net surplus/(deficit)            | 60 \u20acm       | (159) \u20acm        |\n\nNet surplus/(deficit) are analysed as:\n\n| Assets | Liabilities |\n|--------|-------------|\n| 60 \u20acm  | (159) \u20acm    |\n\nFair value of plan assets\n\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 247 \u20acm | 96 \u20acm |\n|---------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Equity investments:       |        |       |\n| With quoted prices in an active market | 1,376 \u20acm | 1,018 \u20acm |\n| Without quoted prices in an active market | 294 \u20acm | 197 \u20acm |\n| Debt instruments:         |        |       |\n| With quoted prices in an active market | 4,589 \u20acm | 4,446 \u20acm |\n| Without quoted prices in an active market | 559 \u20acm | 513 \u20acm |\n| Property:                 |        |       |\n| With quoted prices in an active market | 26 \u20acm | 18 \u20acm |\n| Without quoted prices in an active market | 494 \u20acm | 391 \u20acm |\n| Derivatives:              |        |       |\n| Without quoted prices in an active market | (1,557) \u20acm | (1,110) \u20acm |\n| Investment fund           | 604 \u20acm | 533 \u20acm |\n| Annuity policies          |        |       |\n| With quoted prices in an active market | 4 \u20acm | 3 \u20acm |\n| Without quoted prices     | 996 \u20acm | 801 \u20acm |\n| Total                     | 7,632 \u20acm | 6,906 \u20acm |\n\nNote:\n1 Derivatives include collateral held in the form of cash. Assets are valued using \u2018level 2\u2019 inputs under IFRS 13 \u201cFair Value Measurement\u201d principles and classified as unquoted accordingly.\n\nThe fair value of plan assets, which have been measured in accordance with IFRS 13 \u201cFair Value Measurement\u201d, are analysed by asset category above and are subdivided by assets that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that do not, such as investment funds. Where available, the fair values are quoted prices (e.g. listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds). Unlisted investments without quoted prices in an active market (e.g. private equity) are included at values provided by the fund manager in accordance with relevant guidance. Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves. The Vodafone UK plan annuity policies fully match the pension obligations of those pensioners insured and therefore are set equal to the present value of the related obligations. Investment funds of \u20ac604 million at 31 March 2021 include investments in diversified alternative beta funds held in the Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK plan.\n\nThe actual return on plan assets over the year to 31 March 2021 was a gain of \u20ac603 million (2020: \u20ac262 million gain).\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nMeasurement of the Group\u2019s defined benefit retirement obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions. The sensitivity analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2021.\n\n| (Decrease)/increase in present value of defined benefit obligation | Rate of inflation | Rate of increase in salaries | Discount rate | Life expectancy |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                  | Decrease by 0.5%   | Increase by 0.5%             | Decrease by 0.5% | Increase by 0.5% | Decrease by 1 year | Increase by 1 year |\n| (Decrease)/increase in present value of defined benefit obligation | (572) \u20acm          | 641 \u20acm                      | 4 \u20acm          | 854 \u20acm          | (738) \u20acm          | (278) \u20acm          | 275 \u20acm |\n\nNote:\n1 The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another. In presenting this sensitivity analysis, the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated on the same basis as prior years using the projected unit credit method at the end of the year, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position. The rate of inflation assumption sensitivity factors in the impact of changes to all assumptions relating to inflation including the rate of increase in salaries, pension increases and deferred revaluations.\n26. Share-based payments\n\nThe Group has a number of share plans used to award shares to Executive Directors and employees as part of their remuneration package. A charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record the cost of these, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nThe Group issues equity-settled share-based awards to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based awards are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group\u2019s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. A corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital is also recognised.\n\nSome share awards have an attached market condition, based on total shareholder return (TSR), which is taken into account when calculating the fair value of the share awards. The valuation for the TSR is based on Vodafone\u2019s ranking within the same group of companies, where possible, over the past five years.\n\nThe fair value of awards of non-vested shares is an average calculation of the closing price of the Group\u2019s shares on the days prior to the grant date, adjusted for the present value of the delay in receiving dividends where appropriate.\n\nThe maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued in respect of share options or share plans will not (without shareholder approval) exceed:\n\n- 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans; and\n- 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans, other than any plans which are operated on an all-employee basis.\n\nShare options\n\nVodafone Group executive plans\n\nNo share options have been granted to any Directors or employees under the Company\u2019s discretionary share option plans in the year ended 31 March 2021 (2020: nil).\n\nVodafone Sharesave Plan\n\nUnder the Vodafone Sharesave Plan UK staff may acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings of up to \u00a3375 over a three and/or five year period, at the end of which they may also receive a tax-free bonus. The savings and bonus may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the invitation period and usually at a discount of 20% to the then prevailing market price of the Company\u2019s shares.\n\nShare plans\n\nVodafone Group executive plans\n\nUnder the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to Directors and certain employees. The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment and for some awards achievement of certain performance targets measured over a three year period.\n\nVodafone Share Incentive Plan\n\nFollowing a review of the UK all-employee plans it was decided that with effect from 1 April 2017 employees would no longer be able to contribute to the Share Incentive Plan and would therefore no longer receive matching shares. Individuals who hold shares in the plan will continue to receive dividend shares.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n26.

Acquisitions and disposals\n\nThe note below provides details of acquisition and disposal transactions for the current year as well as those completed in the prior year. For further details see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nBusiness combinations\n\nAcquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The acquiree\u2019s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Group\u2019s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders\u2019 proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.\n\nAcquisition of interests from non-controlling shareholders\n\nIn transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change in control, the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid or received and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity.\n\nAggregate cash consideration\n\nThe aggregate cash consideration in respect of purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, is as follows:\n\n|                      | 2021 (\u20acm) | 2020 (\u20acm) |\n|----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash consideration paid |           |           |\n| European Liberty Global Assets | \u2013         | 10,313    |\n| Other acquisitions during the year | 138       | 108       |\n| Net cash acquired     | (2)       | (126)     |\n|                      | 136       | 10,295    |\n\nAcquisition of European Liberty Global assets\n\nIn the comparative period, on 31 July 2019, the Group completed the acquisition of a 100% interest in Unitymedia GmbH (\u2018Unitymedia\u2019) and Liberty Global\u2019s operations (excluding its \u2018Direct Home\u2019 business) in the Czech Republic (\u2018UPC Czech\u2019), Hungary (\u2018UPC Hungary\u2019) and Romania (\u2018UPC Romania\u2019) for an aggregate net cash consideration of \u20ac10,313 million. The primary reason for acquiring the businesses was to create a converged national provider of digital infrastructure in Germany, together with creating converged communications operators in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania.\n\nThe purchase price allocation is set out in the table below:\n\n| Net assets acquired                      | Fair value (\u20acm) |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Identifiable intangible assets\u00b9         | 5,818           |\n| Property, plant and equipment\u00b2         | 4,737           |\n| Inventory                               | 2               |\n| Trade and other receivables             | 856             |\n| Other investments                       | 2               |\n| Cash and cash equivalents               | 109             |\n| Current and deferred taxation           | (1,904)         |\n| Short and long-term borrowings          | (9,527)         |\n| Trade and other payables                | (1,066)         |\n| Post employment benefits                | (40)            |\n| Provisions                              | (178)           |\n| **Net identifiable liabilities acquired** | **(1,191)**    |\n| Goodwill                                | 11,504          |\n| **Total consideration**                 | **10,313**      |\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

The goodwill is attributable to future profits expected to be generated from new customers and the synergies expected to arise after the Group\u2019s acquisition of the businesses.\n4. Transaction costs of \u20ac46 million were charged to Other income and expense in the consolidated income statement in the year ended 31 March 2020.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n27. Acquisitions and disposals (continued)\n\nFrom the date of acquisition to 31 March 2020, the acquired entities contributed \u20ac1,993 million of revenue and a loss of \u20ac247 million towards the profit before tax of the Group. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the prior financial year, revenue would have been \u20ac45,975 million and the profit before tax would have been \u20ac822 million.\n\nOther acquisitions\n\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2021, the Group completed certain acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of \u20ac178 million, of which \u20acnil has been paid in cash. The aggregate provisional fair values acquired of goodwill, identifiable assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests recognised on acquisition were \u20ac92 million, \u20ac445 million, \u20ac306 million and \u20ac53 million, respectively. In addition, the Group paid \u20ac138 million in respect of acquisitions completed in prior periods.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2020 the Group completed certain acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of \u20ac276 million, of which \u20ac108 million was paid in that year. The aggregate provisional fair values of goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired operations were \u20ac248 million, \u20ac113 million and \u20ac85 million, respectively.\n\nDisposals\n\nThe difference between the carrying value of the net assets disposed of and the fair value of consideration received is recorded as a gain or loss on disposal. Foreign exchange translation gains or losses relating to subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates that the Group has disposed of, and that have previously recorded in other comprehensive income or expense, are also recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nAggregate cash consideration\n\nThe aggregate cash consideration in respect of the disposal of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed, is as follows:\n\n|                      | 2021  | 2020  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|\n| Cash consideration received |       |       |\n| Vodafone New Zealand | (37)  | 2,023 |\n| Tower infrastructure in Italy | 192   | 2,140 |\n| Vodafone Malta       | \u2013     | 242   |\n| Other disposals during the period | 3     | 35    |\n| Net cash disposed    | (1)   | (13)  |\n|                      | 157   | 4,427 |\n\nVodafone New Zealand\n\nIn the comparative period, on 31 July 2019, the Group sold its 100% interest in Vodafone New Zealand Limited (Vodafone New Zealand) for consideration of NZD $3.4 billion (\u20ac2.0 billion). The table below summarises the net assets disposed and the resulting net gain on disposal of \u20ac1.1 billion.\n\n|                      | \u20acm    |\n|----------------------|-------|\n| Goodwill             | (243) |\n| Other intangible assets | (155) |\n| Property, plant and equipment\u00b9 | (783) |\n| Inventory            | (29)  |\n| Trade and other receivables | (244) |\n| Investments in associates and joint ventures | (4) |\n| Current and deferred taxation | (11) |\n| Short and long-term borrowings | 215 |\n| Trade and other payables | 261 |\n| Provisions           | 35    |\n| Net assets disposed  | (958) |\n| Net cash proceeds arising from the transaction | 2,023 |\n| Other effects\u00b2       | 13    |\n| Net gain on transaction\u00b3 | 1,078 |\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

Recorded within Other income and expense in the consolidated income statement.\n**Tower infrastructure in Italy**\n\nIn the comparative period, on 31 March 2020, the Group merged its passive tower infrastructure in Italy with Infrastruttura Wireless Italiane S.p.A. (INWIT), (the \u2018combination\u2019). As part of the combination, Vodafone received proceeds of \u20ac2,140 million and a 37.5% shareholding in the combined entity. As a result of the transaction, we no longer consolidate the tower assets and account for our interest as a joint venture using the equity method. We have also entered into an agreement to lease back space on the mobile base stations to locate network equipment (see note 20 \u201cLeases\u201d). The Group recognised a net gain on the combination of \u20ac3,356 million.\n\n| Goodwill | (1,320) |\n| Property, plant and equipment | (548) |\n| Trade and other receivables | (164) |\n| Current and deferred taxation | 44 |\n| Short and long-term borrowings | 270 |\n| Trade and other payables | 79 |\n| Provisions | 40 |\n\n**Net assets contributed into INWIT**\n\n| Fair value of investment in INWIT | 3,559 |\n| Net cash proceeds arising from the transaction | 2,140 |\n| Restriction of gain (note 20) | (744) |\n\n**Net gain on formation**\n\n| 3,356 |\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

The fair value of \u20ac3,559 million comprises an investment of \u20ac3,345 million recorded within investments in associates and joint arrangements (note 12) and a dividend receivable of \u20ac214 million, recorded within Other receivables (note 14).\n3. Recorded within Other income and expense in the consolidated income statement.\n\n**Vodafone Malta**\n\nIn the comparative period, on 31 March 2020, the Group sold its 100% interest in Vodafone Malta Limited (\u2018Vodafone Malta\u2019) for consideration of \u20ac242 million. A net gain on disposal of \u20ac170 million has been recorded within Other income and expense in the consolidated income statement.\n\n**Other transactions with non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries**\n\n| 2021 | 2020 |\n|---|---|\n| Cash consideration received/(paid) | |\n| Vantage Towers IPO | 2,000 |\n| Vantage Towers Greece | (288) |\n| Other | (49) |\n| **Total** | **1,663** |\n\n**Vantage Towers IPO**\n\nDuring the period, the Group completed an initial public offering of Vantage Towers AG, with the first day of trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange being 18 March 2021. The offer consisted solely of a secondary sell-down of existing shares held by Vodafone GmbH. Cash consideration of \u20ac2,000 million was received in the period. A further \u20ac217m was received in April 2021, following completion of the market stabilisation period described in the Vantage Towers prospectus.\n\n**Vantage Towers Greece**\n\nOn 25 March 2021, the Group exercised its option to purchase the remaining 38% of Vantage Towers Greece for cash consideration of \u20ac288 million, taking its shareholding to 100%.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n28. Commitments\n\nA commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future, mainly in relation to agreements to buy assets such as mobile devices, network infrastructure and IT systems and leases that have not commenced. These amounts are not recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position since we have not yet received the goods or services from the supplier. The amounts below are the minimum amounts that we are committed to pay.\n\nCapital commitments\n\n| Company and subsidiaries | Share of joint operations | Group |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------|\n|                          | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n| Contracts placed for future capital expenditure not provided in the financial statements\u00b9 | 3,993 | 3,046 | 133 | 103 | 4,126 | 3,149 |\n\nNote:\n\u00b9 Commitment includes contracts placed for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nLeases entered into by the Group but not commenced at 31 March 2021 are disclosed in note 20.\n\n29. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\n\nContingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows, where the likelihood of payment is considered more than remote, but is not considered probable or cannot be measured reliably.\n\n| Performance bonds\u00b9 | Other guarantees\u00b2 |\n|--------------------|-------------------|\n| 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n| 381 | 414 |\n| 2,347 | 2,908 |\n\nNotes:\n\u00b9 Performance bonds require the Group to make payments to third parties in the event that the Group does not perform what is expected of it under the terms of any related contracts or commercial arrangements.\n\u00b2 Other guarantees principally comprise Vodafone Group Plc\u2019s guarantee of the Group\u2019s 50% share of a US$3.5 billion loan facility (2020: AUD1.7 billion and US$3.5 billion loan facilities), which forms part of the Group\u2019s overall joint venture investment in TPG Telecom Ltd (2020: Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited). The Group\u2019s share of these loan balances is included in the net investment in joint venture (see note 12 \u201cInvestments in associates and joint arrangements\u201d). Other guarantees also includes INR42.5 billion (2020: nil) in relation to the secondary pledge over shares owned by Vodafone Group in Indus Towers (see \u201cIndus Tower merger\u201d paragraph on page 195).\n\nUK pension schemes\n\nThe Group\u2019s main defined benefit plan is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (Vodafone UK Plan) which has two segregated sections, the Vodafone Section and the CWW Section, as detailed in note 25 \u201cPost employment benefits\u201d.\n\nThe Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of both the Vodafone Section and CWW Section whilst a deficit remains. The deficit is measured on a prescribed basis agreed between the Group and trustee. The Group provides surety bonds as the security.\n\nThe level of the security has varied since inception in line with the movement in the Vodafone UK Plan deficit. At 31 March 2021 the Vodafone UK Plan retains security over \u20ac822 million (notional value) for the Vodafone Section and \u20ac176 million (notional value) for the CWW Section. The security may be substituted either on a voluntary or mandatory basis. The Company has also provided two guarantees to the Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK Plan for a combined value up to \u20ac1.47 billion to provide security over the deficit under certain defined circumstances, including insolvency of the employers. The Company has also agreed a similar guarantee of up to \u20ac1.47 billion for the CWW Section.\n\nAn additional smaller UK defined benefit plan, the THUS Plc Group Scheme, has a guarantee from the Company for up to \u20ac117 million.\nVodafone Idea\n\nAs part of the agreement to merge Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in 2017, the parties agreed a mechanism for payments between the Group and Vodafone Idea Limited (\u2018VIL\u2019) pursuant to the difference between the crystallisation of certain identified contingent liabilities in relation to legal, regulatory, tax and other matters, and refunds relating to Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. Cash payments or cash receipts relating to these matters must have been made or received by VIL before any amount becomes due from or owed to the Group. Any future payments by the Group to VIL as a result of this agreement would only be made after satisfaction of this and other contractual conditions.\n\nThe Group\u2019s potential exposure under this mechanism is now capped at INR 64 billion (\u20ac747 million) following payments made under this mechanism from Vodafone to VIL totalling INR 19 billion (\u20ac235 million). The matters covered by the mechanism include the Adjusted Group Revenue (\u2018AGR\u2019) judgement debt levied on VIL for an amount materially in excess of the cap. There are significant uncertainties in relation to VIL\u2019s ability to settle all liabilities relating to the AGR judgement and no further cash payments are considered probable at 31 March 2021.\n\nThe carrying value of the Group\u2019s investment in VIL is nil and the Group is recording no further share of losses in respect of VIL (see note 12). The Group\u2019s potential exposure to liabilities within VIL is capped by the mechanism described above. As a consequence, contingent liabilities arising from litigation in India concerning operations of Vodafone India are no longer reported below.\n\nIndus Towers merger\n\nThe merger of Indus and Bharti Infratel completed on 19 November 2020 and the combined entity was renamed Indus Towers Ltd (\u2018Indus Towers\u2019). Under the terms of the merger a security package was agreed for the benefit of Indus Towers which can be invoked in the event that VIL is unable to satisfy certain payment obligations under its Master Services Agreements with Indus Towers (the \u2018MSAs\u2019). The security package includes:\n\n- A prepayment in cash of INR 24 billion (\u20ac279 million) by VIL to Indus Towers in respect of its payment obligations that are undisputed, due and payable under the MSAs after the merger closing;\n- A primary pledge over 190.7 million shares owned by Vodafone Group in Indus Towers having a value of INR 47 billion (\u20ac544 million) as at 31 March 2021; and\n- A secondary pledge over shares owned by Vodafone Group in Indus Towers (ranking behind Vodafone\u2019s existing lenders for the remaining \u20ac1.2 billion bank borrowings secured against Indian assets (see note 21) utilised to fund Vodafone\u2019s contribution to the VIL rights issue in 2019) (\u2018the Bank Borrowings\u2019) with a maximum liability cap of INR 42.5 billion (\u20ac495 million).\n\nIn the event of non-payment of relevant MSA obligations by VIL, Indus Towers will have recourse to the primary pledge shares and, after repayment of the Bank Borrowings in full, any secondary pledged shares, up to the value of the liability cap. VIL\u2019s ability to make MSA payments to Indus Towers is uncertain and depends on a number of factors including its ability to raise additional funding.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nThe Group is currently involved in a number of legal proceedings, including inquiries from, or discussions with, government authorities that are incidental to their operations.\n\nLegal proceedings where the Group considers that the likelihood of material future outflows of cash or other resources is more than remote are disclosed below. Where the Group assesses that it is probable that the outcome of legal proceedings will result in a financial outflow, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of that obligation, a provision is recognised for these amounts.\n\nIn all cases, determining the probability of successfully defending a claim against the Group involves the application of judgement as the outcome is inherently uncertain. The determination of the value of any future outflows of cash or other resources, and the timing of such outflows, involves the use of estimates. The costs incurred in complex legal proceedings, regardless of outcome, can be significant.\n\nThe Group is not involved in any material proceedings in which any of the Group\u2019s Directors, members of senior management or affiliates are either a party adverse to the Group or have a material interest adverse to the Group.\n\nIndian tax cases\n\nIn January 2012, the Supreme Court of India found against the Indian tax authority and in favour of Vodafone International Holdings BV (\u2018VIHBV\u2019) in proceedings brought after the Indian tax authority alleged potential liability under the Income Tax Act 1961 for the failure by VIHBV to deduct withholding tax from consideration paid to the Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited group (\u2018HTIL\u2019) in connection with its 2007 disposal to VIHBV of its interests in a wholly-owned Cayman Island incorporated subsidiary that indirectly held interests in Vodafone India Limited (\u2018Vodafone India\u2019).\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n29. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings (continued)\n\nThe Finance Act 2012 of India, which amended various provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961 with retrospective effect, contained provisions intended to tax any gain on transfer of shares in a non-Indian company, which derives substantial value from underlying Indian assets, such as Vodafone\u2019s transaction with HTIL in 2007. Further, it sought to subject a purchaser, such as Vodafone, to a retrospective obligation to withhold tax. On 3 January 2013, Vodafone received a letter from the Indian tax authority reminding it of the tax demand raised prior to the Supreme Court of India\u2019s judgement and updating the interest element of that demand to a total amount of INR142 billion, which included principal and interest as calculated by the Indian tax authority but did not include penalties. On 12 February 2016, Vodafone received a notice dated 4 February 2016 of an outstanding tax demand of INR221 billion (plus interest) along with a statement that enforcement action, including against Vodafone\u2019s indirectly held assets in India, would be taken if the demand was not satisfied. On 29 September 2017, Vodafone received an electronically generated demand in respect of alleged principal, interest and penalties in the amount of INR190.7 billion. This demand does not appear to have included any element for alleged accrued interest liability.\n\nIn response to the 2013 letter, Vodafone initiated arbitration proceedings under the Netherlands-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (\u2018Dutch BIT\u2019). The arbitration hearing took place in February 2019. In September 2020, the arbitration tribunal issued its award unanimously ruling in Vodafone\u2019s favour. The Indian Government applied in Singapore to set aside the award primarily on jurisdictional grounds. The proceedings have been transferred to a senior court, with a hearing date set for September 2021.\n\nSeparately, on 24 January 2017, Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited formally commenced arbitration with the Indian Government under the United Kingdom-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (\u2018UK BIT\u2019) in respect of retrospective tax claims under the Income Tax Act 1961 (as amended by the Finance Act 2012). Although relating to the same underlying facts as the claim under the Dutch BIT, the claim brought by Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited is a separate and distinct claim under a different treaty. After the Delhi High Court first upheld, and subsequently dismissed, the Indian Government\u2019s application for an injunction preventing Vodafone from progressing the UK BIT arbitration as an abuse of process, the Indian Government appealed the dismissal. Hearings took place from 2018 to 2020 with frequent adjournments. Following the award in the Dutch BIT, the Delhi High Court dismissed the injunction appeal proceedings. Vodafone has undertaken to take no steps advancing the UK BIT arbitration proceedings pending the outcome of the Indian Government\u2019s application to set aside the Dutch BIT award in Singapore. The Delhi High Court also permitted the formation of the UK BIT tribunal.\n\nVodafone and Vodafone Group Plc will continue to defend vigorously any allegation that Vodafone or Vodafone India is liable to pay tax in connection with the transaction with HTIL and will continue to exercise all rights to seek redress including pursuant to the Dutch BIT and the UK BIT. Based on the facts and circumstances of this matter, including the outcome of legal proceedings to date, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that no present obligation exists at 31 March 2021.\n\nVISPL tax claims\n\nVodafone India Services Private Limited (\u2018VISPL\u2019) is involved in a number of tax cases. The total value of the claims is approximately \u20ac500 million plus interest, and penalties of up to 300% of the principal.\n\nOf the individual tax claims, the most significant is in the amount of approximately \u20ac249 million (plus interest of \u20ac554 million), which VISPL has been assessed as owing in respect of (i) a transfer pricing margin charged for the international call centre of HTIL prior to the 2007 transaction with Vodafone for HTIL assets in India; (ii) the sale of the international call centre by VISPL to HTIL; and (iii) the acquisition of and/or the alleged transfer of options held by VISPL in Vodafone India. The first two of the three heads of tax are subject to an indemnity by HTIL. The larger part of the potential claim is not subject to an indemnity. A stay of the tax demand on a deposit of \u20ac20 million and a corporate guarantee by Vodafone for the balance of tax assessed are in place. On 8 October 2015, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Vodafone in relation to the options and the call centre sale. The Indian Tax Authority has appealed to the Supreme Court of India. The appeal hearing has been adjourned indefinitely.\n\nWhile there is some uncertainty as to the outcome of the tax cases involving VISPL, the Group believes it has valid defences and does not consider it probable that a financial outflow will be required to settle these cases.\n\nOther cases in the Group\n\nUK : IPCom v Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone UK\n\nOn 22 February 2019, IPCom sued Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Limited for alleged infringement of two patents claimed to be essential to UMTS and LTE network standards. If IPCom could have established that one or more of its patents was valid and infringed, it could have sought an injunction against the UK network if a global licence for the patents was not agreed. The Court ordered expedited trials on the infringement and validity issues. The trial on the first patent was in November 2019 and removed the risk of an injunction so IPCom withdrew the second patent trial listed for May 2020. Both IPCom and Vodafone appealed certain aspects of the judgement from the first trial at a hearing in January 2021. The Court of Appeal found in favour of both IPCom and Vodafone on different issues. Vodafone is seeking permission to appeal a discrete issue from the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The validity of the first patent will be considered by the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office at a hearing in July 2021. Although the outcome of this hearing is unknown, we believe that there is a high probability that the first patent will be found to be invalid and as a result Vodafone has no liability for patent infringement which would mean that the Group has no present obligation. IPCom has indicated that it wishes to pursue a damages assessment for the limited infringement found by the trial court. However, IPCom has suggested that these proceedings be deferred until the outcome of the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office. In any event, were the patent found to be valid the Group believes that the resulting damages would be minimal.\nSpain and UK: TOT v Vodafone Group Plc, VGSL, and Vodafone UK\n\nVodafone Group Plc has been sued in Spain by TOT Power Control (TOT), an affiliate of Top Optimized Technologies. The claim makes a number of allegations including patent infringement, with TOT initially seeking over \u20ac500 million in damages from Vodafone Group Plc as well as an injunction against using the technology in question. Huawei has also been sued by TOT in the same action.\n\nIn a decision dated 30 October 2017, the Commercial Court of Madrid ruled that while it did have jurisdiction to hear the infringement case relating to the Spanish patent, it was not competent to hear TOT\u2019s contractual and competition law claims against Vodafone. The trial took place in September 2018 and in January 2020 judgement was handed down in Vodafone and Huawei\u2019s favour. TOT appealed but limited its claims against Vodafone to seek approximately \u20ac4 million in damages and injunctive relief. The appeal judgement was issued on 23 April 2021 and TOT\u2019s claims for damages and injunctive relief against both Vodafone and Huawei were rejected, therefore the Group does not believe that any present obligation exists.\n\nIn December 2019 TOT brought a similar claim in the English High Court against Vodafone Group and Vodafone UK alleging breach of confidentiality and patent infringement. The value of the claim is not pleaded. Proceedings have been stayed until 30 September 2021 pending the outcome of the appeal in Spain. Vodafone has issued an application seeking to strike out certain aspects of TOT\u2019s case which will be heard once the stay has been lifted. It remains unclear how much of the claim will remain after the strike out application. Vodafone has not yet filed its defence. At this stage of proceedings, we are not able reliably to evaluate the likelihood of, or amount of, any financial outflow.\n\nGermany: Kabel Deutschland takeover - class actions\n\nThe German courts have been determining the adequacy of the mandatory cash offer made to minority shareholders in Vodafone\u2019s takeover of Kabel Deutschland. Hearings took place in May 2019 and a decision was delivered in November 2019 in Vodafone\u2019s favour, rejecting all claims by minority shareholders. A number of shareholders appealed. The appeal process is ongoing. While the outcome is uncertain, the Group believes it has valid defences and that the outcome of the appeal will be favourable to Vodafone.\n\nItaly: Iliad v Vodafone Italy\n\nIn July 2019, Iliad filed a claim for \u20ac500 million against Vodafone Italy in the Civil Court of Milan. The claim alleges anti-competitive behaviour in relation to portability and certain advertising campaigns by Vodafone Italy. Preliminary hearings have taken place, including one at which the Court rejected Iliad\u2019s application for a cease and desist order against alleged misleading advertising by Vodafone. The main hearing on the merits of the claim is scheduled for 8 June 2021.\n\nThe Group is currently unable to estimate any possible loss in this claim in the event of an adverse judgement but while the outcome is uncertain, the Group believes it has valid defences and that it is probable that no present obligation exists.\n\nGreece: Papistas Holdings SA, Mobile Trade Stores (formerly Papistas SA) and Athanasios and Loukia Papistas v Vodafone Greece\n\nIn October 2019, Mr. and Mrs. Papistas, and companies owned or controlled by them, filed several new claims against Vodafone Greece with a total value of approximately \u20ac330 million for purported damage caused by the alleged abuse of dominance and wrongful termination of a franchise arrangement with a Papistas company. Lawsuits which the Papistas claimants had previously brought against Vodafone Group Plc and certain Directors and officers of Vodafone were withdrawn. Vodafone Greece filed a counter claim and all claims were heard in February 2020. All of the Papistas claims were rejected by the Greek Court because the stamp duty payments required to have the merits of the case considered had not been made. Vodafone Greece\u2019s counter claim was also rejected. The Papistas claimants and Vodafone Greece have each filed appeals and, subject to the Papistas claimants paying the requisite stamp duty, the hearing on the merits of these appeals will take place in late 2021 and early 2022.\n\nThe amount claimed in these lawsuits is substantial and, if the claimants are successful, the total potential liability could be material. However, we are continuing vigorously to defend the claims and based on the progress of the litigation so far the Group believes that it is highly unlikely that there will be an adverse ruling for the Group. On this basis, the Group does not expect the outcome of these claims to have a material financial impact.\n\nUK: Phones 4U in Administration v Vodafone Limited and Vodafone Group Plc and Others\n\nIn December 2018, the administrators of former UK indirect seller, Phones 4U, sued the three main UK mobile network operators (\u2018MNOs\u2019), including Vodafone, and their parent companies. The administrators allege a conspiracy between the MNOs to pull their business from Phones 4U thereby causing its collapse. Vodafone and the other defendants filed their defences in April 2019 and the Administrators filed their replies in October 2019. Disclosure has taken place and witness statements are due to be filed by the end of July 2021. The judge has also ordered that there should be a split trial between liability and damages. The first trial will start in May 2022.\n\nTaking into account all available evidence, the Group assesses it to be more likely than not that a present obligation does not exist and that the allegations of collusion are completely without merit; the Group is vigorously defending the claim. The value of the claim is not pleaded but we understand it to be the total value of the business, possibly equivalent to approximately \u00a31 billion. Vodafone\u2019s alleged share of the liability is also not pleaded. The Group is not able to estimate any possible loss in the event of an adverse judgement.\n30. Related party transactions\n\nThe Group has a number of related parties including joint arrangements and associates, pension schemes and Directors and Executive Committee members (see note 12 \u201cInvestments in associates and joint arrangements\u201d, note 25 \u201cPost employment benefits\u201d and note 23 \u201cDirectors and key management compensation\u201d).\n\nTransactions with joint arrangements and associates\n\nRelated party transactions with the Group\u2019s joint arrangements and associates primarily comprise fees for the use of products and services including network airtime and access charges, fees for the provision of network infrastructure and cash pooling arrangements. No related party transactions have been entered into during the year which might reasonably affect any decisions made by the users of these consolidated financial statements except as disclosed below.\n\n|                                | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Sales of goods and services to associates | 14    | 32    | 27    |\n| Purchase of goods and services from associates | 5     | 4     | 3     |\n| Sales of goods and services to joint arrangements | 203   | 305   | 242   |\n| Purchase of goods and services from joint arrangements | 109   | 97    | 192   |\n| Net interest income receivable from joint arrangements | 65    | 71    | 96    |\n| Net interest expense payable to joint arrangements | 56    | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n\nTrade balances owed:\n\n|                                | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| by associates                  | 3     | 4     | 1     |\n| to associates                  | 5     | 4     | 3     |\n| by joint arrangements          | 88    | 157   | 193   |\n| to joint arrangements          | 31    | 37    | 25    |\n| Other balances owed by associates | 56    | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n| Other balances owed by joint arrangements | 955   | 1,083 | 997   |\n| Other balances owed to joint arrangements | 1,575 | 2,017 | 169   |\n\nNotes:\n1. Amounts arise primarily through VodafoneZiggo, TPG Telecom Limited and INWIT S.p.A. Interest is paid in line with market rates.\n2. Amounts for years ended 31 March 2021 and 2020 are primarily in relation to leases of tower space from INWIT S.p.A.\n\nDividends received from associates and joint ventures are disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nTransactions with Directors other than compensation\n\nDuring the three years ended 31 March 2021 and as of 18 May 2021, no Director nor any other executive officer, nor any associate of any Director or any other executive officer, was indebted to the Company. During the three years ended 31 March 2021 and as of 18 May 2021, the Company has not been a party to any other material transaction, or proposed transactions, in which any member of the key management personnel (including Directors, any other executive officer, senior manager, any spouse or relative of any of the foregoing or any relative of such spouse) had or was to have a direct or indirect material interest.\n31. Related undertakings\n\nA full list of all of our subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated undertakings is detailed below.\n\nA full list of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated undertakings (as defined in the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008) as at 31 March 2021 is detailed below. No subsidiaries are excluded from the Group consolidation. Unless otherwise stated the Company\u2019s subsidiaries all have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares and are indirectly held. The percentage held by Group companies reflect both the proportion of nominal capital and voting rights unless otherwise stated.\n\nSubsidiaries\n\nAccounting policies\n\nA subsidiary is an entity directly or indirectly controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities that affect the Company\u2019s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group\u2019s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholder\u2019s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\n| Company name | % of share class held by Group Companies | Share class |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Albania      |                                        |             |\n| Rugga \u201cIbrahim Rugova\u201d, Sky Tower, Kati i S, Hysja 2, Tirane, Shqip\u00ebri, Albania | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| Autostrada Tirane-Durr\u00ebs, Rugga: \u201cPavareza\u201d, Nr 61, Kashar, Tirana, Albania | 99.94 | Ordinary shares |\n| Argentina    |                                        |             |\n| Centro 348, 5 to R, C1010AAH, Buenos Aires, Argentina | 100.00 | Ordinary shares |\n| ORGAL S.A.

These reserves are not distributable.\n2. Own shares relate to treasury shares which are purchased out of distributable profits and therefore reduce reserves available for distribution.\n3. The Company has determined what amounts within this reserve are distributable and non-distributable in accordance with the guidance provided by ICAEW TECH 02/17BL and the requirements of UK law. In accordance with UK Companies Act 2006 s831(2), a public company may make a distribution only if, after giving effect to such distribution, the amount of its net assets is not less than the aggregate of its called up share capital and non-distributable reserves.\n4. Includes \u20ac1 million tax credit (2020: \u20acnil).\n5. Includes the impact of the Company\u2019s cash flow hedges with \u20ac5,892 million net loss deferred to other comprehensive income during the year (2020: \u20ac4,113 million net gain); \u20ac1,226 million net loss (2020: \u20ac408 million net gain) recycled to the income statement; and \u20ac687 million credited (2020: \u20ac705 million charged) on related tax movements. These hedges primarily relate to foreign exchange exposure on fixed borrowings, with any foreign exchange on nominal balances directly impacting income statement in each period but interest cash flows unwinding to the income statement over the life of the hedges (up to 2059). See note 22 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d in the consolidated financial statements for further details.\n6. Includes the reissue of 1,426.8 million (\u20ac1,944 million) in March 2021 in order to satisfy the first tranche of the mandatory convertible bond issued in March 2019.\n7. These represent the irrevocable and non-discretionary share buyback programme announced on 19 March 2021.\nNotes to the Company financial statements\n\n1. Basis of preparation\n\nThe separate financial statements of the Company are drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 \u201cReduced disclosure framework\u201d, (FRS 101). The Company will continue to prepare its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 on an ongoing basis until such time as it notifies shareholders of any change to its chosen accounting framework.\n\nThe Company financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThe following exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied:\n\n- Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, \u201cShared-based payment\u201d (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of share options, and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined);\n- IFRS 7 \u201cFinancial Instruments: Disclosures\u201d;\n- Paragraph 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, \u201cFair value measurement\u201d (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities);\n- Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 \u201cPresentation of financial statements\u201d comparative information requirements in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1;\n- The following paragraphs of IAS 1 \u201cPresentation of financial statements\u201d:\n  - 10(d) (statement of cash flows);\n  - 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);\n  - 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);\n  - 38B-D (additional comparative information);\n  - 40A-D (requirements for a third statement of financial position);\n  - 111 (cash flow statement information); and\n  - 134-136 (capital management disclosures).\n- IAS 7 \u201cStatement of cash flows\u201d;\n- Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 \u201cAccounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors\u201d (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective);\n- The requirements in IAS 24 \u201cRelated party disclosures\u201d to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group;\n- The requirements in IAS 36 to disclose valuation technique and assumptions used in determining recoverable amount.\n\nAs permitted by section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Company is not presented in this Annual Report. These separate financial statements are not intended to give a true and fair view of the profit or loss or cash flows of the Company. The Company has not published its individual cash flow statement as its liquidity, solvency and financial adaptability are dependent on the Group rather than its own cash flows.\n\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of Company financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Management regularly reviews the accounting judgements that significantly impact the amounts recognised in the financial statements and the estimates that are considered to be \u201ccritical estimates\u201d due to their potential to give rise to material adjustments in the Company\u2019s financial statements in the year ending 31 March 2021.\n\nA source of estimation uncertainty for the Company relates to the review for impairment of investment carrying values and the estimates used when determining the recoverable value of the investment. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment from revisions to these assumptions within the next financial year (see note 2).\n\nSignificant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as a whole\n\nForeign currencies\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional rate of currency prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the Company\u2019s functional currency at the rates prevailing on the reporting period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the initial transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the period.\n\nBorrowing costs\n\nAll borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.\nNotes to the Company financial statements (continued)\n\n1. Basis of preparation (continued)\n\nTaxation\nCurrent tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences that exist at the reporting period date and that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future. The deferred tax is measured at the rate expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting period date. Temporary differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the Company financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Company statement of financial position when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.\n\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\nThe Company\u2019s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group\u2019s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of derivative financial instruments consistent with the Group\u2019s risk management strategy. Changes in values of all derivative financial instruments are included within the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship when changes in value are deferred to other comprehensive income or equity respectively. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (\u2018fair value hedges\u2019) or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments (\u2018cash flow hedges\u2019). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nFair value hedges\nThe Company\u2019s policy is to use derivative financial instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk arising, principally, from capital market borrowings. The Company designates these as fair value hedges of interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. Gains and losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nCash flow hedges\nCash flow hedging is used by the Company to hedge certain exposures to variability in future cash flows. The portion of gains or losses relating to changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income; gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. When the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nPensions\nThe Company is the sponsoring employer of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme. There is insufficient information available to enable the scheme to be accounted for as a defined benefit scheme because the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore, the Company has applied the guidance within IAS 19 to account for defined benefit schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes and recognise only the contribution payable each year. The Company had no contributions payable for the year ended 31 March 2021 (2020: \u00a3nil). The defined benefit scheme is recognised in the financial statements of the participating employers, Vodafone UK Limited and Vodafone Group Services Limited.\n\nNew accounting pronouncements\nTo the extent applicable the Company will adopt new accounting policies as set out in note 1 \u201cBasis of preparation\u201d in the consolidated financial statements.\n2. Fixed assets\n\nAccounting policies\nShares in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and capital related to share-based payments. Contributions in respect of share-based payments are recognised in line with the policy set out in note 7 \u201cShare-based payments\u201d.\n\nThe Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nWhere there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nThe Company applies the same methodology and assumptions used by the Group for goodwill impairment testing purposes, as set out in note 4 \u201cImpairment losses\u201d to the consolidated financial statements. For the purposes of the Company\u2019s own impairment assessment, the Group\u2019s operations are considered to be a single cash generating unit (CGU) held within the Company\u2019s principal subsidiary, Vodafone European Investments. The pooling of the Company\u2019s interests within a single CGU significantly reduces the risk that movements in individual assumptions used during the goodwill impairment testing will impact the result of the investment impairment assessment. Whilst the underlying assumptions used are a source of estimation uncertainty, they do not give rise to a significant risk of adjustment within the next financial year, including the additional assumption for the current uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShares in Group undertakings\n\n| Cost: | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| 1 April | 84,264 | 84,812 |\n| Disposals | \u2013 | (616) |\n| Capital contributions arising from share-based payments | 136 | 136 |\n| Contributions received in relation to share-based payments | (87) | (68) |\n| **31 March** | **84,315** | **84,264** |\n\n| Amounts provided for: | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| 1 April | 798 | 1,039 |\n| Eliminated on disposals | \u2013 | (144) |\n| Impairment losses | 130 | 15 |\n| Impairment reversals | \u2013 | (112) |\n| **31 March** | **928** | **798** |\n\n| Net book value: | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|----------------|---------|---------|\n| **31 March** | **83,385** | **83,466** |\n\nNote:\n1. During March 2021, the Company received a dividend from one of its subsidiary investments.

Debtors\n\nAccounting policies\nAmounts owed by subsidiaries are classified and recorded at amortised cost and reduced by allowances for expected credit losses. Estimated future credit losses are first recorded on initial recognition of a receivable and are based on estimated probability of default. Individual balances are written off when management deems them not to be collectible. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n| Amounts falling due within one year: | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Amounts owed by subsidiaries\u00b9      | 163,667 | 224,799 |\n| Taxation recoverable               | 194     | 268     |\n| Other debtors                      | 14      | 71      |\n| Derivative financial instruments   | 274     | 681     |\n| **Total**                          | **164,149** | **225,819** |\n\n| Amounts falling due after more than one year: | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Deferred tax                                  | 164     | \u2013       |\n| Derivative financial instruments              | 2,964   | 8,424   |\n| **Total**                                     | **3,128** | **8,424** |\n\nNote:\n\u00b9 Amounts owned by subsidiaries are unsecured, have no fixed date of repayment and are repayable on demand with sufficient liquidity in the group to flow funds if required. Therefore expected credit losses are considered to be immaterial.\n\n4. Other Investments\n\nAccounting policies\nInvestments are classified and measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment.\n\n| Collateral | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|------------|---------|---------|\n| **Total**  | **3,107** | **1,115** |\n\n5. Creditors\n\nAccounting policies\nCapital market and bank borrowings\nInterest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception) and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated fair value hedge relationship. Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.\n\n| Amounts falling due within one year: | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Bonds                               | 2,251   | 2,259   |\n| Bank loans                          | \u2013       | 708     |\n| Collateral liabilities              | 962     | 5,292   |\n| Other borrowings                    | 36      | 56      |\n| Bank borrowings secured against Indian assets | 862 | \u2013 |\n| Amounts owed to subsidiaries\u00b2      | 158,017 | 208,258 |\n| Derivative financial instruments   | 109     | 559     |\n| Other creditors                     | 92      | 101     |\n| Accruals and deferred income\u00b2      | 432     | 89      |\n| **Total**                           | **162,761** | **217,322** |\n\n| Amounts falling due after more than one year: | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Deferred tax                                  | \u2013       | 722     |\n| Bonds                                         | 42,447  | 47,432  |\n| Bank loans                                    | 350     | 1,346   |\n| Bank borrowings secured against Indian assets | 385     | 951     |\n| Derivative financial instruments              | 3,940   | 4,177   |\n| **Total**                                     | **47,122** | **54,628** |\n\nNotes:\n\u00b9 Components for 2020 have been represented to align with the 2021 presentation, separating borrowings that were previously shown together as bonds and other loans. There is no impact on total amounts falling due within one year or total amounts falling due after more than one year.\n\u00b2 Amounts owed to subsidiaries are unsecured, have no fixed date of repayment and are repayable on demand.\n\u00b3 Includes \u00a3539 million (2020: \u00a3nil) payable in relation to the irrevocable and non-discretionary share buyback programme announced in March 2021.\n\nIncluded in amounts falling due after more than one year are bonds of \u20ac30,337 million which are due in more than five years from 1 April 2021 and are payable otherwise than by instalments. Interest payable on these bonds ranges from 0.0% to 7.875%.\n6. Called up share capital\n\nAccounting policies\n\nEquity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the amount of the proceeds received, net of direct issuance costs.\n\n| Ordinary shares of 20 \u00be%, US cents each allotted, issued and fully paid | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Number | \u00a3m | Number | \u00a3m |\n| 1 April | 28,815,914,978 | 4,797 | 28,815,258,178 | 4,796 |\n| Allotted during the year | 920,800 | \u2013 | 656,800 | 1 |\n| 31 March | 28,816,835,778 | 4,797 | 28,815,914,978 | 4,797 |\n\nNotes:\n1. At 31 March 2021 there were 50,000 (2020: 50,000) 7\u00bd% cumulative fixed rate shares of \u00a31 each in issue.\n2. At 31 March 2021 the Company held 592,642,509 (2020: 2,043,750,434) treasury shares with a nominal value of \u00a399 million (2020: \u00a3340 million). The market value of shares held was \u00a3918 million (2020: \u00a32,610 million). During the year, 63,830,400 (2020: 49,629,851) treasury shares were reissued under Group share schemes.\n3. On 5 March 2019 the Company announced the placing of subordinated mandatory convertible bonds totalling \u00a31.72 billion with a 2 year maturity date in 2021 and \u00a31.72 billion with a 3 year maturity date due in 2022. During the year, 1,426,788,937 treasury shares were issued in settlement of tranche 1 of the maturing subordinated mandatory convertible bond. The remaining bonds are convertible into a total of 1,426,788,937 ordinary shares with a conversion price of \u00a31.2055 per share. For further details see note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n7. Share-based payments\n\nAccounting policies\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans for the employees of subsidiaries using the Company\u2019s equity instruments. The fair value of the compensation given in respect of these share-based payment plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the Company\u2019s subsidiaries over the vesting period. The capital contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments.\n\nThe Company currently uses a number of equity-settled share plans to grant options and shares to the Directors and employees of its subsidiaries.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the Company had 62 million ordinary share options outstanding (2020: 53 million).\n\nThe Company has made capital contributions to its subsidiaries in relation to share-based payments. At 31 March 2021, the cumulative capital contribution net of payments received from subsidiaries was \u00a3218 million (2020: \u00a3169 million). During the year ended 31 March 2021, the total capital contribution arising from share-based payments was \u00a3136 million (2020: \u00a3136 million), with payments of \u00a387 million (2020: \u00a368 million) received from subsidiaries.\n\nFull details of share-based payments, share option schemes and share plans are disclosed in note 26 \u201cShare-based payments\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n8. Reserves\n\nThe Board is responsible for the Group\u2019s capital management including the approval of dividends. This includes an assessment of both the level of reserves legally available for distribution and consideration as to whether the Company would be solvent and retain sufficient liquidity following any proposed distribution.\n\nAs Vodafone Group Plc is a Group holding company with no direct operations, its ability to make shareholder distributions is dependent on its ability to receive funds for such purposes from its subsidiaries in a manner which creates profits available for distribution for the Company. The major factors that impact the ability of the Company to access profits held in subsidiary companies at an appropriate level to fulfil its needs for distributable reserves on an ongoing basis include:\n\n\u2013 the absolute size of the profit pools either currently available for distribution or capable of realisation into distributable reserves in the relevant entities;\n\u2013 the location of these entities in the Group\u2019s corporate structure;\n\u2013 profit and cash flow generation in those entities; and\n\u2013 the risk of adverse changes in business valuations giving rise to investment impairment charges, reducing profits available for distribution.\n\nThe Group\u2019s consolidated reserves set out on page 123 do not reflect the profits available for distribution in the Group.\n9. Equity dividends\n\nAccounting policies\nDividends paid and received are included in the Company financial statements in the period in which the related dividends are actually paid or received or, in respect of the Company\u2019s final dividend for the year, approved by shareholders.\n\n|                        | 2021 \u20acm | 2020 \u20acm |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Declared during the financial year: |         |         |\n| Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2020: 4.50 eurocents per share (2019: 4.16 eurocents per share) | 1,205    | 1,112    |\n| Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2021: 4.50 eurocents per share (2020: 4.50 eurocents per share) | 1,207    | 1,205    |\n| Proposed after the balance sheet date and not recognised as a liability: |         |         |\n| Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2021: 4.50 eurocents per share (2020: 4.50 eurocents per share) | 1,260    | 1,205    |\n\n10. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\n\nOther guarantees and contingent liabilities\nOther guarantees principally comprise the Company\u2019s guarantee of the Group\u2019s 50% share of a US$3.5 billion loan facility (2020: AUD1.7 billion and US$3.5 billion loan facilities), which forms part of the Group\u2019s overall joint venture investment in TPG Telecom Ltd (2020: Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited), and the guarantee of \u20ac1.8 billion (2020: \u20ac1.9 billion) of subsidiary spectrum payments.\n\nThe Company will guarantee the debts and liabilities of certain of its UK subsidiaries at the balance sheet date in accordance with section 479C of the Companies Act 2006. The Company has assessed the probability of loss under these guarantees as remote.\n\nAs detailed in note 25 \u201cPost employment benefits\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is the sponsor of the Group\u2019s main defined benefit scheme in the UK, being the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme (\u2018Vodafone UK plan\u2019). The results, assets and liabilities associated with the Vodafone UK plan are recognised in the financial statements of Vodafone UK Limited and Vodafone Group Services Limited.\n\nAs detailed in note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has covenanted to provide security on the Group\u2019s performance bonds and also in favour of the trustee of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme and the Trustees of THUS Plc Group Scheme.\n\nLegal proceedings\nDetails regarding certain legal actions which involve the Company are set out in note 29 \u201cContingent liabilities and legal proceedings\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n11. Other matters\n\nThe auditor\u2019s remuneration for the current year in respect of audit and audit-related services was \u20ac3 million (2020: \u20ac4 million) and for non-audit services was \u20acnil (2020: \u20ac1 million).\n\nThe Directors are remunerated by the Company for their services to the Group as a whole. No remuneration was paid to them specifically in respect of their services to Vodafone Group Plc for either year. Full details of the Directors\u2019 remuneration are disclosed in the \u201cAnnual Report on Remuneration\u201d on pages 82 to 103.\n\nThe Company had two (2020: two) employees throughout the year.\n\nVodafone Group Plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales (registration number 1833679). The registered address of the Company is Vodafone House, The Connection, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 2FN, England.\nNon-GAAP measures\n\nUnaudited information\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the discussion of the Group\u2019s reported operating results, non-GAAP measures are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management. However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all companies including those in the Group\u2019s industry. Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. Additionally, certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself a measure defined under GAAP. Such measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure.\n\nThe non-GAAP measures discussed in this document are listed below, together with the location of the definition and the reconciliation between the non-GAAP measure and the closest equivalent GAAP measure.\n\n| Non-GAAP measure                                      | Defined on page | Closest equivalent GAAP measure | Reconciled on page |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Performance metrics                                   |                 |                                 |                    |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                       | Page 218        | Operating profit                 | Page 23            |\n| Organic adjusted EBITDA growth                        | Page 218        | Not applicable                   | Not applicable     |\n| Organic percentage point change in adjusted EBITDA margin | Page 218        | Not applicable                   | Not applicable     |\n| Organic revenue growth                                | Page 218        | Reported revenue growth          | Page 219           |\n| Organic service revenue growth                         | Page 218        | Reported service revenue growth   | Pages 219 to 220   |\n| Organic mobile service revenue growth                  | Page 218        | Reported mobile service revenue growth | Pages 219 to 220 |\n| Organic fixed service revenue growth                   | Page 218        | Reported fixed service revenue growth | Pages 219 to 220 |\n| Organic retail revenue growth                          | Page 218        | Reported retail revenue growth    | Pages 219 to 220   |\n| Other metrics                                          |                 |                                 |                    |\n| Adjusted profit attributable to owners of the parent  | Page 221        | Profit attributable to owners of the parent | Page 221 |\n| Adjusted basic earnings per share                      | Page 221        | Basic earnings per share         | Page 221           |\n| Cash flow, funding and capital allocation metrics      |                 |                                 |                    |\n| Free cash flow (pre spectrum, restructuring and integration costs) | Page 222 | Inflow from operating activities | Page 222 |\n| Free cash flow                                         | Page 222        | Inflow from operating activities | Pages 30 and 222   |\n| Gross debt                                             | Page 222        | Borrowings                       | Page 222           |\n| Net debt                                               | Page 222        | Borrowings less cash and cash equivalents | Page 222 |\n| Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)                      | Page 223        | ROCE calculated on a GAAP basis  | Pages 223 to 224   |\n| Financing and Taxation metrics                         |                 |                                 |                    |\n| Adjusted net financing costs                           | Page 225        | Net financing costs              | Page 29            |\n| Adjusted profit before taxation                        | Page 225        | Profit before taxation           | Page 225           |\n| Adjusted income tax expense                            | Page 225        | Income tax expense               | Page 225           |\n| Adjusted effective tax rate                            | Page 225        | Effective tax rate               | Page 225           |\n| Share of adjusted results in equity accounted associates and joint ventures | Page 225 | Share of results in equity accounted associates and joint ventures | Page 226 |\nNon-GAAP measures (continued)\n\nUnaudited information\n\nPerformance metrics\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is our segment performance measure. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue.\n\nTo simplify our reporting, the Group no longer discloses adjusted operating profit and EBIT. These metrics were non-GAAP measures disclosed in the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\n| Non-GAAP measure | Purpose | Definition |\n|------------------|---------|------------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA  | It is used for internal performance reporting. It is used in conjunction with financial measures such as operating profit to assess our operating performance and profitability. It is a key external metric used by the investor community to assess performance of our operations. | Adjusted EBITDA is operating profit after depreciation on lease-related right of use assets and interest on leases but excluding depreciation, amortisation and gains/losses on disposal of owned fixed assets and excluding share of results in associates and joint ventures, impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, other income and expense and significant items that are not considered by management to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Group. |\n\nOrganic growth\n\nAll amounts in this document marked with an \u201c*\u201d represent organic growth. This measure presents performance on a comparable basis, including merger and acquisition activity and movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\nOrganic growth is calculated for revenue and profitability metrics, as follows:\n\n\u2212 Service revenue;\n\u2212 Mobile service revenue;\n\u2212 Fixed service revenue;\n\u2212 Retail revenue;\n\u2212 Adjusted EBITDA; and\n\u2212 Percentage point change in adjusted EBITDA margin.\n\nWhilst organic growth is not intended to be a substitute for reported growth, nor is it superior to reported growth, we believe that the measure provides useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons:\n\n\u2212 It provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of certain factors unrelated to its operating performance;\n\u2212 It is used for internal performance analysis; and\n\u2212 It facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies (although the term \u201corganic\u201d is not a defined term under GAAP and may not, therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies).\n\nWe have not provided a comparative in respect of organic growth rates as the current rates describe the change between the beginning and end of the current period, with such changes being explained by the commentary in this document. If comparatives were provided, significant sections of the commentary for prior periods would also need to be included, reducing the usefulness and transparency of this document.\n### Year ended 31 March 2021\n\n#### Service revenue\n\n|                      | FY21  | FY20  | Reported growth | Other activity (incl.

Capital employed includes total borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments included in trade and other receivables/payables, short term investments, collateral assets, financial liabilities under put option arrangements and equity. We calculate pre-tax ROCE (controlled operations) by dividing Operating profit excluding impairment losses, amortisation of customer bases and brand intangible assets, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, lease-related interest and other income and expense and excluding the share of results in associates and joint ventures. On a post-tax basis, the measure includes our share of results from associates and joint ventures and a notional tax charge. Capital is equivalent to net operating assets and is calculated as the average of opening and closing balances of: property, plant and equipment (including Right-of-Use assets and liabilities), intangible assets (including goodwill), operating working capital (including held for sale assets and excluding derivative balances) and provisions. Other assets that do not directly contribute to returns are excluded from this measure and include: other investments, current and deferred tax balances and post employment benefits. On a post-tax basis, ROCE also includes our investments in associates and joint ventures. |\n\n### Pre-tax ROCE for controlled operations.\n\n### Post-tax ROCE (including Associates and Joint Ventures)\n\nThe table below presents the calculation of ROCE using GAAP measures as reported in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n| FY21 \u20acm | FY20 \u20acm |\n|---------|---------|\n| Operating profit | 5,097 | 4,099 |\n| Total borrowings | 67,760 | 74,925 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | (5,821) | (13,557) |\n| Derivative financial instruments included in trade and other receivables | (3,151) | (9,176) |\n| Derivative financial instruments included in trade and other payables | 4,010 | 4,767 |\n| Short term investments | (4,007) | (4,132) |\n| Collateral assets | (3,107) | (1,115) |\n| Financial liabilities under put option arrangements | 492 | 1,850 |\n| Equity | 57,816 | 62,625 |\n| **Capital employed at end of the year** | **113,992** | **116,187** |\n| **Average capital employed for the year** | **115,090** | **104,255** |\n| **ROCE** | **4.4%** | **3.9%** |\n\n**Note:**\n\n1.

The use of electronic communications, rather than printed paper documents, means information about the Company can be accessed through emails or the Company\u2019s website, thus reducing our impact on the environment.\n\nA growing number of our shareholders have opted to receive communications from us electronically. Shareholders who have done so will be sent an email alert containing a link to the relevant documents.\n\nWe encourage all our shareholders to sign up for this service.

Through ShareGift, shareholders who have only a very small number of shares, which might be considered uneconomic to sell, are able to donate them to charity. Donated shares are aggregated and sold by ShareGift with the proceeds being passed on to a wide range of UK charities.\n\nSee sharegift.org or call +44 (0)20 7930 3737 for further details.\n\nLandmark Financial Asset Search\nWe participate in an online service which provides a search facility for solicitors and probate professionals to quickly and easily trace UK shareholdings relating to deceased estates.\n\nVisit www.landmarkfas.co.uk or call +44 (0)844 844 9967 for further information.\n\nWarning to shareholders (\u201cboiler room\u201d scams)\nOver recent years we have become aware of investors who have received unsolicited calls or correspondence, in some cases purporting to have been issued by us, concerning investment matters. These callers typically make claims of highly profitable investment opportunities which turn out to be worthless or simply do not exist. These approaches are usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals and are commonly known as \u201cboiler room\u201d scams. Investors are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice or offers to buy shares. If it sounds too good to be true, it often is.\n\nSee the FCA website at fca.org.uk/scamsmart for more detailed information about this or similar activities.\n\nDividends\nSee pages 23 and 152 for details on dividend amount per share.\n\nEuro dividends\nDividends are declared in euros and paid in euros and pounds sterling according to where the shareholder is resident. Cash dividends to ADS holders are paid by the ADS depositary bank in US dollars. This aligns the Group\u2019s shareholder returns with the primary currency in which we generate free cash flow. The foreign exchange rates at which dividends declared in euros are converted into pounds sterling and US dollars are calculated based on the average exchange rate of the five business days during the week prior to the payment of the dividend.\n\nPayment of dividends by direct credit\nWe pay cash dividends directly to shareholders\u2019 bank or building society accounts. This ensures secure delivery and means dividend payments are credited to shareholders\u2019 designated accounts on the same day as payment. A dividend confirmation covering both the interim and final dividends paid during the financial year is sent to shareholders at the time of the interim dividend in February. ADS holders may choose to have their cash dividends paid by cheque from our ADS depositary bank, Deutsche Bank.\n\nDividend reinvestment plan\nWe offer a dividend reinvestment plan which allows holders of ordinary shares who choose to participate to use their cash dividends to acquire additional shares in the Company. These are purchased on their behalf by the plan administrator, Equiniti, through a low-cost dealing arrangement. For ADS holders, Deutsche Bank, through its transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (AST), maintains the DB Global Direct Investor Services Program which is a direct purchase and sale plan for depositary receipts with a dividend reinvestment facility. See vodafone.com/dividends for further information about dividend payments or, alternatively, please contact our registrar, Equiniti or AST for ADS holders as applicable.\n\nContact information for Equiniti and AST can be found on page 227\n\nTaxation of dividends\nSee page 231 for details on dividend taxation.\n\nShareholders as at 31 March 2021\n\n| Number of ordinary shares | Number of accounts | % of total of issued shares |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| 1-1,000                   | 297,155            | 0.21                      |\n| 1,001-5,000               | 39,967             | 0.30                      |\n| 5,001-50,000              | 11,002             | 0.46                      |\n| 50,001-100,000            | 452                | 0.11                      |\n| 100,001-500,000           | 637                | 0.52                      |\n| More than 500,000         | 1,098              | 98.40                     |\n\nMajor shareholders\nAs at 17 May 2021, Deutsche Bank, as custodian of our ADR programme, held approximately 13.68% of our ordinary shares of 20 20/21 US cents each as nominee.\n\nAt this date, the total number of ADRs outstanding was 383,236,963 and 1,442 holders of ordinary shares had registered addresses in the United States and held a total of approximately 0.008% of the ordinary shares of the Company.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the following percentage interests in the ordinary share capital of the Company, disclosable under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, (DTR 5), have been notified to the Directors.\n\n| Shareholder | Shareholding |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| BlackRock, Inc.\u00b2 | 6.90% |\n| Norges Bank | 3.004% |\n\nNotes:\n1.

In order to satisfy the conversion of the first tranche of the MCB, 1,426,710,896 shares were issued from existing shares held in treasury. Under this programme the Company is expected to purchase up to the number of ordinary shares of 20 20/21 US cents each announced for the programme on 19 March 2021. The number of shares expected to be purchased is below the number permitted to be purchased by the Company pursuant to the authority granted by the shareholders at the 2020 AGM.\n\nFurther details of the programme can be found on page 31\n\nAt each AGM all Directors shall offer themselves for re-election in accordance with the Company\u2019s Articles of Association and in the interests of good corporate governance.\n\nDirectors are not required under the Company\u2019s Articles of Association to hold any shares of the Company as a qualification to act as a Director, although the Executive Directors are required to under the Company\u2019s Remuneration Policy.\n\nFull details of the Remuneration Policy can be found on pages 84 to 89\n\n**Rights attaching to the Company\u2019s shares**\nAt 31 March 2021, the issued share capital of the Company was comprised of 50,000 7% cumulative fixed rate shares of \u00a31.00 each and 28,224,193,469 ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares) of 20 20/21 US cents each. As at 31 March 2021, 592,642,309 ordinary shares were held in Treasury.\n\n**Dividend rights**\nHolders of 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are entitled to be paid in respect of each financial year, or other accounting period of the Company, a fixed cumulative preferential dividend of 7% p.a. on the nominal value of the fixed rate shares. A fixed cumulative preferential dividend may only be paid out of available distributable profits which the Directors have resolved should be distributed.\n\nThe fixed rate shares do not have any other right to share in the Company\u2019s profits.\n\nHolders of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends but may not declare dividends in excess of the amount recommended by the Directors. The Board of Directors may also pay interim dividends. No dividend may be paid other than out of profits available for distribution.\n\nDividends on ordinary shares can be paid to shareholders in whatever currency the Directors decide, using an appropriate exchange rate for any currency conversions which are required.\n\nIf a dividend has not been claimed for one year after the date of the resolution passed at a general meeting declaring that dividend or the resolution of the Directors providing for payment of that dividend, the Directors may invest the dividend or use it in some other way for the benefit of the Company until the dividend is claimed. If the dividend remains unclaimed for 12 years after the relevant resolution either declaring that dividend or providing for payment of that dividend, it will be forfeited and belong to the Company.\n\n**Voting rights**\nAt a general meeting of the Company, when voting on substantive resolutions (i.e. any resolution which is not a procedural resolution) each shareholder who is entitled to vote and is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every share held (a poll vote). Procedural resolutions (such as a resolution to adjourn a general meeting or a resolution on the choice of Chairman of a general meeting) shall be decided on a show of hands, where each shareholder who is present at the meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is demanded.\n\nShareholders entitled to vote at general meetings may appoint proxies who are entitled to vote, attend and speak at general meetings. Two shareholders present in person or by proxy constitute a quorum for purposes of a general meeting of the Company.\n\nUnder English law, shareholders of a public company such as the Company are not permitted to pass resolutions by written consent. Record holders of the Company\u2019s ADSs are entitled to attend, speak and vote on a poll or a show of hands at any general meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders by the depositary\u2019s appointment of them as corporate representatives or proxies with respect to the underlying ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Alternatively, holders of ADSs are entitled to vote by supplying their voting instructions to the depositary or its nominee who will vote the ordinary shares underlying their ADSs in accordance with their instructions.\n\nHolders of the Company\u2019s ADSs are entitled to receive notices of shareholders\u2019 meetings under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to the ADSs.\n\nEmployees who hold shares in a vested nominee share account are able to vote through the respective plan\u2019s trustees. Note there is now a vested share account with Computershare (in respect of shares arising from a SAYE exercise) and Equatex (MyShareBank).\n\nHolders of the Company\u2019s 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are only entitled to vote on any resolution to vary or abrogate the rights attached to the fixed rate shares. Holders have one vote for every fully paid 7% cumulative fixed rate share.\nShareholder information (continued)\n\nLiquidation rights\nIn the event of the liquidation of the Company, after payment of all liabilities and deductions in accordance with English law, the holders of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares will be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on such shares, together with certain dividend payments, in priority to holders of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares. The holders of the fixed rate shares do not have any other right to share in the Company\u2019s surplus assets.\n\nPre-emptive rights and new issues of shares\nUnder section 549 of the Companies Act 2006 Directors are, with certain exceptions, unable to allot the Company\u2019s ordinary shares or securities convertible into the Company\u2019s ordinary shares without the authority of the shareholders in a general meeting. In addition, section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 imposes further restrictions on the issue of equity securities (as defined in the Companies Act 2006) which include the Company\u2019s ordinary shares and securities convertible into ordinary shares which are, or are to be, paid up wholly in cash and not first offered to existing shareholders. The Company\u2019s Articles of Association allow shareholders to authorise Directors for a period specified in the relevant resolution to allot (i) relevant securities generally up to an amount fixed by the shareholders; and (ii) equity securities for cash other than in connection with a pre-emptive offer up to an amount specified by the shareholders and free of the pre-emption restriction in section 561. At the 2020 AGM the amount of relevant securities fixed by shareholders under (i) above and the amount of equity securities specified by shareholders under (ii) above were in line with the Pre-Emption Group\u2019s Statement of Principles.\n\nFurther details of such proposals are provided in the 2021 Notice of AGM.\n\nDisclosure of interests in the Company\u2019s shares\nThere are no provisions in the Articles of Association whereby persons acquiring, holding or disposing of a certain percentage of the Company\u2019s shares are required to make disclosure of their ownership percentage although such requirements exist under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\n\nGeneral meetings and notices\nSubject to the Articles of Association, AGMs are held at such times and place as determined by the Directors of the Company. The Directors may also, when they think fit, convene other general meetings of the Company. General meetings may also be convened on requisition as provided by the Companies Act 2006.\n\nAn AGM is required to be called on not less than 21 days\u2019 notice in writing. Subject to obtaining shareholder approval on an annual basis, the Company may call other general meetings on 14 days\u2019 notice. The Directors may determine that persons entitled to receive notices of meetings are those persons entered on the register at the close of business on a day determined by the Directors but not later than 21 days before the date the relevant notice is sent. The notice may also specify the record date, the time of which shall be determined in accordance with the Articles of Association and the Companies Act 2006.\n\nUnder section 336 of the Companies Act 2006 the AGM must be held each calendar year and within six months of the Company\u2019s year end.\n\nVariation of rights\nIf at any time the Company\u2019s share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, either with the consent in writing of the holders of three quarters in nominal value of the shares of that class or at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\n\nAt every such separate meeting all of the provisions of the Articles of Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that (i) the quorum is to be the number of persons (which must be at least two) who hold or represent by proxy not less than one third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class or, if such quorum is not present on an adjourned meeting, one person who holds shares of the class representing not less than one third in nominal value of the shares of that class or at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\n\nLimitations on transfer, voting and shareholding\nAs far as the Company is aware there are no limitations imposed on the transfer, holding or voting of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares other than those limitations that would generally apply to all of the shareholders, those that apply by law (e.g. due to insider dealing rules) or those that apply as a result of failure to comply with a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nNo shareholder has any securities carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities.\n\nDocuments on display\nThe Company is subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers. In accordance with these requirements the Company files its Annual Report on Form 20-F and other related documents with the SEC. These documents may be inspected at the SEC\u2019s public reference rooms located at 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549. Information on the operation of the public reference room can be obtained in the United States by calling the SEC on +1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s SEC filings, including all those filed on or after 4 November 2002, are available on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. Shareholders can also obtain copies of the Company\u2019s Articles of Association from our website at vodafone.com/governance or from the Company\u2019s registered office.\n\nMaterial contracts\nAt the date of this Annual Report the Group is not party to any contracts that are considered material to its results or operations except for:\n\n- its \u20ac3,860,000,000 and US$ 3,935,000,000 revolving credit facilities which are discussed in note 21 \u201cBorrowings\u201d to the consolidated statements;\n- Contribution and Transfer Agreement dated 31 December 2016, as amended, relating to the contribution and/or transfer of shares in Ziggo Group Holding B.V. and Vodafone Libertel B.V. to Lynx Global Europe II B.V. and the formation of the Netherlands joint venture;\n- the Implementation Agreement dated 20 March 2017, as amended, relating to the combination of the Indian mobile telecommunications businesses of Vodafone Group and Idea Group as detailed in note 27 \u201cAcquisitions and disposals\u201d to the consolidated financial statements;\n- the Implementation Agreement dated 25 April 2018 relating to the combination of the businesses of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel;\n- the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 9 May 2018 relating to the purchase of Liberty Global plc\u2019s businesses in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic;\n- the Transitional Services Agreement dated 31 July 2019 relating to services and cooperation relating to the sale of Liberty Global plc\u2019s businesses in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic;\n- the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 31 July 2019 relating to the sale of Vodafone New Zealand; and\n- the Deed of Merger dated 31 March 2020 relating to the combination of Vodafone Italy\u2019s towers with INWIT\u2019s passive network infrastructure.\nExchange controls\nThere are no UK Government laws, decrees or regulations that restrict or affect the export or import of capital including, but not limited to, foreign exchange controls on remittance of dividends on the ordinary shares or on the conduct of the Group\u2019s operations.\n\nTaxation\nAs this is a complex area investors should consult their own tax adviser regarding the US federal, state and local, the UK and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances.\n\nThis section describes, primarily for a US holder (as defined below), in general terms, the principal US federal income tax and UK tax consequences of owning or disposing of shares or ADSs in the Company held as capital assets (for US and UK tax purposes). This section does not, however, cover the tax consequences for members of certain classes of holders subject to special rules including, for example, US expatriates and former long-term residents of the United States; officers and employees of the Company; holders that, directly, indirectly or by attribution, hold 5% or more of the Company\u2019s stock (by vote or value); financial institutions; insurance companies; individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts; tax-exempt organizations; dealers in securities or currencies; investors that will hold shares or ADSs as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for US federal income tax purposes; investors holding shares or ADSs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the US; or US holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar.\n\nA US holder is a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs that is for US federal income tax purposes:\n\n- an individual citizen or resident of the United States;\n- US domestic corporation;\n- an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its source; or\n- a trust, if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust\u2019s administration and one or more US persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to be treated as a domestic trust for US federal income tax purposes.\n\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. Holders that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning the US federal income tax consequences to them and their partners of the ownership and disposition of shares or ADSs by the partnership.\n\nThis section is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, and on the tax laws of the UK, the Double Taxation Convention between the United States and the UK (the \u2018treaty\u2019) and current HM Revenue and Customs (\u2018HMRC\u2019) published practice, all as of the date hereof. These laws and such practice are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.\n\nThis section is further based in part upon the representations of the depositary and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nFor the purposes of the treaty and the US-UK double taxation convention relating to estate and gift taxes (the \u2018Estate Tax Convention\u2019), and for US federal income tax and UK tax purposes, this section is based on the assumption that a holder of ADRs evidencing ADSs will generally be treated as the owner of the shares in the Company represented by those ADRs. Investors should note that a ruling by the first-tier tax tribunal in the UK has cast doubt on this view, but HMRC have stated that they will continue to apply their long-standing practice of regarding the holder of such ADRs as holding the beneficial interest in the underlying shares. Similarly, the US Treasury has expressed concern that US holders of depository receipts (such as holders of ADRs representing our ADSs) may be claiming foreign tax credits in situations where an intermediary in the chain of ownership between such holders and the issuer of the security underlying the depository receipts, or a party to whom depository receipts or deposited shares are delivered by the depository prior to the receipt by the depository of the corresponding securities, has taken actions inconsistent with the ownership of the underlying security by the person claiming the credit, such as a disposition of such security. Such actions may also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced tax rates that may be applicable to certain dividends received by certain non-corporate holders, as described below. Accordingly, (i) the creditability of any UK taxes and (ii) the availability of the reduced tax rates for any dividends received by certain non-corporate US holders, each as described below, could be affected by actions taken by such parties or intermediaries. Generally exchanges of shares for ADRs and ADRs for shares will not be subject to US federal income tax or to UK tax other than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (see the section on these taxes on page 219).\n\nTaxation of dividends\nUK taxation\nUnder current UK law, there is no requirement to withhold tax from the dividends that we pay. Shareholders who are within the charge to UK corporation tax will be subject to corporation tax on the dividends we pay unless the dividends fall within an exempt class and certain other conditions are met. It is expected that the dividends we pay would generally be exempt.\n\nIndividual shareholders in the Company who are resident in the UK will be subject to the income tax on the dividends we pay. Dividends will be taxable in the UK at the dividend rates applicable where the income received is above the dividend allowance (currently \u00a32,000 per tax year) which is taxed at a nil rate. Dividend income is treated as the highest part of an individual shareholder\u2019s income and the dividend allowance will count towards the basic or higher rate limits (as applicable) which may affect the rate of tax due on any dividend income in excess of the allowance.\n\nUS federal income taxation\nSubject to the passive foreign investment company (PFIC) rules described below, a US holder is subject to US federal income taxation on the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes). Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the US holder\u2019s basis in the shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain.\n\nHowever, the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with US federal income tax accounting principles. US holders should therefore assume that any distribution by the Company with respect to shares will be reported as ordinary dividend income. Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder will be taxable to the holder at the reduced rate normally applicable to long-term capital gains provided that certain requirements are met.\n\nDividends must be included in income when the US holder, in the case of shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution to be included in income will be the US dollar value of the pound sterling or euro payments made determined at the spot pound sterling/US dollar rate or the spot euro/US dollar rate, as applicable, on the date the dividends are received.\nby the US holder, in the case of shares, or the depository, in the case of ADSs, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars at that time. If dividends received in pounds sterling or euros are converted into US dollars on the day they are received, the US holder generally will not be required to recognise any foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income.\n\nWhere UK tax is payable on any dividends received, a US holder may be entitled, subject to certain limitations, to a foreign tax credit in respect of such taxes.\n\n**Taxation of capital gains**\n\n**UK taxation**\n\nA US holder that is not resident in the UK will generally not be liable for UK tax in respect of any capital gain realised on a disposal of our shares or ADSs.\n\nHowever, a US holder may be liable for both UK and US tax in respect of a gain on the disposal of our shares or ADSs if the US holder:\n\n- is a citizen of the United States and is resident in the UK;\n- is an individual who realises such a gain during a period of \u201ctemporary non-residence\u201d (broadly, where the individual becomes resident in the UK, having ceased to be so resident for a period of five years or less, and was resident in the UK for at least four out of the seven tax years immediately preceding the year of departure from the UK);\n- is a US domestic corporation resident in the UK by reason of being centrally managed and controlled in the UK; or\n- is a citizen or a resident of the United States, or a US domestic corporation, that has used, held or acquired the shares or ADSs in connection with a branch, agency or permanent establishment in the UK through which it carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK.\n\nIn such circumstances, relief from double taxation may be available under the treaty. Holders who may fall within one of the above categories should consult their professional advisers.\n\n**US federal income taxation**\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules described below, a US holder that sells or otherwise disposes of our shares or ADSs generally will recognise a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the amount realised and the holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the shares or ADSs. This capital gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the US holder\u2019s holding period in the shares or ADSs exceeds one year.\n\nThe gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of losses is subject to limitations.\n\n**Additional tax considerations**\n\n**UK inheritance tax**\n\nAn individual who is domiciled in the United States (for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention) and is not a UK national will not be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of our shares or ADSs on the individual\u2019s death or on a transfer of the shares or ADSs during the individual\u2019s lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax is paid, unless the shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a UK permanent establishment or pertain to a UK fixed base used for the performance of independent personal services. Where the shares or ADSs have been placed in trust by a settlor they may be subject to UK inheritance tax unless, when the trust was created, the settlor was domiciled in the United States and was not a UK national. Where the shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to US federal gift or estate tax, the estate tax convention generally provides a credit against US federal tax liabilities for UK inheritance tax paid.\n\n**UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax**\n\nStamp duty will, subject to certain exceptions, be payable on any instrument transferring our shares to the custodian of the depositary at the rate of 1.5% on the amount or value of the consideration if on sale or on the value of such shares if not on sale. Stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT), at the rate of 1.5% of the amount or value of the consideration or the value of the shares, could also be payable in these circumstances but no SDRT will be payable if stamp duty equal to such SDRT liability is paid.\n\nFollowing rulings of the European Court of Justice and the first-tier tax tribunal in the UK, HMRC have confirmed that the 1.5% SDRT charge will not be levied on an issue of shares to a depositary receipt system on the basis that such a charge is contrary to EU law.\n\nNo stamp duty should in practice be required to be paid on any transfer of our ADSs provided that the ADSs and any separate instrument of transfer are executed and retained at all times outside the UK.\n\nA transfer of our shares in registered form will attract ad valorem stamp duty generally at the rate of 0.5% of the purchase price of the shares. There is no charge to ad valorem stamp duty on gifts.\n\nSDRT is generally payable on an unconditional agreement to transfer our shares in registered form at 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration for the transfer, but if, within six years of the date of the agreement, an instrument transferring the shares is executed and stamped, any SDRT which has been paid would be repayable or, if the SDRT has not been paid, the liability to pay the tax (but not necessarily interest and penalties) would be cancelled. However, an agreement to transfer our ADSs will not give rise to SDRT.\n\n**PFIC rules**\n\nWe do not believe that our shares or ADSs will be stock of a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year or the foreseeable future. This conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus is subject to change. If we are a PFIC, US holders of shares would be required (i) to pay a special US addition to tax on certain distributions and (ii) any gain realised on the sale or other disposition of the shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as a capital gain unless a US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to the shares or ADSs.\n\nOtherwise a US holder would be treated as if he or she has realised such gain and certain \u201cexcess distributions\u201d rateably over the holding period for the shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated. An interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such preceding year beginning with the first such year in which our shares or ADSs were treated as stock in a PFIC would also apply. In addition, dividends received from us would not be eligible for the reduced rate of tax described above under \u201cTaxation of dividends \u2013 US federal income taxation\u201d.\n\n**Back-up withholding and information reporting**\n\nPayments of dividends and other proceeds to a US holder with respect to shares or ADSs, by a US paying agent or other US intermediary will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and to the US holder as may be required under applicable regulations. Back-up withholding may apply to these payments if the US holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.\n\nCertain US holders are not subject to back-up withholding. US holders should consult their tax advisers about these rules and any other reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or disposition of shares or ADSs, including requirements related to the holding of certain foreign financial assets.\nHistory and development\n\nThe Company was incorporated under English law in 1984 as Racial Strategic Radio Limited (registered number 1833679). After various name changes, 20% of Racial Telecom Plc share capital was offered to the public in October 1988. The Company was fully demerged from Racial Electronics Plc and became an independent company in September 1991 at which time it changed its name to Vodafone Group Plc.\n\nSince then we have entered into various transactions which impacted on the development of the Group. The most significant in the year ended 31 March 2021 are summarised below.\n\n- On 13 July 2020, the Group announced that Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited (\u2018VHA\u2019) and TPG Telecom Limited (\u2018TPG\u2019) had completed their merger. The merged entity was admitted to the Australian Securities Exchange (\u2018ASX\u2019) on 30 June 2020 and is known as TPG Telecom Limited. Vodafone and Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Limited each own an economic interest of 25.05% in the merged unit, with the remaining 49.9% listed as free float on the ASX.\n\n- On 26 November 2020, the Group announced that the merger of Indus Towers Limited and Bharti Infratel Limited had completed. The combined company is listed on the National Stock Exchange of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange and was renamed Indus Towers Limited following the merger. Vodafone holds a 28.1% shareholding in the combined company.\n\n- On 21 December 2020, the Group announced that it had completed the combination of the tower infrastructure assets of Vodafone Greece with those of Wind Hellas Telecommunications SA. The combined entity (\u2018Vantage Towers Greece\u2019) is the largest tower infrastructure company in Greece.\n\n- On 11 January 2021, Vodafone Limited (\u2018Vodafone UK\u2019) and Telefonica UK Limited announced the commercialisation of Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited (\u2018Cornerstone\u2019), the 50:50 joint venture company that owns and manages their passive tower infrastructure in the UK. Vodafone subsequently transferred its 50% shareholding to Vantage Towers AG on 14 January 2020.\n\n- Vantage Towers AG completed an initial public offering and the first day of trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange was 18 March 2021. The offer consisted solely of a secondary sell-down of existing shares held by Vodafone GmbH.\n\nRegulation\n\nIntroduction\n\nOur operating companies are generally subject to regulation governing the operation of their business activities. Such regulation typically takes the form of industry specific law and regulation covering telecommunications services and general competition (antitrust) law applicable to all activities. The following section describes the regulatory frameworks and the key regulatory developments at national and regional level and in the European Union (\u2018EU\u2019), in which we had significant interests during the year ended 31 March 2021. Many of the regulatory developments reported in the following section involve ongoing proceedings or consideration of potential proceedings that have not reached a conclusion. Accordingly, we are unable to attach a specific level of financial risk to our performance from such matters.\n\nEuropean Union (\u2018EU\u2019)\n\nThe new European Electronic Communications Code (\u2018Code\u2019) has updated the telecoms regulatory framework in Europe. The Code was required to be implemented by Member States in Europe by December 2020. In February 2021, the European Commission (\u2018EC\u2019) started infringement procedures against the 24 Member States that did not meet the deadline including Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, and Spain. The Code has been transposed and is in force in Hungary and Greece.\n\nIn November 2020, the EC tabled the first legislative initiative under the EU Data Strategy and the Data Governance Act, which intended to facilitate sharing and reuse of public sector data by increasing trust, reducing barriers to data sharing and increasing citizen control. In December 2020, the EC published the Digital Services Act package, comprising a Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, intended to reshape the regulatory environment for digital services in Europe regarding security, fairness and competition.\n\nIn December 2020, the EC published two legal acts mandated under the European Electronic Communications Code: (1) EC\u2019s Recommendation on relevant markets to identify those product and service markets in which ex ante regulation may be justified, (2) the Delegated Act setting a single maximum Union-wide mobile voice termination rate and a single maximum Union-wide fixed voice termination rate applicable to any provider of fixed and mobile termination services across the Union in the next five years.\n\nIn February 2021, the EC proposed the prolongation of the Roaming Regulation for 10 years in order to ensure the continuation of Roam-Like-at-Home. The EC proposes to reduce the wholesale caps for all services (data, voice and SMS) and bring new measures on transparency, quality of service and access to emergency communications.\n\nIn March 2021, the EC published a \u201cConnectivity Toolbox\u201d, which is a joint deliverable of Member States and the EC containing best practices on network cost reduction, spectrum authorisation for 5G, the environmental footprint and environmental impact assessment of networks as well as Electronic Magnetic Fields. The objective of this toolbox is to reduce the cost of broadband deployment in Europe for Network Operators while the EC is in the process of revising the Broadband Cost Reduction Directive.\n\nIn March 2021, the EC presented the 2030 Digital Decade Compass, setting the EU\u2019s digital ambitions for the next decade, including two overarching targets for all European households to have gigabit connectivity by 2030, and for all populated areas to be covered by 5G. The EC proposes to publish a new Annual European Digital Decade report which will include \u2018traffic lights\u2019 on the EU\u2019s and Member States\u2019 progress towards the 2030 digital ambition.\nAddressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Next Generation EU package is the Union\u2019s means to support the recovery processes in EU Member States. The bulk of the proposed recovery measures will be powered by a new temporary recovery instrument worth \u20ac750 billion. A significant amount will be allocated towards digital and green initiatives, with a proposed minimum of 20% of the Recovery and Resilience Facility to be allocated to digital and 37% to green initiatives.\n\n**Europe region**\n\n**Germany**\n\nIn May 2017, the national regulatory authority (\u2018BNetzA\u2019) initiated the market review process for wholesale access at fixed locations in the markets for access to unbundled local loop (ULL) and for virtual unbundled local access (VULA) as well as for access to bitstream wholesale products. However, mainly due to the delay of the new German telecoms law implementing the Code, BNetzA has not yet published a draft regulatory order on possible remedies and the future of fibre access regulation. It is expected that BNetzA will publish the draft shortly after adoption of the telecoms law.\n\nIn September 2019, BNetzA published a draft decision regarding the fixed access market review that indicated that Deutsche Telekom has significant market power across all speeds, technologies and regions. Cable operators are not defined as being dominant.\n\nAs part of the process of implementing the Code, the German Parliament approved an abolition of the right to bill TV services via ancillary costs in Multi Dwelling Units with a transition period for the existing footprint until June 2024. The law is expected to enter into force on December 2021.\n\n**Italy**\n\nIn March 2017, the national regulatory authority (\u2018AGCOM\u2019) imposed a minimum billing period of one month for fixed and convergent offers, effective by the end of June 2017. The operators appealed AGCOM\u2019s resolution before the Administrative Court and the appeal was rejected in February 2018. Vodafone Italy filed an appeal before the Council of State and after the public hearing held in July 2020, the Council of State issued a Preliminary referral to the Court of Justice in order to assess if the NRA has the power to impose minimum and binding billing periods under EU law.\n\nIn January 2020, the national competition authority (\u2018AGCM\u2019) ruled that Vodafone, TIM, Fastweb and WindTre would have coordinated their commercial strategies relating to the transition from four-week billing (28 days) to monthly billing, with the maintenance of a 8.6% price increase, in violation of art.101 of TFEU. Vodafone\u2019s appeal on the Authority\u2019s decision is pending before the Administrative Tribunal. The hearing will take place in May 2021.\n\nThe frequencies in the 2.1 GHz band are being renewed until 2029. The cost has already been defined and is different for the single advance payment or with annual instalments. For renewal, Vodafone Italy will have to pay \u20ac240m (single payment) by April 2021 or the first of eight annual instalments of \u20ac36m for a total amount of \u20ac276m. In the event of non-payment, the frequencies will expire in December 2021.\n\nIn April 2021, AGCOM started a public consultation on the co-investment commitments presented by TIM in January 2021 to verify the applicability of art. 76 of the Code.\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\nThe national regulatory authority (\u2018Ofcom\u2019) issued its Fixed Wholesale Telecoms Market statement setting regulation for consumer and business connectivity services until 2026. Ofcom are keen to encourage wider investment in fibre, with wholesale pricing anticipated to rise to fund this. While basic services will be subject to +CPI price caps, most other services will not be directly price-regulated, however equivalence and supply obligations will be retained in most UK areas.\n\nIn March 2021, Vodafone acquired 40MHz of 3.6GHz spectrum expiring in 2041 for \u00a3176 million. Vodafone\u2019s total holdings in 3.4-3.6 GHz are 90 MHz. The assignment stage, which will determine the final location of the spectrum, is currently taking place and is expected to be completed in April.\n\n**Spain**\n\nVodafone Spain has requested a three-year extension and modification of the commitments which ended in April 2020 in relation to the Movistar\u2013DTS merger in 2015. Following Vodafone Spain\u2019s extension request in February 2020, the national regulatory authority (\u2018CNMC\u2019) rendered public its Resolution extending the term of most of the initial commitments for an additional period of three years, ensuring access to Movistar Estrellas and Movistar Series channels. The Resolution has eliminated the commitment that limited the terms in which Telef\u00f3nica could acquire SVOD content, which has been appealed by Vodafone.\n\nIn May 2019, the Ministry of Economy and Enterprise launched a 5G public consultation on 700MHz, 1.5GHz and 26GHz spectrum bands. In December 2019, the Ministry launched a public consultation to modify the Spanish National Frequencies Plan relative to the 700MHz auction. The Ministry approved the final cap that will apply for the 700 MHz band, expected to be auctioned in Q1 FY2021. In December 2020 there was a public consultation on 700 MHz auction rules, which included stringent obligations related to price, coverage and wholesale access.\n\nThe Spanish Government approved a strategic digitalisation plan \u2018Espa\u00f1a Digital 2025\u2019. The plan contains 10 strategic pillars, including a \u20ac2.3 billion Connectivity Plan and a \u20ac2 billion 5G Boosting Plan for 2021-2025.\n\nIn November 2020, a public consultation on the new Audiovisual Act, intended to transpose the Audio-Visual Services Directive into national legislation, launched for comments and is expected to be approved in 2021.\n\nIn November 2020, CNMC published a public consultation on Market 3a and 3b review which is expected to be approved in Q1 FY2021. The proposal implies an increase in the number of deregulated municipalities and would reduce the period for closure of copper exchanges from five to two years.\n\nIn December 2020, the government approved a Royal Decree modifying the current Consumers Law, in which companies providing telephony customer care services must offer an alternative number (mobile or landline) where the cost of a call must be equal to or less than the cost of a call to a standard geographic or mobile number.\n\n**Ireland**\n\nIn April 2019, the national regulatory authority (\u2018ComReg\u2019) published its final decision on Universal Service funding applications by eircom Ltd (\u2018eir\u2019) for 2010 to 2015. ComReg found that the net cost of the USO did not represent an unfair burden on eir. Subsequently, eir have challenged this decision. The proceedings are ongoing, and Vodafone Ireland is a notice party to these proceedings.\n\nIn May 2019, ComReg initiated a review of the regulated Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). In its draft decision notified to the EC in June 2020, ComReg proposed the regulated fixed WACC should fall from 8.18% to 5.61%. In line with the decrease of the WACC, the EC urged ComReg to update relevant fixed pricing decisions as soon as possible, to ensure that prices in the Irish wholesale markets reflect current market conditions. ComReg issued its decision on the WACC in October 2020 and decided to update WACC as part of an overall review of the Access Network Model. The final decision is expected in the second half of 2021.\nIn December 2020, ComReg published its decision on the Multi-Band Spectrum Auction. In late January 2021, Three Ireland (Hutchison) Ltd and Three Ireland Services (Hutchison) Ltd (collectively \u2018Three\u2019) lodged an appeal to the decision. The proceedings were given a hearing for June 2021.\n\nComReg and the Irish government have continued to extend the Temporary Spectrum Measures. The measures have extended for two further three-month periods until October 2021. As part of these measures the 2.1GHz licenses have been liberalised and there is a facility to apply for 2.6GHz spectrum for specific hotspots as required.\n\n**Portugal**\n\nIn June 2019, Vodafone Portugal launched a court action against the national regulatory authority (\u2018ANACOM\u2019) seeking the revocation of Dense Air\u2019s spectrum licence under the \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 principle. In March 2020, Vodafone Portugal launched another court action against an ANACOM December 2019 decision which amends \u2013 instead of revoking \u2013 Dense Air\u2019s spectrum license. On November 2020, Vodafone Portugal brought a precautionary proceeding against ANACOM regarding the restrictive impact in the 5G auction of maintaining Dense Air\u2019s spectrum licence. Legal proceedings are ongoing.\n\nIn February 2020, the Portuguese Government put forward a Resolution setting out its 5G Strategy. Following this, ANACOM launched a public consultation on the 5G Auction Regulation and in November 2020 ANACOM published its final decision. Vodafone submitted a court action against ANACOM in relation to discriminatory measures between new entrants and current MNOs, which is pending decision. In the meantime, the auction, which began in December 2020, is ongoing.\n\nIn July 2020, the national competition authority (AdC) sent Vodafone Portugal and three other national operators a statement of objections (SO) alleging that operators may have formed a cartel to limit competition in telecoms services advertising via the Google search engine. In October 2020, Vodafone Portugal responded to the SO and proceedings are ongoing. Vodafone has also filed motions and appeals with different authorities regarding procedural irregularities and invalidity of evidence collected during the December 2018 raid at Vodafone Portugal\u2019s premises. In December 2020, a Court decision declared email evidence collected at Vodafone Portugal\u2019s premises to be inadmissible.\n\nVodafone Portugal continues to challenge payment notices totalling \u20ac34.8 million issued by ANACOM regarding 2012-2014 extraordinary compensation of Universal Service net costs.\n\nIn March 2021, ANACOM decided on the annual review of prices applicable to circuits connecting the mainland and the autonomous regions of Azores and Madeira (CAM circuits) and the various islands in Azores (inter-island circuits) which are managed by the operator with significant market power and subject to cost-orientation. Prices applicable to traditional/non-Ethernet circuits and inter-islands circuits were maintained, whereas prices applicable to CAM Ethernet circuits were lowered by 10%. New prices apply retroactively as of October 2020.\n\n**Romania**\n\nIn August 2020, the Government initiated the 5G Security Draft Law following the administrative approval process; however, the final parliamentary process has not yet been finalised. The 5G spectrum auction is delayed until the second half of 2021.\n\nIn October 2020, following a review of the wholesale markets for fixed access, the national regulatory authority (ANCOM) decided to maintain its previous decision regarding market competitiveness, therefore markets 3a and 3b continue to be free of significant market power-based remedies.\n\nIn November 2020, fixed termination rates decreased by 30% to \u20ac0.098 cents/min.\n\n**Greece**\n\nFortinet has filed a complaint with the Administrative Court requesting the annulment of the Vectoring/FTTH allocation decisions. The hearing date has been postponed to November 2021.\n\nIn December 2020, Vodafone Greece acquired 2x10 MHz of 700 MHz, 2x20 MHz of 2.1GHz, 140 MHz of 3.5 GHz, and 400 MHz of 26 GHz in the recent auction for \u20ac130m. The spectrum acquired has a 15-year duration to 2035, with the option of a further five-year extension.\n\nFollowing the publication of the 5G Auction Tender document, a petition by Greek residents for its annulment, as well as for any future administrative acts, was filed before the Council of the State on the grounds it infringed environmental protection provisions. The hearing date is set for May 2021.\n\nThe national regulatory authority\u2019s (EETT) decision in relation to Wind\u2019s complaint against Vodafone Greece and Cosmote alleging abuse of dominance in relation to calls to mobile networks in Albania is pending.\n\nVodafone Greece appealed EETT\u2019s decision on the MVNO access dispute resolution between Vodafone and Fortinet. The hearing of the case is pending.\n\nIn June 2020, the BU-LRIC + model for access services to the local loop/sub-loop, virtual products including FTTC/H and related services took effect.\n\nThe development of a margin squeeze test model based on non-discrimination obligation for OTE\u2019s retail plans is currently in progress. The public consultation for the model\u2019s main principles and methodology was completed in November 2019 and the public consultation was completed in March 2021. Vodafone Greece has requested a second short-term consultation before the final decision is notified to EC.\n\n**Czech Republic**\n\nFollowing statement of objections sent by EC in August 2019 to O2 Czech Republic, CETIN and T-Mobile Czech Republic for their network sharing agreement, the Commission\u2019s investigation continued in 2020.\n\nIn April 2020, the 900MHz band was reshuffled to provide one contiguous block to each 900MHz holder.\n\nIn August 2020 and September 2020, Vodafone appealed against the terms of the 5G spectrum auction to both the CTU Council and the administrative court respectively; and both were dismissed. In March 2021, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed Vodafone\u2019s appeal. Vodafone filed a complaint to the EC after the auction was completed, arguing that the auction terms set by the CTU infringed EU law. The case is pending.\n\nIn November 2020, the CTU ruled to uphold the mobile termination rate at CZK 0.248/0.95 eurocent set by November 2020.\n\nIn January 2021, Vodafone acquired 2x10MHz of 700MHz and 20 MHz (TDD) of 3.4-3.6 GHz for CZK 1.568bn. Refarming of 3.4-3.6GHz spectrum should take place in Q1 FY2021-22 to provide contiguous spectrum to each spectrum holder in this band.\n\n**Hungary**\n\nIn January 2021, the national regulatory authority (NMHH) published its market analysis decision for wholesale voice call termination on individual mobile networks. Each mobile network operator and mobile virtual network operator in Hungary is found to have significant market power. Magyar Telekom requested a review of the decision in court which is ongoing.\n\nIn March 2020, Vodafone Hungary acquired 2x10 MHz of 700MHz spectrum and 2x5 MHz of 2.1GHz spectrum and 1x50MHz of 3.6GHz spectrum for \u20ac108.02 million. In January 2021, Vodafone Hungary acquired 2x9 MHz of 900 MHz and 2x20 MHz of 1800 MHz for \u20ac131.8 million. The spectrum has a 15-year duration to 2037, with the option of a further five-year extension.\nRegulation (continued)\n\nThe Economic Competition Office investigation into the network and spectrum sharing and possible collusion in the previous spectrum tender by Magyar Telekom and Telenor is ongoing.\n\n**Albania**\n\nIn April 2020, the national regulatory authority (\u2018AKEP\u2019) issued its final decision on the market analysis of the wholesale mobile market for access and origination, whereby it states that the three criteria test is not met and therefore no operator has significant market power and consequently no regulatory obligations are imposed.\n\nIn June 2020, AKEP issued its final decision on national and international mobile termination rates (MTRs). The National MTRs will remain unchanged at 1.11 ALL/min. In November 2020, AKEP issued a public consultation on its intention to develop its own cost model to ensure that MTRs reflect Albanian market conditions and characteristics accurately, and to set an appropriate glide path for the application of the target rates.\n\nIn July 2020, Vodafone Albania implemented the new regulated roaming tariffs for Western Balkan six. The new tariffs declined as per the glide path set by the national regulatory authority (\u2018AKEP\u2019), following the April 2019 agreement between the governments of Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Albania & Kosovo to abolish roaming charges between their countries.\n\nIn December 2020, Vodafone Albania\u2019s acquisition of Abcom sh.p.k was approved by AKEP and the National Competition Authority.\n\nThe 5G auction for the 3.5 GHz band has been pushed back to the second half of 2021. The 700MHz band is currently allocated to Digital Terrestrial TV and planned to be released in 2022.\n\n**Africa, Middle East and Asia-Pacific region**\n\n**Vodacom: South Africa**\n\nIn March 2021, the national regulatory authority (\u2018ICASA\u2019) published a findings document on its market inquiry into mobile broadband services. ICASA found insufficient competition and designated Vodacom as a significant market power in several relevant markets at wholesale (site access, national roaming) and retail levels, proposing remedies primarily at the wholesale level. ICASA also published the Draft Regulations for comment and public hearings.\n\nIn October 2020, ICASA issued an invitation to Apply (ITA) notice on the licensing process for international mobile telecommunications in respect of the provision of mobile broadband wireless access services for urban and rural areas. Using the complementary bands, IMT700, IMT900, IMT2600 and IMT3500 with applications closing in December 2020. ICASA also issued a composite ITA for an individual electronic communications network service license and radio frequency spectrum license for the wireless open access network with a closing date of March 2021.\n\nIn March 2021, an interdict following applications by Telkom and MTN was granted against the ITA process pending the finalisation of the review proceedings set for July 2021 relating to the ITA.\n\nAs part of the COVID-19 response measures, Vodacom received a temporary assignment of 160MHz spectrum until May 2021.\n\nOn 31 March 2021, ICASA published Final Equity Ownership Regulations, which promotes equity ownership by historically disadvantaged groups (HDGs) and B-BBEE. Key requirements include licensees being required to have a minimum of 30% of its ownership equity held by black people (determined using \u201cthe flow through\u201d principle of the ICT Sector Code) and must have a minimum B-BBEE contributor status of Level 4. Licensees will be required to provide a compliance report to ICASA annually.\n\nIn December 2019, the Competition Commission published the Final Report on the Data Services Market Inquiry. Following this, Vodacom and the Competition Commission concluded a consent agreement in March 2020, implemented during this financial year, on mutually accepted solutions aimed at addressing the concerns raised in the Final Report.\n\n**Vodacom: Democratic Republic of the Congo**\n\nIn August 2018, the Customs Authority issued a draft infringement report assessing that there were unpaid duties for alleged smuggled devices bought by Vodacom DRC amounted to US $44 million, to which Vodacom DRC objected. In May 2019, Vodacom DRC filed an administrative appeal at the Council of State, which is yet to be heard.\n\nThe national regulatory authority (\u2018ARPTC\u2019) assigned temporary spectrum (2x2 MHz of 900 MHz and 2x5 MHz 2.1 GHz) until August 2020. This temporary licence was extended until February 2021 and has been returned on this date. The Central Bank issued temporary measures on free person to person (P2P) mobile money transaction fees until December 2020, which have since lapsed.\n\nIn April 2020, a new decree introduced a Central Equipment Register System (\u2018CEIR\u2019) and handset certification fees. In November 2020, Vodacom DRC was fined US $2.5 million by way of a Ministerial Decree for alleged shortcomings in its cooperation and implementation of charging mechanisms related to the CEIR system. Assessment of the Ministerial Decree indicated that its issuance was not in accordance with applicable laws and procedures and Vodacom appealed the fine and sought interim suspension of the decree. A decision on the petition for interim suspension and its respective implementation measure was to be issued by December 2020; however, this has been delayed to date due to COVID-19.\n\nIn January 2021, Vodacom DRC received notice by the Minister of Communications, stating that a December 2020 investigation found non-compliant SIM cards without providing further details. Vodacom DRC sent a letter requesting further information on the details of the investigation. While awaiting a response to its letter in February 2021, Vodacom DRC was fined US $3.65 million by way of a Ministerial Decree for alleged non-compliance. Vodacom DRC initiated legal action and appealed for a stay of the execution of the fine for the duration of the appeal, which was granted.\n\n**Vodacom: Tanzania**\n\nIn February 2020, the national regulatory authority (\u2018TCRA\u2019) issued new SIM Card Registration Regulations to formalise the \u2018biometric only\u2019 SIM registration requirement and restrict ownership of the number of SIMs by customers. Vodacom Tanzania is participating in TCRA\u2019s process on intended barring of non-compliant SIMs, whereby a final deadline is still to be set.\n\nIn February 2021, TCRA issued a letter stating that Vodacom Tanzania has been found non-compliant with QoS regulations and imposed a fine of US $3.5 million. However, instead of payment of this fine, Vodacom Tanzania entered a binding commitment to invest the equivalent value into its network.\n\nIn February 2021, TCRA issued new Rules on Bundle Tariffs, Promotions and Special Offers and a Directive on a minimum data price floor to be implemented by April 2021. Vodacom and all operators complied with the request.\nVodacom: Mozambique\nThe Communications Regulator assigned temporary spectrum (2x5 MHz of 800 band), which remains in force whilst the \u201cState of Calamity\u201d related to Covid-19 continues.\n\nVodacom: Lesotho\nIn December 2019, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) issued a notice of enforcement against Vodacom Lesotho premised on its view that the company\u2019s statutory external auditors were not independent, as required by the Companies Act. In September 2020, the LCA issued a penalty of M 134 million against Vodacom Lesotho. Despite Vodacom Lesotho reserving its rights for appeal within the statutory timeframe, in October 2020, the LCA issued a notice of revocation of the operating licence of Vodacom Lesotho for failure to pay a penalty of R134 million. Thirty percent of this fine was determined by the LCA to be payable in October 2020 and the balance was suspended for a period of five years, on the condition that Vodacom Lesotho is not found guilty for breach of any of its regulatory obligations in the future. Vodacom Lesotho has launched an application in the Lesotho High Court to have both determinations of the LCA imposing the fine and revoking its operating licence, respectively, reviewed and set aside. The Lesotho High Court has, in the meantime, issued an order interdicting the LCA from, inter alia, enforcing the payment of the said fine and revoking Vodacom Lesotho\u2019s operating licence. The Lesotho High Court heard the matter in December 2020, and Vodacom Lesotho is awaiting judgement.\n\nTurkey\nIn December 2019, the national regulatory authority (ICTA) approved and published its Fixed Broadband Wholesale Market Analysis, stating that Vodafone Turkey will have access to T\u00fcrk Telekom fibre at different network levels based on regulated terms and fees and retail tariffs will be subject to an ex-ante margin squeeze test. In February 2021, ICTA published the rules and procedures for this test.\n\nICTA\u2019s proposed action to broaden the scope of the 3G coverage to include new metropolitan areas was suspended by the Council of State motion, as Vodafone Turkey appealed to the administrative court. In April 2019, the Council of State accepted the case and annulled the ICTA decision. As of March 2021, Plenary Session of Administrative Law Divisions rejected ICTA\u2019s requests and finalised the judgment in favour of Vodafone Turkey.\n\nIn August 2019, Vodafone Turkey received the payment order for the administrative penalty of TL 138 million due to the breach of pre-information obligations as per the District Sales Regulation & Consumer Law on Value Added Services. In September 2019, the Administrative Court annulled the penalty, with the procedure of appeal pending. At the appellate phase, the State Council reversed the judgment against the competition. Engagement with the Ministry is ongoing, and a legislative proposal has been drafted for the Ministry\u2019s previous and upcoming penalties to ensure a healthy investment environment.\n\nEgypt\nIn September 2020, Vodafone Egypt submitted its proposal to acquire 40 MHz in response to the national regulatory authority (NTRA) issuance of a bid for spectrum acquisition in the 2600 MHz band. In December 2020, Vodafone Egypt\u2019s technical and financial proposal was accepted, and a new License Annex was signed between NTRA and Vodafone after payment of US $270 million and the remaining 50% to be paid over two years in two equal instalments.\n\nIn January 2020, Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) concluded a MoU with Saudi Telecom Company (STC) for the sale of Vodafone\u2019s 55% shareholding in Vodafone Egypt to STC. In December 2020, Vodafone ended talks with STC.\n\nGhana\nIn January 2018, Vodafone Ghana paid 30% of the judgment debt into court (\u20ac48 million) in line with a Conditional Stay of Execution in relation to a High Court decision, affirmed by a panel of the Court of Appeal, on a parcel of land located at Afari in the Central Region of Ghana. In May 2019, the Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court\u2019s decision. An appeal is pending before the Supreme Court and another application which seeks to stop the plaintiff from enforcing the judgment was expected in April 2020. In July 2020, the Supreme Court granted Vodafone Ghana\u2019s application to produce this new evidence as part of the documents to be relied on. The Plaintiff in December 2020 also filed for leave to produce new evidence at the trial. The Supreme Court heard this application in January 2021 and a date will be given by the Court for a mini trial of the matter to be conducted at the Supreme Court after which the Court will deliver its judgment.\n\nIn June 2020, the national regulatory authority (NRA) declared MTN Ghana as a significant market power in Ghana. With immediate effect, several corrective market interventions were announced as follows: Asymmetric MTR Pricing, National Roaming, Price Floor/Ceiling as well as Technology Neutrality in the 1800MHz frequency band. While asymmetric pricing was implemented in October 2020 for a two-year period, national roaming and the other market interventions are still under discussion with a view to implementation in the first half of 2021.\n\nIn January 2020, Vodafone Ghana successfully renewed its 900MHz and 1800MHz licenses for 10 years, until 2029, pending payment of US $25 million. Vodafone Ghana entered negotiations with the Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Finance to amend the terms of renewal in relation to increasing duration of license, payment terms, re-farming rights, and additional 800MHz spectrum, which continue.\n\nThe NRA assigned 2x5MHz of 800MHz frequency band on a temporary basis until June 2021 as part of Covid-19 measures.\n\nThe NRA has requested customer information from licensees as part of the Government\u2019s tracking and tracing programme, which following an application was found by the High Court in June 2020 to be compliant with the emergency order. Information is still being provided to the government for this purpose.\n### Overview of spectrum licences at 31 March 2021\n\n| Country     | 700MHz | 800MHz | 900MHz | 1400/1500MHz | 1800MHz |
