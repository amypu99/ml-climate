Sustainability Report\nIndependent Assurance Report on the Non-Financial Information Statement. Sustainability Report of Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries for 2021\n\n(Translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)\n\nTo the Shareholders of Iberdrola, S.A.:\n\nPursuant to article 49 of the Spanish Code of Commerce, we have performed a limited assurance review of the accompanying Non-Financial Information Statement / Sustainability Report (hereinafter NFIS/SR) of Iberdrola, S.A. (hereinafter the Parent or Iberdrola) and subsidiaries (hereinafter the Group) for the year ended 31 December 2021, which forms part of the consolidated Directors\u2019 Report of the Group.\n\nThe NFIS/SR includes information which has not been the subject of our assurance work. In this respect, our work was limited exclusively to providing assurance on the information contained in the \u201cDisclosures from the Statement of Non-Financial Information\u201d, \u201cGRI Contents Index\u201d and \u201cSASB Contents Index\u201d tables for the \u201cElectric Utilities & Power Generators\u201d sector, which are included in the accompanying NFIS/SR.\n\nIn addition, we have performed a Moderate Assurance review of the application of the principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact on the information included in the \u201cStakeholder Engagement\u201d section of the accompanying NFIS/SR, prepared in accordance with the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018).\n\nDirectors\u2019 Responsibility\n\nThe Directors of the Parent are responsible for the content and authorisation for issue of the NFIS/SR included in the Group\u2019s consolidated Directors\u2019 Report. The NFIS/SR has been prepared in accordance with prevailing mercantile legislation and selected GRI Standards: core option, the Electric Utilities Sector Supplement of version G4 of the GRI Guide, and the SASB standards for \u201cElectric Utilities & Power Generators\u201d, based on each subject area in the \u201cDisclosures from the Statement of Non-Financial Information\u201d, \u201cGRI Contents Index\u201d and \u201cSASB Contents Index\u201d tables in the aforementioned NFIS/SR.\n\nThis responsibility also encompasses the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control deemed necessary to ensure that the Report is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Directors of the Parent are also responsible for defining, implementing, adapting and maintaining the management systems from which the information required to prepare the NFIS/SR was obtained.\nFurthermore, the Directors of the Parent are also responsible for implementing the processes and procedures required for compliance with the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018).\n\n**Our Independence and Quality Control**\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including international independence standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\nOur firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC1) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe engagement team was comprised of professionals specialised in reviews of non-financial information and, specifically, in information on economic, social and environmental performance. It also included specialists in the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018) on stakeholder engagement and on social, environmental and financial performance.\n\n**Our Responsibility**\n\nOur responsibility is to express our conclusions in an independent limited assurance report based on the work performed. We conducted our review engagement in accordance with the requirements of the Revised International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000, \u201cAssurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u201d (ISAE 3000 (Revised), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC)), and with the guidelines for assurance engagements on the Non-Financial Information Statement issued by the Spanish Institute of Registered Auditors (ICJCE). Furthermore, we conducted our engagement in accordance with AccountAbility\u2019s Type 2 Sustainability Assurance Standard AA1000AS v3 (2020).\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and, consequently, the level of assurance provided is also lower.\n\nOur work consisted of making inquiries of management, as well as of the different units and areas of the Group that participated in the preparation of the NFIS/SR, reviewing the processes for compiling and validating the information presented in the Report and applying certain analytical procedures and sample review tests, which are described below:\n\n- Meetings with the Group\u2019s personnel to gain an understanding of the business model, policies and management approaches applied, the principal risks related to these matters and to obtain the information necessary for the external review.\n\u2013 Analysis of the scope, relevance and completeness of the content of the Report based on the materiality analysis performed by the Group and described in the \u201cAbout this report\u201d section, considering the content required by prevailing mercantile legislation.\n\n\u2013 Analysis of the processes for compiling and validating the data presented in the NFIS/SR for 2021.\n\n\u2013 Review of the information relative to the risks, policies and management approaches applied in relation to the material aspects presented in the NFIS/SR for 2021.\n\n\u2013 Review through meetings with Group personnel responsible for implementing the Stakeholder Relations Model and reviewing the internal documentation on the deployment of the model, and the nature and scope of the processes defined in order to comply with the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018), and evaluating the reliability of the information on performance indicated in the aforementioned scope.\n\n\u2013 Corroboration, through sample testing, of the information relative to the content of the Report for 2021 and whether it has been adequately compiled based on data provided by the information sources.\n\n\u2013 Review of information on the Taxonomy of activities in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment.\n\n\u2013 Procurement of a representation letter from the Directors and management.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that:\n\na) The NFIS/SR of Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2021 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with prevailing mercantile legislation and selected GRI Standards: core option, and the Electric Utilities Sector Supplement of version G4 of the GRI Guide, and the SASB standards for \u201cElectric Utilities & Power Generators\u201d, based on each subject area in the \u201cDisclosures from the Statement of Non-Financial Information\u201d, \u201cGRI Contents Index\u201d and \u201cSASB Contents Index\u201d tables in the aforementioned NFIS/SR.\n\nb) The information included in the \u201cStakeholder Engagement\u201d section of the NFIS/SR regarding the principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018).\nEmphasis of Matter\n\nRegulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment stipulates the obligation to disclose information on how and to what extent the undertaking\u2019s activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable in relation to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. This obligation applies for the first time for the 2021 fiscal year, provided that the Non-Financial Information Statement is published from 1 January 2022 onwards. Consequently, the attached NFIS/SR does not contain comparative information on this matter. Additionally, certain information has been included in respect of which the Directors of Iberdrola have opted to apply the criteria that, in their opinion, best allow them to comply with the new obligation, and which are those defined in the \u201cTaxonomy\u201d section of the accompanying NFIS/SR. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\nRecommendations\n\nNotwithstanding the above conclusions, our main observations on the application of the principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact defined in the AA1000AP AccountAbility Principles (2018) are set out below:\n\nOn the principle of Inclusivity\n\nIn 2016 Iberdrola approved its Stakeholder Relations Model, based on standard AA1000, to develop its stakeholder relations policies (revised in December 2021), provide a system for relations with Iberdrola Group\u2019s stakeholders and create a corporate culture. In 2021, relations with local stakeholders continued to be promoted, segmenting and prioritising local stakeholders in the five countries where the Group is present.\n\nIn line with these advances, we recommend that decentralisation efforts continue, uploading this new segmentation into the available stakeholder management tool, which implies greater decentralisation of the model among the main geographic regions. Similarly, we recommend that the Stakeholder Relations Model be updated to reflect the improvements made and the benchmarks applicable in this regard.\n\nOn the principle of Materiality\n\nThe Stakeholder Relations Model enables the identification of material topics, as well as the global risks and opportunities in the eight stakeholder categories and three businesses in the five countries where the Group is present, and also provides a reputational perspective. In 2021 work began to identify the matters entailing the greatest reputational risk, drawing up matrices of reputational risk matters by country.\n\nWith regard to this principle, we recommend that Iberdrola continue to work on assessing the results obtained, thereby integrating the most significant material topics identified into the Parent\u2019s internal management and decision-making processes.\n\nOn the principle of Responsiveness\n\nOnce the main material topics have been identified, the Stakeholder Relations Model enables responses to stakeholder expectations to be designed and subsequently monitored.\nWith regard to this principle, we recommend that Iberdrola continue to work on designing action plans that take into account the most significant material topics identified globally and locally, these being defined as those with a high priority that entail reputational risk, critical risk, and opportunities of a very high interest as established by Iberdrola.\n\n**On the principle of Impact**\n\nThe Non-Financial Information Statement / Sustainability Report includes Iberdrola\u2019s main impacts on the various stakeholders, in line with the concept of \u2018social dividend\u2019 enshrined in Iberdrola\u2019s governance and sustainability system and which is understood to be \u201cthe creation of value, whether direct, indirect or induced, through its activities, for all stakeholders\u201d. Furthermore, the Stakeholder Relations Model reflects the impact of action plans associated with material topics.\n\nWith regard to this principle, we recommend that information on the impact of actions undertaken continue to be gathered and recorded at local level so as to be able to follow up both locally and globally.\n\n**Use and Distribution**\n\nThis report has been prepared in response to the requirement established in prevailing mercantile legislation in Spain, and thus may not be suitable for other purposes and jurisdictions.\n\nKPMG Asesores, S.L.\n\n*(Signed on original in Spanish)*\n\nPatricia Reverter Guillot\n\n25 February 2022\nStatement of Non-Financial Information.

Above all, it has further increased the positive impact of our activities on the societies that we serve. 2021 saw the renewed success of a pioneering strategy combining the environmental, social and governance standards with which we contribute to the well-being of citizens and the construction of a better future for all.\u201d\nIn an environment still affected by the pandemic and its economic and social consequences, the Iberdrola group continued to lead the transition to a cleaner and more efficient energy system in 2021, contributing to a sustainable and inclusive recovery in all of the countries in which it does business.\n\nAs was made clear at the Glasgow Climate Summit, at which Iberdrola played a prominent role, there is practically unanimous consensus on the urgency of promoting rapid and effective decarbonisation. This gives new impetus to the development of clean energy electrification, energy storage and smart grids, which Iberdrola has been pursuing for more than two decades.\n\nIn the last 12 months alone, we have added 3,500 new MW of new renewable capacity through cutting-edge facilities like the photovoltaic plants Ceclav\u00edn in Extremadura and Barcience in Castile-La Mancha; the wind farms Halsary in the United Kingdom, Roaring Brook in the United States, Santiago in Mexico, and Chafariz in Brazil; as well as the Port Augusta hybrid wind and photovoltaic project in Australia.\n\nIn addition, 2021 saw the definitive roll-out of offshore wind energy, which became a major growth platform for the group globally. We have 2,600 MW under construction through projects such as Vineyard Wind 1, Park City Wind and Commonwealth Wind in the United States; East Anglia Hub in the United Kingdom; Saint Brieuc in France; Baltic Eagle in Germany; and we have a portfolio of 33,400 MW both in our traditional markets and in new markets, including Taiwan and Japan.\n\nWe also continue to spearhead the development of energy storage following the completion of the Gouv\u00e3es and Daiv\u00f5es plants, belonging to the T\u00e2mega large complex, in Portugal, with a storage capacity of 20 million KWh, as well as the installation of a super battery at the Whitelee windfarm in the United Kingdom.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s transformation to climate neutrality, fully consistent with the achievement of a more efficient, competitive, clean and sustainable economic system, also marked noteworthy milestones such as the demolition of the smokestacks at our coal-fired thermal power plants in Velilla, Spain, and Longannet, United Kingdom. This has cemented our position as the largest non-coal-production electricity company in the world, and places our CO\u2082 emissions at 60 grams per kWh in Europe, almost one-fourth lower than our peers.\nIn addition, we are making progress on numerous projects to decarbonise difficult-to-electrify energy consumption, through green hydrogen-based solutions. Hence, together with dozens of industrial partners, we have launched 60 new projects in eight countries, from Spain (where we are finalising the start-up of the largest green hydrogen plant in Europe, located in Puertollano) to the United Kingdom and Brazil. Iberdrola is thus at the cutting edge of an energy vector for which Europe and the United States have already set ambitious targets.\n\nAnd we have continued to strengthen and digitalise our distribution and transmission networks, key infrastructures for integrating a growing flow of clean energies, promoting greater electrification and continuing to provide the best service for our customers.\n\nIn 2021 we undertook initiatives including the transmission lines in Jalapao and Rio Formoso, Brazil; a reliability project in Rochester, United States; and the launch of the Global Smart Grids Innovation Hub, a global innovation centre for smart grids located at our facilities in Larraskitu, Bilbao, with more than 60 participants and 120 projects underway to design the electric grids of the future.\n\nStrengthening of the grids is allowing us to respond in real time to extraordinary situations like the bad weather experienced in certain countries, including storm Filomena in Spain and storm Arwen in the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to offer, day in and day out, new smart and innovative solutions to meet the needs of increasingly connected customers through digital and competitive products.\n\nThe group\u2019s intense activity is reflected in the results of the company. Net profit increased by 8% to \u20ac3,885 million thanks to the investments made during the year, which totalled \u20ac9,940 million, allowing us to further promote international growth. All of this allows us to propose to the shareholders at the General Meeting a near of 5% increase in shareholder remuneration to \u20ac0.44 per share payable in 2022.\n\nThis year, once again, analysts and investors continue to demonstrate their confidence in the company's progress and outlook. Of more than 30 analysts who follow us, two-thirds recommend buying and none recommend selling, maintaining an average target price of \u20ac12 per share.\nIberdrola, bigger in social responsibility\n\nAll of the growth and global presence that we have consolidated over the years allows us to increasingly generate more wealth, more employment and more well-being, in line with the concept of the social dividend, which we were pioneers in adopting in 2016 and which is a binding commitment for us just like the financial dividend.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s model, far from viewing one dividend as competing with the other, is based on the conviction that, to thrive and be profitable over the long term, companies must be sensitive to and meet the needs of their environment.\n\nThis was also stated by the chairman and CEO of BlackRock in his most recent annual letter sent to the senior executives of the companies in which this fund has a stake, including Iberdrola. Larry Fink underscored the need for companies to create value for all of their stakeholders through a clear business purpose and a consistent strategy compatible with the decarbonisation of the economy.\n\nIt is precisely this essential pillar of work that the thousands of women and men who work at Iberdrola have been building for decades, and which in 2021 translated into, for example, \u20ac12,200 million in purchases with which we are promoting industrialisation and providing stability for thousands of companies of all sizes, helping them preserve hundreds of thousands of jobs and creating other new jobs with a high added value.\n\nOur activities have also had a very positive impact on government coffers in all the countries in which we are present, to which we have contributed more than \u20ac7,800 million. And we do so responsibly, based on a culture of compliance embedded in all of our activities, and which has given leading positions on the tax transparency ratings.\n\nWe have also continued to promote the creation of high-quality jobs of the future within our company, hiring more than 5,500 employees who are now part of a committed, diverse and skilled human group of about 40,000 people.\n\nOur desire to foster the professional development, specialisation and talent of our staff has led us to provide more than 59 hours of training per employee this year, far above the European average, despite the difficulties brought about by the pandemic. Many of these training hours took place at our Innovation and Training Campus, which was inaugurated by their Majesties the King and Queen of Spain in April.\nIn terms of R&D&i, the close to \u20ac340 million allocated in 2021 to innovative projects have allowed us to remain at the cutting edge of transformation in the sector, making us the private utility that invests the most in R&D&i in the world, according to the report *The 2021 Industrial Investment Scoreboard* prepared by the European Commission.\n\nHowever, we are also fully aware that the twenty-first century will be dominated by companies able to create a diverse and fully inclusive environment. This leads us to promote, among other things, actual and effective gender equality within and outside of our company. Thanks to the measures we have implemented, such as promoting women\u2019s participation in STEM careers and at the *Escolas de Eletricistas* in Brazil, we are continuously increasing the presence and responsibility of women within our company. This year, this effort once again led us to be included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality index, the only Spanish utility listed in all years of this index, and to be recognised by Forbes as one of the 10 best companies in the world in terms of the labour integration of women in its ranking of the World\u2019s Top Female Friendly Companies.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s social commitment is fully shared by our employees, who year after year devote their time to helping the neediest through our International Corporate Volunteering Programme. In 2021, the programme set a new record, with more than 12,200 participants around the world.\n\nIn sum, we continue to demonstrate that the energy transition is fully compatible with profitability and the creation of value for all stakeholders, showing the way to green, inclusive and resilient growth.

Iberdrola, the utility of the future\nI.1. About Iberdrola\n\n- Purpose and values\n- A successful and well-established business model\n- Presence and areas of activity\n- Main products and services\n- Key operating figures\n- Corporate and governance structure, ownership and legal form\nIberdrola\u2019s corporate purpose, which is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations, reflects the main social trends and addresses major economic, social and environmental challenges, reflecting the expectations of stakeholders and defining Iberdrola\u2019s role as an agent of social change and transformation in the energy sector. It is expressed as follows:\n\n\u201cTo continue building together each day a healthier, more accessible energy model, based on electricity\u201d\n\nThis purpose expresses:\n\n- The Iberdrola group\u2019s commitment to the well-being of people and the preservation of the planet.\n- The Iberdrola group\u2019s commitment to a real and comprehensive energy transition, based on the decarbonisation and electrification of the energy sector and of the economy as a whole, which contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2014 particularly the fight against climate change \u2014 and generates new opportunities for economic and social development.\n- The conviction that a more electricity-based energy model \u2013 which abandons the use of fossil fuels and mainstreams the use of renewable energy sources, efficient energy storage, smart grids and the digital transformation \u2013 is also healthier for the population, whose well-being depends on the environmental quality of their surroundings.\n- The aspiration for the new energy model to also be more accessible to all, and to favour inclusiveness, equality, equity and social development.\n- The desire to promote this new model in partnership with all players involved and with society as a whole.\n\nTo attain this Purpose, the Iberdrola group has condensed its corporate values into the following three concepts:\n\n- **Sustainable energy**: the group seeks to always be a model of inspiration, creating economic, social and environmental value in all of its surroundings, and with the future in mind.\n- **Integrating force**: the group works with strength and responsibility, combining talents, for a Purpose that is to be achieved by all and for all.\n- **Driving force**: the Iberdrola group brings about small and large changes in order to make people\u2019s lives easier, always seeking to improve, and to do so efficiently and with high self-imposed standards.\nA successful and well-established business model\n\nIberdrola firmly believes that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 is technologically possible, economically feasible and socially necessary. The decarbonisation of the economy is a tremendous opportunity to create wealth, generate employment and improve both the condition of the planet and people\u2019s health. The group is therefore committed to leading the energy transition, a path it embarked on 20 years ago and that has led it to invest \u20ac120,000 million since then.\n\nThis commitment will be fulfilled by promoting:\n\n- **Power decarbonisation**\n- **Networks system integration**\n- **Demand electrification**\n\nTwo decades of growth based on strong strategic foundations that drive future growth\n\n- **Geographical diversification**\n  - Countries with high rating and ambitious climate policies.\n- **Energy transition**\n  - Enabling decarbonisation and electrification.\n- **Efficiency**\n  - Continuous drive for excellence.\n- **Portfolio optimisation**\n  - Contributing to the environmental and financial sustainability of our business model.\n- **Innovation**\n  - Laying foundations for the future.\n\nA business model that enables us to accelerate the creation of value for all\n\n1.

The corporate and governance structure of the Iberdrola group is reflected in the following chart:\n\nThis corporate and governance structure is defined as described below, with a differentiation between the duties of supervision and control, on the one hand, and those of day-to-day administration and effective management, on the other:\n\na. Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A.: approval and oversight of the group\u2019s strategic goals, definition of its organisational model, formulation of corporate policies, as well as supervision of compliance therewith and further development thereof.\n\nb. Chairman & CEO, with the technical support of the Operating Committee, the Business CEO and the rest of the management team: duty of organisation and strategic coordination of the group.\n\nc. Country subholding companies: strengthening of the duty of organisation and strategic coordination through the dissemination, implementation and supervision of general strategy and basic management guidelines at the country level. These entities group together equity stakes in the energy head of business companies, which carry out their activities within the various countries in which the group does business.\n\nOne of the main functions of the country subholding companies is to centralise the provision of services common to the head of business companies, always in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and especially the legal provisions regarding the separation of regulated activities. Country subholding companies have boards of directors that include independent directors and their own audit committees, internal audit areas and compliance units or divisions.\n\nThe group\u2019s listed country subholding companies (currently AVANGRID, Inc. and Neoenergia, S.A.) have a special framework of strengthened autonomy.\nd. Head of business companies assume decentralised executive responsibilities, enjoy the independence necessary to carry out the day-to-day administration and effective management of each of each business and are responsible for the day-to-day control thereof. They are organised through their respective boards of directors, which include independent directors where appropriate, and management decision-making bodies; they may also have their own audit committees, internal audit areas and compliance units or divisions.\n\nGovernance structure\n\nComposition of the Board of Directors\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, Iberdrola\u2019s Board of Directors is made up of 14 members:\n\n| Position | Director | Status | Nationality | Date of first appointment | Date of last appointment | Membership on Board Committees |\n|----------|----------|--------|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Chairman & CEO | Jos\u00e9 Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Gal\u00e1n | Executive | Spain | 21-05-2001 | 29-03-2019 | Chair of the Executive Committee |\n| First Vice-Chair and lead independent director | Juan Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Serna | Independent | Spain | 31-03-2017 | 18-06-2021 | Member of the Executive Committee Chair of the Remuneration Committee |\n| Second Vice-Chair | Anthony L.

Governance and Sustainability System\n\n- Introduction to the Governance and Sustainability System\n- By-Laws\n- Code of Ethics\n- Policies and commitments\n- Long-term risks and opportunities. Comprehensive Risk System\nIntroduction to the Governance and Sustainability System\n\nThe company has a Governance and Sustainability System, which evolved from the former Corporate Governance System, and which is structured around three pillars: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nA commitment to sustainability, good governance and transparency is one of the hallmarks of Iberdrola\u2019s identity. The Board of Directors therefore regularly reviews the Governance and Sustainability System, keeping it updated and including therein the recommendations and best practices generally accepted in international markets.\nBy-Laws\n\nThe By-Laws are the core of the company\u2019s internal regulations and make up the backbone of the Governance and Sustainability System. Based on the Purpose and Values, they constitute the guidelines defining the identity and uniqueness of the company and its business enterprise.\n\nCode of Ethics\n\nThe group\u2019s Code of Ethics sets forth the overall principles and guidelines of conduct intended to ensure ethical and responsible behaviour by all of its directors, professionals and suppliers. The code has been prepared taking into account the good governance recommendations generally accepted in international markets and the sustainable development principles accepted by Iberdrola, S.A., which constitute a basic tool for monitoring the group\u2019s activities. It also meets the company\u2019s prevention obligations with regard to the criminal liability of legal entities.\n\nThe code therefore applies to all the group\u2019s directors, professionals and suppliers, as well as to investees that are not part of the group but over which the company has effective control, within the legally established limits, regardless of their rank, geographic location or functional reporting, and of the group company where they perform their services.\n\nExcluded from the scope of application are listed country subholding companies and their subsidiaries, under their own special framework of strengthened autonomy, as they have their own code of ethics or conduct, inspired by a purpose and values that are ultimately in line with the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and governed by the principles set forth in the Code of Ethics.\n\nThe Code of Ethics forms part of the Governance and Sustainability System, which was approved by the Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A. in 2002 and last amended on 16 December 2021.\n\nFor more detailed information on the group\u2019s Compliance System, see the \u201cEthics and integrity\u201d section of chapter IV.2.\n\nPolicies and commitments\n\nThe Iberdrola group has a set of corporate policies that develop the principles reflected in the Governance and Sustainability System and that contain the guidelines governing the actions of the company and the companies of its group, as well as those of the directors, officers and employees thereof, within the framework of the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group.\n\nThese policies, the full versions of which can be found in the Corporate Governance tab of the website, are grouped into four categories:\n\n- Purpose (see the Purpose and Values section), Code of Ethics (see the Code of Ethics section), General Sustainable Development Policy and Stakeholder Engagement Policy (see the Stakeholder Engagement section).\n- Environment and Climate Change\n- Social Commitment\n- Corporate Governance\nThese policies and commitments serve to guide the company and its workforce for the management of their activities, and, more specifically, as a guide on the material topics dealt with in this document.\n\n**General Sustainable Development Policy**\n\nIberdrola has a *General Sustainable Development Policy*, approved by the Board of Directors in 2007 and last revised on 16 December 2021. It sets out the general principles and foundations that govern the group\u2019s sustainable development strategy. The goal is to ensure that all its corporate activities and businesses are carried out by fostering the sustainable creation of value for society, citizens, customers, shareholders and the communities in which the group is present, equitably contributing along with all the groups that play a role in the success of its business enterprise.\n\nThe policy contains 5 overarching principles of conduct in relation to:\n- the creation of shared sustainable value\n- transparency\n- the development and protection of intellectual capital\n- innovation\n- responsible taxation\n\nAnd 8 principles of conduct in relation to the principal Stakeholders:\n- workforce\n- shareholders and the financial community\n- regulatory entities\n- customers\n- suppliers\n- media\n- with society in general\n- environment\n\nThe principles of conduct included in these sustainable development policies are described throughout this report.\n\n**Environment and Climate Change Policies**\n\n*Environmental policies* are the response to environmental challenges such as climate change and the loss of biodiversity, while helping to identify and take advantage of the opportunities arising from the energy and ecological transition.\n\n- *Sustainable Management Policy*\n- *Environmental Policy*\n- *Climate Action Policy*\n- *Biodiversity Policy*\n\nSpecifically, the group\u2019s commitment to sustainability is built around the following main principles of conduct, as set out in its *Sustainable Management Policy*:\n\u2022 Development of a business model based on environmentally sustainable economic activities;\n\u2022 competitiveness of the energy products supplied, through efficiency in the processes of generation, storage, transmission, distribution and sale of energy;\n\u2022 high quality of service and reliability and security in the supply of energy products;\n\u2022 reduction in the environmental impact of all activities performed by group companies;\n\u2022 creation of shared sustainable value with the company\u2019s shareholders and its other Stakeholders;\n\u2022 promotion of the group\u2019s social commitment and, in particular, respect for human rights as set out in the Policy on Respect for Human Rights; and\n\u2022 encouragement of the responsible energy use.\n\nSocial Commitment Policies\n\nThe policies relating to social commitment reflect, within the framework of the Company\u2019s sustainable development strategy, the group\u2019s connection with human rights, and the development of professional relationships based on diversity, inclusion and a sense of belonging, as it is essential in managing people to promote equal opportunities and ensure non-discrimination.\n\n\u2022 Policy on Respect for Human Rights\n\u2022 Human Resources Framework Policy\n\u2022 Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy\n\u2022 Selection and Hiring Policy\n\u2022 Knowledge Management Policy\n\u2022 Innovation Policy\n\u2022 Quality Policy\n\u2022 Corporate Security Policy\n\nCorporate Governance Policies\n\nThe corporate governance policies and rules are intended to ensure the proper functioning of the main corporate bodies, the administration and management of the company, and the development of the business generally, all in accordance with applicable law.\n\nIn particular, these policies and rules are structured into four parts:\n\n\u2022 Corporate governance and regulatory compliance policies.\n\u2022 Risk policies.\n\u2022 Governance rules of the corporate decision-making bodies and of other functions and internal committees.\n\u2022 Market abuse prevention rules.\nLong-term risks and opportunities. Comprehensive Risk System\n\nIberdrola\u2019s Board of Directors and senior management is firmly committed to and engaged in the management of the group\u2019s risks:\n\n- **Ex-ante**: acceptable levels of tolerance to risk are reviewed and approved on an annual basis through risk policies that establish (through limits and indicators) the qualitative and quantitative risk appetite at the group level and at each of the main businesses and corporate functions, in accordance with the objectives established in the multi-year plan and the respective annual budgets.\n\n- **Ex-post**: periodic monitoring of significant risks (key risk maps) and threats and the various exposures of the group, as well as of compliance with the approved limits and indicators.\n\nRisk management within the group is based on foresight, independence, commitment to the group\u2019s business objectives and the engagement of senior management and the Board.\n\n### Functions of the Risk Committee\n\n**Active management**\n\n**Credit risk**\n- Analysis and approval of counterparties and limits, establishment of approval criteria, and monitoring of exposures in order to minimise credit losses.\n\n**Market risk**\n- Analysis and approval of detailed limits and monitoring of exposures in order to constrain the effects of volatility in the markets in which the group operates.\n\n**Coordination of second lines / Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)**\n\nTo ensure, under the internationally recognised three lines model, that there are mechanisms for all significant risks of the group to be controlled at all times and that they are regularly reported to the various committees and externally.\n\nBy way of supplement, the group has a Compliance System, linked to the Board\u2019s Sustainable Development Committee, with elements that include the Code of Ethics and the Compliance Unit.\n\nOverall supervision of operational risk through the group\u2019s corporate Insurance, Security and Cybersecurity, Information Technology and Occupational Safety and Health units and the businesses.\nComprehensive Risk Control and Management System\n\nThe group\u2019s General Risk Control and Management Policy approved by the Board of Directors establishes the mechanisms and basic principles for appropriate management of the risk/opportunity ratio, at a risk level that makes it possible to:\n\n- Attain strategic goals with controlled volatility.\n- Ensure the group\u2019s corporate stability, financial strength and reputation (Stakeholders).\n- Contribute to achieving the SDGs, with a special focus on goals seven and thirteen.\n- Disseminate a risk culture.\n\nThe General Risk Control and Management Policy and related policies are implemented, in accordance with the three lines model, within a comprehensive risk control and management system supported by a Risk Committee, which is based on properly defining and assigning functions and responsibilities at the operational and supervisory level that develop suitable procedures, methodologies and support tools.\n\nRisk policies and limits of the Iberdrola group\n\nThe General Risk Control and Management Policy is further developed and supplemented with the following specific policies established in relation to certain risks, corporate functions or businesses of the group, which are also annually approved by the Board of Directors of the group\u2019s parent company, and which include limits and indicators that are subsequently monitored.\n\nThe country subholding companies adopt and apply the group\u2019s risk policies, approving the guidelines on specific risk limits based on the nature and particularities of the businesses in each country. The listed country subholding companies, and companies with significant interests held by other shareholders, approve their own policies under their own special framework of strengthened autonomy.\n\nPrincipal risk factors of the Iberdrola group\n\nThe risk factors to which the group is subject are generally grouped into the following categories:\n\n| Category                  | Definition                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate Governance      | Non-compliance with applicable law, the Governance and Sustainability System, the recommendations set forth in the CNMV\u2019s Code of Good Governance, and international standards. |\n| Market                    | Exposure to volatility in variables like electricity and other energy commodity prices, emission rights, exchange rate, interest rate, solvency, liquidity, inflation, raw materials, etc. |\n| Credit                    | Contractual breach by a counterparty, causing economic or financial losses, including payment and replacement cost risks.                      |\n| Business                  | Uncertainty as to the behaviour of variables intrinsic to the business (characteristics of demand, hydraulic resources, wind, solar, etc.)       |\n| Regulatory and political  | Regulatory changes made by the regulators that can affect remuneration of the regulated businesses, environmental or tax provisions, etc.       |\n| Other*                    | External events or inadequate internal procedures, including those stemming from i) technical failures, human error and technological obsolescence, ii) operation and construction of facilities, iii) supply and the supply chain, iv) cybersecurity and systems, v) safety and health, vi) pandemics, extreme natural phenomena and climate change, vii) regulatory compliance, viii) reliability of financial and non-financial information, ix) fraud and corruption, and x) litigation, arbitration and tax matters. |\n| Reputational              | Potential negative impacts on the company\u2019s reputation arising from situations or events that fail to meet the expectations of its Stakeholders. |\n\n* Operational, technological, environmental, social and legal.\nGiven the multidimensional nature of the risks, the taxonomy defined in the system contemplates additional classification variables for better monitoring, control and reporting of such risks. These additional categories include the classification of risks into Structural Risks, Hot Topics and Emerging Risks, the latter being understood as potential new threats, the impact of which is as yet uncertain and the probability of which is undefined, but which are growing and could become significant for the Group.\n\nThe system contemplates the continuous monitoring and detection of emerging risks and other non-financial risks, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks with significant reputational consequences.\n\n**Evaluation of risk management processes**\n\nGRI 102-30\n\nGenerally, the group\u2019s Comprehensive Risk Control and Management system allows for proper ex ante identification of risks or sounds alarms that allow for the making of decisions intended to minimise the impact of the risks.\n\nThe group's Risk Committee meets at least on a monthly basis. This committee is supplemented with the Credit Risk and Market Risk Committees, which also meet on a monthly basis. On at least a quarterly basis, the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of the Board of Directors monitors trends in the group\u2019s risks:\n\n- It reviews the group\u2019s quarterly risk report, which includes monitoring of compliance with the risk policies and limits and the updated key risk maps submitted by the group\u2019s Risk Management and Internal Assurance Division.\n- It coordinates and reviews the Risk Reports sent periodically (at least half-yearly) by the Audit and Compliance Committees of group companies that have such a body.\n- On at least a half-yearly basis, it prepares a risk report for the Board of Directors.\nI.3. Climate Action\n\n- Introduction to climate action\n- Climate governance\n- Objectives and elements of climate action\n- Strategy and management of climate opportunities and risks\n- Indicators and metrics\n- Other aspects associated with the energy transition\nIntroduction to climate action\n\nIberdrola, a global leader in the fight against climate change, firmly believes that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 is technologically possible, economically feasible and socially necessary.\n\nA common denominator of all of Iberdrola\u2019s activities is the sustainable creation of value, in accordance with its social dividend, in addition to the search for leadership. For this reason, in the last two decades, Iberdrola has undertaken a commitment to lead the energy transition, through a sustainable model executed with innovation, flexibility and efficiency in all of its business lines.\n\nClimate governance\n\nIberdrola was a pioneer in the inclusion within its former Corporate Governance System of the fight against climate change as a priority. In 2009 it approved the first policy that addressed the fight against climate change. The current Climate Action Policy establishes the framework for Iberdrola\u2019s strategy and business model, which is in line with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, in the fight against climate change. Through this policy, Iberdrola is committed to continue assuming a leadership position (directly and by establishing partnerships), promoting awareness (impacts, challenges and benefits of its achievement) and contributing to a carbon-neutral and sustainable future.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s principles of conduct include implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and of other leading organisations for identifying and reporting long-term risks relating to climate change. Along these lines, Iberdrola was one of the first companies to publicly commit to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. For this purpose, the company created an internal multidisciplinary working group in 2017 to coordinate all the work performed in this area.\nSo as to be always focused on the best compliance with and implementation of the policies, the Company has several corporate bodies and internal committees that ensure the monitoring of those policies. The By-Laws approved by the shareholders in June 2021 formalised the obligation of the Board of Directors to approve, supervise and regularly report on the Climate Action Plan. This Statement of Non-Financial Information is the instrument through which the Company and its Board of Directors fulfil this obligation.\n\nIn line with the need for professionalisation, diversification and qualification on relevant topics, the Board has a training and refresher programme for its members, the topics of which include decarbonisation and the fight against climate change. The Annual Activities Report of the Board of Directors and the Committees thereof describes and enumerates the issued handled by the Board and its committees, including all contents regarding climate change risk and opportunities.\n\nFor its part, the structure of remuneration of executive directors and the management team takes into account economic/financial, operational and sustainability matters. A long-term remuneration plan (2020-2022 Strategic Bonus) was approved in April 2020. This plan sets out parameters relating to the Sustainable Development Goals, such as reducing the average intensity of CO2 emissions and increasing the number of suppliers subject to sustainable development standards, among others (see additional details in the \"Remuneration policy\" section under \"Corporate Governance\").\n\nFor more detailed information, see section I.2. Governance and Sustainability System, as well as the following link Governance and Sustainability System.\n\nAt the operational and management level, business activities are aligned with these guidelines to deliver on Iberdrola\u2019s commitment. Internal working groups have been created, including the Global Climate Change Working Group, which integrates various perspectives and organisations in this area.\n\n### Objectives and elements of climate action\n\nIberdrola today has stayed on its path of reducing the intensity of direct emissions, which reached 60 gCO2/kWh in Europe and 96 gCO2/kWh globally at year-end 2021.\n\nIberdrola stands out as a global leader in renewable energy, with an installed capacity of 38,138 MW in renewable generation technology. Iberdrola already generates 100% of its energy with zero emissions in countries like the United Kingdom, Germany and Portugal.\n\nIberdrola has continued to move forward in 2021 with its commitment to the Paris Agreement and the energy transition as well as to the goals already established in order to become a carbon-neutral company in Europe (Scope 1) by 2030 \u2013 20 years in advance of the European Union\u2019s goal. In addition, at the global level, it will reduce its emissions intensity to 50 gCO2/kWh by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality before 2050.\n\nIt has also made a commitment to reducing absolute GHG emissions at the global level for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2030; this goal is aligned with the aim of achieving the 1.5\u00ba C limit and is recognised as science-based by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nThe Climate Action Plan is continually evolving, and the Company is working with the goal of accelerating its decarbonisation objectives to the greatest extent possible. The following climate targets are fully linked to Iberdrola\u2019s growth and investment strategy, which will be updated and reported at the upcoming Capital Markets Day.\nClimate goals\n\nClimate change is a key element for defining the company\u2019s strategy, focusing on promoting clean technology, innovation and the establishment of alliances. Iberdrola treats it not only as a risk factor, but also as an opportunity for growth through mitigation and adjustment activities during the transition towards a low-carbon economy.\n\nTo meet its emissions-reduction commitment, Iberdrola will continue to promote and spearhead a business model and an investment plan fully integrated into a decarbonised future.\n\n**IBERDROLA GROUP\u2019S CLIMATE-RELATED OBJECTIVES**\n\n| To reduce the intensity of CO\u2082 emissions up to 50 gCO\u2082/kWh by 2030 |\n| --- |\n| Target for scopes 1, 2 and 3 approved by the Science Based Target initiative in diciembre 2020, aligned with 1.5\u00b0C |\n| Iberdrola will be net zero in Scope 1, 2 and 3 before 2050 |\n\n**Investment Plan**\n\nThis commitment by the Iberdrola group took the form of investments amounting to \u20ac120,000 million from 2001 to 2020, making it a world leader in renewable energy. In addition to these investments directed toward the electrification of the economy, innovation and technological advances as well as greater consumer connectivity, the 2020-2025 period will see the addition of a total of \u20ac75,000 million, the largest investment programme in the history of the group. This programme will give an important push to the renewables area, which will reach 60 GW of installed capacity in 2025, compared with the more than 38 GW currently, and 95 GW by 2030. By the end of the decade, the company also expects to double the regulated value of its network assets -- to \u20ac60,000 million -- and to install 600 MW of operational green hydrogen by 2025.\n\n**Technological and business innovation for climate action**\n\nInnovation is a key factor in Iberdrola\u2019s strategy, given that it is a tool that not only enhances the company\u2019s competitiveness and maximises its use of technology in activities that add value, but that also contributes to the fight against climate change through technologies making it possible to provide more sustainable, competitive and efficient solutions. For further details on Iberdrola\u2019s innovation strategy and products, see section III.2 Quality and safety for our customers through innovation and digitalisation.\n\nSome representative examples of innovation at Iberdrola with an impact on climate change and decarbonisation are: its commitment to green hydrogen as an energy vector of the future, digitalisation and automation, and disruptive technologies.\nExamples of innovation projects and new technologies with an impact on climate change\n\nGreen hydrogen\n\nIberdrola is at the forefront of the development of green hydrogen, with more than 60 projects in eight countries (including Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the United States), in keeping with the electrification and decarbonisation needs of sectors such as industry or heavy transport. Some of its most noteworthy projects covering different areas are:\n\n| Puertollano Plant | H2 Green Steel |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| The largest industrial-use green hydrogen plant in Europe, located in Puertollano, Spain. Consisting of a photovoltaic solar plant, a system of lithium-ion batteries and an electrolysis system, it will supply hydrogen to a Fertiberia ammonia factory. | Iberdrola and H2Green Steel have entered into an agreement to build a 1,000 MW-capacity green hydrogen plant on the Iberian Peninsula in order to decarbonise steel manufacturing. |\n\nDigitalisation and automation\n\nDigitalisation together with decarbonisation and electrification are the three key trends driving the transformation of the energy system and catalysing the transition towards a sustainable energy model. The energy system is adopting such technologies as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), the cloud and blockchain, which may make it possible to meet the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources and developing smart grids. By applying AI, Iberdrola can better foresee and predict when a device is going to fail or the potential damage to infrastructure following an extreme climate event, allowing it to make decisions to enhance the reliability of the grid.\n\nDrones\n\nExamples of the use of these devices in the company\u2019s operations include inspecting components of wind farms and high-voltage lines. In the specific case of grids, they are used for emergencies, making it possible to reduce downtime in electricity supply following extreme events and emergencies.\n\nBig Data\n\nThe group is developing new solutions and improvements through big data included, inter alia, in the Meteoflow system and in predictive maintenance of offshore wind turbines. Meteoflow has evolved and has recently incorporated big data techniques. The latter development makes it possible to include and utilise a large amount of meteorological information and data, which permits the use of large information series.\n\nAlliances, partnerships and awareness-raising\n\nIn keeping with its strategy, Iberdrola supports ambitious approaches in the framework of its climate policies and the establishment of plans and objectives. In addition, through alliances, declarations and campaigns, Iberdrola publicly supports frameworks for defining green-recovery plans, aligning its climate goals with a pathway to robust, sustainable economic growth. This is in addition to the need for all players to be aligned with and committed to the fight against climate change, which makes awareness-raising among society a key.\n\nAlliances and global climate agenda\n\nIberdrola is an active participant, with a high degree of visibility, in the main milestones of the climate agenda, participating in a large number of technical seminars and high-level conferences. Iberdrola wants to actively and decisively contribute to a sustainable, low-carbon future \u2013 an effort that will also promote social and economic development through the creation of employment and wealth. To this end, the Company is committed to conducting its policy-impacting activities within its areas of influence and alliances in which it participates in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\nHence, Iberdrola has played an important role in the inauguration of meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and the various editions of New York Climate Week, climate conferences such as the Race to Zero Dialogues and the Climate Dialogues at various meetings of the global climate agenda at all levels (meetings of the subsidiary bodies of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), meetings of multilateral bodies linked to climate, etc.).\n\nIberdrola also belongs to various international coalitions, backs diverse external initiatives and cooperates with numerous international organisations, business and/or multi-actor coalitions, think tanks and research centres, supporting ambitious global climate action.\n\nIberdrola has been a member of the UN Global Compact since 2002, and it has belonged to the Red Espa\u00f1ola del Pacto Mundial since 2004, as a founding member. Through this membership, Iberdrola has assumed, inter alia, the commitment to implement its Ten Principles and to promote the 2030 Agenda, contributing to the attainment and dissemination of the SDGs. It has been identified as a LEAD company, owing to its high levels of commitment to the principles of the Global Compact, and it has been at the forefront of the climate action platform since its inception in 2016.\n\nWithin the framework of the United Nations High-Level Dialogue on Energy, held in September 2021, Iberdrola submitted an ambitious plan of objectives and actions on the energy transition, universal access and climate change, referred to as the Energy Compact, enhancing its leadership in and visibility on the global climate and sustainability agenda. Together with the general Energy Compact, Iberdrola submitted a specific compact on green energy, highlighting the company\u2019s roadmap in this regard, which will play a very important role in the roadmap to the decarbonisation of the economy.\n\nOne of the most important milestones of Iberdrola\u2019s climate activity is its active participation in the Conferences of the Parties (COP) on Climate Change, organised each year by the UNFCCC. At COP26, held in Glasgow, Scottish Power/Iberdrola was an official partner and played a leading role, organising more than 100 events and participating in the main high-level meetings and encounters.\n\nIberdrola is very actively involved in the We Mean Business initiative through its support for specific campaigns such as implementing initiatives in Spain to promote climate action among small and medium-sized enterprises (SME Climate Hub).\nAs noted above, within the framework of climate resilience, Iberdrola is a member of the Coalition for Climate and Resilient Investment (CCRI). This coalition is led by the private sector and committed to developing and testing practical solutions to integrate physical climate risks in investment decision-making.\n\nIberdrola is also part of Race to Zero, a global alliance promoted by the High Level Climate Champions and the United Nations, bringing together companies, governments and various civil society actors committed to reaching a zero net emissions future no later than by mid-century.\n\nOne of the most prominent initiatives in which Iberdrola takes part is the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, a part of the World Economic Forum platform. This is a global community of CEOs who support and promote action to achieve the transition to a net zero emissions economy. The Chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio S. Gal\u00e1n, along with 70 other business leaders in various industries and regions, has joined this alliance.\n\nAnother noteworthy initiative is the Corporate Leaders Group, a business alliance with broad recognition in Europe and internationally for spearheading the most ambitious stances on climate policies. Iberdrola actively participates in the alliance at all levels.\n\nIberdrola has also been a member, since its inception, of the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), a coalition of governments, regions and companies focused on promoting the shutdown of coal within the framework of a fair transition to a clean energy model.\n\nIndustry campaigns include the very important role played by EV100 of The Climate Group, in which Iberdrola was the first Spanish company to join. This initiative is intended to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, for which reason Iberdrola has made a commitment to electrify its entire vehicle fleet and to facilitate recharging by its employees in Spain and the United Kingdom by 2030.\n\nIn 2021, within the framework of COP26 and the main international climate milestones, Iberdrola has joined important declarations, alliances and campaigns, including the following:\n\n- Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement, promoted by the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) and the COP26 Presidency, to accelerate the transition to generation based on clean non-coal sources.\n- Various statements of support for an increase in the aim of the United States\u2019 NDC, promoted by European Parliament deputy Pascal Canfin and We Mean Business.\n- Support for open letters to call on the G7, G20 and global leaders to raise the aim and accelerate climate action efforts, promoted by the WEF (Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders) and We Mean Business.\n- Race to Zero Breakthroughs: promoted by the UN Global Compact. This initiative, launched by the High Level Climate Champions together with the COP26 Presidency, seeks to advance intermediate milestones in the roadmap of all industries to climate neutrality. Iberdrola has been invited to support a roadmap to advance toward climate neutrality in the energy sector.\n\n**Awareness Plan**\n\nIn 2016, Iberdrola launched a Plan for Raising Social Awareness on Climate Change (the \u201cAwareness Plan\u201d). Aimed at different sectors of the public, its objectives are to generate knowledge, promote mobilisation and foster climate action. Since that time, the Awareness Plan has become a key activity within the company, focusing on four lines of action: internal actions; external actions; schools, youth and university students; alliances and institutions.\nDetails on some of the noteworthy projects in each of the action areas are included below.\n\n### Examples of innovation projects with an impact on climate change\n\n| Internal actions | Development of initiatives available to citizens and other agents and municipalities, organisations, universities, etc. |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Online and in-person courses** | \u201cLocal Councils #For climate\u201d Industry initiative for municipalities from the broader \u201cCommunity #For climate\u201d initiative. Has a Web-based platform (ayuntamientosporelclima.es) designed to promote climate action by small and medium-sized municipalities in Spain. |\n| **Environmental awareness-raising; Climate change; The influence of air quality.** | \u201cEnergia4All\u201d Sponsorship of a number of basic online courses on energy, which received a EUROPEAN AWARD, as a Good Practice in the category of \u201cCommunication & Engagement\u201d, from the RGI Organisation Renewables Grid Initiative. |\n| **Event for employees** | Connects with COP26, including news and 10 videos with views of COP26 from various perspectives. |\n\n| Schools, youth and universities | Alliances and institutions |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Development on climate change content for schools** | **Global alliance with UNICEF** |\n| **EducaClima** | Three-year alliance in the area of training opportunities for vulnerable young people in the green economy, with spheres of action in Spain, Brazil and sub-Saharan countries of Africa. |\n| An initiative which through its Web platform (educaclima.com) provides the educational community with resources and information for all educational levels on climate change and sustainability. | **Partnership with NGOs to raise awareness.** |\n\n### Fair and Inclusive Transition\n\nThe transition toward a decarbonised model will entail structural changes with a strong impact on certain regions, areas and groups. So that no one to be left behind, this transition must be fair and inclusive.\n\nIn its commitment to the energy transition and green economy, Iberdrola is promoting a fair and inclusive sustainable transition having a shared value with society and aligned with the Paris objectives.\n\nOn this path, Iberdrola is part of the \u201cAgreement for a fair energy transition for thermal plants being closed: employment, industry and territories\u201d, along with the Ministry for Ecological Transition, Ministry of Labour and Social Economy, other companies that own coal-fired thermal power plants in Spain and union organisations. In this regard, it has assumed the commitments set forth for fulfilling the 2015 Paris Agreement and the Energy and Climate Strategic Framework in its Fair Transition Strategy. This strategy promotes ensuring that workers and territories make the most of the transition opportunities and minimise the negative impacts thereof through support and recovery measures.\n\nIn 2020 Iberdrola had already taken the lead in launching the open innovation platform in the regions where coal-fired power plants have been closed in Spain, Lada and Velilla. This innovative tool promotes generating knowledge among the parties involved, actively seeking interests and synergies so as to tackle the specific demographic and economic challenges of each area.\nManagement of climate opportunities and risks\n\nWe are facing a systemic and global risk. Companies, governments and individuals can reduce emissions (mitigation) and/or increase their resilience with a view to the future (adaptation). Climate change poses various risks, with increasing long-term impacts that, to a greater or lesser degree, may not be considered new risks for the sector. These risks are set out in the General Risk Control and Management Policy and are therefore monitored. They may be classified as:\n\n- Physical, stemming from possible material impacts on the facilities and the supply chain as a result of effects of the future evolution of climate variables (higher temperatures, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns, increased extreme weather events in terms of both frequency and intensity, etc.).\n\n- Transition, associated with all the risks that can appear in the gradual global decarbonisation process, such as regulatory changes, market, technological and reputational risks, grievances (such as for deficient reporting), changes in demand, etc.\n\n- Other risks may arise as a result of these risks, including those relating to deterioration in the credit of counterparties (suppliers, banks, others), social phenomena (humanitarian crises, impacts on crops and fishing, refugee crises, epidemics) and greater competition for financial resources.\n\nThe identification, analysis and management of the risks arising from climate change has been integrated, with a global focus, into the ERM philosophy under which Iberdrola has focused its management of risks since the middle of the last decade. This is addressed through a multi-departmental focus, with cooperation between corporate and business functions. For more information on Iberdrola\u2019s risks, as well as its governance, identification and monitoring systems, see the \u201cLong-term risks and opportunities. Comprehensive Risk System\u201d of this report, the Risks Section of the Management Report of the Consolidated Annual Financial Report 2021, Section E of the Annual Corporate Governance Report 2021 and the \u201cRisks\u201d section of the Integrated Report March 2022.\n\n| Area                  | 2021 improvements \u2013 identification and reporting of climate change risks |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Risks                 | In the GRC internal risk reporting tool, a label has been enabled allowing system users to assign the \u201cClimate change\u201d variable to any risk, in addition to the classification of risks according to the primary categories defined in the Iberdrola group\u2019s General Risk Control and Management Policy. |\n| CRS and Reputation    | The internal tool for implementing the Global Stakeholder Engagement Model includes types of relevant issues and risks, including climate change, in order for users to identify specific issues and risks and associate them with this classification. |\nIdentification and evaluation of transition opportunities and risks\n\nThe main risks of transition (regulatory and market risks) are essentially domestic. Climate change risks sometimes require strategic management, of which Iberdrola\u2019s growth policy is an example given its strong focus on the development of renewable energy and flexible smart grids.\n\nIberdrola has been a pioneer promoting renewable energy and fighting climate change, and has achieved a leadership position allowing it to anticipate the potential risks of transition included in the following table, thus actively contributing to global decarbonisation.\n\n| Risks                  | Approach/management                                                                 | Opportunities                                                                 |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Market risks           | Expert unit in charge of making forecasts and preparing long-term plans at the European and domestic levels | - Economic decarbonisation, which requires an increase in the electrification of end uses, particularly heating (through the use of heat pumps) and transportation (through the use of electric vehicles). This transfer of energy from the fossil-fuel sector (a risk for these companies) is an opportunity for electricity companies |\n| Regulatory risk        | The risk associated with climate change is yet another part of the typical analysis of regulatory risks, and thus is evaluated for each investment. | - Increasing importance of networks (in terms of greater digitalisation, smart grids, and system flexibility) under electrification scenarios |\n| Financial risk         | Iberdrola\u2019s business model contributes to the decarbonisation of the economy        | - Improved energy efficiency and associated benefits for consumers, and an improved relationship with them |\n| Technological risk     | The group has units for technological and prospective analysis, as well as for technical and performance analysis. In any event, renewable technologies are mature technologies. Reduced exposure to cycles | - Advantages in terms of attracting financing for companies with sustainable and resilient business models |\n| Reputational risk      | Reformulation of the corporate Stakeholder Relations Policy, which is an essential element of our responsible and sustainable business model |                                                                                   |\n\nAnalysis of transition scenarios\n\nIn 2021 Iberdrola updated its analysis of transition scenarios stemming from climate change using the same methodology as in 2020. This analysis is based on the group\u2019s strategy published in its Outlook 2020-2025, and on an update of the most recent versions of selected benchmark transition scenarios. The update of the analysis thus contemplated:\n\n- The impacts on the various time horizons\n- Interaction between key parameters of the transition scenarios and the operational business indicators for the various businesses and territories of the group\n- For the various businesses and territories of the group\n- Comparing impacts with respect to the Iberdrola base case\n\nMoreover, the strategic outlooks are expected to be updated in 2022, when the risks and opportunities identified in the climate change analysis scenarios will be assessed.\nBenchmark scenarios\n\nThe scenarios selected are based on plausible forecasts prepared by the International Energy Agency within the framework of the World Energy Outlook (WEO-2021). The Outlook 2020-2025 is based on a central scenario and another two scenarios are considered on which the potential risks and opportunities have been assessed:\n\n- **Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS):** scenario aligned with achieving the goals agreed to in the Paris Agreement (<2\u00b0C), improving air quality, and providing universal access to electricity, all in accordance with the UN SDGs. Base scenario used to prepare Iberdrola\u2019s Outlook 2020-2025.\n\n- **Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS):** provides the path towards which the energy sector will likely trend in 2040 based solely on policies and measures already implemented or announced and on the targets set.\n\n- **Net zero emissions by 2050 scenario (NZE2050):** scenario in line with the aim of a global energy sector with net zero emissions by mid-century, moving up the SDS scenario with respect to emissions neutrality.\n\n**2020 - 2025 period**\n\nThe scenarios for the 2020-2025 period are evaluated according to an assessment of the sensitivity of the assumptions and forecasts of the different businesses and countries in which the group operates to the macroeconomic and industry parameters that define each alternative scenario. The results obtained confirm the resilience of the company\u2019s strategic plan (Outlook 2020-2025), publicly presented during Capital Markets Day on 5 November 2020.\n\nThis plan includes initiatives and projects allowing the group to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by decarbonisation policies regarding electricity generation, the trend toward electrification of demand, the reality of the digital transformation and the possibility of integrating the entire system thanks to the electricity grids. Also considered are alternative scenarios, and it has been verified that the company\u2019s strategy and plans minimise the identified risks. Significant short-term risks for Iberdrola arising from climate change transition factors are not identified.\n\n**2025 - 2030 period**\n\nThe scenarios for the 2025-2030 period are assessed according to a methodology that considers impacts and opportunities resulting from the change in macroeconomic or industry parameters considered most significant for the group\u2019s businesses in each country. A change in these parameters affects the group\u2019s various businesses to different degrees, and would impact different operational business indicators. The correlations and degree of intensity identified between these two types of variables are given below:\nThe indicators most sensitive to potential changes in the climate scenarios for each country have been selected for the analysis, both for the main geographic areas in which the group operates and for other countries with significant activity.\n\nThe review of the analysis confirmed continuity in both positive and negative impacts, or rather the absence of a significant impact for the businesses and geographic areas analysed in the previous year. Hence, the qualitative and quantitative results obtained in reviewing the analysis of climate change scenarios do not point to significant differences with respect to those obtained in 2020.\n\nThe table below provides a qualitative description of the trend of the most relevant operating indicators for each business under the two alternative scenarios.\nUnder a STEPS scenario, involving slower decarbonisation than under the central scenario used as well as a lower degree of green electrification, significant impacts were generally absent in the medium term as a result of the high visibility of the investments planned by the company for the 2025-2030 period. The areas in which there could be negative impacts during the 2025-2030 period, although of relatively low importance, are: the retail business in Europe, associated with the lower per-unit consumption in this scenario; the generation business due to potential lower growth in installed capacity in the European area; and the network business in Europe, as a result of a lower level of electrification than forecast in the base scenario. The rest of the businesses will maintain the forecasted growth rates as a result of the great need for investments to strengthen networks and the penetration of renewables in the United States and Brazil.\n\nA more ambitious global scenario (Net Zero 2050) would entail greater opportunities for the Iberdrola group as a result of a more rapid energy transition, supported by better financial instruments and policies, more ambitious emission reduction goals, and above all greater electrification of energy consumption, improved infrastructure, greater efficiency, flexibility of the electricity system, improved service quality, etc. All of the group\u2019s businesses would benefit from positive impacts of varying degrees depending on the business and geographic area analysed. The opportunities identified for the renewables and networks businesses in the United States, where the scale of the impact would be very high, as well as for the networks business in Brazil should be emphasised. The growth vectors would leverage increased investment in renewables and in transmission and distribution networks to accelerate the grid reinforcement and infrastructure improvement projects needed to ensure integration of the system and quality of supply.\n\nThe potential financial impact of the scenarios described have been analysed according to TCFD recommendations. Hence, in the 2030 horizon, the impacts analysed are a result of the business developments described in the preceding paragraphs, and show a balance of increased opportunities against the risks identified. The commercial and networks businesses could be impacted by losses of under \u20ac100 million in terms of expected EBITDA for 2030 in the STEPS scenario. By contrast, the opportunities arising from a Net Zero scenario could have a positive impact on EBITDA of more than \u20ac300 million by 2030 for each of the three businesses: retail, wholesale and networks. The Net-Zero scenario has been evaluated assuming organic growth and a stable balance sheet structure.\n2030 - 2050 period\n\nThe qualitative exercise of extrapolating the analysis of transition risks and the group\u2019s business model was revised updated in 2021 based on available projections. This also led to a favourable conclusion regarding the group\u2019s resilience to expected trends during that period.\n\nIdentification and evaluation of physical opportunities and risks\n\nIberdrola monitors and manages physical risks through a permanent climate science analysis process and applies it in the Company\u2019s usual procedures, with a focus on planning, execution and control, and continual improvement.\n\nPhysical risks are specific to each site, gradual, associated with each technology, and occur over relatively long periods, although they can now be seen in the short term (e.g. in some cases as a result of increased extreme weather events).\n\nAnalysis of physical scenarios\n\nIberdrola has analysed the evolution of the main climate threats based on the projections contained in the Fifth Assessment Report, AR5, of the IPCC for the RCP 4.5 scenarios (stabilisation scenario, where the efforts being made and to be made at the international level in terms of reducing GHG emissions are taken into account) and RCP 8.5 (a more pessimistic scenario of greater concentration of GHG emissions and, therefore, greater variations in climate). The selection of the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios reflects a conservative approach with regard to physical risk analysis.\n\nBased on the evaluation conducted, it can be stated that many climate change risks, both chronic and extreme, affect the usual variables of the business and consequently the variables managed, to a greater or lesser degree, in the usual processes of its operations. Nevertheless, climate change will affect the likelihood of occurrence of these risks and, potentially, their intensity. Extreme weather events are identified as one of the main threats for the various technologies and jurisdictions.\n\nThe most recent IPCC report (AR6), published in August 2021, includes a new set of illustrative scenarios of emissions that explore the climate response for a broad range of emitters, soil uses and pollutants. Based on the new projections of this new set of scenarios, and pending the publication of the remaining reports of this new publication (AR6), the impact of the new scenarios on the evaluation of risks carried out and of the conclusions associated with the AR5 will be revised.\nThe table below sets out the main threats identified for the different technologies taking into account the expected evolution of the climate variables and the degree of technological sensitivity. Furthermore, the main management measures in operating the facilities are identified to minimise the possible impacts for each of them.\n\n| Climate threats/impacts | Principal threats | Principal physical impacts | Approach/management | Opportunities |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------|\n| **Average temperature variations** | | | | |\n| | | | | |\n| **Average precipitation variation** | | | | |\n| | | | | |\n| **Sea-level rise** | | | | |\n| | | | | |\n| **Heat waves/fires** | | | | |\n| | | | | |\n| **Cold snaps** | | | | |\n| | | | | |\n| **Extreme precipitation (flooding and/or landslides)** | | | | |\n| | | | | |\n| **Storms and high winds** | | | | |\n\n8 The analysis has not taken into account the specific characteristics of a given facility, and the best available information has been taken into account in relation to the evolution of threats.\nDealing with vulnerability to risks derived from climate change entails a more in-depth analysis of the concept of climate resilience. A facility or infrastructure is resilient to climate when it is designed, built and operated in such a way that it anticipates, is prepared for and is adapted to changing climate conditions. At the same time, it can resist, respond to and rapidly recover from potential interruptions caused by extreme climate conditions, which makes this an optimum strategy for mitigating the risks derived from climate change within an organisation. According to this definition, as well as an ongoing-improvement philosophy, the resilience of the various business areas is analysed based on three key concepts for framing it: robustness (derived from design and construction procedures), recovery (derived from early-detection tools and action protocols) and adaptive capacity.\n\nAlong this line, some examples of actions/projects under way in different areas of the group with regard to one or more aspects of resilience are listed below.\n\n### Examples of actions in response to the different elements of climate resilience\n\n#### Meteoflow system \u2013 Response to storm Filomena\n\nThis is an advanced IT system, primarily intended to predict the electricity output of renewable facilities in various countries. Among other functionalities, it has the capacity to forecast weather events whose intensity or other characteristics might damage infrastructures or endanger fieldwork. This allows emergency plans to be activated sufficiently in advance. Hence, Meteoflow enhances the resilience of facilities to the growing extreme weather events caused by climate change.\n\nA recent example of the use of the Meteoflow system and its ongoing improvement was the response to storm Filomena, which primarily affected central Spain in January 2021. The inclusion of an ice-generation alarm made it possible to act in advance, mobilising the staff ahead of time, pre-locating generators and mobilising drones and helicopters.\n\n#### Investment in smart grids\n\nInvestments in grids have improved the response to incidents, including those associated with extreme weather events, in terms of both the number of customers affected and the average outage time per incident. The investments have included an increase in the level of automation of the medium-voltage grid, thereby improving identification, isolation and replacement times following incidents.\n\n#### DARWIND project\n\nDevelopment of internal component-reliability analysis tools making it possible to identify better-performing models of components, which is very important when selecting replacement parts for the fleet. Hence, in addition to increasing availability, this enhances the robustness and response to possible extreme weather events.\n\n### Analysis by business\n\nFurther information is given below on the main risks posed by an accelerator for each of the group\u2019s three global businesses with respect to climate change.\n| Business | Analysis |\n|----------|----------|\n| Networks | Given the geographic location of our network assets in Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States and Brazil, and according to available studies, potential rises in sea levels in coastal areas would affect a very small percentage of the regulatory base of the group\u2019s assets. Temperature increases and a higher frequency of extreme weather events could entail greater technical losses, impairment of service quality levels, an increase in operating and maintenance costs (associated with several factors such as the shorter useful life of assets) and annual investments, although in amounts that are perfectly recoverable due to the multi-annual tariff updates for these regulated businesses. The current investment and response plans, experience acquired and the grid design (mesh design with buried lines) would act as mitigating measures. In terms of transition risks, there is the possibility of widespread development of distributed generation, the impact of which would be partially offset by the growing electrification of the economy (such as electric cars) and investments in smart grids. |\n| Renewables | The main physical risk is the potential negative future evolution of the hydro, solar and wind resource, which are the key variables in the financial results of this line of business activity. The uncertainty relating to long-term global climate projections is in addition to the need to specify the impact in the geographic areas where our assets are located. There is currently a high level of uncertainty associated with long-term projections, particularly for solar and wind resources. In the case of hydropower resources, a possible reduction in annual average rainfall could have a negative impact on the production of the group\u2019s hydroelectricity plants, which is particularly clear for run-of-the-river plants, although the negative effects on some regions could be partially offset by other regions. Climate change could also affect the seasonal distribution of rainfall. In terms of transition risks, there is a possibility of cuts in the renewable energy remuneration frameworks and of a decrease in prices in marginal wholesale markets due to increased renewable production with lower variable cost. |\n| Liberalised | The long-term impact of climate change on the thermal generation business is not considered material in view of the fact that there will be a substantial reduction in the group\u2019s fleet in coming decades (as it will reach the end of its useful life) and will mainly be concentrated in Mexico. The impact on the retail business is considered minor, as possible negative effects arising from efficiency measures and temperature changes could be counteracted by the higher growth that the electrification of the economy is expected to bring about. |\n\nIn conclusion, and based on the impacts noted above (which take account of the current uncertainty associated with climate projections) and the existing mitigating elements, it is estimated that the physical risks of climate change might not have a material, permanent impact on the consolidated figures of the group, which is estimated to be globally resilient. In terms of transition risks, the group\u2019s current positioning as a result of its investment focus on grids and renewable energy puts it in a favourable position for facing such risks. The group believes that the opportunities stemming from the decarbonisation of the global economy (growth in renewables, investments in integrated smart grids, electrification of transport, green energy, etc.) outweigh the risks.\n\n**Risk management mechanisms and resilience**\n\nThe main risk management mechanisms, as well as the mitigating actions, are listed below:\n\u2022 Integration of climate change as a key management and corporate governance element.\n\u2022 Many risks deriving from climate change affect the normal variables of the business, and, consequently, variables already managed (to a greater or lesser degree) in the usual operations of the businesses (e.g. redundancy of equipment, emergency plans, crisis plans, etc.), which have management processes that already contribute to climate resilience.\n\u2022 The fact that many impacts are primarily medium-to-long-term means that, to a large extent, it is the group\u2019s future assets, rather than its current assets, that will bear the most severe impacts, given that its assets are progressively renewed when they reach the end of their useful life.\n\u2022 Regulatory coverage in the Networks business.\n\u2022 Insurance coverage.\n\u2022 Diversification (geographic, by technology, age, etc.) of assets.\n\u2022 Strong business model, with financial capacity.\n\u2022 Early action by the group in transforming the business model to adapt to climate change, allowing it to minimise transition risks and take advantage of the related opportunities.\n\u2022 The design specifications of new equipment will take account of more severe weather scenarios, and technological improvements will make it possible to extract greater economic value from new projects.\n\u2022 Iberdrola also maintains a proactive stance in working with third parties participating in the global and local dialogue on adaptation, as well as in partnering with other industry players and in the processes of acquiring knowledge from climate science, as a key action to move forward in a cost-efficient manner in developing the resilience of our activities.\n\u2022 Innovation remains a strategic variable for the group.\n\u2022 The consideration of climate change in decision-making on new investments.\n\nClimate change and new investments\n\nUnder the philosophy of continuous improvement, and in line with the Board of Directors\u2019 commitment to facing the risks of climate change, the analysis of these risks was strengthened during 2021 in the investment dossiers, on which investment decisions on new assets (\u201cFID\u201d, in international terminology) are based.\n\nGiven that the networks businesses are built around multi-annual reviews and that future investments in thermal power plants will be quite small, it has been considered appropriate to focus the analysis on new onshore wind and photovoltaic facilities. Based on the experience gained, the model will be expanded in the future to include offshore wind farms.\n\nThe model, promoted by several corporate divisions with the help of Renewables, has been constructed on the basis of the survey. This document should be completed by the Business (from a technical perspective), taking into account the particularities of each site.\n\nThe main variables and related risks have been identified based on existing internal studies, allowing the Business to verify all items in each survey. By contrast, physical risks, due to their nature, are analysed using climate projections from various sources, with different levels of granularity and time horizons, that are made available to the Business.\n\nHowever, as part of Iberdrola\u2019s philosophy of constant improvement and taking into account the evolution of the science (new projections, more powerful tools, etc.), the markets and current legislation, as well as demands from society, the company must continue advancing and analysing the potential risks \u2013 both physical risks associated with specific facilities, as well as transition risks. It must also continue to strengthen the inclusion of the climate change variable within the various process of the Company and project phases.\nIndicators and metrics\n\nIberdrola includes major indicators in this document to report on aspects relating to climate and to the strategy of the fight against climate change, which are key for the constant monitoring of the strategy\u2019s resilience in view of the scenarios analysed. In particular, these indicators include the greenhouse gas emissions inventory, the intensity of emissions, reduction targets, the use of energy, energy intensity, the energy mix, renewable installed capacity, water use, source of water, R&D&i and Capex in the development of low-emission products, services and/or technology.\n\nIberdrola believes that consistent and improved disclosure of the financial risks relating to climate change will allow for the establishment of a constructive and well-informed dialogue between investors and companies regarding the opportunities and risks relating to their activities.\n\nIn addition, for information on the company\u2019s actions to mitigate and adapt to the consequences of climate change, see the \"Management of climate opportunities and risks\" section of this chapter as well as the specific Climate Change section of the website.\n\nOther aspects associated with the energy transition\n\nDemand-side management\n\nGRI 201-2\n\nAs part of its demand-side management programmes, Iberdrola\u2019s main objective is to improve energy efficiency and the smart use of active electrical grids to thus contribute to the more efficient use thereof by consumers and thereby reduce CO2 emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change.\n\nThe types of actions taken include those relating to information, training and the provision of solutions and technologies that help consumers improve energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of their energy habits and consumption. Iberdrola engages in demand-side management in all of its geographic areas and for its various types of customers.\n\nThe main activities performed are broken down separately due to the unique nature and law of each country or market.\n\nFor example, i-De continues to improve and develop smart grids allowing for the active management of demand by consumers (residential, commercial and industrial) and an improvement in the energy efficiency of the system.\n\nIberdrola offers home energy management services through internet-connected devices that allow customers to better manage their electricity consumption and thus obtain energy savings (range of SmartHome products). The industrial and commercial sectors also have initiatives to diagnose and propose measures for energy savings and to improve energy efficiency, like photovoltaic solar energy installation, electromobility, efficient lighting, efficient air conditioning, optimisation of heating and cooling processes, etc.\n\nSASB IF-EU-420a.2\n\nThe percentage of the metered electric load served through the group\u2019s smart grids is close to 100% in Spain and above 53% in the United States\\(^9\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^9\\) In the case of Brazil and the United Kingdom, as at the closing date, information was not available on the same basis to report this indicator according to the established criterion.\nAvailability and reliability\n\nThe companies of the Iberdrola group have no direct responsibility for long-term electricity planning processes for the respective electricity systems in the countries in which they operate.\n\nGovernment authorities conduct studies to anticipate the long-term needs of the respective electricity system, and Iberdrola\u2019s companies act as market agents, making investment decisions consistent with their business plans.\n\nFuel\n\nA key element in managing the availability of electricity service is the supply of the necessary fuel. Iberdrola is supplied through flexible gas contracts and purchases on wholesale markets, adjusting to the needs of each territory. It also ensures that it has a stable, long-term and low-risk supply of nuclear fuel.\n\nNuclear plant decommissioning\n\nIberdrola is the only 100%-owner of a nuclear plant in Spain (Cofrentes). It also has interests in Almaraz I and II (52.69%), Trillo (49%), Vandell\u00f3s II (28%) and Asc\u00f3 II (15%), as indicated in the Scope of information section.\n\nAccording to Law 25/1964 on nuclear energy, the management of radioactive waste, including spent nuclear fuel, and the decommissioning and closing of nuclear plants, is an essential public service reserved to the State, pursuant to Article 128.2 of the Spanish Constitution. This law entrusts Empresa Nacional de Residuos Radiactivos S.A. (Enresa) with the management of this public service. Therefore, in accordance with the sixth General Radioactive Waste Plan (Plan General de Residuos Radiactivos) (PGRR) currently in effect, the State assumes ownership of the radioactive waste and is responsible for the monitoring that may be required after the closure of a nuclear plant, once the period established in the relevant closure declaration has passed.\n\nEnresa prepares the PGRR, which, together with the corresponding economic/financial study, is the basic reference document setting forth the strategies to be followed and activities to be carried out in Spain in the fields of radioactive waste management and plant decommissioning. The PGRR is sent to the Ministry of Ecological Transition in Demographic Challenge every four years, or whenever so required by the Ministry, for approval by the Council of Ministers after a report of the Nuclear Safety Council, after hearing from the Autonomous Communities with respect to territorial and environmental ordinances. The first PGRR was adopted in 1987, and the sixth, approved in June 2006, is currently in force.\n\nThe financing system in Spain for PGRR activities is based on contributions from waste-generating entities and is known as the \u201cFund for the Financing of the General Radioactive Waste Plan Activities\u201d. The fund is managed by Enresa and includes provisions for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants.\n\nIberdrola makes contributions to the fund through a fee calculated by Enresa and approved by the government, which covers all expenses relating to managing the spent fuel and the radioactive waste generated at its plants, as well as those corresponding to the decommissioning and closure thereof, as provided in the PGRR.\nIberdrola also records a reserve on its balance sheet to cover the pre-decommissioning stage of its nuclear power plants. Pre-decommissioning refers to the period from the final cessation of operations of the plant until the decommissioning approval, at which time ownership of the plant is transferred to Enresa. The current sixth PGRR establishes a period of 3 years for this stage.\n\nIn March 2019, Iberdrola signed a protocol agreement for the closure of the nuclear plants between 2025 and 2035. This protocol includes the schedule for a gradual, orderly closure of the reactors making up the nuclear installations in Spain.\nI.4. Our ESG+F proposal\n\n- Leaders in ESG+F\n- Iberdrola\u2019s contribution to the SDGs\n- Our main focus: SDGs 7 and 13\nLeaders in ESG+F\n\nIberdrola, aware that environmental, social and good governance (ESG) factors influence the medium- and long-term results and sustainability of the company, has included sustainability indicators in its business strategy.\n\nTherefore, the group is fully committed to sustainable development and bases its investments on environmental, social and corporate governance along with financial strength (ESG+F) standards, supported by the strategic pillars that have allowed for two decades of sustainable growth, thanks to geographic diversification, leading the energy transition, promoting efficiency, focusing on innovation and generating a sustainable dividend.\n\nAlong these lines, the targets that the company has set based on environmental, social and good governance criteria should be highlighted. These objectives synthesise some of the main contents and comments of the corporate policies, which, together with the Purpose and Values, establish the ESG priorities.\n\nThe remuneration systems include the consideration of ESG factors as parameters for evaluation, linking to specific results and to initiatives to be undertaken.\n\n| E | Emissions per kWh | gCO\u2082/kWh | 2021 | 2022e | 2025e |\n|---|------------------|----------|------|-------|-------|\n|   | Biodiversity: reforestation | Trees, in Million | 2 | 2.5 | 8 |\n|   | Water consumption | m\u00b3/GWh | 306.6 | < 500 | < 420 |\n|   | Smart Grid implementation | % of HV and MV grids | 73 | 75 | 83 |\n|   | Smart meters | Number, in Million | 15.3 | 16.7 | 21.2 |\n|   | R&D investment | Million Euros | 337.5 | 330 | 400 |\n\n| S | Training hours | Hours / employee year | 58.6 | > 55 | > 55 |\n|---|----------------|-----------------------|------|-------|-------|\n|   | Customers: smarts services | Number, in Million | 11.1 | 12 | 18 |\n|   | Jobs supported | Contribution to employment | ~ 400,000 | > 400,000 | > 500,000 |\n|   | Women in relevant positions | % of management positions | 24.4 | 25 | 30 |\n|   | Gender pay gap | % women / men ratio | +7.2 % | > -2 % | > -2 % |\n|   | Electricity for All | Beneficiaries, in Million | 9.6 | 11.5 | 14 |\n|   | Foundation | Beneficiaries, in Million | 2.0 | 1.3 | 1.4 |\n\n| G | Best practices in Governance | Inclusion in Corporate Governance System | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n|---|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---|---|---|\n|   | Cybersecurity | Annual number of security assessments | 1.670 | 1.800 | 2.000 |\n|   | Suppliers | % of suppliers with sustainable policies | 73.7 % | 70 % | 75 % |\nIberdrola\u2019s contribution to the SDGs\n\nAs a result of the continuing dialogue with its Stakeholders, and aware of the unquestionable economic, social and environmental impact of all its activities, Iberdrola has a sustainable development strategy aligned with the group\u2019s implementation of a business plan focused on the sustainable creation of value, primarily based on its Purpose and Values, and respect for human rights. Thus, it promotes initiatives that contribute to bringing about a more just, equal and healthy society, and, in particular, to achieving the SDGs, notably those relating to Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) and Climate action (SDG 13), through specific lines of action focused on universal access (SDG 7.1), increasing renewable energy (SDG 7.2) and developing measures to improve energy efficiency (SDG 7.3) using tools such as fostering innovation (SDG 9), education (SDG 4), protection of biodiversity (SDG 15), gender equality (ODS 5) in particular, and reduced inequalities (SDG 10) in general, which essentially entails protecting disadvantaged groups. Iberdrola defends the role played by the SDGs and Agenda 2030 as a global social compact, because global problems such as climate change and the pandemic call for global solutions and agreements.\n\nIberdrola has linked its business and sustainability strategy to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since they were set in 2015, and in 2018 it approved an update of its Corporate Governance System, which was mainly intended to formalise the Iberdrola group\u2019s commitment to the SDGs, underscoring the group\u2019s contribution to achieving them with the social dividend generated through its business activity.\n\nIn December 2020 Iberdrola reformulated its governance and sustainability system, structuring it around ESG standards aligned with its sustainable development strategy and its social dividend, which cemented the company\u2019s position at the forefront of best international corporate governance practices. This was a key element for overcoming the differences resulting from COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021. The recovery from this crisis was based on strengthening institutions\u2019 social and sustainability parameters.\n\nThe SDGs thus inspired or are included as a fundamental element in the following areas:\n\n- By-Laws\n- Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and Code of Ethics\n- Environmental policies.\n- Social commitment policies.\n- Policies and rules relating to Corporate Governance.\n\nUltimately, this is an attempt to see that all Stakeholders participate in the social dividend generated by the company\u2019s activities, or shared value, which is the sum of all the economic, social and environmental impacts that a company generates through its activity, within the environment in which it does business.\n\nThe General Sustainable Development Policy introduces the principles governing the various corporate policies relating to sustainable development. Section I.3 \u201cPolicies and commitments\u201d describes the content and focus of these policies.\nThe company\u2019s commitment to contribute to the SDGs is supervised by its governance bodies. Thus, the Sustainable Development Committee of the Board (the composition and duties of which are described in the \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d section of chapter IV.2), is vested with the power to, among other things, \u201cMonitor the group\u2019s contribution to the achievement of the SDGs\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, given the overarching nature of the SDGs within the group, Iberdrola has a global SDG Advisory Committee, a multidisciplinary team that meets every three or four months in order to review the actions taken by Iberdrola and analyse the alignment thereof with the SDGs, in addition to proposing new challenges and encouraging actions that help to achieve the goals that have been set. The SDG Advisory Committee held three meetings in 2021.\n\nOur main focus: SDGs 7 and 13\n\nIberdrola focuses its efforts on the SDGs where its contribution is most significant: the supply of affordable and non-polluting energy (Goal 7) and climate action (Goal 13). This commitment forms part of its governance model and of the sustainable management of the company, and is formalised in objectives tied to the remuneration of the management team: the shareholders at the 2017 General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting approved a long-term incentive plan linked to their contribution to the achievement of these two goals. At the 2020 General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, the Board of Directors approved a new long-term remuneration plan (Strategic Bonus 2020-2022) linked to both economic/financial performance (changes in Net Profit, Financial Strength and Total Shareholder Return) and the contribution to the UN 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. In relation to the latter point, these objectives refer to the fight against climate change, the drive for sustainability in the supply chain and the commitment to equal pay for men and women, which contribute to SDGs 3, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14 and 15.\n### Our main focus: SDGs 7 and 13\n\n**Electricity for All programme:**\n- **Goal:** 16 million beneficiaries by 2030.

Environmental\nII.1. Fight against climate change and protection of biodiversity\n\n- Iberdrola with nature\n- Environmental governance and management\n- Emissions reduction and climate action\n- Sustainable use of resources and action for a circular economy\n- Protection of biodiversity\n- Environmental compliance\nIberdrola with nature\n\nAn energy model in harmony with nature and human beings\n\nThe preservation of the planet and the well-being of people are priorities for Iberdrola in determining its entire business strategy and its business model. Therefore, in a scenario characterised by strong growth in global energy demand, Iberdrola is working to build an energy model in harmony with nature and human beings as a source of sustainable development.\n\nEconomic and social development is closely linked to the use of natural capital, understood as all of the natural materials (stocks) that we use and that generate a flow of goods and services. Our use of these materials will affect not only their availability but also the integrity and biological diversity of ecosystems that share in the use thereof.\n\nThe group is therefore committed to continue leading a sustainable energy model where the reduction of emissions, the conservation, protection and promotion of biodiversity, and the sustainable and efficient use of resources are integrated into all its activities and processes. This model is based on using renewable energies, smart grids, efficient energy storage and driving the electrification of demand as an energetic vector for competitive and efficient decarbonisation.\n\nTo ensure the success of the group\u2019s commitment to conduct its business activities in harmony with nature, Iberdrola works on three fronts that, together, address its main impacts:\n\n- Climate action: to establish the strategy, work plans and goals for reducing emissions and combating climate change.\n- Circular economy: to integrate the sustainable use of resources by increasing the life of its assets and reducing the use of raw materials and the generation of waste.\n- Protecting biodiversity: to integrate biodiversity conservation into decision-making, minimise problems and establish programmes to reverse and offset impacts.\n\nIberdrola is fully committed to this approach and establishes and regularly updates the action plans associated with each of line of work.\nEnvironmental governance and management\n\nEnvironmental and climate change policies\n\nEnvironmental policies are integrated into the sustainable development strategy and constitute the Company\u2019s decisive response to the challenges, objectives and goals posed by climate change, preservation of the environment and the loss of biodiversity, while helping to identify and take advantage of the opportunities arising from the energy transition. They are therefore the living expression of Iberdrola\u2019s commitment, shared by all its Stakeholders, to create an integral business value that takes into account and respects the natural and environmental capital on which it is based and which requires its activity, thus contributing to its maximum dissemination and application among its Stakeholders and within the communities in which it is present.\n\nThese environmental policies, which are in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, are as follows:\n\n**Sustainable Management Policy**\n\nIberdrola is committed to a sustainable energy model and its actions are in line with and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its principles of conduct are therefore based on carrying out economic activities that are environmentally sustainable, competitive, with high quality of service, that generate shared value, that respect human rights, and that promote the use of energy. The policy also establishes the instruments necessary to reduce the environmental impact of all its activities, such as leading the fight against climate change, assuming a leadership position in the conservation and protection of biodiversity, improving the circularity of its activities and its suppliers, promoting the rational and sustainable use of water, and avoiding or mitigating polluting emissions and their effects on human health.\n\n**Environmental Policy**\n\nIberdrola\u2019s *Environmental Policy* sets out the principles for developing a sustainable model that respects nature, biodiversity and historical heritage and that promotes the conservation, protection and promotion of the development and growth of natural heritage through innovation and Stakeholder engagement. For this purpose, it implements a common environmental management model for the group, which applies the precautionary principle and the principle of continuous improvement, places the environment at the centre of the decision-making process, and is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe policy also defines three high-priority lines of action, namely: the circular economy, natural capital and biodiversity protection. All of these pillars are essential to achieving fully sustainable activity in harmony with nature.\n\n**Biodiversity Policy**\n\nThe *Biodiversity Policy* shows Iberdrola\u2019s commitment to combating the loss of biodiversity and generating a positive net impact on biodiversity from its activities. This commitment involves integrating biodiversity into strategic planning, managing risk through continuous assessment of impacts and dependencies throughout the life cycle, applying the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, mitigate, restore and offset) in all our activities, avoiding the placement of new infrastructure in protected areas, implementing biodiversity action plans, working together with Stakeholders, and encouraging awareness and communication.\nThis Biodiversity Policy establishes four lines of action for these purposes: protect biodiversity and ensure the sustainable use of natural capital; identify, quantify and continuously assess the impacts and dependencies of the group\u2019s activities; work with Stakeholders; and enhance, raise awareness and communicate internally and externally with transparency.\n\n**Climate Change Policy**\n\nThis policy establishes the framework for Iberdrola\u2019s strategy and business model, which is in line with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, in the fight against climate change. Through this policy Iberdrola is committed to continue assuming a leadership position (directly and by establishing alliances), promoting awareness (impacts, challenges and benefits of its achievement) and contributing to a carbon neutral and sustainable future.\n\nFor more detailed information, see section I.3. Climate action.\n\n**Environmental Management System**\n\nThe commitments made in the various environmental and sustainability policies mentioned above are embodied in the Iberdrola group\u2019s Environmental Management System. This system enables the alignment of the environmental dimension within the group\u2019s sustainability model, integrating the SDGs and coordinating the mechanisms for measuring and assessing the group\u2019s environmental performance in terms of the life cycle, including the concepts of circular economy and natural capital in the group\u2019s management.\n\nThe group\u2019s Environmental Management System establishes a common, homogeneous, integrated and environmental framework that is a benchmark for all of the organisations. The system also facilitates the development of an ongoing diagnosis of the company\u2019s environmental behaviour at each of its management levels.\nCorporate Environmental Footprint\n\nTo gauge the group\u2019s environmental performance, Iberdrola calculates its Corporate Environmental Footprint (CEF), which evaluates the effects of the company\u2019s activities on the environment from a life-cycle viewpoint (ISO/TS standard 14072:2014). The objectives of the CEF are:\n\n- To quantify and unify the group\u2019s environmental performance.\n- To determine the effect of its activities on the various categories of environmental impact.\n- To help monitor the organisation\u2019s environmental performance and allow the objectives of the businesses and environmental improvements to be tracked.\n- To identify and assess the environmental aspects having the greatest significance for Iberdrola\u2019s activities.\n\nIn line with this performance, Iberdrola takes part in the European Rules Electricity Environmental Footprint (REEF) project, helping develop the Environmental Footprint (EF) product rules for the electricity sector. This makes it possible to have common rules for calculating the industry\u2019s EF.\n\nFor more information, see Iberdrola\u2019s Environmental footprint.\n\nCertifications\n\nIberdrola\u2019s environmental management system is rooted in international procedures and standards that are audited by prestigious independent agencies. The company currently holds the following environmental certifications:\n\n- **ISO 14001-2015.** This standard covers activities consisting of the product generation, transmission, distribution and marketing, office management and general services.

The latter parameter reflects the particular operating conditions of some of our plants in Mexico, which Iberdrola operates as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) under the auspices of the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission (Comisi\u00f3n Federal de la Electricidad) (CFE). Under these conditions, Iberdrola believes that the IPP plants do not comply with the requirement set out in the GHG Protocol regarding \u201cfull authority to introduce and implement operating policies at the operation\u201d in order to be included in Scope 1.\nThe updated information is available in the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory section of the corporate website.\n\n**Direct greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 1 (per GHG Protocol)**\n\nDirect emissions are emissions from GHG sources owned or controlled by the company. They include:\n\n- Emissions that result from the consumption of fuel and that are produced by owned facilities that generate electrical power.\n- Emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) associated with fuel consumption.\n- Emissions from non-generation (gas storage) facilities.\n- Fugitive emissions of methane (CH4) (storage and transport of natural gas).\n- Fugitive emissions of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) (distribution networks, substations, generation plants, etc.).\n- Fugitive emissions of coolant gases.\n- Emissions from facilities that provide services to buildings (fuel consumption).\n- Emissions from mobile combustion sources associated with road transport of employees with fleet vehicles for work purposes.\n\nThe emission factors used to calculate each of these emissions are obtained from official sources.\n\nThe following two tables show the changes in Scope 1 emissions from production facilities and other facilities (offices, vehicle fleets, etc.).\n\n| GRI 305-1 | SASB IF-EU-110a.1 |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n\n**CO\u2082 emissions at Scope 1 production facilities (t CO\u2082 eq)**\n\n|                      | 2021       | 2020<sup>13</sup> | 2019<sup>14</sup> |\n|----------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Thermal generating plants | 9,175,358  | 9,220,435         | 8,439,072         |\n| Cogeneration         | 3,515,703  | 3,250,773         | 4,516,241         |\n| Other emissions      | 63,101     | 47,656            | 5,284             |\n| **Total**            | **12,754,162** | **12,518,864**   | **12,960,597**    |\n\nStationary combustion emissions, from generation, account for more than 99% of total Scope 1 emissions.\n\n**SASB IF-EU-110a.1**\n\n- Gross Global Scope 1 emissions are: 13,207,008 tCO\u2082 eq.\n- Percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations: 95%.\n- Percentage of gross global Scope 1 GHG emissions covered under emissions-reporting regulations: 100%.\n\n<sup>13</sup> Data updated in the verification of the GHGs.\n<sup>14</sup> Data updated in the verification of the GHGs.\nOther Scope 1 emissions (t CO\u2082eq)\n\n| Source of emission factors | 2021 |\n|---------------------------|------|\n| CH\u2084 and N\u2082O emissions from combustion (Non-renewable generating plants)\u00b9\u2075 | 14,698 |\n| CH\u2084 Fugitive Emissions (Gas storage and transport) | 222,289 |\n| SF\u2086 Fugitive Emissions (Electricity distribution) | 56,010 |\n| Emissions in buildings (Fuel consumption) | 46,176 |\n| Emissions from mobile combustion (Fleet vehicles) | 80,237 |\n| Other emissions (Gas storage, coolant gases) | 33,436 |\n| **Total** | **452,846** |\n\nFor more information, see the climate change and emissions section of the corporate website.\n\nIndirect greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 2 (per GHG Protocol)\n\nIndirect emissions are those emissions deriving from the company\u2019s activity but generated by other entities, including emissions from the generation of electricity acquired for the company\u2019s consumption. These emissions are:\n\n- Emissions associated with the consumption of electrical power during shutdowns of the thermal, renewable and nuclear plants, and during pumping at the hydroelectric plants.\n- Emissions associated with electricity consumption in the group\u2019s buildings.\n- Emissions associated with network losses during the distribution and transmission of electricity to third parties.\n\nCO\u2082 is calculated by applying the emission factor of the generation mix of the respective country:\n\n- Spain: Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a.\n- United Kingdom: DEFRA.\n- United States: U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n- Mexico: SEMARNAT.\n- Brazil: Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation for Brazil.\n\nAn action plan is being advanced internally to complement the calculation of emissions using a \"market-based\" methodology. This effort will continue throughout 2022.\n\nIberdrola continues to reduce its indirect emissions, in particular energy emissions in buildings, due to its increased use of green energy. In 2021 electrical power consumed by the offices in the United Kingdom was 100% green, while in Spain it was 99% green.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9\u2075 Only emissions associated with owned generation are included.\n\u00b9\u2076 IPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\u00b9\u2077 MITECO: Ministerio de Transici\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica / EPA: Environmental Protection Agency (United States).\n### Scope 2 emissions (t CO\u2082eq)\n\n| Emissions associated with network losses | 2021  | 2020<sup>18</sup> | 2019<sup>19</sup> |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                         | 1,830,631 | 1,407,845         | 1,568,304         |\n| Emissions associated with consumption of electric energy during shutdowns and pumping | 310,100 | 451,671           | 473,698           |\n| Emissions associated with the electricity consumption in buildings | 21,253 | 23,138            | 39,743            |\n| **Total**                               | **2,161,984** | **1,882,654**     | **2,081,745**     |\n\n### Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 3 (GHG Protocol)\n\nIberdrola has incorporated the life cycle perspective into its management model, which includes knowing the long-term impacts of the value chain. New elements are thus included each year in the calculation of its Scope 3, indirect emissions that result from the company\u2019s activities at sources not owned or controlled by it. They include the following:\n\n- Emissions (due to fuel consumption) from electrical power generation facilities used in production for third parties. (GHG Protocol Category 3).\n- Emissions associated with the transport of employees for work purposes (hired and private vehicles, aircraft and trains). (GHG Protocol Category 7).\n- Emissions associated with the supply chain.

Therefore, in 2019 Iberdrola defined its circular economy model, which includes the entire value chain from suppliers to customers, along with its operations. The model\u2019s approach is summarised in the following chart:\n\nIberdrola has been a signatory to the Spanish government\u2019s circular economy agreement with the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge since 2017.\n\nThe generation of electricity is one of the group\u2019s main activities. As part of its commitment to promoting a circular economy, Iberdrola continues to opt for the most efficient technologies per unit of production, with the smallest environmental impact. This is reflected in the following activities:\n\n- Commitment to the development of renewable energy, especially hydroelectric, onshore wind, offshore wind, and solar photovoltaic energy.\n- Selection of products that have a smaller environmental impact.\n- Sustainable management and use of consumables, always respecting the natural environment and taking the necessary measures to reduce the risks of affecting it.\n- Commitment to technologies that improve efficiency in the consumption of water.\n- Solving waste-recycling problems through innovation projects with suppliers and technology centres.\n- Lifecycle analysis quantifying the impacts stemming from the use of raw materials and from decommissionings.\nUse of materials\n\nGRI 301\n\nThe change in the consumption of fuel from non-renewable sources over the last three years is shown below:\n\nGRI 301-1\n\nUse of raw materials\n\n|                  | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Coal (t)         | 0      | 113,130| 162,683|\n| Fuel-oil (t)     | 26,327 | 26,227 | 36,084 |\n| Natural gas (Nm3)| 13,719,683,127 | 14,649,824,720 | 13,984,058,419 |\n| Gas-oil (m3)     | 23,649 | 18,141 | 19,447 |\n| Uranium (kg)     | 34,899 | 29,899 | 37,148 |\n| Waste-derived fuel (WDF) (t) | 2,258 | 0 | 1,841 |\n| Offgas (m3)      | 69,875,382 | 73,835,934 | 77,560,574 |\n\nGRI 301-2\n\nThe use of waste-derived fuel (WDF) and offgas from industrial processes accounted for 0.2% of the fuel energy consumed in the year.\n\nFuel use (%) by country in 2021 is shown below:\n\nGRI 301-1\n\nDistribution of fuel consumption in 2021 (%)\n\n|                  | Coal | Fuel oil | Natural Gas | Gas-oil | Uranium | WDF | Offgas |\n|------------------|------|----------|-------------|---------|---------|-----|--------|\n| Spain            | 0.0  | 96.2     | 14.8        | 26.3    | 100.0   | 100.0| 100.0  |\n| United Kingdom   | 0.0  | 0.0      | 4.9         | 0.0     | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0    |\n| United States    | 0.0  | 0.0      | 4.3         | 73.0    | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0    |\n| Brazil           | 0.0  | 0.0      | 75.9        | 0.4     | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0    |\n| Mexico           | 0.0  | 3.8      | 0.1         | 0.3     | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0    |\n| Other countries  | 0.0  | 0.0      | 0.1         | 0.3     | 0.0     | 0.0  | 0.0    |\n\nApart from fuel, there is also consumption \u2013 to a much lower extent \u2013 of chemical products (in water purification, filtering of gases, etc.), oil and grease, etc.\n\nRational use of water\n\nGRI 303 SASB IF-EU-140a.1.

304**\n\nThe degradation of ecosystems and the unprecedented decline in biological diversity, which the scientific community universally considers to be a direct result of the impact of human activities, entail grave environmental, economic and social risks. This requires urgent action to revert the loss of biodiversity.\n\nIberdrola, aware that ecosystem conservation is an essential condition for global sustainability, is committed to assuming a leadership role in the conservation and promotion of biodiversity in its industry, and to promoting, along with its Stakeholders, a social culture in which biodiversity is valued, preserved, restored and sustainably used, maintaining ecosystem services, favouring a healthy planet, and providing essential benefits for all.\n\nIberdrola understands that respect for biodiversity and ecosystems must have a preeminent position within its business strategy. Consequently, Iberdrola has had a **Biodiversity Policy** since 2017 \u2013 strengthened in 2021 \u2013 in which it makes a commitment to integrate biodiversity protection and conservation in decision-making and to develop an energy model that is responsible to nature as a source of sustainable development.\n\nIberdrola has the following mechanisms to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity within management, and for it to be taken into account in decision-making processes:\n\n- Biodiversity Policy\n- Environmental Management System\n- Tools for evaluating impacts and dependencies\n- Biodiversity Action Plan\n- Environment and biodiversity committees\nThe **Biodiversity Policy** sets out the main principles of conduct and defines four priority lines of action that are reflected in the points detailed in the Action Plan:\n\n- The protection of biodiversity and the sustainable use of natural capital, adopting the hierarchy of preservation, integrating into its management the best practices along the entire lifecycle and promoting actions in favour of regenerating and conserving natural heritage.\n- Identifying, quantifying and assessing the impacts and the dependencies of the group\u2019s activities on natural capital with a focus on biodiversity during the entire lifecycle of facilities and promoting research and improving the knowledge of the ecosystems in the environments of the territories in which it operates.\n- Engaging with Stakeholders, considering their needs and expectations regarding biodiversity in order to integrate these needs and expectations in action plans, and partnering on research projects.\n- Communication, awareness-raising and training, both internally and externally.\n\nThe Biodiversity Action Plan can be summarised in the following chart:\n\n### Interaction with Biodiversity\n\n**Main impacts and dependencies**\n\n**GRI 304-2**\n\nIberdrola identifies impacts and dependencies stemming from the interaction of these activities on biodiversity and natural capital, in order to avoid, minimise, remedy and/or offset these impacts and dependencies. To this end, it has the following tools:\n\n- Corporate Environmental Footprint\n- Assessments of environmental impact on new projects\n- Impact surveillance, monitoring and re-evaluation programmes\n\nIn addition, since 2012 Iberdrola has been working on developing methodologies to identify, quantify and assess the impacts and dependencies of its activities on natural capital. To this end it has incorporated new tools. Thus, in 2021 several pilot projects were carried out at our facilities to quantify the net effect of our activities on biodiversity, based on international benchmark methodologies.\nIdentification of dependencies\n\nCarrying out operations and maintenance activities requires, in addition to raw materials, the services that nature provides. By identifying these dependencies, we are able to assess those services and plan actions to prevent their modification and to protect and preserve them. An analysis of the group\u2019s activities makes it possible to identify dependencies on the following ecosystem services:\n\n- Waterway maintenance service, through the hydrological cycle. The water cycle makes it possible to recover river flows, which is necessary to produce energy at hydro plants and for cooling processes at thermal plants.\n- Climate regulation service, which is obtained through nature by means of the long-term storage of carbon dioxide in soils, plant biomass and the oceans. This service is important for all generation facilities.\n- Terrain stabilisation and erosion control. Vegetation on slopes prevents avalanches and landslides. This service is important for hydroelectric plants and transmission and distribution grid facilities.\n- Protection against floods and storms, through the buffer provided by vegetation during such events. This service is important for hydroelectric plants and grid facilities.\n- In addition, there are also dependencies on abiotic resources, the most important of which are:\n  - Water. This resource is the source of production at hydroelectric plants, and it is necessary for cooling at thermal plants.\n  - Mineral and non-mineral (gas and uranium) resources as fuel in power generation at thermal plants.\n\nIdentification of impacts\n\nActions that may have impacts during the different phases of the life of facilities are identified in order to avoid, minimise and appropriately correct such potential impacts. The following chart shows activities that might have most significant impacts during the various phases of a project:\nBased on these actions, we can single out a number of significant potential effects on biodiversity, arising from the activities, products and services of the group:\n\n| Potential impacts |\n|-------------------|\n| **Construction stage** | **Operation and maintenance stage** |\n| Change in land use | General effects |\n| Habitat and species loss | Effect on birds |\n| Electrocution | Effect on land wildlife |\n| Variation in water quality | Variation in water quality |\n| Fires | Effect on flora |\n| Changes to the landscape | Increased greenhouse gases and climate change |\n| Collisions | Discharges/spills into water |\n| Soil degradation | |\n| Ecosystem fragmentation | Air, soil or water pollution |\n| Habitat alteration | |\n| Species displacement | |\n\n**GRI 102-11**\n\nIberdrola, in keeping with the principle of precaution, applies the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimise, remedy, and as a last resort, offset) in all projects. Environmental impact evaluation (EIE) processes analyse alternatives, with a view to avoiding locating new infrastructure in protected areas or areas with a high biodiversity value, even if they are not officially protected. Before beginning the process, Iberdrola consults with the various Stakeholders regarding new projects and incorporates good construction practices, going beyond the applicable legal requirements in each case. Once this process has ended, and during construction, Iberdrola continues to work with Stakeholders, seeking to ensure that the environmental impact is as low as possible, and restoring the affected areas. If significant impacts are identified during the evaluation process, the project is modified to the extent possible, and the best available techniques and any measures identified as necessary are employed to correct and minimise these impacts. Where it is not possible to avoid or fully mitigate an impact, compensatory measures are implemented.\n\n**Facilities in protected spaces or high biodiversity-value areas**\n\n**GRI 304-1**\n\nThe areas in which Iberdrola conducts its activities serve as habitats for a variety of flora and wildlife, some of which are under some form of protection. This is mainly due to the fact that the construction work was performed prior to the issuance of the declarations of protection by the public authorities. This is the case of certain hydroelectric plants in Spain. There are also facilities for which \u2013 after an analysis of the alternatives, giving priority to avoiding protected areas, and after an environmental assessment process in which the mitigation hierarchy was applied \u2013 the competent authorities authorised the project. Such authorisation is based on the consideration that while the protected areas or high biodiversity-value areas could not be avoided, the preventive and palliative measures prevented the activities from having significant impacts on the protected habitats and species.\nTherefore, following the impact assessment process, it was determined that the presence of such facilities in protected spaces or in high biodiversity-value areas was compatible with the protected elements, with the consequent implementation of measures to prevent, mitigate and compensate possible adverse effects.\n\nThe following table shows the Iberdrola facilities within or adjacent to protected spaces or in high biodiversity-value areas:\n\n| Facility                          | Location with respect to the protected area | Affected surface area/length | Type of protection

facilities\n\n**GRI 304-4**\n\nAwareness of the species that live in the vicinity of the facilities is fundamental to the prevention of effects on them - all the more so if they are protected.\n\nIberdrola has identified threatened species included on the IUCN Red List and on the national and regional lists of the areas in which it operates that potentially could be affected by our facilities. The company also conducts species monitoring programmes and research projects at many of its facilities with a view to learning more about their patterns of behaviour and incorporating this knowledge into its operations (see Indicators **GRI 102-11** and **GRI 304-3**).\n\n### IUCN Red List Classification\n\n| Critically endangered (CR) | 16 |\n| Endangered (EN)            | 55 |\n| Vulnerable (VU)            | 100 |\n| Near threatened (NT)       | 113 |\n| Least concern (LC)         | 1,393 |\nHabitats protected or restored\n\nA proper habitat is essential for ensuring the successful survival of local species. For this reason, as part of Iberdrola\u2019s Action Plan, operating units carry out, in accordance with the needs of each facility and during its lifecycle, specific programmes and actions to avoid, minimise, and offset effects on habitats and species, and to restore these habitats and species, as well as to monitor their interactions in order to remedy the impacts. The most noteworthy actions and programmes carried out in 2001 are listed below. Further information on the efforts taken out through the Action Plan will be made available in the 2020-2021 Biodiversity Report.\n\nHabitat restoration and compensation programmes\n\nIn Brazil, work to create the Biodiversity Corridor in order to establish connectivity between the forest areas of Iguacu National Park (PNI) and the Direct Influence Areas (AID) of the Lower Iguacu Hydroelectric Plant, in the environs of the reservoir, is underway. The corridor will comprise more than 3,000 hectares. In 2021, conservation work was carried out on more than 1,135 hectares. Also in Brazil, work continues to be carried out to develop the Permanent Preservation Areas of Corumb\u00e1, Telespires and Itapebi.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, work continues on the Habitats Management and Monitoring Plan with respect to the wind farms, covering a total area of more than 10,000 hectares. In 2021, 215 hectares of peat swamp and forestland with more than 336,000 trees were restored.\n\nFauna and flora species protection and conservation programmes\n\nIberdrola is working to minimise the impacts of its facilities on fauna and is carrying out actions to foster its protection and conservation. Special attention has been paid to the effects of our windfarms and grids on fauna, particularly birdlife. Numerous actions have been taken in this regard, from adapting supports \u2013 more than 87,211 in Spain since 2018 \u2013 to implementing new bird protection methodologies. Measures are also under way to detect the passage of birds and chiropterans and to shut down the turbines at our wind farms as needed.\n\nIn the implementation of new projects, numerous actions are being taken to conserve and improve the habitats of threatened or unique species. This includes the various actions to improve the populations of the species of Sedum pruinarum, Arnica montana, Narcissus triandrus, Narcissus Bulbocoidum, Drosera rotundifolia and Sphagnum spp. at the T\u00e1mega Hydro Complex and to improve the population of the Cabrera\u2019s vole (Iberomys cabrerae) at the Oriol Photovoltaic Plant.\n\nFauna tracking and monitoring programmes\n\nIberdrola carries out programmes to track threatened species or habitats that may be affected by its activities, in order to evaluate the success of its corrective measures, identify possible impacts and implement new measures to reduce such impacts where necessary. In addition to the tracking of birdlife and chiropterans at the group\u2019s wind farms, measures are underway to monitor fish and water bodies so as to protect the water environment in Spain, in addition to monitoring programmes with respect to herpetofauna, ichthyofauna and mastofauna at the hydro plants in Brazil, the monitoring of feline species at the combined cycle plant in Altamira and the benthic and marine mammal monitoring at the offshore wind farms.\nVegetation management programmes\nIberdrola applies the best techniques to minimise effects in the form of soil loss due to erosion and acidification. These techniques include maintaining the vegetal cover at photovoltaic plants and refraining from using herbicides as well as avoiding the mass cutting of trees for street cleaning work related to fire protection lanes.\n\nProgrammes to foster knowledge and research for habitat and species\nIberdrola supports the expansion of knowledge and research as key measures to protect and conserve biodiversity. Hence in 2021, the company continued to support research such as the work carried out through the Coralizar Project on the effects of climate change on coral reefs and the Flyways Project to monitor wading and migratory birds, some of which are at risk of extinction, in northeastern and southern Brazil.\n\nThe Migra Project also continued, the objective of which is to study the migratory movements of birds in Spain. A project has been launched with the Migres Foundation to analyse actions for the recovery of ospreys in Spain. Work is also under way to conserve habitats and species, such as the protection of feline species and mangroves in Mexico. In addition, Iberdrola has participated in the working groups of the National Commission of the Environment (CONAMA) promoted conferences such as the one on biodiversity and offshore wind held on World Oceans Day through ScottishPower Renewables and in collaboration with the UN Compact and the UICN, and conferences on ornithology, and has also sponsored the international conference of the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA21), among other activities.\n\nEnvironmental compliance\n\nTo respond to the international expansion and diversity of the company's activities that have an environmental impact, in 2008 the Iberdrola group\u2019s Environmental Management System was approved, with the aim of creating a common framework for environmental matters, so as to enable the coordination of the various plans and measures while respecting autonomy and individual characteristics at the regional level.\n\nThis shared system has been developed since then, in keeping with the commitment to ongoing improvement and with the goal of fulfilling the purpose and values of the Iberdrola group, incorporating innovative actions in the area of environmental management, which enables the alignment of the environmental dimension within the group\u2019s sustainability model, with the integration of the Sustainable Development Goals and identification of the mechanisms for measuring and assessing the group\u2019s environmental performance from the perspective of the lifecycle. This approach in turn is allowing Iberdrola to integrate the circular economy and natural capital into its management activities.\n\nThe Iberdrola group\u2019s Environmental Management System translates the environmental policies of sustainable development into environmental guidelines. These environmental guidelines are then deployed by Iberdrola\u2019s organisations, in the form of environmental objectives and goals, including through the assignment of responsibilities, resources and time periods for their achievement.\n\nIberdrola has specific Environmental Management Systems for its businesses and processes, based primarily on the UNE-EN-ISO 14001:2015 and EMAS standards, distributed and implemented within its organisations. These systems make it possible to reduce environmental risks, improve resource management and optimise investments and environmental costs.\nThe group has also incorporated the Corporate Environmental Footprint, as certified under ISO 14072, as the mechanism for measuring environmental management, implementing improvements, reducing environmental risks, improving resource management, and encouraging their circularity and the optimisation of investments and environmental costs.\n\nIncidents relating to the environment during 2021 involved the following fines and non-monetary sanctions:\n\n| GRI 307-1 | Environmental compliance |\n|-----------|--------------------------|\n|           | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Total amount of fines imposed (\u20ac) | 3,112,069 | 2,761,312 | 2,301,170 |\n| Non-monetary sanctions (No.) | 14 | 18 | 27 |\n| Cases being resolved through arbitration or similar mechanisms (No.) | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nOf the total amount of the fines levied during the financial year, \u20ac1,924,121 relates to Spain and \u20ac1,187,949 relates to Brazil. In Spain, 80% of the total amount of the fines was for issues related to tree trimming, branch fires and the electrocution of birds that came into contact with power lines. In Brazil, the fines related primarily to the cutting of trees without authorisation or not in keeping with technical standards, improper disposal of waste on public roads, or the lack of licences for supplying electricity, or supplying it in environmentally restricted areas.\n\nOf the non-monetary sanctions, 12 correspond to Brazil and 2 to Spain.\n\n**Environmental Grievance Mechanisms**\n\nIberdrola makes grievance tools and mechanisms, and the management procedures associated therewith, available to its Stakeholders. All of this is described in the \"Complaint and grievance mechanisms\" section of Chapter III.3.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the environmental aspects of its activities, Iberdrola has an email mailbox, medioambiente@iberdrola.es, that serves as a channel of communication with its Stakeholders. It can be accessed in the contact section, which gives the ability to ask questions, offer suggestions, state grievances or submit complaints. This mailbox is included in the company\u2019s Environmental Management System and is certified under the ISO 14001 standard.\n\n203 emails were received in the environmental inbox in 2021. Of this total, 15 were environmental queries and four were environmental complaints.\n\nIn addition to the environment mailbox, Iberdrola can also receive messages relating to the environment through the various channels that it maintains on social media.\nIII.

For this reason, all of the companies forming part of the Iberdrola group work together to attract, select, empower and retain their professionals, whose performance, knowledge and skills are aligned with the company\u2019s purpose, values and current and future needs.\n\nThe group has specific policies approved by the Board of Directors that regulate recruitment activities (such as the Recruitment and Selection Policy and the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy), as well as a broader recruitment and selection process applied at the global level. This ensures that the principles described in the \u201cDiversity and equal opportunity\u201d y \u201cIberdrola\u2019s commitment to human rights, related to labour practices\u201d sections of this report are applied in the selection processes. This process also relies on local practices in order to ensure that the best talent is attracted and selected in line with the needs of each specific territory and is adapted to the specific legal system.\n\nIn 2021, in keeping with the reality of the global social context as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Iberdrola carried out various actions to attract, select, empower and retain the best and most diverse talent pool across its various territories. These actions include:\n\n- In Spain, a graduate programme has been launched to attract and hire talent, accelerating their professional growth in order to have a group of future leaders and experienced specialists who can strengthen strategic areas and meet Iberdrola\u2019s future growth needs.\n- Attendance at job forums and holding talks and conferences, both in person and virtually, to share the values of our company with students and encourage them to take part in our selection processes, with the attendance of more than 14,000 students at these events.\n\nWe have also continued with the following projects:\n\n- Agreements with prestigious universities such as Comillas Pontifical University, Universidad de Salamanca, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Yale University, Strathclyde University, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco and Hamad Bin Khalifa University.\n- Training programmes at the company. A combined total of 331 vocational students and 580 university students have begun their training at Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a, ScottishPower, AVANGRID, Neoenenergia, Iberdrola M\u00e9xico and Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional.\n- International scholarship programmes for master\u2019s studies. In 2021, Iberdrola awarded 35 scholarships for master\u2019s degree studies in the company\u2019s areas of interest.\n- Encouraging the use of internal employee channels to promote opportunities for internal promotion and international mobility: in 2021, 40% of published vacancies were filled internally.\nAll of these initiatives form part of the actions that Iberdrola undertakes to attract and select talent.\n\nThe lesser degree of representation of women in the labour market, for certain technical profiles, makes it difficult to achieve gender parity in new hires. These limitations are specific to the energy sector, for which reason Iberdrola is implementing numerous actions to promote an interest in technical studies among school-age girls.\n\n### New hires\n\n| By age, in numbers | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------------|------|------|------|\n| Up to 30 years old | 1,814 | 1,308 | 1,333 |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 1,932 | 1,462 | 1,207 |\n| 51 or more years old | 136 | 99 | 99 |\n| **Total number out of total workforce** | **3,882** | **2,869** | **2,639** |\n\n| By age, in % | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------|------|------|------|\n| Up to 30 years old | 32.47 | 26.19 | 28.17 |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 10.40 | 8.73 | 7.73 |\n| 51 or more years old | 2.09 | 1.47 | 1.46 |\n| **Total % out of total workforce** | **12.66** | **10.07** | **9.73** |\n\n### Employee turnover\n\n| Personnel leaving the company | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| By age, in numbers | | | |\n| Up to 30 years old | 366 | 262 | 115 |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 911 | 731 | 258 |\n| 51 or more years old | 1,033 | 712 | 176 |\n| **Total number** | **2,310** | **1,705** | **1,773** |\n\n| By seniority, in % | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------------|------|------|------|\n| Up to 10 years | 1,151 | 905 | 309 |\n| Between 11 and 20 years | 281 | 223 | 130 |\n| More than 20 years | 877 | 576 | 110 |\n| **Total number** | **2,310** | **1,705** | **1,773** |\n\n33 Data recalculated with respect to the figures published in 2019 and 2020.\n34 Of the headcount of this group at year end.\n## Dismissals at the company\n\n| By age, in numbers | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------------|------|------|------|\n| Up to 30 years old | 143  | 24   | 85   |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 374  | 65   | 289  |\n| 51 or more years old | 125  | 26   | 90   |\n\n| By age, in % | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------|------|------|------|\n| Up to 30 years old | 2.56 | 1.45 | 1.70 |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 2.01 | 1.16 | 1.72 |\n| 51 or more years old | 1.92 | 1.28 | 1.34 |\n\n| By seniority, in numbers | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Up to 10 years | 442  | 77   | 348  |\n| Between 11 and 20 years | 98   | 24   | 60   |\n| More than 20 years | 102  | 14   | 56   |\n\n| By seniority, in % | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------------|------|------|------|\n| Up to 10 years | 1.38 | 1.03 | 0.94 |\n| Between 11 and 20 years | 1.38 | 1.03 | 0.94 |\n| More than 20 years | 1.88 | 0.90 | 0.97 |\n\n| By professional category | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Leadership | 22   | 12   | 7    |\n| Qualified technicians | 137  | 50   | 97   |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel | 483  | 53   | 350  |\n\n| By professional category (%) | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-----------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Leadership | 1.05 | 1.49 | 0.83 |\n| Qualified technicians | 1.39 | 0.98 | 1.04 |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel | 2.58 | 1.58 | 2.05 |\n\n| Total number | 642  | 115  | 464  |\n| Total % out of total workforce | 2.09 | 1.24 | 1.63 |\n\n## Average seniority of workforce by region (years)\n\n| Region          | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-----------------|------|------|------|\n| Spain           | 18.1 | 13.7 | 17.1 |\n| United Kingdom  | 16.2 | 16.2 | 16.2 |\n| United States   | 11.3 | 12.4 | 11.6 |\n| Brazil          | 6.9  | 7.0  | 6.9  |\n| Mexico          | 7.5  | 5.7  | 7.1  |\n| IEI             | 4.3  | 3.7  | 4.2  |\n\n| Average overall seniority of workforce | 11.4 | 11.3 | 11.3 |\n\n## Employees eligible to retire\n\n| In the next 5 years (%) | In the next 10 years (%) |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Iberdrola total | 7.44 | 11.37 | 13.05 | 15.81 | 19.99 | 22.06 |\nCollective bargaining agreements\n\nGRI 102-41\n\nThe relationship between the company and trade unions is based on respect and recognition of the legitimacy of these institutions as workers\u2019 representatives, within the principles and ethical values that guide good trade union practices. The parties rely on negotiation as the main form of establishing mutual rights and duties. Trade union negotiations are part of the labour relations management model at group companies, and collective bargaining agreements are established to reflect modern and advanced labour practices, while respecting the regional characteristics and areas of activity of the various group companies.\n\nGenerally speaking, the collective bargaining agreements of the Iberdrola group apply to all employees working under an employment relationship and for the account of the companies of the group, regardless of the type of contract entered into, the professional group to which they are assigned, their occupation or the job performed.\n\nHowever, issues relating to corporate organisation, the law of each country or even the practices and customs in each country lead to certain groups being expressly excluded from the scope of collective bargaining agreements (for example, executive officers in Spain are not covered by the agreement). This is why there is not 100% coverage, as indicated in the table below:\n\n| Personnel covered by a collective bargaining agreement, by region |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Region** | **2021** | **2020** | **2019** |\n|-------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Spain       | 8,578    | 8,383    | 8,380    |\n| United Kingdom | 3,680    | 3,674    | 3,934    |\n| United States | 3,504    | 3,438    | 3,234    |\n| Brazil      | 15,092   | 12,808   | 11,730   |\n| Mexico      | 349      | 348      | 323      |\n| IEI         | 178      | 261      | 228      |\n| **Total**   | 31,381   | 28,912   | 27,829   |\n\nThere are 9 collective bargaining agreements in Spain, 2 in the United Kingdom, 11 in the United States, 38 in Brazil, 10 in Mexico, and 3 in the other countries of Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional.\n\nGRI 402-1\n\nThe different organisational changes and significant events are formally reported in compliance with the various legal provisions applicable at both the global and local level, as well as any applicable terms of the collective bargaining agreements with regard to the labour relations of the group companies. The minimum periods for giving notice range from less than one week to a maximum of four weeks in the main countries in which the group operates.\nBenefits\n\nIberdrola offers a number of benefits to its employees, including:\n\n- Life insurance\n- Medical insurance\n- Disability insurance\n- Maternity/paternity leave\n- Pension fund\n- Remuneration in the form of company shares\n\nDiversity and equal opportunity\n\nPolicies and commitments\n\nIberdrola has long demonstrated its commitment to diversity and inclusion, and aims to embrace the diversity of the communities it serves. The company seeks to strengthen individual capabilities based on the firm belief that each person brings a special and unique talent that enriches everyone. This commitment is shared with all those who interact directly or indirectly with us: partners, shareholders, suppliers or customers.\n\nIn 2021, the company took action to further strengthen its role as a key player for true social and economic progress. The management of diversity and inclusion is seen not only as an urgent issue of equity or fairness, but also as an opportunity for value creation from different perspectives. The following slogan was promoted within this context:\n\n*We are diverse. We are unique. We are Iberdrola.*\n\nIn order to create an ecosystem that promotes diversity and is truly inclusive, structural tools have been developed to guide conduct in this area, including:\n\n- **Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy:** In 2021 the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a decision to combine the Diversity and Inclusion Policy and the Equal Opportunity and Reconciliation Policy into a single policy.\n\n- **Board of Directors Diversity and Member Selection Policy:** its purpose is to ensure that proposals for the appointment of directors favour diversity in the composition of the Board. This commitment has positioned the company as a leader among IBEX-35 companies, with a female representation of 43%, rising to more than 50% in the case of independent directors.\n\n- **Global D&I Council:** Creation of a Global Diversity Committee with the aim of proposing, advancing and coordinating the company\u2019s position on diversity and inclusion and promoting its implementation in line with the existing policy. The Council works to understand the context of the group and of each country in order to act quickly in response to identified needs. This committee seeks to connect Iberdrola\u2019s senior management with the reality of the organisational culture and to influence this culture, in line with the group\u2019s strategy, so as to create an environment that facilitates and strengthens diversity and inclusion among the company\u2019s professionals. Taking into consideration its key role, the Council has established a specific action plan for 2021 and 2022.\nOur Vision\n\nGroup companies promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) through initiatives focused on talent, culture and social contribution, collaborating with their employees and other Stakeholders to achieve an inclusive, innovative and sustainable energy future for all.\n\nOur Pillars of Action\n\nBasic elements of the Iberdrola group\u2019s positioning in D&I\n\nTalent Pillar:\n- Recruitment and selection framework: ensuring gender diversity in shortlisting and interview panels for senior positions.\n\nCulture Pillar:\n- Definition and implementation of the DE&I Business Case for senior management.\n- Awareness-raising and training for employees with people management responsibilities, both in unconscious biases and in inclusive leadership.\n- Inclusive and authentic communication that encourages dialogue at the company.\n\nSocial Contribution Pillar:\n- Volunteering programmes and initiatives of the foundations focused on vulnerable groups.\n- Promoting interest in STEM careers.\n\nMetrics and Reporting:\n- Definition and analysis of key metrics to guide decision-making.\n- Review and improvement plan based on the reports and indices in which we participate.\n- Assess new opportunities for partnerships and agencies with which we can collaborate.\nIn addition to the initiatives proposed by the D&I Global Council, Iberdrola implements other actions and objectives to promote diversity and inclusion and therefore contribute to important Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda:\n\n- Maintain salary equality between men and women at the group level, monitoring the salary gap;\n- Increase the number of women in executive positions throughout the entire group, reaching 30% by 2025.\n- Ensure that 70% of key suppliers have robust sustainability or ESG policies and practices;\n- Improve the quality of life of vulnerable groups through the Foundations and the Corporate Volunteering Programme;\n- Raise the ratio of training hours per employee above that of comparable companies;\n- Bring electricity to more than 16,000,000 people by 2030 - Electricity for All Programme.\n\nOur firm commitment to diversity and inclusion has progressed over the years and translated into important awards and partnerships:\n\n- Support for UN WOMEN, a United Nations entity that promotes gender equality.\n- In early 2022, Bloomberg recognised Iberdrola for the fifth year in a row by including it in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) of organisations committed to equality between women and men.\n- European Round Table for Industry (ERT): Iberdrola is a member of this international initiative, within which it works with the Diversity and Inclusion working group that seeks to give greater visibility and support and connect large companies in this regard.\n- Commitment perceived by employees: 77% of respondents to the labour climate survey stated that Iberdrola is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment.\n- The Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI) recognised Iberdrola for its various initiatives to promote a high-quality work environment among its employees.\n- Iberdrola was the winner of the first edition of the MAPFRE Responsible Inclusion award for its leadership in the commitment to people with disabilities.\n\nIn addition, due to the considerable impact of local cultures and context on diversity and inclusion management, the group\u2019s companies implement many other initiatives that are carried out at the local level.\n### Main diversity and inclusion actions in 2021\n\n| Spain | United Kingdom | United States | Brazil | Mexico |\n|-------|----------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| Equality Plan and Equality Committee within the framework of the 7th Collective Bargaining Agreement. | Sponsorship of European Diversity Month, an initiative promoted by the European Commission. | Creation of two new employee networks: Coalition for Asian Pacific Americans (ACAPA) and Community for all Abilities and Resource for Excellence (CARE), in addition to the five existing networks.

In some countries there are local committees whose main mission is to ensure adequate implementation of the D&I strategy and compliance with planned measures.\n\nMore detailed information can be found in the [Diversity and Inclusion Report](#), as well as on the [corporate website](#).\nWork-life balance and labour disengagement policies\n\nIberdrola promotes a work-life balance, as well as co-responsibility in the performance of family obligations, providing measures for looking after family members and children and flexible working hours. The Human Resources Framework Policy establishes the main principles of conduct in relation to respect for privacy and the right to digitally disconnect.\n\nIn fact, Iberdrola was the first IBEX-35 company in Spain to establish a year-round uninterrupted schedule in general to allow for a better work-life balance. In other countries, the company has also implemented flexible working hours, given employees the freedom to choose the most appropriate place to work depending on their function \u2014 as long as team requirements are met \u2014 and established measures to control overtime and/or extended maternity and breastfeeding benefits.\n\nGRI 401-3\n\nParental leave and return to work\n\n|                      | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Employees entitled to parental leave (No.) | 30,672 | 9,283 | 28,486 | 8,640 | 27,125 | 8,249 |\n| Employees entitled to parental leave (%) | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |\n| Number of employees taking parental leave | 977 | 366 | 743 | 332 | 789 | 424 |\n| Number of employees who returned to work after parental leave ended | 1,135 | 327 | 830 | 264 | 878 | 365 |\n| Number of employees who returned to work after parental leave ended and who were still employed after 12 months | 970 | 268 | 825 | 272 | 856 | 350 |\n| Return-to-work rate | 94.8 | 89.3 | 97.2 | 79.5 | 99.5 | 86.1 |\n\nDefending salary equality\n\nIberdrola guarantees respect for this right and has made it one of the commitments set out in its Pol\u00edtica de igualdad de oportunidades y conciliaci\u00f3n, which calls for equal pay for men and women for equal work and a wage review with uniform criteria for both genders. The current collective bargaining agreements at the companies of the Iberdrola group ensure equality in starting wages for men and women.\n\nTotal average salary of men and women at Iberdrola is quite similar. The ratio of men\u2019s average salary to that of women is 93.32% in 2021, in which year the calculation included average salary as well as fixed and variable salary and salary supplements.\n\nThe salary gap in 2020 and 2019 was 93.2% and 95.1%, respectively, considering average salary, composed of base and variable salary.\n\nThe underlying cause of the salary gap in certain age groups is the smaller presence of females within the staff, a common situation in the energy sector, and which is more pronounced in management and technical positions.\n\nTo mitigate this reality, Iberdrola is working in the following areas:\n\u2022 On equitable professional development through the implementation of specific training plans for women.\n\u2022 On including new generations and promoting STEM careers in groups within the industry with a higher minority representation.\n\u2022 On promoting scientific careers among youth and women students, who will go on to form part of the talent pool that Iberdrola will access in the future.\n\u2022 On promoting measures of work-life balance that equally benefit men and women, so that they can exercise co-responsibility in family duties and thus establish the conditions required for parity.\n\u2022 On gradually increasing the presence of women in positions of responsibility. For Iberdrola, 33.7% of positions of responsibility were held by women in 2021. The percentage at year-end 2021 increased to 24.4% for relevant leadership positions and other positions reporting to the Board of Directors or the committees.\n\n### GRI 405-2\n\n#### Average salary by age group and gender\n\n| Iberdrola (EUR) | Salary men/Salary women | (Salary men \u2013 Salary women) / Salary men |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                 | Includes: Fixed salary  | Includes: Fixed salary                    | Includes: Fixed salary |\n|                 | Variable Supplements    | Variable                                  | Variable Supplements  |\n| 2021            | 2020                    | 2019                                     | 2021  | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Up to 30 years old | 95.8                    | 92.0                                     | 92.8  | -4.4 | -8.7 | -7.8 |\n| Between 31 and 50 years old | 85.4                    | 85.0                                     | 86.1  | -17.1 | -17.7 | -16.2 |\n| 51 or more years old | 110.9                   | 111.7                                    | 112.1 | 9.8  | 10.5 | 10.8 |\n| Total average salary | 93.3                    | 93.2                                     | 95.1  | -7.2 | -7.3 | -5.2 |\n\n35 In 2021 Iberdrola internalised basic network services in Brazil (approximately 2,300 contracted employees), which is reflected both in average salary of skilled workers and support personnel and in total average salary.\nA safe work environment\n\nOccupational health and safety management system\n\nThe 5 Essential Safety Principles summarise the logical sequence of steps to be followed by each Iberdrola employee before beginning work so as to ensure that the employee carries out their work in a manner that avoids accidents. To this end, each individual is responsible for determining \u2013 or is informed of \u2013 the procedures for each job or task and the applicable practices and legislation with respect to such work. The 5 Essential Principles are intended to ensure that the various risks are recognised, along with the likelihood of occurrence and the various mitigation measures that are set out and which are always to be kept in mind. These principles alert us to the ideal initial conditions needed before any task is performed, in order to ensure that both internal and external elements are taken into consideration. The principles also help each person adopt a responsible personal attitude both regarding themselves and regarding the other individuals who work in the same environment and who will be affected by their work, in order to avoid unnecessary risks that could affect work teams, machinery, management systems, etc. as well as other workers and contractors in the workplace.\n\nIn sum, the 5 Essential Safety Principles are the foundation that allows us to understand what must be anticipated in order to maintain safety as well as physical and mental health, giving employees complete confidence when carrying out their work.\n\nWorkers covered by the occupational health and safety management system\n\nThe purpose of the Global Safety and Health Department is to propose a global strategy and objectives to ensure uniform safety and health requirements and standards throughout the Company in the countries in which it operates, with the ultimate aim of achieving the goals established in the Global Safety and Health Strategic Plan 2019-2022. To achieve this:\n\n- In every country, an occupational health and safety system has been established in accordance with ISO 45001 (or is in the process of being migrated to 45001 certification), as well as applicable local legal requirements.\nIn general, all employees are covered by the occupational health and safety system in their respective locations. However, there may be exceptions in certain locations as a result of specific local norms. For example, in the United States, employees of the \"AVANGRID Management Corporation\" (5.6%) are not covered by the aforementioned management system, given that their activities are considered low-risk. Likewise, in Brazil, steps continue to be taken for 100% of the employees to be included within the scope of ISO 45001 certification. In Mexico, the corporate segment (14%) is in the process of joining in the Joint Prevention Service.\n\n### Coverage of the health and safety management system (own personnel)\n\n|                                      | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Employees covered by occupational health and safety management system | 38,913 | 35,471 |\n| Employees covered by an occupational health and safety management system subject to internal audit | 38,857 | 35,466 |\n| Employees covered by an occupational health and safety management system subject to third-party audit or certification | 29,561 | 26,692 |\n\n### Main elements of the health and safety systems\n\n|                                      | Spain | United Kingdom | U.S. | Brazil | Mexico | IEI |\n|--------------------------------------|------|----------------|------|--------|--------|-----|\n| Is there a system?                   | Yes  | Yes            | Yes  | Yes    | Yes    | Yes |\n| Reference regulation                 | Law 31/1995 | UKHS-GSP-SMS2008 Health & Safety Legal Register - Lists all the Legal Requirements | Only for offshore wind | None | None | Several |\n| Scope                                | All 15 companies covered by the collective bargaining agreement | All employees | Networks and renewables businesses, Rest of the Corporation, not included because low-risk | Celpe, Cosern, Elektro, Termopernambuco and renewables business | Electricity generation businesses.

These processes are monitored through internal and external audits to ensure quality and efficacy. In addition, the results of the specific audits and controls are used to create action plans, develop improvements to the management system and communicate better practices.\n\nIberdrola has also made available to its employees a system allowing them to give notice of hazards or situations involving an occupational hazard. The notification processes are specific to each location (Employee Portal in Spain; chain of command in the United States, etc.), but in no event may these communications lead to reprisals or adversely affect an employee, given that they are part of Iberdrola\u2019s preventive culture.\n\nIn line with this culture, workers are always instructed to not proceed or give priority under any circumstance to performing any task that involves a risk without having the means and knowledge needed to mitigate or eliminate the effects of the risk. Hence, at all locations, employees have the right to speak out and to stop work or refrain from working if they feel that a situation is unsafe.\n\nLastly, when an incident is reported in any country, an investigation is carried out on the possible root causes and contributing factors. In addition, general procedures are implemented to monitor and complete the corrective actions resulting from the investigation (through the hierarchy of controls stemming from applicable law).\n\n**GRI 403-7**\n\nIberdrola seeks to ensure that all contractors abide by the highest possible health and safety performance standards in order to prevent any significant impact on workers\u2019 safety and health in the workplace as a result of the business relationship with the contractor. Hence, all workplace risk evaluation and prevention processes cover relationships with contractors and suppliers, in order to ensure that they comply with applicable health and safety requirements. If a supplier does not have a certified integrated management system, its contract may be delayed until specific plans under Iberdrola\u2019s control are defined in order to prevent any risk.\nOccupational health services\n\nGRI 403-3\nTo improve the efficiency of the processes referred to above, Iberdrola has a health service at all of its locations to eliminate hazards as well as identified risks to its employees. Workplace health is monitored using the means available in each country, while always ensuring the confidentiality of personal data. In addition, informational events and campaigns are carried out to promote health and healthy habits, along with vaccination campaigns and medical check-ups, depending on the location.\n\nWorker participation, consultation and communication on occupational health and safety\n\nGRI 403-4\nIn Spain, there is a general procedure in place for communication and another for consultation and participation, both of which reflect the legal requirements applicable in this area (Chapter V. Law 31/1995) and requirements 5.4 and 7.4 of ISO 45001:2018. There are also procedures for conduct unanimously agreed on with the trade unions that govern the operation of the safety and health committees and the powers of the prevention representatives.\n\nAt ScottishPower, the process and procedures are detailed in section 8 of the Safety and Health Management System Manual (UKHS-GSP-SMS2004).\n\nAt AVANGRID, workers may be consulted either informally or formally. Formal consultation is carried out through an established series of panels of qualified workers, through which workers nominated by their peers are consulted in relation to the development of the management system, and through the strategic safety board, where the leaders and representatives of senior workers are consulted.\n\nAt Neoenergia, worker participation takes the form of a preliminary risk analysis through the implementation of activities by certain workers; the reporting of incidents via the CEA (Accident Reporting) system; safety observations; meetings of the CIPA (Committee for the Prevention of Internal Accidents); and multidisciplinary teams to address non-compliance.\n\nIn Mexico, reporting takes place through the intranet and by e-mail. The information routinely reported includes details of accidents and operational incidents. For external communications, a reporting procedure governs requests for information as well as technical communications with customers.\n\nAt Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional (IEI), there are several union teams to hear the concerns of workers and raise them at periodic forums and meetings with company representatives to discuss topics of common interest, including safety and health. In the countries where Iberdrola Renovables Internacional has a presence, and in accordance with each country\u2019s legal requirements, there are committees or meetings to discuss these specific safety and health topics; in addition, the meeting minutes of the coordinating board of Iberdrola Renovables in Madrid is forwarded to these countries. In countries where Iberdrola Clientes Internacional has a presence, meetings are held and workers are given surveys allowing them to express their concerns with regard to workplace safety and health.\n### Own staff represented on safety and health committees (%)\n\n| Country     | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------------|------|------|------|\n| Spain       | 96.6 | 97.1 | 98.5 |\n| United Kingdom | 98.2 | 100  | 100  |\n| United States | 100  | 100  | 99.9 |\n| Brazil      | 100  | 95.1 | 100  |\n| Mexico      | 100  | 85.9 | 99.8 |\n| IEI         | 0.00 | 12.4 | 43.2 |\n| **Iberdrola total** | **96.9** | **95.2** | **98.8** |\n\n### Worker training on occupational health and safety\n\n**GRI 403-5**\n\nThe company regularly releases subject-specific online or on-site courses for all employees in accordance with their duties and needs, in order to provide training on general and relevant safety topics. The online safety courses are mandatory and are calculated for purposes of annual variable salary or bonus.\n\nIn each country, the workforce\u2019s training needs are regularly identified, so as to ensure that all workers have the knowledge required to safely carry out their duties. Courses normally combine theory and practice. In addition, in order to establish a common leadership model, a safety and health leadership course was offered at the global level to officers and managers in 2021.\n\n### Promotion of health among workers\n\n**GRI 403-6**\n\nIberdrola provides workers with material resources to promote their health, and organises non-work-related sports activities announced and promoted through the corporate intranet, in addition to sponsoring sports teams, etc. A \u201cHealth and Welfare\u201d Global Practices Group has been created with the aim of establishing common guidelines for conduct in this area, with the involvement of specialised representatives from the medical services in the different countries.\n\nAmong other activities, and depending on the country, systems coordinated with private entities are made available to employees, offering health coverage for them and their direct family members, along with medical insurance, life insurance, advice on health problems, etc. In addition, efforts are under way to involve employees in health, fitness and well-being activities.\n\nFurthermore, to mitigate possible non-work-related health risks, Iberdrola offers its workers voluntary services and programmes to promote health such as awareness campaigns on healthy life habits (smoking prevention, food, etc.), corporate offers and benefits for access to sports facilities and activities, illness prevention campaigns (mental health, cancer, cardiovascular disease, vaccination campaigns, etc.).\n### Main mental health management actions related to COVID-19 2021\n\n| Country

The main objective is to connect the training offered with the strategy, and to do so collaboratively with all group companies.\n\nOngoing learning is a key element for promoting innovation, competitiveness and the progress of Iberdrola\u2019s professionals. For this reason, Iberdrola has a solid training model that reaches all of its professionals in all categories. This firm commitment to training translated into more than two million employee training hours in 2021.\n\nA comprehensive analysis of the current training model and the cost-benefit ratio of the training offered was also carried out in 2021. This analysis examined the type of training, formats and channels, and the employees who received training. Employees\u2019 evaluation of the training and its impact on the group was also examined. All this made it possible to identify the strengths and opportunities of the current model.\n\nOther actions include the following:\n\n- Iberdrola Spain has implemented training actions in key aspects of digitalisation, creating Digital Twins, or replicas of the group\u2019s iconic facilities for training purposes. This approach allows for greater autonomy in content creation, shortens the student\u2019s learning curve, and results in greater efficiency.\n- In the United Kingdom, employees hired under ScottishPower\u2019s apprenticeship and graduate programme received training through a variety of programmes ensuring that they acquire the skills required by their business areas.\n- In 2021 AVANGRID extended the training offered through LinkedIn Learning to all employees, creating learning paths that reinforce the current development programmes (such as the AMP\u2019D Leading People and the Engineering Development Programme) and that also help ensure that the group behaviour model is adopted through development paths for each behaviour.\n- At Neoenergia, in addition to programmes to improve the technical qualification of its professionals, educational incentives are offered for undergraduate, technical and MBA/post-graduate courses. These actions are completely focused on mandatory technical competencies, which cover strategic aspects of the business, in face-to-face or digital formats.\nModel of Principles and Behaviours\n\nSince the launch of Iberdrola\u2019s new Behavioural Principles Model in 2019, and in order to bring these principles into line with the Group\u2019s purpose and values, several actions have been carried out that contribute to the cultural change being pursued. This is a unique model, covering all employees and countries of the Iberdrola group, which seeks to inspire the conduct of the company\u2019s employees during each stage of their professional career. The principles in question are:\n\nLearn to develop, Empower to grow, Share to evolve, Influence to be a leader, Focus to attain results, and Simplify to be agile.\n\nThis model is the framework to which the Human Resources processes (recruitment, training, development and performance) have been adapted, both globally and locally.\n\nAt the global level, in 2021 new reinforcement actions were designed to boost participation and engagement within the e-Leaders Challenge programme that was launched the previous year. This programme is based on the 70/20/10 learning model applied by Iberdrola in all of its training and development actions, according to which 70% of learning comes from on-the-job experience (\u201clearning by doing\u201d), 20% is acquired through conversations, feedback, coaching and mentoring, and only 10% comes from structured training courses and programmes.\n\nAt the local level, the United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil, Mexico and the United States have continued to strengthen the Behavioural Principles Model in all their Professional Development Programmes, carrying out different training, development and internal communication initiatives.\n\nIn Spain, a variety of resources have been designed, including:\n\n- \u201cDevelopment Conversations\u201d \u2013 interviews in digital format with leaders in various professional fields. These training sessions have been brought into line with our values and behavioural principles.\n- Training itineraries based on our principles designed in LinkedIn Learning.\n- The Savia programme has been strengthened with a more comprehensive self-assessment questionnaire that is more in line with our behavioural model.\n- \u201cAn idea in 5 minutes\u201d \u2013 development videos with well-known speakers in areas of expertise relating to business and general issues aligned with our principles.\n- \u201cThe change show\u201d \u2013 internal videos where employees who are leaders in each of the principles recount their first-hand experiences and challenges.\n- Team Leader Programme, with a four-year modular structure that is based on our principles (work was carried out on \u201cSimplify to be agile\u201d and \u201cShare to build\u201d in 2021).\n- Work was carried out this year on the Lead your Personal Effectiveness programme for executives.\n- \u201cWe are speaking with\u201d \u2013 online conferences with key figures in the business world where employees will have the opportunity to discuss and exchange experiences.\n- In the United Kingdom, the self-assessment process continued so that all employees have a clearer vision of where they stand in relation to each of the six principles, including areas to be developed and suggested training actions.\n- In the United States, the behaviours have been reinforced in the various learning tools and through internal communications.\n- The \u201cLiving Our Behaviours\u201d programme \u2013 a contest that rewards the implementation of the behaviours.\n\u2022 A system of questions was created for the selection processes that is in line with the behavioural model and adapted to the different levels.\n\n\u2022 A self-assessment tool based on our behavioural principles was also launched, allowing us to identify both strengths and areas for development.\n\n\u2022 Design of LinkedIn Learning itineraries depending on the different levels of the behavioural model.\n\n\u2022 In Mexico, in addition to the internal communication initiatives, six TED Talks have been held, an online conference format with internal leaders in each of the six behavioural principles. Each leader gave a live talk where they shared their challenges and professional experiences related to each principle, providing a space for questions and dialogue with those attending.\n\n\u2022 In Brazil, several internal communication initiatives were developed, such as the \u201cletters of recognition\u201d programme, linked to each of the six principles of behaviour, the aim of which is for leaders and employees to be able to make acknowledgements by sharing these letters, by email, WhatsApp, Yammer or LinkedIn. In addition, the Onboarding programme for new employees has been strengthened in order to integrate, facilitate and accelerate adaptation.\n\nProfessional Development Programmes\n\nGiven the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many of the Professional Development Programmes (PDPs) continued to be carried out as online events in 2021, both globally and locally. In order to support the PDPs locally, we have a global online guide available in all three languages, which includes specific information on the behavioural model.\n\nWe continue to foster an environment across the group in which our employees can manage their own growth and development. With this goal in mind, we continued to work to support employees throughout 2021 in their journey to becoming future leaders through the High Potential Programme, within the framework of our talent pool management process. In 2021, a total of 146 professionals took part across the group, all of whom completed an online assessment and built a Personal and Individual Development Plan to be implemented throughout the year.\n\nAlso in 2021, a skills evaluation process was carried out for executives in order to define development activities and identify candidates to strengthen the Company\u2019s succession plan.\n\nTo monitor the development of new team managers, the company has continued to carry out a specific programme to hone the skills and competencies needed for employee management. This programme is especially important for professionals in the early stages of their management career.\n\nCoaching and Mentoring programmes\n\nMentoring programmes \u2014 which involve pairing up an employee with a long professional career or specific knowledge and a less experienced employee or an employee who needs to broaden their knowledge in a specific area \u2014 facilitate the ongoing training of employees, strengthen a collaborative culture and promote the exchange of ideas and knowledge. The following initiatives were carried out across the group:\n\nThe first global Digital Mentoring programme was completed in May 2021. This initiative seeks to contribute to the digital transformation process at Iberdrola by connecting employees who need support in innovation and digital transformation projects with others who have previous experience in these areas. In this version, more than 7,300 hours were dedicated to the programme, with a participant satisfaction rating of 4.4 out of 5.\nThe initiative also contributes to the company\u2019s inclusion strategy by connecting employees of different generations, genders and cultures. In this first version, 30% of the 185 pairs were from different countries, and 54% from different generations. In order to continue with the programme, the call for a second version was launched in September 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Iberdrola\u2019s Digital Mentoring programme was selected as one of the best \u201chigh impact\u201d business initiatives within the framework of the \u2018JOBS 2030-Future of Work\u2019 project launched by For\u00e9tica, a leading business association in Spain in the area of sustainability.\n\nBoth through the Digital Mentoring programme and through the mentoring initiatives carried out by the countries, skills have been developed relating to the strategic needs of the business, including: new technologies, knowledge management, transformative leadership, change management, resilience, and diversity and inclusion. Overall, the seven programmes involved nearly 400 pairs and 3,500 hours of learning.\n\nProgrammes for skills management and lifelong learning\n\nThe Iberdrola group believes that professional development helps the company achieve its results and makes the organisation more efficient, by equipping employees with the skills and competencies they need to perform their work efficiently today, while preparing them to undertake greater responsibilities and challenges down the line.\n\nAll of Iberdrola\u2019s training and development activities are based on the 70/20/10 learning model. The content of all development programmes has been updated to bring them into line with our principles and behaviours.\n\n- Iberdrola has various programmes aimed at high-potential professionals, including the MBA in the Global Energy Industry, which is offered by Comillas Pontifical University in Madrid and Strathclyde University Business School in Glasgow. This is a global programme that lasts two and a half years, in which professionals from Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Mexico take part.\n\n- Iberdrola has an extensive training and development catalogue for professionals pursuing a career in management. Nevertheless, in light of the sector in which Iberdrola operates, technical training is key to attaining the company\u2019s objectives. For this reason, we continue to carry out a global programme in collaboration with IMD, in an online format, intended for professionals with technical degrees, in order to provide them with the required behavioural skills and techniques.\n\n- Iberdrola offers its technical specialists, middle managers and some of its executives a global development model based on the group\u2019s Behavioural Principles Model, which is implemented through the Personal Development Plans (PDPs) created by these professionals.\n\nSpecific training for executives\n\nFor its management team, Iberdrola carries out a number of development programmes in collaboration with the best internationally recognised schools and institutions:\n\n- **Energising Leadership Programme**, an advanced management programme offered by ESADE Business School.\n\n- **Driving Leadership Transformation Programme**, delivered by IESE and IMD Business School.\n\u2022 NEXUS, in collaboration with IMD, which offers training resources such as round-table discussions for C-level executives from around the world.\n\n\u2022 The offering of digital Masterclasses was broadened for the entire global management team in 2021. The classes were taught online by globally recognised experts, with the participation of close to 340 professionals.\n\nTo ensure that the complexity of managers\u2019 agendas is not an obstacle to their continued growth, the company continues to provide them with a broad range of resources in various formats and platforms, giving them access to relevant, high-quality content that strengthens their leadership skills.\n\nA major update of the leadership model was carried out in 2021 in order to continue development of the training offer. After a comprehensive internal and external benchmarking analysis, a new leadership development model was designed, which is more strategic and provides greater differential value. This model will be implemented starting next year.\n\nAt the local level, training initiatives for executives have also been adapted to the online format.\n\n\u2022 In Spain, the Leadership and Digital Culture, Lead your Personal Effectiveness, Leader\u2019s Communication and Leading in a Digital Context programmes were offered.\n\n\u2022 ScottishPower has continued with its Advance Leadership: Leaders of Leaders and the Leadership Mastery Programme: New Senior Leaders, designed based on the needs detected in the Climate Survey, and it has developed and offered a new programme on effectiveness called Team Performance (Effectiveness).\n\n\u2022 AVANGRID has continued to offer the Purpose-Driven Leaders programme in partnership with Yale University.\n\n\u2022 In Brazil, a Management Leadership programme was offered to contribute to the development of a strategic business vision. the company also continued its \u201cBusiness Strategy\u201d workshop, an event on business objectives.\n\n\u2022 In Mexico, a \u201cDNA of a Leader\u201d programme was offered for the management team, with the design of an executive version for senior officers. Negotiation workshops were also offered to the management team.\n\n| GRI 404-1 |\n\n### Hours of training by professional category and gender\n\n| Hours of training | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|\n|                   | Men  | Women| Men  | Women| Men  | Women|\n| Leadership        | 85,078 | 31,054 | 77,415 | 30,563 | 61,428 | 26,094 |\n| Qualified technicians | 440,433 | 207,835 | 352,221 | 171,403 | 307,451 | 135,162 |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel | 1,449,663 | 183,248 | 1,178,017 | 160,035 | 1,091,123 | 154,822 |\n| **Total**         | 1,975,175 | 422,140 | 1,607,653 | 362,000 | 1,460,002 | 316,079 |\n| Average hours of training by trained personnel | | | | | | |\n| Leadership        | 39.32 | 35.49 | 38.57 | 38.01 | 35.90 | 40.33 |\n| Qualified technicians | 43.41 | 39.82 | 38.52 | 37.31 | 37.82 | 37.14 |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel | 75.87 | 53.85 | 68.53 | 50.85 | 69.88 | 58.76 |\n| **Average hours of training - trained personnel** | 62.87 | 44.45 | 56.73 | 42.36 | 57.36 | 45.67 |\n\nThe specific training varies according to the diverse professional profiles of the staff, not according to gender. The high numbers of training hours received by skilled workers and support personnel, about 85% of whom are men, explains the difference in average hours between men and women.\nEmployees receiving performance and career development reviews\n\nGRI 404-3\n\nAs indicated in Iberdrola\u2019s Human Resources Framework Policy, employee performance evaluations, and communication of the results to the employees evaluated, are considered essential aspects for their professional development. Some of the basic principles of conduct relating to this aspect and described in the policy are:\n\n- Perform periodic evaluations of the performance of the employees of the group.\n- Communicate the results thereof to the employees evaluated so as to favour their professional development.\n\nAt the Iberdrola group, employees are included in formal performance review processes, which vary based on professional category and level of responsibility, as well as the country in which the employees are located.\n\nEmployees can be reviewed through two types of processes, according to professional category and the level of responsibility relating to their position.\n\nLeadership\n\n- Goals review (\u201cWhat\u201d): measurable, quantifiable and specific goals to be achieved over the course of the review period, relating to the goals of the Company.\n- Performance review (\u201cHow\u201d): review of conduct during achievement of the goals, which must be aligned with the Iberdrola group\u2019s mission and purpose.\n\nQualified technicians, skilled workers and support personnel\n\n- Performance review (\u201cHow\u201d): employees are reviewed on the basis of a number of personal competencies, which must be aligned with the Iberdrola group\u2019s mission and purpose.\n\nThese processes are based on a corporate SAP-based tool that allows management of the Human Resources processes relating to the review. In this way, all users involved in these processes (employee, evaluator and Human Resources team) can work in real time and globally. Furthermore, the main advantage of this tool is that it makes it possible to standardise and unify the focus and the applicable guidelines and criteria.\n### Employees with performance reviews (%)\n\n|                      | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| **Men (%)**          |       |       |       |\n| Leadership           | 93.73 | 93.48 | 94.99 |\n| Qualified technicians | 86.72 | 90.02 | 88.56 |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel | 65.54 | 70.03 | 69.81 |\n| **Average men**      | 74.20 | 77.97 | 77.36 |\n| **Women (%)**        |       |       |       |\n| Leadership           | 95.02 | 94.71 | 93.79 |\n| Qualified technicians | 85.86 | 89.82 | 87.68 |\n| Skilled workers and support personnel | 59.57 | 67.02 | 66.85 |\n| **Average women**    | 77.25 | 81.57 | 79.76 |\n| **Average Iberdrola**| 74.91 | 78.81 | 77.93 |\n\nEmployees hired in the last quarter of the year are not eligible for the performance evaluation for that year.\nIII.2. Quality and safety for our customers through innovation and digitalisation\n\n- Innovation and digital transformation projects\n- Our commitment to our customers\nInnovation and digital transformation projects\n\nToday Iberdrola is the utility company of the future thanks to its ongoing commitment to innovation, as shown by the fact that it has been recognised for the first time as the private utility company that invests the most in R&D worldwide, according to the European Commission\u2019s ranking.\n\nIberdrola invested a total of 337.5 million euros in R&D&i in 2021, a 15% increase over 2020. The R&D&i efforts within the Iberdrola group are organised around five main pillars, which in turn are aligned with the fundamental vectors of transformation of the energy industry, decarbonisation and the electrification of the economy:\n\n- **Disruptive technologies** that are increasingly efficient, sustainable and environmentally friendly, enabling optimisation of facilities and processes.\n\n- **Green hydrogen, innovative renewable energy, sustainable mobility, energy storage, smart grids**, the electrification of heat, and the recycling of clean technology components will contribute to industrial transformation, with a focus on sustainability, green and affordable energy, and employment.\n\n- **New products and competitive services** that meet customers\u2019 needs, with more personalised content and offerings.\n\n- **Digitisation and automation in all businesses and processes**, with the introduction of new technologies such as blockchain, big data, the Internet of Things, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, etc.\n\n- **Innovation with start-ups, entrepreneurs and suppliers**, intended to develop partnerships and new, disruptive business models, encourage the exchange of knowledge, and act as a driving force among its partners.\n\n- **A culture of innovation and talent.** Iberdrola promotes a culture of innovation through the transfer of knowledge, the attraction of talent and the encouragement of the entrepreneurial spirit. The **Universities Programme**, Iberdrola U, involves the development of various initiatives with academia, such as endowed chairs, R&D projects, student training, in-house training and young entrepreneurs. It is a network that promotes training, entrepreneurship and research, connecting 490,000 members including students, researchers, teachers, etc.\n\nThis year marked the inauguration of the **Iberdrola Campus**. This is a global centre for knowledge, innovation and employability, where nearly 13,000 people receive training in its classrooms every year, and it represents Iberdrola\u2019s commitment to technology, R&D and collaboration with technology centres as drivers to lead the energy transition. There was also the inauguration of the Global Smart Grids Innovation Hub in Bilbao, the primary goal of which is to drive and streamline the development of innovation in smart grids, which will be critically important to speeding up the energy transition and driving the development of the associated industry.\n\nSome of the innovative initiatives are set out below, classified by major category:\nRenewable energy\n\nImproved efficiency at wind farms, photovoltaic plants and hydroelectric facilities. Big data technologies have been used to obtain weather forecasts for wind farms and photovoltaic plants, such as in the ENERPREDIC project, and to take into account climate variability, including solar variability, making it possible to visualise and process information thanks to the CHINOOK tool. These technologies have also been used for data analysis and decision making in the CARTERAREN project. Metrics associated with the maintenance and operation of the wind farms have been created using highly visual graphics, and new solutions have been developed to improve the efficiency of the tools of the DOMINA system as part of the REN-EFIC project. Work on the ASPA project continued for the development of new models and tools for early detection of failures based on artificial intelligence and big data techniques; and the AEROEXTENS project focused on understanding the performance of wind turbines in relation to machine control strategies. The DIAGNOSGRE and GRIDFORMIN projects have included digital twin methodologies to verify the operating parameters of a wind farm, calibrating the sensitivity and stability of the wind farm, and to analyse the configuration of the equipment required in order to stabilise the grid.\n\nIn the area of hydroelectric energy, the possibility of increasing the pumping capacity at the hydroelectric plants was studied, with an analysis of future energy requirements, the best location for this increase, and the technological improvements that will make it possible, such as reversible variable-speed turbines or lower-cost penstocks (such as those being developed by the NEWPUMPING and CONDUCCIONES projects). In addition, two projects were financed by the CDTI \u2013 HYDROSMART and HYDRODEMAND \u2013 which supplement the development of these lines of work.\n\nRegarding innovation in offshore wind projects, at East Anglia One in the United Kingdom, work continues on several projects such as CROWN2, which studies various types of anti-corrosion solutions, and Lidar trials, which studies wind resources. Iberdrola is planning the construction in upcoming years of the East Anglia Hub, which will combine three projects with a total installed capacity of 3,100 MW: East Anglia One North, East Anglia Two and East Anglia Three. Work has begun on a new design for the foundations of the East Anglia Three wind farm, and studies are under way to export energy using HVDC technology. Noteworthy in the Baltic Sea is the construction of Baltic Eagle, where a new monopile design, adapted to the seabed conditions and the size of the new 9.5 MW wind turbines is being implemented. Lastly, there is the FLAGSHIP project, an initiative of the H2020 programme for the design, manufacture and operation of a new semi-submersible floating concrete platform and a 10 MW turbine in the waters surrounding Norway\u2019s Metcentre (Marine Energy Test Centre).\n\nTo encourage a culture of innovation, work is continuing on the YO SOY INNOVADOR initiatives for the launch of internal and external challenges and the Renewables Digital Evolution Plan (2018-2022), which seeks to standardise, globalise and improve the efficiency of processes in the quest for operational excellence, through a global, multidisciplinary team.\n\nClean generation technologies\n\nEfforts in the generation area focused on digitalisation, operational flexibility and efficiency, reduction of environmental impact, and improved safety at the facilities during 2021:\n\u2022 In the nuclear area, work on the COATI project continued for the development of software to enable the implementation of specific loading plans for spent fuel elements, which elicited the interest of potential users such as ENRESA. In addition, 3D models are being used to simulate critical processes such as container loading, along with the use of augmented reality and virtual reality.\n\n\u2022 In the thermal generation and industrial heat area, progress is continuing satisfactorily with the pioneering REDEMIS project, which has achieved exceptional results in reducing the emissions and start-up times of combined-cycle plants. A highlight of the digital area is the FLAGSHIP project, which, through the creation of digital \u201ctwins\u201d, enables the simulation of operating environments that differ from the ones in the basic design of the plant, displaying the results of the operations and making a possible to improve them in terms of operational flexibility, reliability and efficiency. In addition, work on the SIRO project began in 2021, which involves technological development based on artificial intelligence and aims to develop and validate a robotic inspection system for generators. This area includes the Industrial Heating and Cooling equipment, the aim of which is to decarbonise the industry by electrifying production processes.\n\n\u2022 In the energy management area, the launch of projects such as Thirties should be noted. This project seeks to improve voltage control and to optimise the use of transmission grids. The area also includes projects such as Flexener, which is oriented toward research on new technologies, simulation models, and flexibility services that to encourage the creation and operation of a 100% renewable energy mix. Also noteworthy is the European Posytyf project, which analyses from a theoretical approach the contribution of renewable energies to the provision of services to the grid through Virtual Power Plants, as well as the BeFlex project, which aims to design an ecosystem to facilitate adequate coordination between all players involved in the provision of services to the distributor, with a special focus on the consumer.\n\nRetail - New projects and services\n\nInnovation is essential in retail activities, in order to offer customers the products and services best suited to their needs. Thus, in 2021 Iberdrola worked on:\n\n\u2022 New initiatives to improve customers\u2019 experience: Work continued on new functionalities integrated into the Iberdrola Customer Apps. Hence, registration processes were simplified, and processes were automated. Integration of the management of domestic chargers from the Public Charging App has also been completed, and Smart Solar installations in Portugal have been monitored.\n\n\u2022 New products and functionalities: Progress has been made on the internationalisation of Smart Solar, the distributed generation solution for self-consumption, which was launched in the United Kingdom and France, with the first installations being carried out in Germany. The first installations of Solar Communities have also been carried out. Residents within 500 metres of a Solar Community can take part in energy self-consumption as a service with no need for installation or investment, and will be able to monitor their savings with the App. Iberdrola has created a management platform offering subsidies for Smart Solar customers that will make it easier for them to access subsidies from Next Generation Europe funds.\n\n\u2022 With respect to Smart Home, the Advanced Smart Assistant and the Company Smart Assistant were launched, allowing customers to optimise their consumption.\n\u2022 **Smart Mobility** most notably includes the boost given to the deployment of high-power stations in the public charging network that will facilitate intercity travel in electric vehicles, enabling vehicles to charge more than 200 km in 5 minutes (charging points of up to 350 kW). In addition, the launch of the global charging point management system, or EVA Platform, will provide technological support for the deployment of charging points that Iberdrola intends to undertake in coming years.\n\n\u2022 Creation of **Smart Clima** to drive the decarbonisation of homes through the electrification of heat. In 2021, the pilot aerothermal installations entered into operation with equipment from the main manufacturers and the development of new energy performance certificates in homes, with a high component of intelligence and digitalisation that enable high-quality energy diagnostics at minimum cost.\n\n\u2022 Iberdrola also participates in R&D&i projects in the **area of electric mobility** and has completed the CIRVE project, bringing into service the initial experiments in interoperability among the major recharging operators in the Spanish market. IBERDROLA also participated in the **MADRID in MOTION** project, in which the challenges posed by collaborative recharging and street lighting were launched, as well as developing prototype banks of batteries to be exchanged for discharged batteries from electric engines at various locations in the city.\n\n**Smart grids**\n\ni-DE Redes El\u00e9ctricas Inteligentes continued to focus on various R&D&i initiatives in 2021, particularly for improving customer service, maintaining and expanding the smart-grid model and the digitalisation of the grid, and advancing toward greater integration of renewable energy into the grid, electric vehicles and storage systems, at both the Spanish and European levels.\n\nIn Europe, work on the ONENET project continued to develop new customer-centric flexibility tools, with an open, streamlined architecture based on the concept of an interoperable network of platforms with coordinated operation. The COORDINET project continued and will coordinate carriers, distributors and consumers of electricity in order to offer a framework that encourages the participation of all players. The ATELIER project was launched with the goal of developing Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) in eight European cities, including Bilbao. I-DE continues to participate in the ASSURED project, which aims to develop fast-charging solutions for heavy-duty electric vehicles.\n\nIn Spain, work has continued on four projects to improve the control, monitoring, analysis, prediction and management in real time of low voltage: i-Trafo, eLVIS, CT Inteligente, Technical Supply Management. Progress also continued satisfactorily on the FLEXENER project to research new simulation technologies and models in the areas of renewable generation, storage systems, flexible demand management and operation of the distribution network. Notable in the field of network integration are the second phase of the Caravaca BESS project, which launched the FLEXIPOWER project to achieve the integration of various battery-based energy storage systems, and progress continued on the DSO-DTR project, validating the first pilots, which make it possible to determine how much additional energy the network can carry.\n\nIn addition, the **2021 NFC ST Pilot Project** began, the aim of which is the NFC tagging of switching elements in substations to digitally verify the identification tag of the switching element. In cybersecurity, the **TrueValSec** project has been launched with the aim of designing in depth the security mechanisms used at the different levels of communication in the electric metering infrastructure of Smart Cities.\nIn the United Kingdom, the projects under way include the DISTRIBUTED ReStart project, which studies how distributed energy resources can be used to restore power in the event of a total or partial disruption to the national electricity transmission network, and the HEAT-Up project, which is financed by Ofgem and will enable tests to be developed that assess the impact of domestic adaptations of heat pumps on electricity grids.\n\nIn Brazil, innovative projects are being implemented in a variety of technological areas: smart grids, energy storage, microgrids, recharge infrastructures, network quality and reliability, facilities security, energy recovery and sustainability. Also noteworthy is the collaborative project with Iberdrola Innovation Middle East in Qatar for the development of new algorithms and analytical metrics that will make it possible to improve the quality of telecommunications service and equipment. The initiatives that have been implemented include the DSO Atibaia project, which calls for the installation of a new automation system, smart meters and a telecommunications network.\n\nIn the United States, projects are under way with Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Studies have been conducted of the network effect on the electrical grid, the utility of customers connected to the grid, the speed at which new energy technologies and business models are adopted, and the effect of climate change on electrical distribution networks. Iberdrola has also participated in developing a digital platform designed to measure accurately and standardise worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases based on artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and digital twins.\n\nIberdrola Innovation Middle East (Iberdrola\u2019s technology hub in Qatar) has developed highly digitalised R&D projects with significant commercial potential in various areas, including smart grids, the integration of renewables and energy management.\n\nGreen Hydrogen\n\nIberdrola remains committed to the generation of green hydrogen for industrial use. Accordingly, construction of the largest green hydrogen plant for industrial use in Europe has begun.\n\nThe Puertollano plant (located in Ciudad Real), which consists of a 100 MW photovoltaic solar plant, a lithium-ion battery system with a storage capacity of 20 MWh, and one of the world\u2019s largest (20 MW) systems for the production of hydrogen by electrolysis, will enable the generation of 1,200 tonnes of green hydrogen for inclusion in the ammonia production processes.\n\nIn addition, with regard to the decarbonisation of mobility, the first phase of the new Barcelona hydrogen plant has begun commercial operation, making it possible to supply hydrogen to 24 TMB buses.\n\nIberdrola Ventures - Perseo\n\nIberdrola Ventures - PERSEO is the start-up programme created by Iberdrola in 2008 with \u20ac125 million in funding in order to encourage the development of a dynamic ecosystem of start-ups and entrepreneurship in the energy sector. The programme focuses on new technologies and business models that allow for improvements to the sustainability of the energy model through greater electrification and decarbonisation of the economy.\n\nSince its creation, the programme has channelled investments of more than \u20ac85 million in start-ups in the energy sector worldwide. Its base of 34 million consumers and nearly 55 GW of installed capacity have allowed Iberdrola to provide the start-ups with a sizable \u201creal-life laboratory\u201d that is aiding the technological and commercial development of the companies. The major achievements in 2021 include:\n\u2022 **Pilot projects:** In 2021, more than 25 pilot projects were carried out with start-ups in technological areas such as IoT, robotics and batteries, and in network construction and maintenance, hybridisation of land use (agrivoltaics), electric mobility, and energy efficiency, with the aim of improving the construction and management of assets, optimising operations and maintenance, and improving the services offered to our customers.\n\n\u2022 **Challenges:** In 2021, Iberdrola introduced nine challenges for the start-up community in the areas of renewable generation, in both onshore wind-based and photovoltaic power generation, electric mobility, and the construction, operation and maintenance of electricity grids.\n\n\u2022 **Investment:** It is important to mention the IPO on the NYSE of two of the companies in which Perso holds an interest, Wallbox Chargers, S.L., which develops electric mobility solutions, and Stem Inc., which manages distributed energy assets (batteries). There were also three new investments through the Programme in the areas of energy efficiency, mobility and decarbonisation.\n\n\u2022 **\u201cVenture Builder\u201d:** Perseo continued the initiative launched in 2020 for investing in and creating (from scratch) electrification and the circular economy businesses \u2014 in areas such as the recycling of photovoltaic modules, wind-turbine blades and batteries \u2014 and in sectors resistant to decarbonisation, such as industrial heat production and heavy transport. This initiative prompted the Net-Zero MAR Partnership, which focuses on the decarbonisation of the maritime sector.\n\nMore information about the R&D&i projects in which the Iberdrola group is participating can be found in the [Innovation in our businesses](#) section of the corporate website.\n\n### Our commitment to our customers\n\n#### Supply quality\n\n**GRI EU 28 SASB IF-EU-550a.2**\n\nQuality of service is an essential element, and its ongoing improvement is one of the fundamental goals of Iberdrola\u2019s activity. A quality-evaluation system enables the achievement of objectives linked to this ongoing improvement. This system involves the implementation of strict internal and external audit procedures to ensure compliance with the established quality standards. Moreover, in Spain as well as in the United Kingdom and Brazil, distribution companies have regulatory incentives linked to improvement in the quality of supply. In addition, Spain has regulatory incentives associated with reducing losses in distribution networks.\n\nIberdrola monitors the quality of the service provided in the various countries, measuring it on the basis of the frequency and duration of interruptions in supply. However, the measurements in each country are made according to different standards following the respective legal or regulatory requirements.\nIndicators used to measure the frequency of interruptions in supply\n\n### Indicators of frequency of interruptions\n\n| Country       | Indicator | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|---------------|-----------|------|------|------|\n| Spain         | NIEPI     | < 0.9| 1    | 1    |\n| United Kingdom| CI        | 37.3 | 36.6 | 43.7 |\n| United States | SAIFI     | 1.4  | 1.4  | 1.2  |\n| Brazil        | FEC       | 5.1  | 5.1  | 5.5  |\n\n- The Installed Capacity Equivalent Interrupt Number (N\u00famero de interrupciones equivalentes de la potencia instalada) (NIEPI) is used in Spain. The regulatory NIEPI is reported.\n- The Customer interruptions per 100 connected customers (CI) is used in the United Kingdom.\n- The System Average Interruptions Frequency Index (SAIFI) is used in the United States.\n- The Equivalent Duration of Interruption per Consumer Unit (Freq\u00fc\u00eancia Equivalente de Interrup\u00e7\u00e3o por Unidade Consumidora) (FEC) is used in Brazil.\n\n### Indicators of average duration of interruptions\n\n| Country       | Indicator | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Spain         | TIEPI     | < 39 min | 48.30 min | 48.10 min |\n| United Kingdom| CML       | 33.92 min | 31.55 min | 35.27 min |\n| United States | CAIDI     | 1.87 h  | 1.84 h  | 1.93 h  |\n|               | SAIDI     | 2.7 h   | N/Av.   | N/Av.   |\n| Brazil        | DEC       | 10.22 h | 11.24 h | 11.02 h |\n\n- The Installed Capacity Equivalent Interrupt Time (Tiempo de interrupci\u00f3n equivalente de la potencia instalada) (TIEPI) is used in Spain.

There were no days with serious incidents in 2021.\n- The Equivalent Duration of Interruption per Consumer Unit (Dura\u00e7\u00e3o equivalente de interrup\u00e7\u00e3o por unidade consumidora) (DEC) is used in Brazil.\n\n---\n\n46 Quality data for Spain (NIEPI and TIEPI) include commercially sensitive information.\n47 Quality data for Spain (NIEPI and TIEPI) include commercially sensitive information.\n48 The value reported for 2021 does not exclude a particular exceptional event (force majeure), as the official confirmation of the data by the regulator was not available at the closing date of reporting for this report.\nCustomer satisfaction\n\nIberdrola uses various mechanisms to measure customer satisfaction levels and to gather customer opinions, verify compliance with its quality standards within the customer service and sales channels, and implement suggestions for improvement. The most significant studies by country are:\n\nIn Spain, in the Wholesale and Retail business, there are various indicators for measuring users\u2019 satisfaction level, including the Detailed Satisfaction Study. Twice a year, it measures overall satisfaction with the service received by the customer and offers detailed information about attributes such as agility, training, and handling of channels, clarity of the invoice, claims management, quality of supply, price competitiveness and electronic billing, whether for large customers, companies, small businesses or residential customers. In 2021, for the seventh consecutive year, overall satisfaction exceeded a score of 7 out of 10.\n\nMost of the studies use the NPS (Net Promoter Score) index, which ranks the recommendations made by Iberdrola\u2019s customers. This index highlights points received for customer service and the use of products and services.\n\nThe company also implemented a Voice of the Customer Measurement Programme, which allows satisfaction surveys to be performed in a transactional manner (immediately following an interaction) at various key times in the customer relationship, while also analysing unstructured information through the use of text analytics. All of the foregoing enables more agile detection of customers\u2019 opinions and the prioritisation and implementation of improvements. This programme measures and analyses factors in the following principal areas:\n\n- Attention to the Telephone Channel\n- Attention to the Points of Attention\n- Attention to the Digital Channels (Web/App)\n- Use of products and services.\n\nRegarding the Networks Business, calls are made periodically to customers who have contacted the company, giving them the opportunity to complete a satisfaction survey about the service that was provided. These results are used for the Customer Satisfaction Index and to detect and resolve problems with the service.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, customer satisfaction is measured by a number of internal and external studies conducted by the Customer Insight department. These analyses include various satisfaction surveys that vary in frequency from monthly to annually.\n\nAt the external level, the key comparative studies measuring the satisfaction of ScottishPower\u2019s customers as compared to its competitors\u2019 customers are USwitch, Which? (with annual surveys) and the UK-CSI study, which is published twice per year. These studies analyse specific areas, such as customer billing, campaign follow-up and complaints. ScottishPower received an overall customer-satisfaction rating of 60.7% in the USwitch survey, improving in the categories of renewable services, energy efficiency, mobile apps and the installation of smart meters. In Which?, it received a score of 55 out of 100, and stood out for the speed of its telephone response. In UK-CSI, its satisfaction indicator rose to 68.1 out of 100.\n\nThe most significant internal analysis is Pulse, which is performed monthly and measures confidence, loyalty, ease of use, value, etc., with the overall satisfaction level in 2021 increasing by 10 out of 100. Based on this analysis, measures are being implemented to improve the handling of customer complaints. In addition, 22,000 customers participated in the TalkEnergy panel, which gathers information on important topics and prepares action plans.\nIn the regulated business, the scores reported in the Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction (BMCS) study conducted by Ofgen (the British electricity market regulator) were used as an indicator to set the regulatory incentive. The index is calculated on the basis of a survey that covers all customers who requested customer service, and takes into consideration various aspects of the service that the customers received. The scores received by the distributors ScottishPower Manweb, ScottishPower Distribution and Energy Networks Transmission in 2021 were 9.24, 9.23 and 8.6 out of 10, respectively.\n\nIn the United States, the subsidiaries of AVANGRID measure perception of the service and customer satisfaction through telephone surveys. In 2021, the AVANGRID companies obtained an overall score of 91.3%: RG&E 91.0%; NYSEG 90.6%; CMP 89.3%; UI 89.0%; CNG 91.9%; SCG 93.0%; and BGC 94.6%.\n\nIn Brazil, the Brazilian Association of Electric Power Distributors (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Distribuidores de Energia El\u00e9trica - ABRADEE) carries out a satisfaction study known as the Perceived Service Quality Satisfaction Index (ISQP) based on an evaluation of performance in the following areas: operational excellence, economic/financial management, customer assessment, social responsibility and management quality. The ISQP is obtained through evaluations made by customers through the surveys administered by Instituto Innovare. Neoenerg\u00eda received a score of 65.7% for overall satisfaction in 2021.\n\nThe ratio of complaints received in the main markets where the company operates is given below.\n\n| Complaints received |\n|---------------------|\n| Number of complaints per 100 customers | 2021 |\n| Spain               | Mercado liberalizado | 1.51 |\n|                     | Mercado regulado     | 1.34 |\n| United Kingdom      | Mercado liberalizado | 6.45 |\n|                     | Mercado regulado     | 0.17 |\n| United States       | Mercado regulado     | 0.02 |\n| Brazil              | Mercado regulado     | 1.82 |\n\n**Responsible communication**\n\n**Marketing communications**\n\nIberdrola goes beyond regulatory compliance in its advertising and marketing communications, and adopts mechanisms and voluntary codes that ensure such communications are transparent and truthful. The *Code of Ethics* also applies in this area for all employees regardless of their area of responsibility.\n\nIberdrola not only complies with applicable advertising practices codes in all locations, but has also implemented internal approval procedures to ensure that all advertising material presented to society is in accordance with responsible advertising practices.\nIncidents of non-compliance concerning marketing, advertising, promotion and sponsorship (No.)\n\n|                        | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Resulting in a fine    | 13   | 15   | 20   |\n| Resulting in a warning | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| Relating to voluntary codes | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| Total incidents        | 13   | 15   | 20   |\n\nThe preceding table lists the incidents that occurred due to non-compliance regarding marketing, advertising, promotion and sponsorship in financial year 2021, in which there were 13 incidents resulting in a fine in Spain.\n\nInformation on and labelling of electricity sold\n\nRegarding labelling, Iberdrola informs its customers about the sourcing of the energy sold by the retailer and its associated environmental impact, generally through its electricity bills and other commercial communications, and always abiding by assurance standards and the format required by the various national agencies (CNMC in Spain, Ofgem in the United Kingdom, ANEEL in Brazil, etc.).\n\nInformation on customer complaint mechanisms and communication channels is included in the \u201cStakeholder engagement\u201d section.\n\nHealth and safety of customers and of the general population\n\nUsers\u2019 safety is of paramount importance to Iberdrola. For this reason, it makes information and training available to the various emergency services and law enforcement services in order to explain the conflicts that they may encounter during the performance of their work and how to act in situations involving electrical risks.\n\nAll stages of the life-cycles of electricity and gas (planning, production activities, transmission and distribution, marketing) are closely regulated because these products are essential to the country\u2019s economy and improve the quality of people\u2019s lives.\n\nAt all stages, alignment with each country\u2019s environmental and labour regulations is essential to minimise possible operational risks (operation of generation plants, electrical risks and risks associated with the handling of gas, etc.). In addition, in the planning and marketing stages, public participation (through social and political representatives) and communication with consumers are two other key factors for protecting public health and safety.\n\nAll processes required for the supply of electricity and gas at all stages as described above ensure that these products arrive at the consumer with an appropriate level of assurance for their health and safety.\nThe following table lists incidents in terms of impacts of products and services on the health and safety of customers. There were 48 incidents in 2021, all in the United States, due primarily to alleged violations of federal safety regulations for facilities.\n\n| GRI 416-2 |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| **Incidents stemming from non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes regarding health and safety (No.)** |\n| 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Resulting in a fine | 42 | 0 | 0 |\n| Resulting in a warning | 6 | 0 | 0 |\n| Relating to voluntary codes | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Total incidents | 48 | 0 | 0 |\n\n| GRI EU25 |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Furthermore, as described above, the construction, operation and maintenance of electric infrastructure involves certain risks, which may at times give rise to incidents affecting people outside of the company. In most of the cases detected, the incidents are related to third parties working without safety measures in the areas around the distribution facilities, as well as accidental contacts with the network. The number increased over the previous year as a result of the easing of restrictions on mobility relating to the pandemic in 2020. |\n| The following table shows the accidents of this kind that occurred during 2021. Nineteen of these accidents (including three deaths) occurred in the United Kingdom; five in Spain (including two deaths); 14 in the United States; and 152 (including 43 deaths) in Brazil. Despite the higher numbers compared with the previous year, significant work has continued in the areas of awareness-raising and training for the general public in order to reduce these numbers as much as possible. |\n\n| Accidents involving persons not belonging to the company (No.) |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Accident victims | 190 | 124 | 186 |\n| Fatalities | 48 | 39 | 72 |\n\nThe claims listed in the following table have been filed against companies of the group on these or other similar grounds not involving injuries and have given rise to legal proceedings in the respective jurisdictions. At year-end 2021, 76 legal proceedings had been resolved or were pending in Spain, 61 in the United States and 97 in Brazil.\n\n| Annual legal proceedings (No.) |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Resolved and pending, stemming from these accidents | 234 | 212 | 245 |\nElectromagnetic fields\n\nHistorically, the possible influence of electrical and magnetic fields on human health has been the subject of a certain amount of public debate. However, the various studies performed in this regard have identified no detrimental effects on human health for the maximum emission figures established by applicable law. Iberdrola, following the precautionary principle, applies the rules in this regard and has shown itself willing to work with the public authorities in adopting such preventive or mitigating measures as may be deemed appropriate to avoid risks or harm to health.\n\nOnly one appeal relating to health impacts was received in 2021. The appeal in question was received in the United States regarding a ruling of the Public Utilities Commission of Maine on the possible use of smart meters. The appellants allege potential health effects resulting from electromagnetic and radio-frequency exposure that these meters may produce. The Maine Public Utilities Commission has approved the use of these meters, but this ruling was appealed, which appeal should be decided during 2022.\n\nEducation on the safe use of electricity\n\nTo ensure consumers\u2019 health and safety, it is very important to inform them of and educate them on safety guidelines for using electricity.\n\nIberdrola thus uses the group\u2019s websites to provide recommendations and information to consumers on the safe use of electricity and gas, as well as guidelines to follow in case of an electrical accident. It also publishes informational booklets on the potential risks of electricity that affect its proper use and promotes informational and educational campaigns on safety measures and energy savings for the general public.\n\nDepending on the location and its level of exposure to adverse weather conditions or other external contingencies, Iberdrola also provides information and recommendations on actions to take in the event of an emergency.\nIII.3. Contribution to the well-being of our communities\n\n- Access to energy\n- Protection of human rights\n- Support to local communities\n- Contributions to society\n- Foundations\n- Iberdrola and the Global Compact\nAccess to energy\n\nThe Sustainable Development Policy approved by the company\u2019s Board of Directors embraces the promotion of universal access to the power supply, with environmentally sustainable, economically assumable and socially inclusive models, as a basic principle of conduct in the creation of sustainable value. In addition, it attends to customers who are economically disadvantaged or in any other situation of vulnerability, establishing specific procedures of protection and collaborating in providing ongoing access to electric power and gas supply according to the policies established by the competent government authorities in each case.\n\nAccess to energy for off-grid customers\n\nThe companies of the Neoenergia group have continued to develop rural electrification programmes, undertaken jointly with government authorities, as an instrument for the social inclusion and development of rural homes not served by electric utilities. In 2021, the funds allocated to these programmes totalled 51 million euros (326 million Brazilian reais) in consolidated terms for the group.\n\nGlobally, Iberdrola has launched the Electricity for All Programme in response to the call of the international community to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. Iberdrola has set the ambitious goal of providing electricity to 16 million persons who currently lack it by 2030.\n\nFor more information, see the Electricity for All Programme section of the corporate website.\n\nAccess for vulnerable customers\n\nThe companies of the group have procedures to protect customers at risk of exclusion or in vulnerable situations so as to facilitate access for the most disadvantaged groups: Iberdrola\u2019s measures in this regard include a lengthening of collection periods and making payment terms more flexible, so as to prevent the suspension of electric and/or gas supply due to non-payment of bills by users who are economically disadvantaged or who have been declared vulnerable due to reasons of age, health, disability or other serious reasons. In some countries such as Spain (with a subsidised electricity rate, called the Bono Social de Electricidad) and Brazil, there is a special, differentiated rate for low-income customers, offering them advantageous prices and special terms.\n\nInitiatives to improve the access of vulnerable customers and communities to electricity\n\n| Country   | Initiative                                                                 |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Spain     | Subsidised Rate (Bono Social), agreements with the regional governments to avoid the suspension of service for vulnerable customers. |\n| United Kingdom | War Home Discount                                                        |\n| United States | Government Energy Assistance Programs, and Hardship & Low Income Program |\n|            | Hardship & Low Income Programme (company-sponsored)                      |\n| Brazil    | Subsidised Electricity Rate (Tarifa Social de Energia El\u00e9ctrica)          |\n| Italy     | Subsidised Rate (Bono Social)                                             |\nInformation regarding disconnections and subsequent reconnections in accordance with the Electric Utilities Sector Supplement of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is shown in the following table:\n\n| GRI | EU27 | SASB | IF-EU-240a.3 |\n|-----|------|------|--------------|\n|     |      |      |              |\n\n### Residential disconnections (no.)\n\n|                        | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Paid up to 48 h after disconnection | 958,886 | 779,851 | 1,185,356 |\n| Paid between 48 h and one week after disconnection | 155,758 | 120,257 | 211,859 |\n| Paid between one week and one month after disconnection | 212,944 | 164,689 | 229,173 |\n| Paid between one month and one year | 199,878 | 131,316 | 195,071 |\n| Paid after more than one year | 15 | 91 | 26 |\n| Outstanding and unclassified | 5,958 | 17,267 | 107,337 |\n| **Iberdrola total** | **1,533,439** | **1,213,471** | **1,928,822** |\n\nIn 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, service shutdowns for non-payment were suspended before gradually resuming in 2021.\n\n### Residential reconnections following payment of unpaid bills (No.)\n\n|                        | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Less than 24 h after payment | 1,213,785 | 996,700 | 1,575,039 |\n| Between 24 h and one week after payment | 184,014 | 111,383 | 146,630 |\n| More than one week after payment | 89,025 | 97,078 | 125,925 |\n| Unclassified | 5,582 | 14,020 | 84,719 |\n| **Iberdrola total** | **1,492,406** | **1,219,181** | **1,932,313** |\n\n### Iberdrola\u2019s commitment to human rights\n\nThe group has a firm commitment to the defence of human rights, and has a set of tools that ensure and promote the protection of and respect for people, in order to prevent, mitigate and redress any possible impact on human rights. The company\u2019s practices are thus in line with the principles underlying the United Nations Global Compact; the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d Framework (the UNGP), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; the Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises; the Social Policy of the International Labour Organization; and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nIberdrola\u2019s Policy on Respect for Human Rights approved by the Board of Directors in 2015 and last updated in April 2021, sets out mandatory principles for all professionals of the group, regardless of where they work. The company has made the following commitments, among others:\n\u2022 To respect the human and labour rights recognised in domestic and international law, as well as comply with international standards in those countries in which human rights legislation has not reached an adequate level of development.\n\n\u2022 To reject child labour and forced or compulsory labour or any other form of modern slavery and to respect freedom of association and collective bargaining, as well as non-discrimination, the freedom of movement within each country, and the rights of ethnic minorities and of indigenous peoples in the places in which it carries out its activities.\n\n\u2022 To advance a culture of respect for human rights and promote awareness-raising in this field among its professionals at all companies within the group, and especially at those where there may be a higher risk of violation of such rights.\n\nIt has also defined its overall human rights due diligence framework with the aim of better integrating all issues relating to human rights into a single comprehensive due diligence system.\n\nThe human rights risk map was updated this year by prestigious independent external specialists in this field in order to identify the main risks in the countries in which the group has operations, as well as in those countries in which it purchases supplies. The advisors used their own methodology to prepare this risk map based on the Global Human Rights Risk Index (GHRRI) of Business & Human Rights (BHR), which, unlike other generic indices on the market, allows the risks specific to the energy sector to be weighted. The index is supplemented with the particular characteristics of Iberdrola\u2019s activities, providing results more closely aligned with the company\u2019s profile.\n\nAccording to the result of the analysis of human rights risks at the 246 main locations of operation (100% of the main locations), none of these locations presents risks relating to collective bargaining, forced labour or child labour.\n\nHowever, some locations in the United States, Brazil, Mexico and Greece (150, or 61%) present possible risks in one or more of the following human rights issues: labour conditions; environmental impact; occupational safety and health; public safety; indigenous peoples; and lands and property.\n\n**Human rights due diligence system**\n\nIberdrola has defined its human rights expectations for its various Stakeholders: employees, suppliers and investment partners, requiring them to strictly respect human and labour rights recognised in domestic and international law in the conduct of their activities.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s Human Rights Due Diligence System seeks to promote the implementation of the Guiding Principles (Principle 18.a of the UNGPs) adjusted for the size of the company and the diversity and particularities of the facilities in the various countries.\n\nThis is illustrated in the following diagram:\nIn summary, the methodology applied adopts the recommendations of the UNGP at three successive levels of refinement and depth in the identification of human rights impacts:\n\n1. **Potential impacts** for the industry, affected by country risk (principle 17). In the specific case of the utilities sector in which Iberdrola operates, the following potential impacts are identified:\n   - Ethics and integrity: corruption, responsible taxation.\n   - Impact on local communities: universal access to energy, natural resources, land and housing, cultural heritage, public health, security, slave labour.\n   - Environmental impact: environmental safety, water availability and management, waste management, biodiversity, climate change and decarbonisation.\n   - Labour practices: diversity, equality, discrimination, labour relations and labour rights.\n   - Innovation and new technologies: cybersecurity and data protection.\n   - Operation of facilities and business essentials: opening of new facilities and facility closures, facility operations and safety, subcontractor issues, anti-competitive practices, consumer rights.\n\n2. **Significant impacts** for the company, based on the severity, possibility of remediation and linkage of impacts (principle 19.b). The main relevant human rights issues according to our Stakeholders are:\n   - Labour practices.\n   - Impact on local communities and the rights of indigenous peoples.\n   - Cybersecurity and information privacy.\n   - Citizen insecurity and labour practices in the hiring of security services.\n\n3. **Priority impacts** for the Action Plan, giving preference to the elimination of due diligence gaps, if any (principle 19.a). Progress on the necessary improvement measures detected through the human rights due diligence system is detailed below.\nComplaint and grievance mechanisms\n\nIberdrola has the channels necessary for affected persons to contact the company directly and report their concerns, complaints or grievances relating to impacts on local communities, employees, suppliers or any other Stakeholder. And in order to facilitate access to mechanisms of remediation for victims (third pillar of the Ruggie Framework), the complaint and claim mechanisms were updated in 2020 and a procedure for formalising the classification, monitoring and control of complaints and grievances was drawn up.\n\nThe information related to human rights complaints and grievances received in the area of Compliance are described in the chapter on Ethics and Integrity; those relating to Human Resources and Legal Services in indicator GRI 406-1, those relating the Environment are reported in the chapter on the Environment and in the section on Contribution to the well-being of our communities; those involving Cybersecurity and information privacy in indicator GRI 418-1 and, lastly, those involving Socioeconomic compliance in indicator GRI 419-1.\n\nExamples of remedial actions carried out during the year are listed in the \u201cPopulation displacement management\u201d, \u201cSocial impact assessments\u201d, \u201cDevelopment programmes for local communities\u201d, etc.\n\nProgress and results\n\nFollowing the human rights due diligence analysis in 2021, the company worked on the improvement opportunities that were detected. The gap analysis, together with the review and update of the ad hoc risk map for the company\u2019s business activity, sets out the process for prioritising actions to prevent and mitigate possible impacts. Specifically, the focus has been on the following:\n\n- The human rights risk map was prepared by an independent third party. In the short term, the information obtained will be used for the company\u2019s ongoing due diligence processes and, if necessary, new management mechanisms will be activated. This action is part of the commitment to periodically update the risk analysis as required by the UNGP.\n\n- After developing a guide with recommendations at the group level for holding public consultations with local communities following the recommendations of the UNGP, in 2021 a digital tool was designed and developed at the group level to manage and document these public consultations. The aim is to facilitate the management, mitigation and remediation of any potential impact on the communities in the vicinity of Iberdrola\u2019s operations.\n\n- The strengthening of external communication on issues relating to respect for human rights, through the creation of a new section on the corporate website.\n\n- The human rights due diligence system \u2014 underpinned by the 360\u00ba supplier monitoring system, among others \u2014 detected the risk of a potential impact on the supply chain, specifically in China\u2019s Xinjiang region. Consequently, Iberdrola has taken proactive measures, requiring that its suppliers of components for photovoltaic plants scrupulously comply with the commitments they have signed and requesting extraordinary measures to ensure the non-use of forced labour in their supply chain (more detailed information can be found in Supplier social assessment section).\nMain significant human rights issues for our Stakeholders\n\nBelow are examples of how Iberdrola is managing specific human rights issues that are significant for its Stakeholders.\n\nLabour practices\n\nNon-discrimination was an issue that was particularly significant for Stakeholders in this regard.\n\nGRI 406\n\nThe principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunity applied within the Iberdrola group are set out in both the Code of Ethics and the global policies and procedures approved and implemented (Human Resources Framework Policy, Recruitment and Selection Policy, Equal Opportunity and Reconciliation Policy, Equality Diversity and Inclusion Policy) and they are intended to avoid any discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity, age, origin, race, colour, language, religion, political opinion, social status, belonging to an indigenous community, disability, health, marital status, pregnancy, sexual orientation or other personal circumstances unrelated to requirements for performing one\u2019s job.\n\nIn addition, specific plans and policies are in place in each country to ensure that the most relevant challenges are addressed at the local level (policies to prevent discrimination against any type of group, harassment prevention policies, etc.).\n\nGroup employees can report behaviour that may constitute labour discrimination both through the ethics mailbox and through their respective supervisors or Human Resources.\n\nThe group received 29 grievances regarding labour discrimination through the various channels in 2021, Thirteen are being reviewed and the other 16 have already been closed. Of the grievances already closed, one ended in a written warning and three ended in dismissals as a result of improper action relating to human rights. In addition, three complaints were received in Spain concerning the right to organise. The Human Resources area is in charge of taking the appropriate disciplinary action.\n\nGRI 406-1\n\nIncidents of discrimination reported (no.)\n\n|                | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| Iberdrola total| 29   | 34   | 33   |\nIberdrola has not received any complaint through the Legal Services channels in regarding other human rights issues in 2021, nor is it aware of court claims that could have a specific social impact.\n\nImpact on local communities and the rights of indigenous peoples\n\nIn applying the Code of Ethics and the corporate policies (especially the Policy on Respect for Human Rights), Iberdrola and its employees commit to respect both ethnic minorities and the internationally recognised rights of indigenous peoples, in accordance with applicable law and the obligations set out in Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\nPresence of the company in indigenous territory, incidents and projects implemented\n\nThe company, with a presence in four countries where there are indigenous communities (Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Australia) encourages business activities to be carried out with respect for different cultural identities, traditions and environmental wealth, as many times these communities depend on natural resources for their subsistence. Therefore, it has channels of dialogue with these communities and their representatives, as well as for the participation of the government, in order to report on the projects with due transparency and integrity. However, as there may occasionally be direct or indirect impacts on these communities at some facilities, the company endeavours to promote ethical practices with the goal of preventing conflicts and generating mutual benefit, which in the long term is the foundation of social value.\n\nFacilities in territories held by indigenous communities are listed below:\n\n| Country | Facility | Indigenous community |\n|---------|----------|----------------------|\n| Mexico  | Topolobambo II combined cycle | In the Ahome municipality: El Chalate, Juricahui, Bajada de San Miguel, Nuevo San Miguel, San Miguel Zapotitl\u00e1n, Zapotillo Uno, Choacahui and La Tea.

The lawsuit relating to the Truk\u00e1 community was filed in 2021. During the reporting period, the action regarding the Kiriris indigenous people was adjudicated. It is now in the appeal stage. The other two actions are in the investigatory phase, awaiting judgement.\nIn the United States, an appeal was filed relating to the Lund Hill solar project water permit in 2020 by the Confederated Tribes of the Yakama Nation. After the appeal was dismissed by the competent authorities, the matter was resolved in 2021.\n\nProjects in indigenous territories are described below:\n\nIn the United States, the following actions were taken with regard to projects under construction in the state of Oregon, pursuant to the requirements of the Oregon Energy Facility: At the Golden Hills wind farm, at the request of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the certificate for the specific type of pylons used at the site was delivered; and at the Bakeoven photovoltaic park, at the request of the Warm Springs Confederated Tribes, the fulfilment of all the settlement requirements at the site was verified.\n\nRegarding solar projects under development, also in the United States, the following actions have been carried out: work is under way with the Yakama Indian Nation to detect issues that might affect the traditional cultural territories in the vicinity of the Bluebird photovoltaic park; actions have also been carried out with respect to the Badger Mountain project with the Yakama Indian Nation and the Colville Tribe, as well as the Tower Road project with the Yakama Indian Nation and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation.\n\nIn Mexico, the \u201cLuces de Esperanza\u201d (Lights of Hope) project is being developed with indigenous communities, offering solar power electrification solutions to rural communities without electricity in Huasteca Potosina, San Juan Guichicovi and Mat\u00edas Romero. In 2021, more than 400 persons benefited, and 100 stage-2 houses in Oaxaca were electrified. And in the rural communities of the Huesteca Potosina, more than 700 people benefited from the electrification of 99 homes and a health centre serving 36 communities.\n\nIncidents detected relating to indigenous employees\n\nThere were no incidents relating to the violation of the rights of employees from indigenous communities in the group during 2021.\n\nCitizen insecurity and labour practices in the hiring of security services\n\nGRI 410\n\nThe Security Policy approved by Iberdrola\u2019s Board of Directors and the specific procedures adopted by the Corporate Security Division for each situation and country are compatible both with international human rights standards and the laws of the countries where the company is present.\n\nThe protocols of conduct have been defined and implemented in all activities and services provided by the Corporate Security Division, with a Quality Management System that has been certified since 2003 under ISO 9001 and externally reviewed each year by AENOR in the countries where it has been implemented in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of this standard, as well as with the standards of the management system.\n\nSecurity and monitoring services providers are hired in accordance with the Purchasing Policy, model and procedures in effect. The Corporate Security Division is responsible for setting the technical specifications and standards to be met by such suppliers in order to be hired, in terms of physical security, resources, training and cybersecurity, as well as the assessment thereof during the performance of their contract. This assessment is performed annually in order to identify areas for improvement.\n\nBoth the company\u2019s personnel and that of subcontractors are qualified for their duties and enhance their knowledge through a rigorous Training Plan, which is continually assessed and monitored. It should be noted, however, that training has been more limited and protracted due to the pandemic.\nSecurity personnel trained in human rights\n\n|                      | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| **Own personnel**    |      |      |      |\n| Own personnel (No.)  | 194  | 187  | 155  |\n| Own personnel trained in human rights (No.) | 150 | 175 | 149 |\n| Own personnel trained in human rights (%) | 77.3 | 93.6 | 96.1 |\n| **Subcontracted personnel** |      |      |      |\n| Subcontracted personnel (No.) | 1,166 | 1,228 | 1,353 |\n| Subcontracted personnel trained in human rights (No.) | 850 | 865 | 837 |\n| Subcontracted personnel trained in human rights (%) | 72.9 | 70.4 | 61.9 |\n\nEmployee training on human rights\n\nDue to the importance that respect for human rights has for the company, it has various training initiatives to inform the entire organisation of the social and labour rights affecting the activities of the company and to train all employees on risk prevention in its operations, on mitigation and on the remediation of any violation of human rights.\n\nEmployee training on human rights (h)\\(^{49}\\)\n\n|                      | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Spain                | 138,450 | 124,991 | 106,570 |\n| United Kingdom       | 70,717 | 83,795 | 90,232 |\n| United States        | 116,212 | 69,952 | 109,570 |\n| Brazil               | 291,817 | 206,389 | 187,179 |\n| Mexico               | 40,061 | 395 | 28,387 |\n| IEI                  | 5,675 | 119 | 1772 |\n| **Iberdrola total**  | 662,932 | 485,641 | 523,710 |\n\nIberdrola continues to act as a lever to promote respect for human rights in its supply chain, for which purpose it has developed an awareness-raising module regarding respect for human rights aimed at suppliers.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{49}\\) Number of Full Time Equivalents (FTEs): 35,120 in financial year 2019, 36,915 in financial year 2020 and 39,788 in financial year 2021.\nSupport to local communities\n\nDevelopment programmes for local communities\n\nIberdrola takes various types of actions to minimise, mitigate and offset any socioeconomic impacts caused by its facilities. These actions are usually established by and agreed on with local authorities and with various Stakeholders, including the protection of biodiversity and recovery of spaces, improvements in communication infrastructure, water supply or roadways, public lighting, creation of direct and indirect employment, professional training courses and activities to support entrepreneurs. The above is in addition to engaging in various sponsorship and patronage activities.\n\nSocial impact assessments\n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment studies prior to the construction of facilities include a Social Impact Assessment in accordance with current law in each of the countries, and must be approved by the competent public authorities. In countries with indigenous communities, a Social Impact Study specific to these communities is always included.\n\nThese evaluations include an analysis of potential impacts on human rights, such as the right to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, through an evaluation of the natural environment (including assessments of the environmental impacts of such factors as emissions, leaks, waste, fires, effects on local biodiversity, changes in land use, changes in the aesthetics and quality of the landscape, restricted access to water and forest resources, etc.). Regarding the fundamental right to enjoy a social and international order or an adequate standard of living, an evaluation of the social and economic environment is also carried out on demographic aspects such as population changes in nearby municipalities; their historical and cultural heritage; increased demands for jobs in certain sectors; and the deterioration or development of basic infrastructure elements, such as roads or railroad networks, etc.\n\nApplicable law ensures consultation with and the participation of both the interested parties and the government administrations during the performance of these impact studies, and part of the project documentation is subject to public review for a period of time that varies according to applicable law in each country. In addition, the Iberdrola group has implemented the Stakeholders Relations Model as well as the Recommendations Guide for Conducting Public Consultations. The viewpoints of the Stakeholders consulted will thus be taken into account in defining the future project.\n\nThese impact studies include the preventive and corrective or compensatory measures required to mitigate the issues identified. Almost 100% of the company\u2019s main locations of operation are thus subject to these types of activities, focused on meeting the needs of its Stakeholders, especially in local communities, and on conducting the most appropriate activities in all areas that most directly affect them.\nConsultation processes with local communities\n\nIn order to better manage and mitigate the impact on the communities in which the group has a presence, operating procedures were reviewed last year to ensure that the public consultation processes were in line with UNGP recommendations. To facilitate the inclusion of these recommendations in formal procedures, a *Guideline for the implementation of good practices* in the relationship with local communities was prepared along with a medium-term plan for its implementation.\n\nA digital tool for the documentary management of the consultations in the communities was designed and developed in 2021 for the implementation of the guideline. Together with the monitoring of the *Recommendations Guide for Conducting Public Consultations* in all of the stages of the useful life of the sites, this will ensure that consultations are better managed and documented, thus making it possible to efficiently monitor the steps set forth in the action, mitigation and remediation plans with respect to any impact in the vicinity of the facilities.\n\nThe objective is to launch this tool throughout the group. This year it was presented in all the countries, and was launched in Mexico in order to test its effectiveness.\n\nEnergy planning (energy sources, technology and long-term needs) is carried out by governmental authorities; this is the institutional area in which the various Stakeholders can participate in accordance with the mechanisms established in each country. Once the most appropriate infrastructure is selected, the viewpoints of the affected communities are taken into account through consultation processes, which vary depending on the country and the type of facility.\n\nIn addition, during the development phase of each project, relations are established with local authorities, communities and any other groups that may be relevant to the project, and dialogue channels are established with the main Stakeholders.\n\nFurthermore, there are channels in the Environmental Management System allowing Stakeholders to send their concerns, complaints, requests for information or any other kind of request to minimise impacts in the area.\n\nSet out below are the most significant examples from all of the activities conducted by Iberdrola in this field for projects currently under development:\n\nIn Spain, the Iberdrola Renovables group, from the initial awarding of a new project (whether wind or photovoltaic), informs the various Stakeholders of the development of the project and of the benefits that the new infrastructures as well as its operation entail. To this end, meetings are held with municipalities and residents. Communities also benefit from the compensatory measures established and agreed with the local authorities. Local Development Programmes have been carried out at the main locations of operation, including the promotion of activities such as livestock raising and beekeeping and contributions to local employment (agrovoltaics) in order to preserve biodiversity and foster the circular economy.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, all proposals on new onshore wind farms and on the repowering of existing wind farms undergo a broad consultation process in which ScottishPower participates with local residents, communities and other Stakeholders. Various rounds of consultation are conducted in the development phase and as the project moves forward, in which the relevant information is shared, including blueprints, visualizations, environmental information, etc. The project team attends these sessions, which are announced in the local press, with informational brochures being distributed.\n\nIn Brazil, the Caeti\u00e9 wind plant has been developed. This included drafting and implementing a *Stakeholder Commitment Plan*, as well as implementing an *Action Plan for the Socio-economic Environment*, in accordance with the Ecuador Principles. One example includes the *Social Communication and Environmental Education Programmes*, carried out with the local communities. In 2021, three environmental education courses were prepared in the areas of influence of the Caetit\u00e9s Complex, in order to train instructors in environmental practices.\nIn the United States, social evaluations within the context of project permits (with regard to community development and other impacts) are usually included in due diligence procedures and project permitting during the planning and development stages. Some of the impact studies conducted in 2021 were for the Camino Solar Project in California, the St. Croix Valley Solar Project in Wisconsin, the Tower Road Solar Project in Oregon, the Mohawk Solar Project in New York and the Powell Creek Solar project in Ohio.\n\nIn Mexico, the renewables business conducted social impact studies at the Cuyoaco Photovoltaic Plant. In addition, social-welfare contributions were also made to the communities located near the projects \u2013 specifically, to local authorities for application of social-welfare contributions at infrastructure works that benefit and affect the areas of education, the environment, culture, sports, health, and the infrastructure of the communities.\n\nManagement of population displacements\n\nDuring the planning phase for new projects, Iberdrola evaluates the land that will potentially be occupied, choosing the land that involves the least displacement of people who either reside in the immediate area or whose economic activities will be affected. In the event of displacement, Iberdrola and the relevant government authorities review the economic, environmental and social consequences of the projects, and jointly hold consultations with the local communities to adopt suitable corrective measures. In addition, in the case of indigenous communities, pathways of dialogue are established with the participation of the government and of various organisations representing these communities, to report on the projects with the required transparency and integrity.\n\nIn the construction of the T\u00e2mega hydroelectric complex (Portugal), detailed socio-economic studies have been conducted for several years on the possible affected dwellings. A prior assessment has been conducted, taking into account the needs of each of them and examining possible relocations to houses with similar characteristics. A total of 59 dwellings were ultimately identified, of which only 50% were permanent residences. The identification of displacements as necessary and the respective financial compensation have been made in accordance with the law on expropriations in Portugal and the methodology implemented regarding the management and definition of displacements and potential economic damages. In addition, in partnership with the Portuguese government and the municipalities, as approved in the Socio-economic Action Plan, financial compensation of 1.4 million euros was determined in addition to the compensation provided in the expropriation process, making it possible to improve the relocation conditions of the affected families and maintain their customs and traditions. Until 2021, 51 dwellings had been relocated, 39 during that year, when the Daiv\u00f5es reservoir was filled. In 2022 and 2023, another eight families were relocated, when the Alto T\u00e2mega reservoir was filled. To date, \u20ac0.5 million of the \u20ac1.4 million approved in the Economic Compensation Plan has been paid.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the development of the East Anglia One, One North and East Anglia Two offshore wind farms has caused 74 displacements of economic activity, for which financial compensation has been provided. In addition, the annual geotechnical and geophysical campaigns in the East Anglia One North, East Anglia Two and East Anglia Three projects have affected 60 fishermen (71 boats), for which financial compensation has also been provided.\nContributions to society\n\nIberdrola has selected the Business for Societal Impact B4SI model to measure and assess business contributions to the community due to its broad international recognition. It is considered the most highly valued standard for measuring the results and impacts of social programmes, both for the company and for the community. This standard only recognises projects that involve voluntary contributions for social or environmental protection ends, for non-profit purposes, and that are not restricted to groups related to the company.\n\nIberdrola has used the model as a basis to report its contributions to society in 2021.\n\n### Contribution to the community in 2021 (\u20ac)\n\n| By category                        | \u20ac       |\n|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Specific contributions             | 6,514,325 |\n| Community investment               | 40,517,080 |\n| Initiative aligned with the business | 7,731,630 |\n| Management costs                   | 3,353,290 |\n\n| By type of contribution            | \u20ac       |\n|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Cash contributions<sup>50</sup>    | 53,987,144 |\n| Staff time                         | 259,557  |\n| In-kind contributions              | 516,333  |\n| Management costs                   | 3,353,290 |\n\n| By area of contribution            | \u20ac       |\n|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Socioeconomic development of the community | 8,495,569 |\n| Energy sustainability              | 13,488,243 |\n| Art and culture                    | 4,029,321 |\n| Education and training             | 7,197,209 |\n| Cooperation and community service  | 15,711,003 |\n| Other                              | 5,841,690 |\n| **Total**                          | **58,116,325** |\n\n<sup>50</sup> Contributions made mostly to non-profit organisations and foundations but also to universities, government administrations, etc., provided that they meet the aforementioned B4SI Model standards.\nFoundations\n\nScottishPower Foundation, AVANGRID Foundation, Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola M\u00e9xico, Instituto Neoenerg\u00eda y Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a; represent Iberdrola\u2019s commitment to the sustainable development of the countries in which it does business. Pursuant to the Master Plan, the foundations have updated their mission, vision and values to include the contribution to the SDGs among their purposes and principles.\n\nIberdrola uses various indicators to measure the results achieved through its community support programmes.\n\nTraining and Research Area\n\nThis work area focuses on young students, supporting their undergraduate, technical or language studies and providing opportunities for those with fewer resources and/or disabilities. It also includes calls for assistance for research, including the launch of the new international Energy for Future programme for young researchers in the energy sector. There are also research grants and scholarships in restoration and conservation in partnership with prestigious museums, such as the Museo del Prado and the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum. These initiatives contribute to the attainment of specific objectives of SDG 4: Quality Education.\n\nA Green Economy programme \u2013 Programa Inspira \u2013 has been relaunched in Castile-La Mancha, in order for young people between 16 and 30 years of age at risk of exclusion to resume their studies.\n\nIn addition, in partnership with various universities, Iberdrola is promoting the representation of women in STEM careers in all of the countries where it is present.\nBiodiversity and Climate Change Area: conservation of birds, habitats and ecosystems\n\nThis work area partners with public institutions and entities devoted to the protection of the environment and birdlife, contributing to the achievement of the specific objectives of SDG 13: Climate action, and 15: Life on Land. Among other initiatives, Iberdrola supports habitat conservation work, such as through its Campos de Tiro Militar reforestation programme in Spain, called \"Forest Defence-Iberdrola\", where more than 60 hectares have been reforested in less than three years. In addition, Iberdrola is carrying out multi-annual cooperation efforts with SEO Birdlife and supporting land and marine habitats through the projects being carried out at the foundations in Scotland (restoration of seagrass and oysters), Brazil (coral restoration), the United States (river water conservation) and Mexico (conservation of the Ca\u00f1\u00f3n de Fern\u00e1ndez).\n\nArt and Culture Area: programmes for lighting, restoration and support to museums\n\nThis area partners with cultural entities, prestigious museums, public institutions and religious entities to promote culture, as well as to restore and preserve the artistic heritage, favouring local development. These actions directly impact Goals 8: Economic growth, and 11: Sustainable cities and communities.\n\nThere are two very important sections within this area. Through the lighting programme, lighting interventions are carried out with respect to important historic-artistic heritage sites in order to foster local development and sustainable tourism. The lighting projects include those at the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, the Guadalupe Monastery, the Salamanca Cathedral, and the Madrid Supreme Court. In addition, the restoration programme helps conserve and preserve the artistic and cultural heritage. Numerous restorations have been carried out with the Museo Nacional del Prado and the Museum of Fine Arts of Bilbao.\n\nAt all of the foundations, workshops, programmes and free visits also provided to promote culture and create new and exciting learning opportunities.\n\nSocial Action Area\n\nThis work area partners with non-profit organisations, foundations and development agencies to promote social and humanitarian projects aimed at the most vulnerable people and that contribute to achieving the specific objectives of SDGs 1: End poverty; 3: Good health and well-being; 5: Gender equality; 7: Affordable and clean energy; and 10: Reduced inequalities.\n\nThe Social Programme of the Foundations is implemented in five countries with the support of projects that promote overcoming child poverty, supporting the inclusion of people with disabilities, improving the quality of life of persons who are seriously ill and supporting women, always prioritising attention to the most vulnerable groups. The more significant partnerships include: Down Syndrome Foundation, Proyecto Hombre, Ciudad Joven, Ayuda en Acci\u00f3n, Save the Children, Upacesur.\n\nIn addition to the social programmes, Fundaci\u00f3n Iberdrola M\u00e9xico is carrying out a multi-year project named \"Urological Brigades\" to contribute to the well-being of low-income women who have complex urological problems by providing them with surgery.\nIberdrola and the Global Compact\n\nIberdrola has been a member of the Global Compact since 2002, when it made the commitment to support, promote and disseminate its ten principles regarding human rights, labour practices, the environment and the fight against corruption, both internally and within its area of influence, as well as its commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and disseminating them at the various communities in which it operates. The company has continued to further develop the policies proposed by the Compact, which it has made public through its annual Statement of Non-Financial Information and its corporate website.\n\nSince 2004, the company has belonged to the Red Espa\u00f1ola del Pacto Mundial (Spanish Global Compact Network) as a founding member, and has prepared progress reports on compliance with the principles of the Compact, which are publicly available on the website of the Red Espa\u00f1ola del Pacto Mundial and on the UN Global Compact.\n\nIn 2021, Iberdrola took the following actions in connection with the Global Compact:\n\n- Submission of the Progress Report 2020 on compliance with the principles of the Compact, rated at the highest level for this type of report (\u201cGC Advanced\u201d).\n- Attendance at the 2021 General Assembly of the Red Espa\u00f1ola.\n- The company was identified as a LEAD company for its high levels of commitment as Participants in the United Nations Global Compact, and was the only Spanish company to have received this recognition.\n- Active participation in the main platforms and initiatives at the global level, including:\n  - The climate action platform (\u201cCaring for Climate\u201d), in which Iberdrola has been a main partner since its creation.\n  - The Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C in support of the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.\n  - Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), with approved targets in line with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario and committed to achieving net-zero emissions.\n  - The CEO Water Mandate initiative to encourage sustainable practices in the use of water.\n  - Iberdrola is a signatory to the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles, which aim to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in the workplace, marketplace and community.\n- In addition, within the framework of the milestones of the multilateral agenda, the following activities should be noted:\n  - Very active involvement in the preparation of the United Nations High-Level Dialogue on Energy, both at the technical level as a member of the Finance and Investment group and through participation in ministerial events.\n  - The Chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Gal\u00e1n, took part in the Caring for Climate high-level panel, which took place at COP 26, as well as in several events in support of the climate ambition within the framework of the United Nations General Assembly. He was accompanied by business, multilateral agency and government leaders.\n  - The Chairman of Iberdrola participated in the 2021 United Nations Global Compact\u2013Accenture CEO Study on Sustainability\n\nIn 2022 Iberdrola will continue to actively participate in the activities of the Red Espa\u00f1ola del Pacto Mundial in a manner similar to the past years.\nIV.

Good governance, transparency and Stakeholder engagement\n\n- Corporate governance\n- Ethics and integrity\n- Public policies\n- Stakeholder engagement\n- Fiscal responsibility\n- Competition\n- Public policies\n- Cybersecurity and information privacy\n- Socioeconomic compliance\nCorporate governance\n\nThe Governance and Sustainability System constitutes the internal regulation of Iberdrola and its group. Within this system, the block on corporate governance includes best practices and positions Iberdrola a leader in this area. The corporate governance rules of the decision-making bodies and internal committees establish their rules of operation, always in line with the highest international standards and focused on the best compliance with and implementation of the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group.\n\nAn independent and plural Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors focuses its activity on defining and supervising the general guidelines by addressing, inter alia, the following matters: (i) establishing the group\u2019s policies and strategies and (ii) supervising the general development of the policies, strategies and guidelines by the country subholding companies and by the head of business companies.\n\nFor more detailed information regarding the composition, operation and activities carried out by the governance bodies of the Company, see the Activities Report of the Board of Directors and of the Committees thereof. This Report describes issues of crucial interest dealt with during the year.\n\nA brief description of the composition and activities of the committees of the Board of Directors can be found in section C.2.1. of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.\n\nSelection and nomination of the members of the highest governance body\n\nThe appointment, re-election and removal of directors is within the purview of the shareholders at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\n\nVacancies that occur may be filled by the Board of Directors on an interim basis until the next General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, whereat the shareholders confirm the appointments or elect the persons who should replace directors who are not ratified, or the vacant positions are withdrawn.\n\nTo this end, the Board of Directors Diversity and Member Selection Policy ensures that proposals for the appointment of directors are based on a prior and objective analysis of the needs of the Board of Directors. The Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy also contains principles and guidelines that must be taken into account for these purposes.\n\nA Board of Directors made up of 14 directors, with a diversity of nationalities and professional profiles.\nThe Appointments Committee advises the Board of Directors regarding the most appropriate configuration of such body and on aspects like the size of and balance among the various classes of directors existing at any time and the personal and professional requirements that the candidates must fulfil. For such purpose, the Committee reviews the structure of each body on a regular basis. Independent directors are appointed on the basis of a proposal of the Appointments Committee, while the other appointments require a report of such Committee.\n\nIn any event, the Board of Directors, and the Appointments Committee within the scope of its powers, will endeavour to ensure that the candidates submitted to the shareholders at a General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting for appointment or re-election as directors, as well as the directors appointed directly to fill vacancies in the exercise of the power of the Board of Directors to make interim appointments, are respectable and qualified persons, widely recognised for their expertise, competence, experience, qualifications, training, availability and commitment to their duties.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors must be irreproachable professionals, whose professional conduct and background are aligned with the principles set forth in the Code of Ethics and with the corporate values contained in the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group.\n\nIf the Board of Directors deviates from the proposals and reports of the Appointments Committee, it shall give reasons for so acting and shall record such reasons in the minutes.\n\nIn addition, the selection of candidates shall endeavour to ensure that the composition of the Board of Directors is diverse in the broadest sense and balanced as a whole, such that decision-making is enriched and multiple viewpoints are contributed to the discussion of the matters within its purview. To this end, the selection process shall promote a search for diverse candidates with knowledge and experience in the various countries in which the group does or will engage in activities. The directors must also have sufficient knowledge of the Spanish and English languages to be able to perform their duties.\n\nIn turn, the Board has entrusted to the Appointments Committee the responsibility of ensuring that when new vacancies are filled or new directors are appointed, the selection procedures are free from any implied bias entailing any kind of discrimination, particularly due to gender.\n\n**Collective knowledge of highest governance body**\n\nThe Company has a programme to provide directors with training and updates in response to the need for professionalisation, diversification and qualification of the Board of Directors.\n\nA diverse Board of Directors in terms of skills, nationalities and gender\n\nDirectors receive training regarding significant issues relating to the group and its Businesses, as well as the environment in which they operate, which are supplemented by reports, articles and other publications of interest made available to the directors through the directors' website (a software application that has a specific section and a blog dedicated to training).\nThis website also facilitates the performance of the directors\u2019 duties and the exercise of their right to information, incorporating documents deemed appropriate to prepare for meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees thereof based on the agenda, as well as materials from the presentations made during the meetings.\n\nIn addition, at each meeting of the Board of Directors, a space is used to present financial, legal or socio-political issues of interest to the group.\n\nFor such purpose, an Orientation Programme covering aspects such as the business and organisational model of the Company and its group, the corporate governance structure and its ownership, and the Governance and Sustainability System is made available to the members of the Board of Directors through the directors\u2019 website.\n\n### GRI 103-33\n\n#### Training and

Within the framework of the evaluation process for financial year 2021, Iberdrola has decided to draw on the help of PricewaterhouseCoopers Asesores de Negocios, S.L. This process is based on the review of a large number of quantifiable and measurable indicators that are objectively updated every year based on the latest trends. As a result of this process, the company develops and adopts ongoing improvement plans designed to implement the specific measures that may help to further perfect corporate governance practices. A summary of this process can be found in section C.1.17 of the Annual Corporate Governance Report 2021.\n\nIdentifying, managing and evaluating economic, environmental and social impacts\n\nThe Board of Directors of Iberdrola S.A. is structured as described in chapter I.1 \u201cAbout Iberdrola\u201d, and its consultative committees assist it in its task of supervising the management of the company's economic, social and environmental performance. This includes both the supervision of the risks and opportunities generated by the group\u2019s activities and compliance with international principles, codes and standards applicable to the tasks for which it is responsible. The Board of Directors and its consultative committees perform periodic evaluations of the aforementioned aspects of the group\u2019s performance, drawing for such purpose on external information of interest thereto, with the assistance of external independent advisers, and on information provided to them by the rest of the organisation itself, primarily through periodic appearances of the group\u2019s officers.\n\nThese appearances are reported in the Activities Report of the Board of Directors and of the Committees thereof.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Committee has supervised the company's conduct in the area of sustainability, corporate reputation, corporate governance and compliance. The appearances of the director of Corporate Social Responsibility and Reputation, Climate Change and Alliances as well as the director of Innovation, Sustainability and Quality have been frequent in this regard, and have dealt with the most significant aspects of what is referred to as \u201cclimate governance\u201d. The director of the Compliance Unit has also appeared on a recurring basis. The secretary of the Board of Directors, the general secretary and director of Legal Services and the heads of the various areas have also been invited to make presentations at meetings during which issues within their purview have been discussed.\nRemuneration policies\n\nAs provided in the By-Laws and the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors, at the proposal of the Remuneration Committee, is the body with power to set the remuneration of directors within the overall limit set by the By-Laws and in accordance with law, except for such remuneration as consists of the delivery of shares or of options thereon or which is indexed to the price of the shares, which must be submitted to the shareholders for approval at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. The Remuneration Committee is a consultative committee chaired by an independent director and made up mostly of independent directors.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for evaluating the level of achievement of the targets to which variable annual and multi-annual remuneration is linked and for submitting it to the Board of Directors for approval.\n\nAs a result of the group\u2019s commitment to sustainability, the long-term incentive plan (2020-20222 Strategic Bonus) proposed by the Board of Directors to the shareholders at the 2021 General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting includes objectives linked to the fight against climate change, notably the acceleration of the emissions reduction objectives. This commitment is aligned with the goal of reducing overall emissions intensity, which contributes to SDGs 7 and 13, by 2030. Other objectives linked to the long-term incentive plan relate to (i) increasing the number of suppliers that adhere to sustainable development policies and standards and (ii) eliminating the wage gap.\n\nPursuant to the By-Laws, the Company will annually allocate as an expense an amount equal to a maximum of two percent of the group\u2019s consolidated profit during the preceding financial year for the following purposes:\n\na. To remunerate the directors both for their status as such and for any executive duties, based on the positions held, dedication and attendance at meetings of the corporate decision-making bodies.\n\nb. To maintain a fund to cover the obligations incurred by the Company with respect to pensions, the payment of life insurance premiums and the making of severance payments to former and current directors.\n\nThe allocation, with a maximum limit of two percent, can only accrue if the profit from the preceding financial year is sufficient to cover the requirements of the legal reserve and other mandatory reserves and if the shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend of at least four per cent of the share capital with a charge to said financial year.\n\nRegardless of the provisions of the preceding sections, the remuneration of the directors may consist of the delivery of shares or options thereon, as well as remuneration linked to the value of the Company\u2019s shares, subject always to the approval of the shareholders acting at a General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\nAnnual total compensation ratio and annual total compensation percentage increase ratio\n\nIberdrola\u2019s Corporate Governance Model provides for the existence of a holding company, Iberdrola S.A., and for country subholding companies in the main countries in which it does business, as shown in the \u201cCorporate and governance structure, ownership and legal form\u201d section of the chapter and described on the Company\u2019s website.\n\nThe main countries in which the Iberdrola group does business are Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil and Mexico, where the compensation remuneration ratios are set forth in the table below.\n\n| Country | Highest level of remuneration | Annual total compensation ratio | Percentage increase in annual total compensation ratio |\n|---------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Spain   | Director/a                    | 21.37                          | -1.44                                                |\n|         |                               | 21.69                          | 0.00                                                 |\n|         |                               | 21.75                          | 1.72                                                 |\n| United Kingdom | CEO | 20.08                          | 3.77                                                |\n|         |                               | 16.69                          | -0.89                                                |\n|         |                               | 19.04                          | 3.39                                                 |\n| United States | CEO | 11.59                          | 6.24                                                |\n|         |                               | 8.82                           | N/A                                                  |\n|         |                               | 18.95                          | -3.02                                                |\n| Brazil  | Director/a                    | 18.80                          | N/A                                                  |\n|         |                               | 14.31                          | 0.21                                                 |\n|         |                               | 14.72                          | -1.4                                                 |\n| Mexico  | CEO                           | 24.83                          | 3.96                                                 |\n|         |                               | 20.67                          | N/A                                                  |\n|         |                               | 7.12                           | 1.28                                                 |\n\nShareholder engagement\n\nIberdrola is a pioneer in implementing shareholder engagement as one of the fundamental pillars of its corporate governance strategy, with the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting being the shareholders\u2019 main channel for participation in corporate life.\n\nAs in 2020, the 2021 General Meeting was held 100% online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing the following innovations to continue encouraging the informed participation of shareholders:\n\n1. Proactive sending of proxy and remote voting cards by Iberdrola to shareholders.\n2. QR code included in the proxy and remote voting cards to facilitate electronic participation.\n3. New channels for remote participation, including the WhatsApp instant messaging application and email, for shareholders and proxy holders to send images of their voting cards.\n4. Prize draw for 100 pairs of virtual reality goggles among shareholders voting or granting proxies through the corporate website\u2019s participation portal.\n5. Extending to proxy representatives, in addition to shareholders, the ability to attend the General Meeting online.\n\n51 Spain: Iberdrola, S.A.; Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a; Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional.

There is no comparable benchmark in 2019 for the higher level of remuneration in 2020.\nThe General Meeting held on 18 June 2021 achieved a quorum of 65.83% of share capital (6.46% present and 59.37% by proxy), with all resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors being approved by a broad majority.\n\nSince 2016 the Basque Government (through the state-owned company Ihobe) and AENOR certify that the management of Iberdrola\u2019s General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting meets the standards for the environmental sustainability of events in the Basque Country (Erronka Garbia) and the ISO 20121 standard on sustainable event management, respectively.\n\nConstructive, continuous, effective and transparent dialogue with the shareholders, encouraging their engagement and promoting their active participation through various channels like the interactive On Line Shareholders (OLS) system and the Shareholders\u2019 Club, among others.\n\nThe company has implemented several specific channels of communication to promote accessibility, the understanding of information, and ultimately the engagement of the shareholders, including the following:\n\na. **Shareholder\u2019s Office.** From the call to the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting through the end thereof, the shareholders can rely on the support of the Shareholder\u2019s Office (Oficina del Accionista), which is in permanent contact with those shareholders who have voluntarily entered their names in its database, and provides a specific service to minority shareholders for the organisation of presentations and events prior to the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\n\nb. **OLS Shareholders\u2019 Club.** This is an open and permanent channel of participation between the company and shareholders who are interested in monitoring the company\u2019s evolution on an ongoing basis.\n\nc. **Investor Relations Office.** This responds on a regular and personalised basis to the questions of analysts and qualified institutional investors in equities, fixed-income securities and socially responsible investments.\n\nd. **Relations with shareholder associations and institutional shareholders.** Both shareholder associations and institutional shareholders may request meetings with representatives of the company through the Investor Relations and External Communication Division.\n\ne. Last, the **Governance and Sustainability System** makes provision for the ability of the Board of Directors or its chairman & CEO to empower the first vice-chair and lead independent director or other directors to engage in dialogue with specific shareholders on issues relating to corporate governance and sustainable development.\n\nFirst Spanish company and one of the pioneers worldwide in formalising a **Shareholder Engagement Policy**, which is one of the main pillars in the corporate governance strategy.\n\n**Stakeholders\u2019 engagement in remuneration**\n\nThe **Annual Director Remuneration Report** for financial year 2020 was approved by an ample majority of the shareholders at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting held on 18 June 2021, which had a quorum of 65.83%.\n\nThe **Annual Director Remuneration Report** for financial year 2021 will be submitted to a consultative vote of the shareholders at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting to be held in 2022.\nEthics and integrity\n\nPolicies and protocols\n\nThe group\u2019s Compliance System is structured around the regulations approved by the Board of Directors. The Unit, under the powers conferred upon it by the Regulations of the Compliance Unit, prepares and approves supplementary regulations that are also binding for all group employees.\n\nRegulations approved by the Board of Directors\n\n- Professionals\u2019 Code of Ethics\n- Crime Prevention Policy\n- Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud Policy\n- Suppliers\u2019 Code of Ethics\n- Internal Regulations for Conduct in the Securities Markets\n- Internal Rules for the Processing of Inside Information\n\nRegulations approved by the Unit\n\n- General Compliance System Framework\n- General Coordination, Collaboration and Information Protocol\n- Protocol for Management of the Risk of Third-Party Fraud and Corruption\n- Corporate Transactions Protocol\n- Protocol for Conduct in Professional Relations with Government Administrations\n- Protocol for Social Contributions, Donations and Sponsorships\n- Procedure for Management of Conflicts of Interest and Related-Party Transactions of Senior Officers\n- Competition Protocol\n- Gifts and Hospitality Protocol\n- Action Protocol in the Event of Notification of Court and Administrative Sanctioning Procedures\n- Case Processing Guide\n- Risk Assessment Guide\n- Third-Party Risk Assessment Guide\n\nEvaluation of risks\n\nOne of the main elements of the Compliance System is the existence of a process of regular and continuous identification and evaluation of the compliance-related risks of each of the corporate functions and in the businesses of the group.\nThus, in terms of risk assessments, two types of evaluations are carried out, which include the risk of corruption:\n\n1. For the purpose of developing the Crime Prevention Policy, the companies of the group have implemented a set of measures making up the Crime Prevention Programme, which has been implemented at each country subholding and head of business company, all within the framework of the process of review and adjustment to the most recent changes to the Spanish Criminal Code following the introduction of criminal liability for legal entities, without prejudice to the legal provisions applicable in any other jurisdiction in which the company does business.\n\n   To implement these Crime Prevention Programmes, there is a regular evaluation of the risks of committing criminal acts that might ultimately be alleged against the various companies of the group based on their activities, as well as an identification of existing controls and the establishment of new controls for the prevention thereof.\n\n2. The Compliance Unit and the Compliance Divisions regularly update a compliance risk map covering the entire Group and following the guidelines established in the Compliance Risk Evaluation Guide, established by the Unit, including an assessment of the likelihood of each risk occurring and the impact that this would have.\n\n   Each Compliance Division analyses the presence of such risks at each of its companies. With the information obtained, a compliance risk map is prepared for each entity, identifying the main controls within the group to mitigate such risks, and if appropriate proposing improvement actions to strengthen the effectiveness of said controls.\n\n   Although Iberdrola, Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a, and their head of business companies are not subject to Law 10/2010 on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (the \u201cMoney Laundering Act\u201d) and, therefore, that Act and the formal and administrative obligations imposed thereunder on certain groups do not apply to them, the risk of perpetration of money laundering offences is contemplated as part of the Crime Prevention Programme of such companies, given the breadth of the definition of the crime and taking into account that this type of crime can be committed by careless action.\n\n   The general controls associated with these offences include: (i) the Code of Ethics, (ii) the Purchasing Policy, (iii) the Protocol for Social Contributions, Donations and Sponsorships, (iv) the Master Plan for Sponsorships, Donations and Partnership Agreements, and (v) the Protocol for Management of the Risk of Third-Party Fraud and Corruption. These companies also have a series of specific controls for this type of crime, which are also identified in their respective programmes.\n\n   However, Iberdrola Inmobiliaria, S.A.U., due to the nature of the activity it carries out, is subject to the Money Laundering Act and, therefore, in addition to the aforementioned preventive controls, this company has implemented additional specific controls primarily aimed at preventing this type of crime. By way of example, the company has approved rules like the Procedure to Prevent Money-Laundering and Terrorist Financing and Contract Approval Endorsements, the Leased Assets Billing Procedure and Payment Order Validation.\nCommunication and training related to anti-corruption rules\n\nTraining and communication are two fundamental pillars of Iberdrola\u2019s Compliance System to ensure that all of its professionals are aware of and comply with the Code of Ethics.\n\nWithin this context, the Compliance Division plans its training and communication activities on an annual basis in collaboration with the corresponding Human Resources and Internal Communications divisions.\n\nCorporate policies, including the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud Policy and the Crime Prevention Policy, as well as the Code of Ethics, are available on the corporate website and on the employee portal.\n\nThe protocols and other procedures approved by the Compliance Unit are available on the employee portal and are circulated by email to all departments where these procedures may be applicable.\n\nGRI 205-2\n\nThe table below shows the training hours associated with the various training activities carried out in 2021.\n\n| Employee training on anti-corruption | 2021 | 2020 |\n|--------------------------------------|------|------|\n|                                      | Number of employees trained | Percentage of total workforce | Number of employees trained | Percentage of total workforce |\n| Spain                                | Leadership | 508 | 43.6 | 517 | 43.2 |\n|                                      | Qualified Technicians | 1,409 | 32.1 | 2,823 | 69.2 |\n|                                      | Skilled workers and support personnel | 1,214 | 29.1 | 2,823 | 65.4 |\n|                                      | Total | 3,131 | 32.2 | 6,163 | 64.2 |\n| United Kingdom                       | Leadership | 14 | 1.7 | 673 | 87.3 |\n|                                      | Qualified Technicians | 87 | 2.7 | 2,623 | 83.4 |\n|                                      | Skilled workers and support personnel | 68 | 4.2 | 1,150 | 69.8 |\n|                                      | Total | 169 | 3.0 | 4,446 | 79.9 |\n| United States                        | Leadership | 330 | 100.0 | N/A | N/A |\n|                                      | Qualified Technicians | 2,861 | 100.0 | N/A | N/A |\n|                                      | Skilled workers and support personnel | 4,244 | 100.0 | N/A | N/A |\n|                                      | Total | 7,435 | 100.0 | 7,099 | 100.0 |\n| Brazil                               | Leadership | 379 | 97.7 | 338 | 96.3 |\n|                                      | Qualified Technicians | 3,062 | 96.6 | 2,796 | 96.3 |\n|                                      | Skilled workers and support personnel | 10,714 | 93.2 | 8,997 | 94.1 |\n|                                      | Total | 14,155 | 94.0 | 12,131 | 94.7 |\n| Mexico                               | Leadership | 38 | 40.4 | 109 | 100.0 |\n|                                      | Qualified Technicians | 373 | 50.2 | 93 | 12.1 |\n|                                      | Skilled workers and support personnel | 135 | 29.4 | 16 | 3.6 |\n|                                      | Total | 546 | 42.1 | 218 | 16.7 |\n| IEI                                  | Leadership | 44 | 50.0 | 42 | 35.0 |\n|                                      | Qualified Technicians | 284 | 44.9 | 148 | 24.5 |\n|                                      | Skilled workers and support personnel | 25 | 25.8 | 8 | 8.6 |\n|                                      | Total | 353 | 43.2 | 198 | 24.2 |\n| Iberdrola total                      | Leadership | 1,313 | 45 | 1,679 | 58 |\n|                                      | Qualified Technicians | 8,076 | 54 | 8,483 | 59 |\n|                                      | Skilled workers and support personnel | 16,400 | 74 | 12,994 | 64 |\n|                                      | Total | 25,789 | 6,455 | 30,255 | 8,149 |\nMonitoring\n\nGrievance mailboxes of the group\n\nGRI 102-17\n\nOne of the basic elements of the Compliance System are the detection and/or monitoring mechanisms allowing for verification of the effectiveness of the controls and prevention activities carried out at the group. Such mechanisms include the ethics mailboxes for employees, which are tools that professionals can use to make queries or report conduct that may involve the commission of any improper conduct or any act contrary to law or the rules.\n\nThe group also has suppliers\u2019 ethics mailboxes. These mailboxes are communication channels to enable the suppliers of the group, as well as any companies that they subcontract, their respective employees and companies that have participated in a tender, to report conduct that might entail (i) violation by any group professional of the Governance and Sustainability System, the Code of Ethics or applicable law, or (ii) the commission by a supplier, its subcontractors or the respective employees thereof of any act contrary to law or to the provisions of the section of the Code of Ethics applicable to suppliers within the framework of their business relations with the group. These mailboxes are available in the purchasing portal of the website.\n\nThe group also has a shareholders\u2019 ethics mailbox. This mailbox represents a channel of communication through which shareholders can report conduct that might involve a breach of the company\u2019s Governance and Sustainability System or the commission by any professional of the group of an act contrary to the law or to the rules of conduct of the Code of Ethics. This mailbox is available on the group\u2019s corporate website, specifically within the interactive system provided for the shareholders known as \u201cOLS \u2013 On-Line Shareholders\u201d.\n\nResponse and remediation plans\n\nGRI 205-3\n\nAs regards the communications received through the ethics mailboxes, a total of 2,177 communications were received in financial year 2021, of which 1,159 were queries and 1,018 were complaints. Of the 1,018 complaints received, 527 were accepted for processing. In 9% of the cases of complaints allowed to proceed, some type of disciplinary measure was taken upon a showing that there had been improper conduct or conduct contrary to the Code of Ethics. Regarding the total of 527 complaints that were accepted for processing, 77 were classified as having a potential impact on human rights.\n\nInformation regarding the existence of cases of corruption during the financial year\n\nThe company has not been informed through the ethics mailboxes of any confirmed cases of corruption during the year. There have also been no incidents recorded through the mailboxes available for this purposes resulting in the cancellation of orders or of contracts with group suppliers due to negative social impacts.\n\nThe Iberdrola group is working with the courts to clarify the circumstances relating to the hiring of the company Cenyt in order to enforce any liabilities that arise and to defend its good name and reputation.\n\nThe corresponding court proceedings are being heard before Central Investigating Court no. 6. Iberdrola, S.A. appears as an aggrieved party in these proceedings. For its part, the head of business company Iberdrola Renovables Energ\u00eda, S.A.U. appears as a person of interest (investigado). The Chairman & CEO, an external director, two executives and five former executives of Iberdrola, S.A., among other individuals and entities, also appear in this capacity.\nA review and analysis of the internal processes performed with the help of independent experts and pursuant to the group\u2019s Governance and Sustainability System has not revealed any violation of the internal control systems or of the Code of Ethics or of any other rules or procedures. Therefore, the impact of these cases on Iberdrola, S.A. or its group companies would be limited to reputational matters.\n\nIn addition, Iberdrola Renovables Castilla y Le\u00f3n has been summoned as a subsidiary civil party in the opening of the Oral Hearing ordered by Investigating Court No. 4 of Valladolid in relation to the wind power scheme in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. The order states that those vicariously liable must provide the following amounts as surety for their secondary civil liability: Iberdrola Renovables Castilla y Le\u00f3n, in the amount of \u20ac11,257,500, severally with the Castile and Leon Government.\n\nProceedings from prior years with an impact on the financial year\n\nOn 22 December 2017, the European Investment Bank (the \u201cEIB\u201d), Iberdrola Ingenier\u00eda y Construcci\u00f3n, S.A.U. and Iberdrola S.A. (in its capacity as owner of all of the share capital of Iberdrola Ingenier\u00eda y Construcci\u00f3n, S.A.U. through the country subholding company Iberdrola Participaciones, S.A.U.) signed a settlement agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) within the framework of the EIB\u2019s investigation relating to the Riga TEC-2 project to rebuild a thermal plant in Riga (Latvia), which was awarded to Iberdrola Ingenier\u00eda y Construcci\u00f3n, S.A.U. on 8 December 2005 and financed by this institution.\n\nThe obligations agreed to with the EIB under the Agreement by Iberdrola Ingenier\u00eda y Construcci\u00f3n, S.A.U. and Iberdrola, S.A. include the development, financing and implementation of a specific programme to sponsor activities in the area of compliance by taking actions and measures in favour of the fight against corruption and fraud for a period of four years from the signing of the Agreement. After the parties agreed to extend the deadline by a further year, in 2021 the company complied fully with the commitments assumed.\nPublic policies\n\nRelations with regulatory entities and social institutions\n\nIberdrola has two kinds of relationships with regulatory entities:\n\n- Relationships geared towards contributing to the enactment of efficient regulatory provisions allowing for the development of a competitive market in activities that are not subject to a natural monopoly, and sufficient remuneration for regulated businesses. To that end, there is a continuous and constructive dialogue where information, knowledge and positions are exchanged. Iberdrola is thus acquainted with the concerns and proposals of regulatory entities and provides them with its own positions in the legitimate defence of its interests and those of its shareholders and customers. The company also actively participates in \u201cpublic hearings\u201d held by regulatory entities in order to ascertain the opinions of the players involved in the processes prior to the revision of regulations or the determination of domestic and European energy policies. It also participates in the official processes of enactment of the laws and regulations and in monitoring the application thereof.\n\n- Provision of all information required by regulatory entities, whether in connection with the normal conduct of its business or as a result of any transitory issue.\n\nIn addition to its direct relationships with regulatory entities, Iberdrola and the companies in its group participate in the regulatory process through the various domestic and international trade associations of which they are members.\n\nPrincipal domestic and international associations\n\n| Global | World Energy Council (Consejo Mundial de Energ\u00eda) | WindEurope |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|\n|        | Energy Networks Association                      | Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) |\n|        | Solar Power Europe                               | European Distribution System Operators (EDSO) |\n|        | Union of the Electricity Industry EURELECTRIC    | Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) |\n|        | CSR Europe                                       | Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) |\n|        | International Emissions Trading Association (IETA)| World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) |\n|        | European Technology and Innovation Platform on Wind Energy (ETIP Wind) | European Utilities Telecom Council-EUTC |\n|        | European Round Table (ERT)                       | International Council on Large Electric (CIGRE) |\n|        | European Network of Cibersecurity (ENCS)         | European Association for Storage of Energy (EASE) |\n|        | Prime Alliance                                   | European Technology Platform Smart Grids |\n|        | World Nuclear Association                        | European Utilities Technology |\n### Principal domestic and international associations\n\n| Spain | United Kingdom | United States | Brazil |\n|-------|----------------|---------------|--------|\n| Foro de la Industria Nuclear Espa\u00f1ola y SNE | Scottish Fuel Poverty | American National Standards Institute (ANSI) | Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Distribuidoras de Energia El\u00e9trica (ABRADEE) |\n| Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola del Gas (SEDIGAS) | The Scottish Renewables Forum | The Wind Coalition (TWC) | Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira dos Comercializadores de Energia (ABRACEEL) |\n| Plataforma Espa\u00f1ola de Redes El\u00e9ctricas (FUTURED) | Offshore Wind Accelerator | North American Transmission Owner and Operator Forum (NATF) | Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira dos Contadores do Setor de Energia El\u00e9trica (ABRACONE) |\n| Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de la Industria El\u00e9ctrica (AELEC) | Energy Networks Association | American National Standards Institute (ANSI) | Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Energia Solar (ABSOLAR) |\n| Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de la Energ\u00eda (ITE) | Renewables UK | Industrial Asset Management Council (IAMC) | Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Geradoras Termel\u00e9tricas (ABRAGET) |\n| Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Normalizaci\u00f3n (AENOR) | Energy & Utility Skills | Gas Technology Institute (GTI) | Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Geradoras Termel\u00e9tricas (ABRAGET) |\n| Fundaci\u00f3n COTEC para la Innovaci\u00f3n | Institute of Customers Service | Edison Electric Institute (EEI) | Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Energia Solar (ABSOLAR) |\n| Asociaci\u00f3n Empresarial para el Desarrollo e Impulso del Veh\u00edculo El\u00e9ctrico | Institute of Engineering &Technology | Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (CEERT) | Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o Empresarial (ABERJE) |\n| Corporate Excellence | National Energy Action | North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) | Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o Empresarial (ABERJE) |\n| Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola del Hidr\u00f3geno | | | Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o Empresarial (ABERJE) |\n\n**Governance | Good governance, transparency and Stakeholder engagement**\n\nwww.iberdrola.com Statement of Non-Financial Information.

These represent the contributions made by the company and do not include additional voluntary contributions from employees. The Networks Business has made various contributions to different organisations and institutions, totalling \u20ac19,230 ($22,750).\nStakeholder engagement\n\nIberdrola\u2019s Stakeholder Engagement Policy\u2014approved by the Board of Directors in February 2015 and last amended in December 2020\u2014emphasises that \u201cit is not possible to achieve the social interest and develop a responsible and sustainable business model without the strong engagement of the Company\u2019s Stakeholders, which are defined as those groups and entities whose decisions and opinions have an influence on Iberdrola and who, at the same time, are affected by the Iberdrola group\u2019s activities\u201d. The value chain comprised of Iberdrola\u2019s businesses means that there is a large number of these groups, for which reason the company has decided to group them into eight different categories that constitute its Stakeholders:\n\nThe initial identification and selection of Iberdrola\u2019s Stakeholders was carried out through processes of internal reflection conducted by the management team. The Stakeholder Engagement Policy later ratified the Stakeholder categories described in the preceding section in 2015 and subsequent updates.\n\nOn this basis, for the proper management of each of the Stakeholders, Iberdrola\u2019s various areas and businesses identify different Sub-Stakeholders that they deem relevant for more specific treatment.\nApproach to Stakeholder engagement\n\nIberdrola has a responsible and sustainable business model, which puts Stakeholders at the centre of its strategy. The company\u2019s objective is thus to build relations of confidence with the various Stakeholders, as well as to deepen their participation, engagement and collaboration.\n\nThe By-Laws, the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and the various corporate policies express the company\u2019s focus on the creation of shared sustainable value for Stakeholders related to our business activities and our institutional reality in view of the commitments made in the Code of Ethics.\n\nIn this regard, the Stakeholder Engagement Policy further develops this business philosophy and establishes five objectives and seven principles of conduct, which serve as a guide for all the group\u2019s professionals to act and engage with Stakeholders.\n\nIberdrola has decisively driven compliance with its Stakeholder Engagement Policy (mentioned above), through a Global Stakeholder Engagement Model based on the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard 2015 (AA1000SES 2015), the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles 2018 (AA1000AP 2018) standard, and in its four principles of inclusiveness, materiality, responsiveness and impact.\nAmong other objectives, this Model seeks to systematise Stakeholder relations throughout the Iberdrola group, in all countries and businesses, and to create a corporate culture with respect to the significance of dialogue with the Stakeholders for more sustainable performance by the company. The Model constitutes a process of continuous improvement in and of itself, as shown below:\n\nThis process is implemented in the management of Iberdrola\u2019s eight Stakeholder groups in the five main countries and at most of the Generation and Renewables facilities, as well as in the various geographic areas of the Networks business.\n\n**Relationship channels, relevant topics and best practices**\n\nIberdrola keeps the relationship channels with its Stakeholders updated and makes continuous efforts to identify the issues that are most important to each of them. An analysis of these issues shows that, while there are issues exclusive to each geographical area, most are common to Iberdrola\u2019s five main countries. The company also identifies best practices in relation to Stakeholders, which are shared by the entire group.\n\nSet out below is a summary of the most important Stakeholder engagement channels, both face-to-face and online, and the main global issues detected, both generally among all Stakeholders and specific to each Stakeholder group. Also included is a best practice example for each of the main countries in which Iberdrola operates.\n\n---\n\n56 The By-Laws state that \u201cthe Company\u2019s corporate website, its presence on social media and its digital communication strategy generally are channels of communication serving the Stakeholder Engagement Policy.\u201d\n### Relevant general channels and issues for all

Environmental. The most significant issues of interest refer to regulatory compliance, the economic and social impact of the facilities on local communities, and environmental impacts and the mitigation thereof.\n\n---\n\n57 In the case of the cogeneration plants, the main Stakeholder group is \u2018Customers\u2019, for whom the most significant issue is compliance with contracts.\nBest practices by country\n\nSpain\n\nThrough the \u201cAyuntamientos por el clima\u201d (\u201cTown Councils for the Climate\u201d) initiative, Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a contributes to promoting climate action by local councils committed to the environment, in order to achieve emissions neutrality by 2050. This initiative consists of an online platform and community providing tools for measuring carbon footprints, disseminating solutions for greater sustainability, highlighting the actions of those who participate, and generating a knock-on effect to extend climate action to all stakeholders.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn the context of the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, ScottishPower has adjusted its consultations with local communities on different renewable projects to an online format. This means that public events are held online, tailor-made information is available on the website, and members of the community can submit questions about the projects through the website itself.\n\nUnited States\n\nAVANGRID has engaged in intensive Stakeholder engagement efforts as part of the Excelsior Connect project to build a 420-kilometre underground power line to boost renewable energy in New York State. AVANGRID uses social media to promote the project, as well as organising round tables with all relevant parties, including government, business, labour and environmental organisations.\n\nBrazil\n\nSupport from Neoenergia towards combating wildfires in Pernambuco, through different actions carried out jointly with the State Environment Agency. The aim is to prevent fires in sugar cane plantations and along power distribution and transmission lines and their resulting impact on the environment and local communities. For such purpose, Neoenergia organises environmental education conferences and workshops, produces educational material for all ages, releases media content, and carries out inspections and visits to plantation areas and other key sites identifying potential hazards.\n\nMexico\n\nIberdrola Mexico encourages its local suppliers to apply for and obtain the Socially Responsible Company label, and supports and guides them throughout the process. The aim is to foster the adoption of CSR principles, in particular those related to business ethics, quality of life in the company, community involvement and environmental protection and preservation.\n\nIberdrola\u2019s response to all of these issues is reflected not only in the various indicators of this Statement of Non-Financial Information. Sustainability Report, but also in the various Annual reports of the Company. The corporate website and the websites of the businesses and the foundations also contain information in this regard.\n\nSimilarly, this Statement of Non-Financial Information. Sustainability Report includes Iberdrola\u2019s main impacts on its various Stakeholders, in line with the \u201csocial dividend\u201d concept established by Iberdrola\u2019s Governance and Sustainability System, understood as \u201cthe direct, indirect, or induced contribution of value that its activities represent for all Stakeholders\u201d. The Stakeholder Engagement Model also includes the impact of the action plans associated with relevant issues.\n\nIberdrola believes that stakeholder panels are a very useful and effective tool of engagement with its Stakeholders. They are a typical practice in the UK Networks business, and in 2019 Iberdrola created a Stakeholder CSR Panel in Spain made up of 10 outside panellists, all of whom are major opinion leaders in this field.\n\nIn recent years, Iberdrola has launched numerous measures to strengthen internal culture regarding the importance of stakeholder engagement throughout the group. These measures include the creation of a global working group called the Iberdrola Stakeholders\u2019 Hub and the internal dissemination of ten guidelines on how to relate to and engage with its Stakeholders.\n\nThe methodology described in the preceding sections enables the company to identify material issues through direct sources. This analysis is completed with the analysis through indirect sources, such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DSJI), the Carbon Disclosure Project, the Materiality Analysis, etc., described in the \u201cDefining report content\u201d section.\nConsidering all of the foregoing, Iberdrola has a complete Stakeholder management system, subject to a process of continuous improvement, which allows it to increasingly engage all of the groups with which it relates and to encourage their participation in all of the company\u2019s decisions. This is shown by the fact that Iberdrola achieved the highest rating in the \u201cstakeholder engagement\u201d section of the DJSI index in 2021, for the second year in a row.\n\n### Fiscal responsibility\n\nIberdrola has a Corporate Tax Policy that sets out the group\u2019s tax strategy, based on ensuring compliance with applicable tax regulations, excellence and the commitment to applying good tax practices, within the framework of the group\u2019s corporate and governance structure. The Corporate Tax Policy applies to all group companies.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Iberdrola S.A. is tasked with designing, evaluating, approving and permanently reviewing corporate policies, including the Corporate Tax Policy. In addition, the Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the tax strategy and approving investments or transactions which are of special tax relevance due to the magnitude or characteristics thereof.\n\nThe Corporate Tax Policy is publicly available on the group\u2019s corporate website.\n\nAware of the importance that tax information represents for all Stakeholders, and as part of its commitment to transparency and best practices, Iberdrola voluntarily prepares the annual \u201cReport on Tax Transparency of the Iberdrola group. Our commitment to society\u201d. This report sets out all significant issues from a tax standpoint, together with an analysis of the group\u2019s tax contribution at the global level, and complements the information provided herein. This report is publicly released and available on the group\u2019s corporate website.\n\n---\n\n58 Iberdrola prepares an annual Management Report on Iberdrola\u2019s Stakeholder Relations, which summarises issues of interest detected within the various communication channels, as well as the company\u2019s response through action plans.\nFiscally responsible behaviour\n\nThe purpose of the Corporate Tax Policy is to set out the Company\u2019s tax strategy, based on ensuring compliance with applicable tax regulations, excellence and commitment to applying good tax practices, within the framework of the group\u2019s corporate and governance structure.\n\nThe Corporate Tax Policy defines the main principles of conduct, including:\n\n- Compliance with tax regulations in each of the countries in which the group operates, paying the taxes that are due. All tax-related decisions are based on a reasonable interpretation of applicable law in close connection with the group\u2019s activity.\n- The prevention and reduction of significant tax risks, ensuring that taxes bear an appropriate relationship to the structure and location of activities, human and material resources, and the group\u2019s business risks.\n- The strengthening of the relationship with tax authorities based on respect for the law, fidelity, reliability, professionalism, cooperation, reciprocity and good faith.\n- Envisaging the taxes that group companies pay in the countries and territories in which they operate as the principal contribution to sustaining public expenditures, and therefore as one of their contributions to society.\n\nBy application of these principles, the group assumes the following good tax practices, among others:\n\n- Not to use artificial structures unrelated to the group\u2019s business for the sole purpose of reducing its tax burden nor, in particular, enter into transactions with related entities solely to erode the tax basis or to transfer profits to low-tax territories.\n- Avoid opaque structures for tax purposes, which are understood as structures calculated to prevent knowledge by the competent tax authorities of the party ultimately responsible for the activities or of the ultimate owner of the assets or rights involved.\n- Not to create or acquire companies resident in countries or territories deemed by Spanish law to be tax havens or included on the EU blacklist of non-cooperative jurisdictions, with the sole exception of those cases in which it is obliged to do so in the case of an indirect acquisition in which the company resident in a tax haven is part of a group of companies being acquired, in which case, the provisions of the Procedure for the creation or acquisition of shares in special purpose vehicles or companies domiciled in tax havens, approved by the Board of Directors, must be taken into account.\n- Follow the recommendations of the good tax practices codes implemented in the countries in which the companies of the group do business, taking into account the group\u2019s specific needs and circumstances. Make the necessary whistleblower channels available to anyone who wishes to report any conduct that may involve any wrongdoing or conduct contrary to the law or to the Governance and Sustainability System, including the rules of conduct set forth in the Code of Ethics that are also applicable to tax-related activities.\n\nThe fiscally responsible behaviour of all companies of the Iberdrola group forms part of the General Sustainable Development Policy, which contemplates basic principles of conduct that must be respected. Iberdrola\u2019s tax policy is guided by the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and the Code of Ethics, and is based on a commitment to ethical principles, good corporate governance, transparency and institutional loyalty.\n\nThe group companies share the principles reflected in the Purpose and Values of the Iberdrola group and the Code of Ethics, and see the social dividend as the contribution of direct, indirect or induced sustainable value that its activities represent for all Stakeholders.\nTax governance and risk management\n\nResponsibility\n\nThe Board of Directors of Iberdrola, S.A., through its chairman & CEO and the management team, fosters the monitoring of tax principles and good tax practices. Likewise, the respective boards of directors of the country subholding companies are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Corporate Tax Policy at the country level.\n\nControl and monitoring\n\nTaxation is not static and is subject to continuous revision, which requires the Corporate Tax Policy to be constantly reviewed in order to reflect the best practices in this area, with the last update taking place in June 2021.\n\nTo achieve efficient control and correct compliance with tax governance requirements, the applicable tax laws and the principles of the Corporate Tax Policy are monitored at all levels.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Global Tax Division approves and periodically reviews guidelines for the evaluation and management of tax risk applicable to all companies of the group. It is also the body responsible for tax compliance within the Company, in coordination with the Company\u2019s Compliance Unit.\n\nFurthermore, the head of business companies report to the country subholding companies regarding the level of compliance with the Corporate Tax Policy, and in turn, the Audit and Compliance Committees of the country subholding companies report to the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of Iberdrola S.A. Finally, the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of Iberdrola, S.A. reports its findings to the Board of Directors.\n\nRisk management and compliance\n\nIberdrola seeks to prevent and reduce significant tax risks, and for such purpose has established objective criteria to classify transactions according to their tax risk. In keeping with this commitment, the company does not include within its controlled affiliates and assets any that are resident in tax havens, pursuant to the laws in this regard (Royal Decree 1080/1991) or in territories classified by the European Union in its blacklist as non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes.\n\nStakeholder engagement in tax matters\n\nIberdrola, S.A. adheres to the Code of Good Tax Practices approved on 20 July 2010 by the full Forum of Large Businesses (Foro de Grandes Empresas), established on 10 July 2009 at the behest of the National Tax Administration Agency (Agencia Estatal de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria). Iberdrola\u2019s commitment to compliance with, further development and implementation of the Code extends to any other good tax practices that stem from the recommendations of the Code in effect at any time, even if not expressly set forth in the Corporate Tax Policy. The group is also committed to compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises in tax matters.\n\nWithin the framework of the Code, since financial year 2015 Iberdrola, S.A. has voluntarily submitted to the Spanish tax authorities an Annual Tax Transparency Report for companies adhering to the Good Tax Practices Code, which includes detailed information on the group\u2019s taxation. This report is currently the most important tool for cooperative relations with the tax authorities.\n\nFurthermore, Iberdrola has voluntarily prepared its annual Report on Tax Transparency of the Iberdrola group since 2019. This report sets out all significant issues from a tax standpoint and will be prepared again in 2022. The report contains the Country by Country Report for the previous year presented in the same terms as those submitted to the Spanish tax authorities. This report is publicly available on the corporate website.\n\nFinally, Iberdrola makes available to its Stakeholders specific ethics mailboxes, which constitute tools to report conduct that could

other operating income and financial income.\n60 Includes the parent company\u2019s equity and the amount associated with subordinated perpetual debentures.\n61 Number of Full Time Equivalents (FTEs).\n62 Mainly includes tangible assets and amounts associated with distribution and transmission concessions in Brazil.\n63 The current corporate income tax expense by jurisdiction for CbCr purposes is due to a reclassification in the consolidated income statement resulting in deferred income tax income from the recognition of the deferred tax asset in Spain. Thus, looking at the movement of the deferral as a whole (expenditure in Australia and Income in Spain), the current income tax expenditure in Australia is 0. The total expense in Australia is deferred income tax expense from the offset of tax losses.\nSpain: No significant deviations in 2021 between nominal rate and effective rate.\n\nUnited Kingdom: The spread between the nominal and effective rate is mainly due to the impact of the change in the tax rate applicable to deferred tax balances following the change in the tax rate to 25% from April 2023.\n\nUnited States: The effective rate is very similar to the nominal rate (federal plus state). The deviation is due (i) on the one hand, to tax credits associated with the renewables business (\u201cPTCs\u201d) as well as investment credits (\u201cITCs\u201d); and (ii) on the other hand, to the restatement of deferred tax balances to the prior year-end state tax rate (\u201cDT true-up\u201d) as well as the restatement of the valuation according to the potential future application of tax credits (\u201cvaluation allowance\u201d).\n\nBrazil: the effective rate is below the nominal rate mainly due to the (optional) application of the presumptive profit regime in the taxation of some of the companies, the payment of interest on equity and the existence of the SUDENE tax incentive.\n\nMexico: changes in exchange rates, considering that dollarised accounts are presented, and the existence of certain accounting and tax differences (provisions, deferred income, inflationary effect, valuation of derivatives and recognition differences in fixed assets and the depreciation rates thereof) justify the difference between the nominal and effective rate.\n\nOther countries: the differential compared to nominal rates is due to accounting standards for capitalisation of tax loss carryforwards and the subsequent application thereof, considering that the tax consolidation regime does not apply in all cases.\n\n### Competition\n\n**GRI 206**\n\nAs provided in the Code of Ethics, the group undertakes to compete fairly in the market and not to engage in advertising that is misleading or denigrates its competitors or third parties.\n\nThe group also undertakes to obtain information from third parties in accordance with regulations, to promote free competition for the benefit of consumers and users and to encourage transparency and free market practices, as set out in the group\u2019s [General Sustainable Development Policy](#).\n\nAt the country level, each of the country subholding companies endeavours to ensure strict compliance with legal provisions on separation of activities and, in many jurisdictions, the applicable internal regulation goes beyond what is required by law, significantly reinforcing measures to prevent any unfair competitive practices stemming from the lack of separation between liberalised and regulated businesses.\n\nThe liberalised head of business companies also have specific controls to avoid any type of anti-competitive practices, particularly in areas like advertising campaigns directed towards individuals and price manipulation.\n\n### Pending cases\n\n**GRI 206-1**\n\nNo cases related to monopoly practices or anti-competitive behaviour have been recorded during the financial year. Nor do any cases filed in prior years remain open.\nCybersecurity and information privacy\n\nCompanies in the energy sector rely on a technological infrastructure, both physical and digital, to support their processes and operations. Growing reliance on technology, highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, can expose businesses to a range of risks, which, if exploited, could disrupt operations, harm assets, put people\u2019s safety at risk, undermine the organisation\u2019s ability to deliver reliable energy services, or expose the company to penalties or third-party liability.\n\nAs a leader in innovation and smart grids, Iberdrola attaches strategic importance to cyber-resilience, and in 2015, the Board of Directors approved a Cybersecurity Risk Policy, pledging to introduce the necessary measures for promoting a robust cybersecurity culture throughout the group by encouraging the secure use of cyber-assets, and strengthening the capacity to detect, prevent, defend against, and respond to cyberattacks or cybersecurity threats.\n\nIts scope of application includes not only information and communications systems and technologies, but also the protection of industrial control systems and smart grids, whether operated by its own personnel or supported by third-party operations and services.\n\nThe Policy builds on a set of cybersecurity rules underpinned by the Global Cybersecurity Framework which, in turn, is further developed by the Global Cybersecurity Incident Response and Crisis Management Framework and the Global Assurance Framework and other cybersecurity standards, procedures and protocols focused on the different aspects of cybersecurity threat.\n\nTo lead the deployment of the Policy throughout the group, Iberdrola has appointed a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to senior management. The CISO is responsible for defining, leading and supervising the cybersecurity strategy throughout the group, as are the CISOs of the various country subholding companies to ensure the implementation of the Policy in each country, taking into account the regulations and legislation applicable in their territory. The global CISO and the CISOs of each country subholding company regularly report to the audit and risk supervision committees of their respective boards of directors, which are tasked with supervising this risk.\n\nThe Iberdrola group\u2019s defined cybersecurity risk strategy and global framework are focused on integrating cybersecurity in all strategic and operational decisions of the company and on taking it into account beginning with the design of new projects and processes, and is supported by the following pillars:\n\n- **Governance:** The Iberdrola group is committed to a cybersecurity governance model based on a sound understanding of the risks to the business and on common policies and standards, with clear assignment of roles and responsibilities that shifts the responsibility for cybersecurity to the company\u2019s various business and support divisions, all under the coordination and oversight of the Cybersecurity Division. To this end, in addition to the global and local CISOs, specific cybersecurity managers have been appointed in IT and in each of the company\u2019s businesses and areas, responsible for defining and deploying the necessary action plans in their respective areas of competence. There is also a Global Cybersecurity Committee comprising all the aforementioned global managers, established for the purpose of supervising, coordinating and disseminating the group\u2019s cybersecurity and personal data protection culture, identifying and preventing cybersecurity and personal data protection threats, and identifying, promoting and sharing best practices in this area. Similarly, local managers meet in committees in each country subholding company.\n\u2022 **Cybersecurity culture:** Iberdrola believes it is essential to promote a strong cybersecurity culture throughout the group, ensuring that all employees at all levels of the organisation have the training and knowledge necessary to minimise exposure to cybersecurity risks, including an understanding of risks and internal regulations and access to tools that allow for proper protection. The cybersecurity training programme covers the entire workforce, and includes annual training initiatives, simulated phishing campaigns and ad-hoc training for technical groups or those exposed to specific risks. The Board of Directors also receives specific cybersecurity training, which is also included in the orientation programme for new directors.\n\n\u2022 **Risk management:** The company\u2019s various businesses and divisions define, implement and prioritise the necessary technical or organisational measures based on an analysis of cybersecurity risks in their respective areas of responsibility, focusing on systems that support critical infrastructure and essential services, personal data and other sensitive information, as well as other business-critical processes. To this end, there is a global risk methodology and a global framework of capabilities, supported by a governance, risk and compliance (GRC) system, which includes measures for controlling identities and access, the protection of communications, equipment and systems and the secure design and development of new projects, as well as the management of supply chain related cybersecurity threats. All of this is set out in multi-year cybersecurity master plans, specific to each Business and to IT, which are approved and supervised by the Cybersecurity Committee, and whose effectiveness is monitored through a global cybersecurity dashboard. Proactive threat and vulnerability scanning programmes are also in place, including mechanisms such as scheduled and regular vulnerability scanning activities, ad-hoc security reviews (penetration tests, Red Teams, etc.), system audits in the context of auditing financial statements, critical infrastructure or the General Data Protection Regulation, and the review of cybersecurity ratings through specialised market services, allowing potential risks to be anticipated. The cybersecurity measures extend to the protecting our customers, suppliers and other Stakeholders against possible risks of social engineering attacks that impersonate our brand.\n\n\u2022 **Resilience:** With a view to minimising the impact on the business and on the continuity of essential services, Iberdrola has implemented technology (SIEMs/SOCs) and global and local cybersecurity incident response teams (CSIRTs), which operate 24x7 and act as a point of contact to ensure the successful detection and management of security threats, vulnerabilities and incidents. Iberdrola\u2019s global CSIRT is a member of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). Furthermore, operational continuity and recovery procedures for cybersecurity incidents are planned, deployed and tested in the different technological areas (IT/OT). The necessary coordination mechanisms at the global level are outlined in the *Global Cybersecurity Incident Response and Crisis Management Framework*, which is regularly tested by organising and participating in cyber exercises and crisis simulations. As a complementary measure, the Iberdrola group has a global cyber-insurance programme to mitigate the financial risks of a possible incident or security breach.\n\n\u2022 **Assurance:** As a listed company and operator of an essential service, the Iberdrola group is subject to strict security regulations in the various countries in which it operates (GDPR, SOX, NIS, PIC, NERC, etc.) and undergoes regular external audits, which include the evaluation of cybersecurity controls on critical systems and assets covered by those regulations. Beside complying with externally imposed obligations, Iberdrola has deployed\nan enhanced assurance programme for critical systems and assets that support essential operational processes of its businesses at global level, aimed at identifying potential vulnerabilities and prioritising and focusing protection and supervision measures in the area of cybersecurity.\n\n- **Partnerships**: Iberdrola actively partners with law enforcement agencies, government agencies, product and service providers, other companies and industry expert groups to continuously reinforce and improve its own cybersecurity capabilities and help improve the cyber resilience of the energy ecosystem as a whole. Iberdrola has co-chaired the World Economic Forum\u2019s working group on Cyber Resilience in the Electricity Industry since it was established in May 2018.\n\n**GRI 418**\n\nWith regard to information privacy, Iberdrola pays special attention to ensuring the privacy of the personal information of the group\u2019s Stakeholders. For this purpose, the company follows a *Personal Data Protection Policy* approved by the Board of Directors and conforming to the *European Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)*. Its purpose is to ensure the right to the protection of data of all individuals dealing with companies belonging to the group, ensuring respect for the right to dignity and privacy in processing of the personal data, and particularly to establish the common principles and guidelines to govern the group regarding the protection of data, ensuring compliance with applicable law on this topic in all countries in which the group is present.\n\nIberdrola has chosen to handle privacy with a holistic focus, the goal of which is to integrate privacy and data protection within the management system and the culture of the company. Responsibility for the protection of personal data lies with the businesses and corporate functions, organisations that process this data, under the coordination and supervision of the *Data Protection Officer*, with the support of the Legal Services.\n\nThe Iberdrola group deals with a large volume of personal data in its day-to-day activities, and given its international nature, international transfers of data among its various companies occur on a daily basis. On 15 December 2020 the Spanish Data Protection Agency issued a decision approving the Binding Corporate Rules of the Iberdrola group, one of the mechanisms established in the GDPR to make such international transfers of personal data within a group of companies. The approval of these rules has been the culmination of another of the steps implemented by the group to ensure full respect for the fundamental rights to privacy of data subjects in all of the countries in which it operates, not limited to European companies directly subject to the GDPR, but also to all other territories.\n\nDuring financial years 2018 and 2019 the Iberdrola group developed and implemented a data protection management system in order to ensure systematic compliance over time with the GDPR, the Binding Corporate Rules and the personal data protection laws of each of the EU countries in which the group is present. This management system has been reviewed within the framework of continuous improvement, through the development of an external evaluation plan. This 3-year plan began during the last quarter of financial year 2019. The first 2019-2021 external evaluation cycle encompasses all of the countries of the European Union in which the retail business is present, as well as the United Kingdom, United States and Mexico. The second external evaluation sector will begin in 2022 (2022-2024 cycle).\n\n---\n\n64 Resolution of the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency dated 15 December 2020.

Promotion of socially responsible practices in the supply chain.\n\n- Description of the supply chain\n- Sustainable management of the supply chain\nDescription of the supply chain\n\nGRI 102-9\n\nThe Iberdrola group\u2019s supply chain consists of two different processes:\n\n- The procurement of material and equipment and the contracting of works and services, which is the responsibility of the group\u2019s Purchasing and Insurance Division.\n- The procurement of fuel, which is handled by the Wholesale and Retail Business.\n\nBoth processes are guided by the same principles embodied in the corporate policies and the Code of Ethics. However, each of them has specific characteristics in their various phases: registration and classification of suppliers, bidding process, execution of contracts, monitoring of contractual terms, and quality control.\n\nProcurement of material and equipment and contracting of works and services\n\nThe mission of the group\u2019s Purchasing and Insurance Division is to establish the strategy and procedures for and to supervise the purchasing of equipment and material (other than fuel), as well as works and services contracts and insurance programmes (other than life and casualty, health and pension insurance) for the entire Iberdrola group, meeting the strategic goals established by the Board of Directors and respecting at all times the company\u2019s Corporate Governance System:\n\nThe purchasing process is periodically audited both internally and by external entities, with no non-conformities having been identified during the financial year. Recommendations and opportunities for improvement that arise during these reviews are analysed and put into place in order to maintain continuous improvement in the processes.\n\nIberdrola placed orders with more than 19,000 suppliers during 2021. A breakdown of the economic and geographic volume is set out in the following table:\nGeneral supply of equipment, materials, works and services (millions of euros)\n\n|                | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| Spain          | 2,405| 2,070| 1,815|\n| United Kingdom | 1,225| 1,484| 2,014|\n| United States  | 3,031| 2,790| 2,583|\n| Brazil         | 1,400| 1,283| 1,622|\n| Mexico         | 395  | 507  | 510  |\n| IEI            | 967  | 360  | 173  |\n| **Total**      | 9,424| 8,494| 8,717|\n\nOf note in 2021 were the volumes invoiced by suppliers related to offshore wind projects in Europe and the United States, onshore wind in Spain, the United States and Australia, as well as investments in electricity distribution networks in Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom and Brazil.\n\nThe group\u2019s high purchasing volumes are a driver of growth for those countries in which the company engages in procurement, favouring their business, industrial and social development through the creation of employment at suppliers and contractors and their auxiliary industries.\n\n**Procurement of fuel**\n\nIberdrola dedicated more than \u20ac4,694 million to the procurement of natural gas and uranium in 2021. Uranium is procured in Spain and only through Empresa Nacional del Uranio (Enusa). Natural gas is procured on the international market, mainly through long-term commercial relationships with approximately 9 large domestic and international suppliers and market operators (producers and traders). These purchases are for the production of electricity (mainly in Mexico) and the distribution and sale of gas in the United States and the United Kingdom - Continental Europe, respectively.\n\n**Procurement of fuel (millions of euros)**\n\n|                | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|\n| Coal           | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| Natural Gas    | 4,639| 2,204| 3,210|\n| Uranium        | 55   | 55   | 70   |\n| **Total**      | 4,694| 2,259| 3,280|\n\n**Spending on local suppliers**\n\nIberdrola follows a local supplier strategy for its strategic contracting that has allowed for the creation of indirect employment and the maintenance of a strong industrial fabric in the geographical areas in which it does business.\n\nThe following table shows the percentage volume of purchasing from local suppliers:\n\n---\n\n65 Volume billed during the financial year. Amount awarded in 2021: \u20ac12,163 million.\n### GRI 204-1\n\n**Procurement or contracting of materials, equipment, works and services from local suppliers (%)**\n\n| Country       | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|---------------|------|------|------|\n| Spain         | 83.8 | 81.7 | 79.0 |\n| United Kingdom| 89.3 | 90.8 | 84.0 |\n| United States | 96.4 | 97.0 | 98.0 |\n| Brazil        | 99.3 | 99.6 | 99.0 |\n| Mexico        | 71.2 | 62.7 | 76.0 |\n| IEI           | 60.2 | 64.7 | 50.0 |\n| **Total**     | 87.9 | 89.0 | 89.0 |\n\n### Sustainable management of the supply chain\n\n#### GRI 102-9 204\n\n**Promotion of sustainability and social responsibility**\n\nIberdrola has the responsibility and the ability to motivate its suppliers to improve their environmental, ethical and social performance through actions that foster excellence in their management of sustainability.\n\n**Highest level commitment to the sustainability of our supply chain**\n\nIberdrola\u2019s commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards and their expansion to cover its main suppliers is embodied in the ambitious goal of ensuring that at least 70% of the group\u2019s main suppliers are subject to sustainable development policies and standards by 2022.\n\nThe significance of this goal is reflected by its inclusion in the 2020-2022 Strategic Bonus objective approved by General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting in 2020.\n\nSpecifically, the objective measures the number of key suppliers covered by sustainable development policies and standards, such as having a human rights strategy, a code of conduct for their suppliers, health and safety standards (SDG 3) and a global environmental sustainability strategy, including strategies on water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7) and biodiversity (SDGs 14 and 15).\n\nThe objective is based on a specific model of evaluation for the supply chain and has been integrated into the new systems implemented by the Purchasing Department, both in the supplier classification system and in the purchasing management system itself, including sustainability within decision-making.\n\n---\n\n66 Suppliers registered in the main countries in which Iberdrola does business are considered to be local based on the Tax ID assigned to the supplier.\nSupplier sustainability evaluation model\n\nIn 2021 the Purchasing Division consolidated the use of the global supplier sustainability evaluation model, which is conformed to the international reality of the Iberdrola group and organised around three core ESG pillars of sustainability.\n\nThe evaluation of a supplier measures the supplier\u2019s performance in highly significant attributes: identification of objectives linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), management of climate change risk, circular economy strategy, human rights due diligence, etc.\n\nThe supplier must provide supporting evidence and documentation for its statements and performance.\n\nThe following information is assessed as part of the three dimensions analysed:\n\n| Environmental | Social | Governance |\n|---------------|--------|------------|\n| 40%           | 30%    | 30%        |\n| \u2022 Existing Policies | \u2022 Human Rights | \u2022 Existing Policies |\n| \u2022 Management Systems | \u2022 Diversity | \u2022 SDGs |\n| \u2022 Greenhouse Gases | \u2022 Management Systems | \u2022 Ethics and Compliance |\n| \u2022 Biodiversity | \u2022 Contributions to Society | \u2022 Sanctions |\n| \u2022 Climate Change | \u2022 Reporting and Transparency | \u2022 Stakeholders |\n| \u2022 Water Management | | \u2022 Supply Chain |\n\nAfter the analysis, the suppliers are rated at two levels: \u201cadequate\u201d if their score exceeds 51 of 100 points (and at least 30% of the points on each of the ESG pillars), and \u201cinadequate\u201d otherwise.\n\nAt year-end 2021, more than 73% of the group\u2019s main suppliers awarded contracts in the 2020-2021 period already met the established criteria and followed sustainable development policies and standards.\n\nFurthermore, in 2021, \u20ac10,827 million have been allocated to suppliers evaluated on the basis of this ESG model. This amount represents 89% of the total amount awarded to the different suppliers making up the Iberdrola group\u2019s supply chain. Of this amount, \u20ac10,014 million (82.5% of the total) was awarded to suppliers surpassing the above mentioned level of sustainability.\n\nIt should be noted that in 2201, the objectives relating to the increase in purchases from key suppliers evaluated as \u201cadequate\u201d were met and that monitoring of improvement plans were introduced for those suppliers not achieving the minimum scores established by Iberdrola. To this end, improvement plans were sent to 529 suppliers of the group and 53% of them have improved their level of sustainability.\n\nNot only is the supplier motivated by this model to improve its profile by taking actions that promote excellence in business management, but the Purchasing Division is also incentivised through quantifiable objectives to choose those companies showing good performance in sustainability or making a commitment to improve.\nFactors evaluated for supplier classification\n\nIberdrola verifies that its suppliers' actions are aligned with the policies, principles and responsibilities of the group.\n\nThe requirements for classifying suppliers are:\n\n- **Supplier's Acceptance of the Code of Ethics**: This ensures the ethical principles that they must accept before entering into their contractual relationships.\n- **Comply with the Legislation of Each Country in Which It Operates**: Compliance with the applicable legislation in each of the countries in which the Iberdrola group carries out its activities.\n- **Stability**: Evidence of a stable financial situation, with no credit risk.\n- **Sustainability**: Environmental performance, human rights, ethics, SDGs, etc.\n- **Third Party Liability**: For certain contracts, a third party liability insurance policy appropriate to the needs will be required.\n\nFuel purchasing is also subject to the general principles of Iberdrola's sustainable development policies, which are intended to encourage suppliers to engage in activities that are socially responsible, respectful of the environment and preventive of occupational risks.\n\nIberdrola carries out an internal evaluation of its main fuel suppliers in accordance with economic, logistical, environmental and social standards. The aspects evaluated include: the existence of an environmental policy, information regarding CO2 emissions, emission reduction initiatives, energy efficiency, biodiversity conservation, occupational health and safety, equal opportunity, human rights and ethical behaviour (anti-bribery and anti-corruption practices).\n\nDuring 2021, three external complaints related to the supply chain were received through the channels set up for this purpose. One claim from a third party over a disagreement in the company's tendering process when it was unsuccessful and two claims of alleged collusion between employees and other suppliers. All three complaints were duly investigated and dismissed owing to lack of evidence. None of these complaints has resulted in the cancellation of any contract or order for reasons related to human rights, corruption, labour practices or environmental practices.\nSupplier environmental assessment\n\n**GRI 308**\n\nAlignment in Purchasing and in supplier management with respect to the environment and sustainability\n\nAt the end of 2021, the volume billed to the Iberdrola group by suppliers with a documented or certified environmental management system represented around 66.9% of the total volume billed (general suppliers).\n\nFuel purchasing is subject to the general principles of Iberdrola\u2019s social responsibility policies, which require that suppliers be encouraged to engage in conduct that is socially responsible, respectful of the environment and preventive of occupational risks. Fuel suppliers with a certified environmental management system represented 70% of those evaluated.\n\n**GRI 308-2**\n\nNo supplier with a significant negative environmental impact has been detected. Furthermore, Iberdrola does not have major suppliers located in areas with water stress.\n\nSupplier social assessment\n\n**GRI 414 414-2 407-1 408-1 409-1**\n\nThe contracting terms of the group for purchasing equipment, material, works and services, include specific supplier corporate social responsibility clauses based on the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the conventions of the International Labour Organization, the principles of the Global Compact, and compliance with the Code of Ethics. For other fuels, the company aims to include these clauses as new contracts are signed.\nDuring the term of the contract, the supplier must allow Iberdrola to review the level of compliance with the principles established in the contracts, and if non-compliance is detected and corrective plans are not adopted, the company reserves the right to cancel the contracts.\n\nAll major suppliers of general goods and equipment and of fuel (as most of them are long-term closed contracts still in effect) are assessed under this management approach and considering their material risks in relation to human rights and negative social impacts. These risks are mitigated and managed through the quality processes in place and the regular audits carried out by each business unit. This strategy will be reinforced in 2022 with a global campaign of social audits of key general goods suppliers to ensure compliance with the group\u2019s ESG criteria and to validate the supplier assessment model.\n\nBased on the sources consulted, and taking into account the suppliers of goods and services from countries identified in 2021 as being at high risk of human rights violations, the following risks may emerge:\n\n- in connection with the risk to freedom of association and collective bargaining, in 0.82% of the volume of purchases made in 2021,\n- in connection with child labour, in 0% of the total volume of purchases made in 2021, and\n- in connection with forced labour, in 0.82% of the total volume of purchases made.\n\nWith regard to fuel supplies, the percentage of purchases made in countries where there is a risk of violation of the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, child labour and forced labour was 0%.\n\nThere was no identification in 2021 of any contracting with suppliers that has generated incidents relating to freedom of association, collective bargaining, or the use of child or forced or compulsory labour, nor is there evidence of receiving complaints on these grounds. Nor have suppliers been detected with a material negative social impact, or incidents reported through the channels established for such purpose, resulting in the cancellation of orders or of contracts with group suppliers due to negative social impacts.\n\nHowever, during 2021, a potential risk was identified following several reports of forced labour in the Xinjiang region of China, linked to equipment for photovoltaic plants. Iberdrola reacted by requiring suppliers potentially exposed to such risk to scrupulously comply with the Code of Ethics and the commitments signed. Work is also being carried out on different ways to minimise this risk, including the possibility of conducting audits and looking into component traceability mechanisms, as part of the Solar Power Europe industry initiative.\n\n**Evaluation of supplier risks**\n\nIberdrola ensures the evaluation of supplier risk during the procurement process, as set forth in the *Purchasing Policy*. In particular, the following risks are identified: Credit risk, fraud risk, cybersecurity risk, CSR risk, human resources risk and tax risk.\n\n**Review of the provision of general supplies in countries presenting a risk of corruption**\n\nIn order to analyse the risk of corruption in procurement, the company uses the *Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 2020 (TI CPI 2020)* as a source to classify countries according to their level of risk.\n\n---\n\n67 Latest available at the date of preparation of this report.\nThe volumes of purchasing in countries classified according to said index based on their level of risk of corruption are set out in the following table:\n\n| Corruption risk | % of 2021 general supply purchases in countries on the CPI Index 2020 |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Purchasing in countries classified as low-risk | 81.1 |\n| Purchasing in countries classified as medium-risk | 0.2 |\n| Purchasing in countries classified as high-risk | 18.7 |\n\nBrazil and Mexico are the main countries classified as having a high risk of corruption by the aforementioned TI CPI 2020 and in which there have been purchases from registered suppliers. The purchasing volume is directly related to Iberdrola\u2019s presence and investment efforts in these countries, and is consistent with its practice of promoting the local industrial fabric.\n\nIberdrola has not made any significant purchase of general supplies from suppliers located in tax havens.\n\n**Review of the provision of fuel supplies in countries presenting a risk of corruption**\n\nAn analysis of the purchases of fuel shows the following ratios in 2021:\n\n| Corruption risk | % provisions of fuel in 2021 in countries included in the CPI 2020 index |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Provisions of fuel in countries classified as low-risk | 51.7 |\n| Provisions of fuel in countries classified as medium-risk | 0.0 |\n| Provisions of fuel in countries classified as high-risk | 48.3 |\n\nAccording to the aforementioned TI CPI 2020, Mexico and Brazil are the main countries with a high risk of corruption in which fuel has been purchased from registered suppliers. However, the company believes that the calculation should exclude these two countries because these purchases are made in strongly regulated environments that require contracting with state-owned companies. Excluding both countries from the calculation, the percentage of fuel purchasing in at high-risk countries would decrease to 0%.\n\n---\n\n68 Low-risk: country index \u2265 60 / Medium-risk: 59-50 / High risk: < 50 on a scale from 0 (perception of high levels of corruption) to 100 (perception of low levels of corruption).\n\n69 Low-risk: country index \u2265 60 / Medium-risk: 59-50 / High risk: < 50 on a scale from 0 (perception of high levels of corruption) to 100 (perception of low levels of corruption).\nV. Financial\nV.1. Sustainable economic growth\n\n- Economic/financial impact\n- ESG Finances\n- Taxonomy\nEconomic/financial impact\n\nGRI 201\nThe electricity industry is and will be a significant driver of the economy, to which it contributes by means of high investments and the creation of both direct and indirect high-quality jobs. An example of this is the energy model towards which Iberdrola undertook a deep transformation more than 20 years ago, a sustainable, safe and competitive model that would make it possible to address the fight against climate change. After more than \u20ac100,000 million of investment during this period, it has been able to generate a total annual employment impact of some 400,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs worldwide, contribute annually more than \u20ac35,000 million to global GDP, and make an annual tax contribution of more than \u20ac14,000 million.70\n\nGRI 201-1\n\nDirect economic value generated, distributed

addition to the direct economic impacts that occur as a result of the cash flows that are generated, the Iberdrola group also induces additional effects or indirect economic impacts such as those described below:\n\n#### GRI 203-2\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, the expansion of electricity systems drives the regional economy in the region where it occurs and creates employment opportunities, contributing to economic and social enhancement.\n\nThe positive effects at the local level include, among others, the improvement of the economy and employment (direct and indirect), the revitalisation and repopulation of underpopulated rural areas, the generation of fees, taxes and duties at the different stages of activity and areas of operation, the training of professionals, the support of local communities through different sponsorship initiatives, the promotion of economic development, and improvement of the quality of life through electrification, etc.\n\nLikewise, and at a general level, renewable projects help to reduce the overall CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the country where they are implemented, contributing to the decarbonisation not only of the region where they are located, but also of the country and the planet as a whole, thus helping to curb global warming and supporting each country\u2019s decarbonisation targets.\n\nPotentially negative effects, which the company seeks to avoid, can be considered to include the following:\n\n- Environmental risks, which may give rise to undesirable consequences for the environment, such as spills and improper emissions, or waste management.\n- The impact on terrain of the facilities, especially large ones, and the possible negative effects (during construction or operation) on traditional activities, particularly in the rural environment, such as ranching, hunting or fishing.\n\n#### GRI 203-1\n\nDuring the construction and operation of its facilities, Iberdrola also carries out certain infrastructure activities that are unrelated to its facilities and without a specific commercial purpose, but rather that are intended to meet the needs of the social environment, resolving existing shortcomings in the local communities.\n\nA summary of these projects with strong social impact during 2021 is provided below:\n\n---\n\n73 Investment tax credits.\n74 Production tax credits.\n\u2022 Improvement of paths and walkways, leading to a better quality of life for residents in the surrounding area.\n\n\u2022 In the United Kingdom, actions continue to be implemented to improve various infrastructures and to make landscape improvements for the enjoyment of people near the various production centres. There is also a visitor centre at the Whitelee wind farm, where visits are received from the general public and from school groups. In support of clean transport, ScottishPower Energy Networks, in partnership with Dumfries & Galloway Council, introduced two new \u00a31.04 million high-tech refuse collection vehicles, funded by ScottishPower Energy Networks\u2019 \u00a320 million Green Economy Fund. These vehicles were the first in the country serving routes in a rural area and were introduced in the local communities of Dumfries and Stranraer. In addition, Edinburgh's first all-electric double-decker buses were officially unveiled in partnership with Lothian, the municipal bus company.\n\n\u2022 In Brazil, the Quilombola culture programme is of particular note, especially the construction of the headquarters of the Quilombos de Santa Rosa Community Association, where different activities can be carried out. In addition, various workshops have been held in connection with this programme to gain a deeper insight into their culture and the activities they carry out.\n\n\u2022 In Mexico, an annual social contribution is made to the communities surrounding the projects. It is based on the following criteria: culture, sport, health, education and social development. In parallel, repairs are made to the roads used for on-site Operation and Maintenance tasks, and by local residents. Also noteworthy is the construction of the waiting room at the Huexco rural hospital.\n\n\u2022 Finally, one should note the partnership with Hydrographic Confederations and other entities in Spain, especially those focused on environmental issues, to enable various activities near hydroelectric reservoirs (sports events, support for the reproduction of certain species, etc., such as the international descent of the Sil River and the repopulation of eels in the J\u00facar and Mijares rivers), by adjusting flows at certain times.\nESG Finances\n\nIn keeping with its sustainable business model, Iberdrola is positioned as one of the world\u2019s leading and pioneering business groups in ESG financing. This has the threefold objective of (i) aligning its financial strategy with its purpose, values and investment strategy, (ii) optimising the cost of its debt, and (iii) diversifying its sources of financing, transforming sustainability into both an end and a means to the financial strength it pursues and which characterises it.\n\nIberdrola demonstrates this commitment to ESG financing in the various regions in which it operates and through the different instruments and formats it uses to finance itself.\n\nBy way of summary, at year-end 2021, the composition of the group\u2019s ESG financial operations portfolio was as follows:\n\n| IBERDROLA GROUP ESG FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS (31/12/2021) Millions of euros |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Green**                                                     | 20,922 |\n| Bonds                                                         | 14,961 |\n| Bank loans                                                    | 354    |\n| Multilateral loans                                            | 2,658  |\n| Structured funding                                            | 2,949  |\n| **Sustainable**                                               | 17,836 |\n| Loans                                                         | 250    |\n| Credit facilities                                             | 12,586 |\n| Commercial paper programmes                                   | 5,000  |\n| **Total ESG**                                                 | 38,758 |\n\nGreen finance transactions\n\nThe group has signed new green finance transactions in 2021 in the total amount of \u20ac7,080\\(^{75}\\) million. This brings the total amount of green finance at the end of 2021 to \u20ac20,922 million\\(^{75}\\).\n\nThe differentiating feature of this financing is the commitment to use the funds to invest in environmentally sustainable and socially responsible projects, fundamentally in renewable energy; expansion and digitalisation of electricity transmission and distribution grids; researching new, more efficient technologies; or in intelligent mobility projects. The company also commits to regularly report the environmental return that its investments in these projects have yielded during the respective period.\n\nThe funds secured through all these operations have gone towards financing or refinancing investments in projects that meet certain environmental and sustainable development criteria, as described in Iberdrola\u2019s respective Frameworks\\(^{76}\\) for green financing, AVANGRID or Neoenergia. These Frameworks are aligned with the Green Bond Principles endorsed by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA).\n\n---\n\n\\(^{75}\\) Including 100% of the financing in which Iberdrola participates with partners.\n\n\\(^{76}\\) Iberdrola Framework for Green Financing, Avangrid Framework for Green Financing and Green Finance Framework do Grupo Neoenergia\nGreen bonds\n\nFor public bond issues, Iberdrola relies on VigeoEiris to validate the green nature of its transactions. VigeoEiris delivers its assessment not only on the transaction and the projects it finances, but also on the issuer's overall sustainability policy. These opinions are available on the corporate website, in the Information related to green finance section, and they are more than satisfactory in all cases.\n\nIn the capital markets, for yet another year Iberdrola is the world's leading corporate group in terms of green bonds issued. The company issued its first green bond in 2014, and since then has intensified its financing through this type of instrument, with many more issues and in various areas: both public and private issues, involving senior and subordinated debt (hybrid bonds) issued by the Corporation or other subsidiaries (AVANGRID green bonds and Neoenergia green debentures and all other companies under these sub-groups).\n\nAt year-end 2021, Iberdrola has a total of 15 current green bonds issued by the Corporation in the total amount of \u20ac11,994 million. Information and details on these transactions can be found in the 2021 Report on Green Financing Returns.\n\nIn addition, Iberdrola, through its subsidiary AVANGRID and several of its subsidiaries, has green bonds outstanding in the US market in the combined amount of 2,725 million dollars aimed at financing renewable and distribution projects in the United States. Information and details on these transactions is described in the Avangrid 2021 Sustainability Report.\n\nNeoenergia and its subsidiaries also have green transactions outstanding on the capital markets, totalling R$3,560 million, earmarked for financing renewable and transmission or distribution projects in Brazil. Information and details of these transactions is described in the Neoenergia 2021 Sustainability Report.\n\nGreen loans in the banking market\n\nIn the banking market, Iberdrola received the first green loan obtained by an energy company in 2017, which was followed by other green transactions. In 2018 Iberdrola M\u00e9xico, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Iberdrola, executed the first green corporate loan in Latin America for US$400 million, which was used to refinance the company\u2019s renewables assets in Mexico.\n\nGreen project financing\n\nIn 2020 Iberdrola signed its first green Project Financing through its 63.55%-owned subsidiary Iberdrola Renovables de la Rioja, S.A., provided by BBVA in the amount of \u20ac23.377 million, to refinance 12 wind farms in La Rioja.\n\nIn 2021 Iberdrola signed 2 green Project Finance agreements through its subsidiaries Parques E\u00f3licos Alto Layna, S.L.U and Energ\u00edas Renovables Ibermap, S.L., 20% owned subsidiaries of Iberdrola, granted by BBVA for \u20ac106.78 million, and by BBVA, Banco Santander and BNP for \u20ac191.879 million, respectively, to refinance wind farms in Spain.\n\n77 Outstanding balance of Iberioja loan at 31/12/2021: \u20ac14 million. The Iberioja loan had a Second Party Opinion from G-Advisory. Iberdrola Renovables de la Rioja is a company that is 63.55 %-owned by Iberdrola.\n78 The Parques E\u00f3licos Alto de Layna loan had a Second Party Opinion from G-Advisory. Parques E\u00f3licos Alto de Layna is a company that is 20 %-owned by Iberdrola.\n79 The Energ\u00edas Renovables Ibermap loan had a Second Party Opinion from G-Advisory. IEnerg\u00edas Renovables Ibermap is a company that is 20%-owned by Iberdrola.\nIn September 2021 AVANGRID signed the first green financing deal for an offshore wind project in the United States, the 800 MW Vineyard Wind I offshore wind farm. The financing has been structured through a US$2,344 million project finance arrangement. Information on this transaction is described in the Avangrid 2020 Sustainability Report.\n\nIn 2021 AVANGRID increased its financing under the form of Green Tax Equity Investment to US$637 million through two new transactions, the Aeolus VII and Aeolus VIII portfolios, with Tax Equity Investment investors. Information and details on these transactions is described in the Avangrid 2021 Sustainability Report.\n\nGreen loans with development institutions\n\nWith regard to green loans, in May 2019, Iberdrola obtained its first green loan from development institutions and since then it has continued to execute a series of green corporate loans with development banks for assets under construction, specifically: i) with the multilateral European Investment Bank (EIB), and ii) with Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO), a Spanish state-owned bank, in the total amount of \u20ac2,201 million. These public institutions have their own standards for evaluating projects and for allocating green instruments. All of the assets financed by these institutions are included as projects capable of green financing within the framework of Iberdrola\u2019s green financing.\n\nTwo loans have been signed with multilateral or development institutions in 2021:\n\n- Green loan with the European Investment Bank, in the total amount of \u20ac600 million, to modernise, automate and adapt distribution networks to the electrification of consumption.\n- First Green Hydrogen loan signed with the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) in the amount of \u20ac6 million for the project to supply green hydrogen to Barcelona\u2019s municipal transport company. This project was labelled as a Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) project and received a grant from the European Union.\n\nIn December 2021, Neoenergia signed a \u20ac200 million green loan with the EIB to finance renewable projects in Brazil, bringing the total amount financed by the EIB to Neoenergia at year-end 2021 to \u20ac457 million. Information on this transaction is described in the Neoenergia 2021 Sustainability Report.\n\nFurther details on these green operations and their sustainability returns can be found in the Report on Green Financing Returns for transactions carried out by the Corporation, the AVANGRID Sustainability Report (for transactions carried out by AVANGRID and subsidiaries) and the Neoenergia Sustainability Report (for transactions carried out by Neoenergia and subsidiaries).\n\nFinancial transactions linked to the achievement of sustainable objectives\n\nThe group has also entered into other financial agreements bearing the ESG, or sustainability, label. These are transactions that, rather than earmarking funds, link certain elements of the instrument to sustainability metrics or the achievement of strategic objectives aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, the credit facilities that the group has in place to manage and optimise its liquidity, or commercial paper, a very short-term financing instrument.\n\n---\n\n80 The green ICO Loan for Electric Mobility had a Second Party Opinion from G-Advisory.\nAs in the case of green financing transactions, most of the financial transactions linked to the achievement of sustainable objectives are also certified by an independent expert in terms of the alignment of the established metrics and targets with the company's sustainable strategy and with the Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles (SLLP).\n\nCredit facilities linked to sustainable objectives\n\nAt year-end 2021, Iberdrola has a volume of credit facilities with costs linked to achieving sustainable objectives in the aggregate amount of \u20ac12,586 million available to the Corporation and to AVANGRID. The main objectives set out in these credit facilities are associated with environmental and social KPIs:\n\n- \u20ac1,500 million sustainable syndicated credit facility:\n  - Environmental KPI: Renewable capacity installed in the group.\n  - Social KPI: number of people in developing countries benefiting from electricity access.\n\n- \u20ac5,300 million sustainable syndicated credit facility:\n  - Environmental KPI: intensity of CO\u2082 emissions, measured in grams per kilowatt hour produced (g/KWh).\n\nIn 2021, a new facility was signed in the amount of \u20ac2,500 million. This new credit line is subject to two sustainability indicators, linked to environmental and social targets. The first of these concerns the reduction of emissions intensity, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 and 13. The second indicator is associated with increasing the number of women in leadership positions in the company, in line with UN SDG 5.\n\nThese same indicators are also included in another new 5-year credit line of JPY 16,000 million signed in June 2021.\n\nFurthermore, on 23 November 2021 AVANGRID extended the maturity and limit of the syndicated credit facility signed in 2018 until 2026 and up to US$3,575 million respectively, maintaining the initial indicator that requires reducing CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nESG commercial paper\n\nOn 15 April 2021 Iberdrola formalised the update of its framework programme for the issuance of short-term notes in the Euromarket (ECP), increasing the maximum outstanding limit to \u20ac5,000 million (from the previous figure of \u20ac3,000 million) and incorporating the sustainable label linked to the achievement of three objectives associated with the areas of the ESG strategy:\n\na. Environmental: intensity of CO\u2082 emissions, measured in grams per kilowatt hour produced (gr/KWh) (contribution to SDGs 7, 13).\n\nb. Social: Percentage of women in positions of leadership in the company (contribution to SDG 5).\n\nc. Governance: Implementation of the eleven recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) (contribution to SDG 16).\n\nFinancial transactions in the circular economy\n\nIberdrola has secured the first loan in the European energy sector linked to the reduction of water consumption, in the amount of \u20ac250 million. The operation includes an incentive linked to meeting certain circular economy objectives.\nTaxonomy\n\nThis section complies with the reporting obligations established by Article 8 of European Union Regulation 852/2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investments, supplemented by Delegated Regulation 2139/2021, which determines eligible activities with respect to climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, and in accordance with Delegated Regulation 2178/2021, which develops the reporting methodology.\n\nUnder this regulatory framework, companies are required to report their eligibility and alignment through three economic indicators; as a percentage of turnover, investment and operating expenditure.\n\nIn 2021 the reporting obligation is limited to the percentage of eligibility, representing the weight of the activities described by Royal Decree 2139/2021. For subsequent years, these eligible activities will have to be analysed from the point of view of alignment with the Taxonomy.\n\nThe eligible activities performed by the companies of the Iberdrola group are also eligible under the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives.\n\nThe weights of the eligible activities in the Iberdrola group are presented in the table below.\n\n| Revenues (Thousands of euros) | OpEx (Thousands of euros) | Investments (Thousands of euros) |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Total eligible activities (a) | 19,615,644                | -2,601,982                       | 8,201,822                        |\n| Total Iberdrola group (b)     | 39,113,454                | -4,051,718                       | 9,531,354                        |\n| Eligibility percentage (a/b) %| 50.2 %                    | 64.2 %                           | 86.0 %                           |\n\nEligible activities included in the values shown above, according to the nomenclature of Annex I and II of the Delegated Regulation, are: 3.1 Hydrogen production, 4.1 Electricity generation from photovoltaic solar technology, 4.3 Electricity generation using wind energy, 4.5 Electricity generation using hydropower, 4.9 Transmission and distribution of electricity, 4.1 Electricity storage, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of: charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings, instruments and devices for measuring, regulating and controlling the energy efficiency of buildings, and renewable energy.\n\nThe criteria applied to calculate the eligibility percentages (ratio published in this report) are described below.\n\n---\n\n81 This heading includes the following products sold:\nSmart Home: control of the energy consumption of each household appliance, changes in consumption and advice on how to save on bills.\nSmart Mobility: solution for charging electric vehicles with 100% renewable energy. Installation of a charging point, electric contract with zero CO\u2082 emissions and control from mobile phone with the Smart Mobility Home App.\nSmart Solar: complete solar solution, with installation and maintenance of solar panels so that customers can generate their own electricity.\nCalculation of the percentage of eligible turnover\n\nThe proportion of eligible Turnover referred to in Article 8(2a) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is calculated as the share of net turnover resulting from products or services, including intangibles, associated with economic activities that are eligible according to the taxonomy (numerator), divided by the net turnover (denominator) as defined in Article 2(5) of Directive 2013/34/EU.\n\nTurnover includes revenue recognised in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, paragraph 82(a), as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008.\n\nTherefore, for the calculation of the eligibility percentages corresponding to the consolidated Iberdrola group, and included in the table above:\n\n- the numerator includes the sum of the Turnover (group 70 ledger accounts of the Spanish General Accounting Plan) of the activities of the companies/subgroups that are eligible and,\n- the denominator corresponds to the Iberdrola group\u2019s total amount of turnover.\n\nIn this turnover ratio, the company includes all the income associated with the main activity, considering that it contributes to the turnover.\n\nCalculation of the percentage of eligible CapEx\n\nThe eligible CapEx ratio referred to in Article 8(2b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is calculated as the numerator divided by the denominator; the denominator being the additions to tangible and intangible assets during the relevant financial year before depreciation, amortisation and any new valuations, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for the relevant financial year, excluding changes in fair value. The denominator also includes additions to tangible and intangible assets resulting from business combinations.\n\nFor non-financial companies applying International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008, CapEx should cover costs that are recognised according to:\n\na. IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment, paragraph 73(e)(i) and (iii);\n\nb. IAS 38 Intangible Assets, paragraph 118(e)(i);\n\nc. IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 79(d)(i) and (ii) (for the cost model);\n\nd. IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53(h).\n\nLeases that do not give rise to the recognition of a right to use the asset are not accounted for as CapEx.\n\nThe numerator, on the other hand, includes the part of the fixed asset investments included in the denominator that:\n\na. relates to assets or processes that are associated with eligible economic activities;\nb. forms part of a plan to expand the economic activities aligned with the taxonomy or to enable economic activities eligible under the taxonomy to be brought into line with the taxonomy in the future (\"CapEx plan\") under the conditions specified in the second paragraph of this point 1.1.2.2 (relating to the \"CapEx plan\");\n\nc. relates to the purchase of production from economic activities aligned with the taxonomy and individual measures that enable the targeted activities to become low-carbon or achieve greenhouse gas reductions, in particular the activities listed in points 7.3 to 7.6 of Annex I of the Annexes to the Delegated Act, as well as other economic activities listed in the Delegated Acts adopted pursuant to Articles 10(3), 11(3), 12(2), 14(2) and 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that those measures are implemented and operational within 18 months.\n\nTherefore, for the calculation of the eligibility percentages corresponding to the consolidated Iberdrola group, and included in the table above:\n\n- the numerator includes only the CapEx aggregation of the activities of the companies/subgroups considered eligible and,\n- the denominator corresponds to the Iberdrola group's total CapEx, which includes investments (on an accrual basis with current or future disbursement) in intangible assets, investments in property, plant and equipment, investments in rights-of-use assets, and investments. CapEx includes the work carried out by the company for its fixed assets and capitalised financial expenses.\n\nFor the purpose of reporting the CapEx and OpEx ratio, purchases of assets necessary to carry out a particular eligible activity have been included.\n\n**Calculation of the percentage of eligible OpEx**\n\nThe eligible OpEx ratio referred to in Article 8(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is calculated as the numerator divided by the denominator; the latter including non-capitalised direct costs associated with research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repairs, as well as other direct costs related to the day-to-day maintenance of tangible fixed assets, by the company or a third party to whom activities are outsourced, and which are necessary to ensure the continuous and efficient operation of those assets.\n\nIn addition, non-financial companies that apply national GAAP and do not capitalise right-of-use assets are required to include leasing costs in OpEx.\n\nThe numerator, on the other hand, includes the part of the operating expenses included in the denominator that:\n\na. relates to assets or processes associated with eligible economic activities including training and other human resource adaptation needs, and non-capitalised direct costs representing research and development;\n\nb. forms part of the CapEx plan to expand the economic activities eligible according to the taxonomy or to enable economic activities eligible under the taxonomy to be aligned with the taxonomy within a pre-defined timeframe, as set out in the second paragraph of this point 1.1.3.2 (relating to the \"CapEx plan\");\nC. relates to the purchase of production from economic activities aligned with the taxonomy and individual measures that enable the targeted activities to become low-carbon or achieve greenhouse gas reductions, as well as individual building renovations, as identified in the Delegated Acts adopted pursuant to Articles 10(3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that those measures are implemented and operational within 18 months.\n\nTherefore, for the calculation of the eligibility percentages corresponding to the consolidated Iberdrola group, and included in the table above, all the costs defined in the Net Operating Expenses section of the income statement have been considered for the OpEx indicator. Income from the results of non-current assets, income from disposed facilities and deferred income associated with property, plant and equipment are excluded from the Net Operating Expense. In addition, the company includes in the operating expenses figure all the direct personnel expenses associated with this activity, as it considers these expenses to be necessary for the development of its activities. For the purpose of reporting the OpEx ratio, the processes and services necessary to carry out a particular eligible activity have also been included. Also excluded are the costs for the provision of services from the corporations to the businesses, and:\n\n- the denominator includes the expenditure of the aforementioned items for the entire Iberdrola group and,\n- the numerator will be formed by the same items, but only from the activities of the eligible companies/subgroups.\n\nFinally, the controls that ensure the homogeneity of currencies, accounting criteria and the avoidance of duplicate amounts or intercompany balances are the controls carried out during the process of preparing the audited consolidated financial statements of the Iberdrola group. In addition, Registration and Presentation controls have been included in the files prepared to obtain the data referring to the Taxonomy.\nVI. About this report\n\n- VI.1.

It therefore corresponds to the global boundary defined above.\n\nReport boundary (Iberdrola total)\n\nComprising Iberdrola, S.A. and the consolidated subsidiaries under its control, which operate in the countries and carry out the activities shown in the table below.\n\n### Significant countries and activities for the Iberdrola group in terms of sustainability and included in the 2021 reporting boundary\n\n| Group office | Electricity production | Transmission and/or Distribution of electricity or gas | Electricity and/or gas supply (2) (3) | Gas storage | Real estate |\n|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|------------|\n|              | Conventional | Renewable (4) | Wholesale market | Retail market |             |            |\n| Spain(5)     | X          | X            | X                  | LIB /REG | X          |\n| United Kingdom | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| United States | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       | REG        |\n| Brazil       | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       | REG        |\n| Mexico       | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       | X          |\n| Portugal     | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| Australia    | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| Germany      | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| Greece       | X          | X(6)         | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| Hungary      | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| France       | X          | X(7)         | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| Poland       | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| Romania      | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| Italy        | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| Ireland      | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| Canada       | X          | X            | X                  | LIB       |            |\n| Other countries (9) | X | X | X | LIB |            |\n\n1. The countries set out herein are those in which the company does business, with facilities and employees. Countries in which the company makes purchases of general supplies and procures fuel are not included. The workforce reported is as at year-end.\n\n2. Types of sales activities:\n   - LIB: activities in liberalised markets, independent of distribution activities.\n   - REG: activities in regulated markets, together with distribution activities. The supply to these markets has not been considered as an activity in the wholesale market.\n\n---\n\n83 With regard to co-controlled subsidiaries, such as companies owning nuclear generation assets, in addition to installed capacity and production indicators, other indicators are reported where considered relevant.\n3. Environmental information on sales activities in Germany and the Republic of Ireland is not consolidated, because it is not yet integrated into the corporate systems as at the date of preparation of this report. It will be included in future reports to the extent the systems collect this information. These activities are not considered to be material in the context of the group.\n\n4. It includes the activities of hydroelectric, wind and solar generation. Environmental information on construction projects is not included, except in the area of biodiversity.\n\n5. Any reference to the 7th Collective Bargaining Agreement includes the following companies at 31 December 2021: Iberdrola, S.A., Iberdrola Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U., Iberdrola Generaci\u00f3n, S.A.U., Iberdrola Generaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U., Iberdrola Generaci\u00f3n Nuclear, S.A.U., Iberdrola Clientes, S.A.U., Iberdrola Operaci\u00f3n y Mantenimiento, S.A.U., i-DE Redes El\u00e9ctricas Inteligentes, S.A. (Sociedad Unipersonal), Iberdrola Infraestructuras y Servicios de Redes, S.A.U., Iberdrola Renovables Energ\u00eda, S.A.U. and Iberdrola Ingenier\u00eda y Construcci\u00f3n, S.A.U.\n\n6. Renewables activities in Cyprus are included in Greece.\n\n7. Activities related to the Saint Brieuc offshore facility, currently under development, as well as Aalto Power\u2019s assets.\n\n8. Activities are not significant from the environmental standpoint. Labour information is included in the information for the United States.\n\n9. Other countries: Bulgaria, Qatar, Netherlands, Japan, Luxembourg, South Africa, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Morocco. In social information relating to people (excluding salary data), Belgium, Bulgaria, Qatar, Japan, Latvia, Singapore, Vietnam are reported. These countries are not included in the environmental information or the other social information as the activities are not considered relevant in terms of sustainability.\n\nAt affiliate nuclear plants, the percentage interest held by Iberdrola in each of them is used to consolidate environmental performance data: Vandell\u00f3s (28%), Almaraz (52.69%); Trillo (49%) and Asc\u00f3 (15%). For social information, on the other hand, because of the structure of the available information systems, nuclear plants are consolidated according to the percentage interest held by Iberdrola in the economic interest grouping created for that purpose; such interest is 51.44% in the case of Trillo-Almaraz and 14.59% in the case of Asc\u00f3-Vandell\u00f3s. A 50% share of the environmental and social data corresponding to the activities of Nuclenor, S.A. is applied according to consolidation by the equity method.\n\nSummary of the information boundaries by country\n\nFollowing the GRI recommendation, the information in this report is structured by country. The table below shows the structure of information by country applied to the boundaries described above:\n\n| Structure of information by country in this report |\n|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Report boundary (Iberdrola Total) = Iberdrola, S.A., controlled subsidiaries and co-controlled affiliates considered to be significant for sustainability purposes. |\n| Spain |\n| United Kingdom |\n| United States |\n| Brazil |\n| Mexico |\n| IEI: Australia, France, Germany, Greece (incl. Cyprus), Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania |\n| (*) IEI also includes Belgium, Bulgaria, Qatar, Japan, Latvia, Singapore and Vietnam in the social information relating to people. |\n| Global boundary (consolidated Iberdrola Total) = report boundary plus the information of affiliates consolidated by the equity method that are not considered significant for purposes of this report. |\n| Information reflected in the corporate boundary of the Consolidated Financial Statements. |\nLimitations on the scope of information\n\nIberdrola believes that this report reflects the economic, environmental and social performance of the company in a reasonable and balanced manner, on the understanding that the exceptions to the scope of the report described in the table \u201cSignificant countries and activities for the Iberdrola group in terms of sustainability and included in the 2021 reporting boundary\u201d do not significantly alter the consolidated indicators and therefore do not affect the reader\u2019s assessment of the company\u2019s performance.\n\nExplanatory footnotes are added in case a particular indicator could not be compiled in accordance with the reporting boundary. In addition, the following GRI indicators GRI 302-1 303-3 303-4 303-5 304-1 304-4 305-5 306-4 412-2 do not include Neoenergia Brasilia, which became part of the Iberdrola group in 2021.\n\nSignificant changes to the organisation and its supply chain\n\nGRI 102-10\n\nChanges in activities and/or in operations\n\nIn the course of their business, the various subsidiaries and affiliates of Iberdrola have engaged in transactions that change the composition of their assets in 2021, including the following:\n\n- In the Wholesale and Retail Business, the largest complex in Europe for green hydrogen for industrial use has been built. The plant has a capacity of 20 MW of electrolysers and is fed from a 100 MW photovoltaic solar plant with 20 MWh of battery storage capacity. The complex, located in Puertollano (Ciudad Real), will enter operation in early 2022 and will supply green hydrogen to produce green fertilisers at the Fertiberia plant.\n\n  Construction was also completed on the first commercial plant for producing and dispensing green hydrogen for heavy mobility. The plant, for public use, has been operational since January 2022 and will supply the new fleet of green hydrogen buses of Tranports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) and will also enable other logistics operators in the area to decarbonise.\n\n- In the Renewables Business, the following notable corporate transactions were carried out during the year.\n  - In Japan, Iberdrola Renewables Japan K.K. acquired a 34.9% stake in Aomori-Seihoku-Oki Offshore Wind from Hitachi Zosen with a view to developing a 600 MW offshore wind project in Round 2 (expected to be awarded in 2022); this would mark Iberdrola\u2019s first wind farm in Japan.\n  - In Taiwan, Iberdrola Renewables Taiwan has been formed to bid in offshore wind tenders.\n  - In Ireland, a 90% stake in three pipeline projects of up to 3 GW of offshore wind has been acquired from DP Energy.\n  - In Poland, a framework agreement was signed with partner SeaWind to form a joint venture for developing offshore wind farms.\nFinally, AVANGRID Renewables announced the restructuring of Vineyard Wind, LLC in a joint venture with Copenhagen Infrastructure (CIP). Vineyard One will remain a 50/50 joint venture, with AVANGRID Renewables taking full ownership of lease area 534, housing the Park City Wind (804 MW) and Commonwealth Wind (1,200 MW) projects, and CIP retaining 100% of lease area 522.\n\nIn Poland, the group reached an agreement with CEE Equity Partner for the acquisition of 163 MW of new renewable capacity in the country: two projects, with a capacity of 112.5 MW, are already in operation, while the third, with a capacity of 50.4 MW, is currently under construction.\n\nIn Vietnam, the group acquired Sowitec Vietnam, with a portfolio of 550 MW of renewable energy in the country, spread over six projects.\n\nIberdrola signed an agreement with GS Energy for the joint development of projects in South Korea and other Asian regions.\n\nIn terms of organic growth in the Renewables Business, highlights include the Francisco Pizarro photovoltaic plant (590 MW - Spain), the Golden Hills wind farm (201 MW - United States), the Chafariz wind farm complex (471 MW - Brazil), the Port Augusta wind-solar hybrid project (317 MW - Australia), the Gouvaes and Daivoes hydroelectric plants (998 MW - Portugal) and the 50 MW batteries at Whitelee (United Kingdom), Gormans (Ireland) and Wallgrove (Australia).\n\nChanges in capital structure\n\nThe shareholders acting at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of Iberdrola held on 18 June 2021 approved two increases in capital by means of a scrip issue in order to once again implement the Iberdrola Retribuci\u00f3n Flexible optional dividend system, implementing the first increase in capital in July 2021 and the second in February 2022. To offset the dilutive effect of the capital increases and to maintain earnings per share, a capital reduction was implemented in July 2021 under the terms approved at the aforementioned Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\n\nChanges in supply chain\n\nThere were no significant changes in the company\u2019s supply chain during the financial year.\nVI.2. Defining report content. Materiality Analysis\nIberdrola directly identifies material aspects for its Stakeholders and for the company itself, by preparing an in-house Materiality Study conducted with the advice of an independent outside firm and by consulting in-house and outside sources. Iberdrola uses this process to identify economic, social, environmental and governance issues that are significant to its focus on sustainable development.\n\nIberdrola also takes into account the Topics of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards as well as the Electric Utility Sector Supplement in this analysis. Together with these global processes of identification of and response to material issues, the company also has a Global Stakeholder Engagement Model, which, although initially based on the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard (AA1000SES, 2015) in its process of implementation already includes the four requirements of the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles 2018 (AA1000AP, 2018), i.e. inclusiveness, materiality, responsiveness and impact, as described in the \u201cStakeholder engagement\u201d section of chapter IV.2.\n\nAll topics reported are specifically identified in the GRI Content Index that is included in this chapter of the report. In its commitment to transparency with its Stakeholders, apart from the topics of the GRI Standards identified as material in the table below, Iberdrola also reports on other topics included in such Standards.\n\nThe analysis for 2021 classifies those topics of interest identified through the analysis in accordance with their significance both to Stakeholders as well as to the company\u2019s strategy. In this way, 18 material topics have been identified, of which 9 topics are considered \u201cpriority\u201d. The following image shows the result of the analysis:\n\nThe various sections of this report offer a concrete response to the aspects identified, as shown in the following table:\n\n---\n\n84 Iberdrola has been continuously applying Assurance Standard AA1000 for the last eleven years. In 2016 Iberdrola\u2019s Operating Committee approved a Global Stakeholder Engagement Model, which was implemented for the first time in 2017.\n### Main material topics 2021\n\n| Priority topics                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Iberdrola\u2019s response                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Energy transition**            | \u2022 Transition towards a low-carbon economy.
