To increase management efficiency and speed, we simplified our structure, grouping together businesses with similar characteristics organized into three sectors: Digital Systems & Services (DSS), Green Energy & Mobility (GEM) and Connective Industries (CI).

By combining Lumada with global business portfolios built up in each region and business, Hitachi will further accelerate its global rollout and expand the value created and realized through the Social Innovation Business on a global scale.\nManagement\n\nCEO\u2019s Message\nChief Sustainability Officer\u2019s Message\nHitachi Group Identity\nSustainability Management\nEngagement and Initiatives\nExternal Assessments and Awards\nSupport people\u2019s quality of life with data and technology that fosters a sustainable society\n\nIn the wake of the financial crisis following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Hitachi made a major shift to the Social Innovation Business, which aims to solve social issues through co-creation with customers, leveraging our core strengths in IT (Information Technology) \u00d7 OT (Operational Technology) \u00d7 Products. For about 10 years until last fiscal year, as one CEO passed the baton to another, we have been on a transformational journey to reform our business structure to further expand our Social Innovation Business.\n\nThe three-year term of our Mid-term Management Plan 2021 was, in a sense, about putting the finishing touches on this process of structural reform. Our key objective to become a global leader in the Social Innovation Business guided us to focus our resources on building a global business foundation. Acquiring global leader ABB\u2019s Power Grids business (currently Hitachi Energy) provided us with core infrastructure in the environmental business that is essential for renewable energy use. Further, our acquisition of GlobalLogic, a leading-edge digital engineering firm that is growing rapidly on its strength in collaborating with customers, gave us the global base needed for our Lumada-focused digital business.\n\nIn the Mid-term Management Plan 2024, Hitachi aspires to \u201csupport people\u2019s quality of life with data and technology that fosters a sustainable society.\u201d In our business activities, we must be mindful of planetary boundaries\u2014tipping points for destructive changes to the global environment\u2014and act to protect the planet. In the social aspect, our next major objective is \u201cwellbeing\u201d\u2014where every individual can fully express their individuality and play an active role. Hitachi focuses on research and development that will enable us to use data and technology to build a sustainable society that does not exceed planetary boundaries while realizing wellbeing. We have set an overall theme for our Mid-term Management Plan 2024\u2014\u201cFrom structural reform to organic growth\u201d\u2014which will pave the way for growth over the next ten years by earning the trust of our customers as their partner in finding solutions to issues.\n\nTo meet expectations from global initiatives and stakeholders, we have identified six key material\nWe will leverage this new framework to achieve the targets of contributing to reduce CO2 emissions by 100 million metric tons annually by fiscal 2024 and also achieving carbon neutrality in the value chain by fiscal 2050.\n\nWe must not lose sight of the fact that the most important factor in continuing to provide value to our customers and the broader society to build a sustainable world is our people. The driving force behind the evolution of our Social Innovation Business is the talents from all over the world who identify with our purpose of solving social issues. Solving increasingly complex social issues requires creativity that goes beyond conventional thinking. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is the key to achieving this. It is crucial that we encourage collaboration across organizations, regions and generations, and build an equitable and inclusive organization where our diverse talents are able to play an active role. We will develop talents and foster a corporate culture that enables each and every employee to see social issues as their own and to fulfill their best with passion, thereby improving engagement with employees.\n\nTo address environmental challenges such as climate change, social issues such as urban population growth, and new social issues that we cannot even predict at this time, Hitachi will take on the challenges and grow through co-creation with our customers and other stakeholders. I invite you to keep your eyes on Hitachi, as we move into the future.\nHitachi believes a strong commitment to sustainability will be the Growth Driver. Sustainability is not a cost nor is it for compliance. It is a value creation for the business first, and as a consequence, for society. It is important to clarify that sustainability is not a concept up in the air, something nice to have, but it\u2019s a key driver for any business to survive in the mid-to-long term future. It has become increasingly accepted that the objective of maximizing shareholder value requires not only top competitive performance, but also the attention to a variety of sustainability\u2019s issues.\n\nAs indicated in the Mid-term Management Plan 2024, we aim to enhance our corporate value through sustainability with a focus on planetary boundaries and wellbeing.\n\nSpeaking to the environment, to accelerate and promote the achievement of Hitachi\u2019s long-term environmental targets as measures, Hitachi developed two business strategies, GX for GROWTH (customer and society decarbonization) and GX for CORE (Hitachi decarbonization). Under GX for GROWTH, we will support customers in reducing CO\u2082 emissions by expanding Hitachi\u2019s greener and more efficient product portfolio and providing customers with End to End (E2E) solutions across sectors. By fiscal 2024, we aim to contribute to reduce CO\u2082 emissions by approximately 100 million metric tons per year. We will accelerate the development of various solutions realizing energy transition, the electrification of mobility and the energy saving. GX for CORE aims to decarbonize our own operations. We aim to achieve reductions in Scope 1 and 2 by investing approximately 37 billion yen over the next three years to meet the carbon neutrality target in fiscal 2030 and 50% CO\u2082 emissions reduction throughout the value chain by the same fiscal year. In addition, we launched a framework for issuing green bonds to mobilize more funds to accelerate activities toward carbon neutrality. Based on these efforts, including preparation of SBTi net zero certification, we aim to improve ESG evaluation.\n\nAt the same time, we are also looking to the future by investing in the R&D of green technologies, such as hydrogen, methanation, and Direct Air Capture (DAC).\n\nHitachi supported COP26 held on November 2021 as 1st Principal Partner in Japanese companies. In COP26, Hitachi had opportunities to discuss with VIPs such as Ministers and present our activities in several events. Through these activities in COP26, we developed good\nManagement\n\nrelationships with stakeholders including government. We recognize that we have a role to play as part of the global community. Through COP26, we were able to demonstrate our strong commitment to climate action. We will focus on advancing decarbonization with our clients and partners to deliver our commitment pledged in COP26. We will continue to monitor the development in COP27.\n\nIn terms of society, Hitachi believes that, through the inclusion of diverse talents, we will be able to collaborate and create innovation in data and technology in the digital age to realize a sustainable society and support people\u2019s wellbeing. In addition to strengthening the acquisition and development of digital talents, we aim to enhance employee engagement by creating a culture in which every employee can contribute in solving social issues, and a work environment in which Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are fostered on a global scale, thereby achieving both business growth and a sustainable society.\n\nAll of the above are in line with Hitachi\u2019s mission to contribute to society but respecting human rights is essential. It is indispensable for the development and sustainability of the company. In accordance with the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, we are promoting human rights due diligence (HRDD) and other efforts to embed human rights risk management into our operation and too see that people\u2019s rights and dignity are respected throughout the value chain.\n\nWe look forward to co-creating solutions with our customers, partners, and the global community to solve sustainable issues. Together, we will innovate for a sustainable society.\nHitachi Group Identity\n\nCarrying out Corporate Activities Based on the Hitachi Group Identity\n\nHitachi\u2019s Mission is to \u201ccontribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products.\u201d To fulfill our Mission, we adhere to our Values, which reflect the Hitachi Founding Spirit of \u201cHarmony, Sincerity and Pioneering Spirit.\u201d Under our Mission and Value, we have added the Hitachi Group Vision, which describes what the Hitachi Group aims to become in the future. These elements together make up the Hitachi Group Identity. Based on the Hitachi Group Identity, continuously considering the next generation, we carry out corporate activities from a medium- to long-term perspective informed by sensitivity to the changing needs of society. The Mid-term Management Plan is our action plan to realize the Hitachi Group Vision; by integrating our management and sustainability strategies, we seek to enhance the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nBy implementing the plan, the Hitachi Group seeks to fulfill its responsibilities as a good corporate citizen and member of the global community which provides value to customers and society leveraging robust, diverse governance; the Pioneering Spirit and strong ethical stance of our employees; and operations that help address social issues. We operate and pursue our activities in line with the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, which are the guidelines for ethical behavior and decision-making shared by all executives and employees of the Hitachi Group.\n\nSolidifying the Hitachi Group Identity\n\nHitachi promotes brand education using training tools and courses, based on the idea that social issues can be solved if each and every one of its employees understands and practices the Hitachi Group Identity.\n\nOne way we promote understanding of and familiarity with the Hitachi Group Identity and the Hitachi Brand is with the annual Inspiration of the Year Global Award, which recognizes remarkable activities that contribute to enhancing the value of the Hitachi Brand by demonstrating the Hitachi Group Identity. In fiscal 2021, the award saw 307 applications from Hitachi Group employees around the world. Projects that utilized data and technology to help create a sustainable society while supporting people\u2019s happiness were selected from various regions for the Grand Prix. One such award went to a project in Europe working to promote the transition to electric vehicles and to co-create technological and commercial innovations. The Grand Prix-winning projects were recognized at the Global Awards Ceremony and shared with all employees through our intranet.\n\n\u201cHitachi Group Identity Movie - I am Hitachi,\u201d a movie featuring the award winners, is released on our website, allowing a wide range of people inside and outside the Group to see how Hitachi Group employees around the world are endeavoring to realize a better society.\nRatio of female and non-Japanese executives and corporate officers\nFY2024: 15% each   FY2030: 30% each\n\nSet Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) targets\n\n2021\nSet the target of achieving carbon neutrality at Hitachi business sites by fiscal 2030.\n\n2022\nSet the target of achieving carbon neutrality throughout the entire value chain by fiscal 2050.\n\n2021\nAnnounced endorsement of Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations\n\n2018\nCommenced operation of the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) system\n\n2016\nFormulated Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050\n\n2013\nFormulated Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, Launched Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) initiative\n\n2011\nIntroduced global HR management\n\n2010\nEnhancement of interactions with Capital Markets, Hitachi IR Day was launched\n\n2003\nShifted to a company with committees (currently a company with a nominating committee, etc.)\n\n2000\n\n2010\nIncreased number of independent directors, including non-Japanese directors\n\n2012\nEnhanced dissemination of information about medium- to long-term sustainable growth\n\n2016\n\n2020\nSet the target of contributing to CO2 emission reductions through business (100 million metric tons in fiscal 2024)\n\n2019\nInstituted the Hitachi Group Global Procurement Code, Enhanced digital talent\n\n2017\nSet diversity targets\n\n2016\nPromoted workstyle reforms\n\n2013\n\n2021\nSet Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) targets.\nRatio of female and non-Japanese executives and corporate officers\nFY2024: 15% each   FY2030: 30% each\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2016\n\n2013\n\n2011\n\n2003\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2020\n\n2030\n\n2050\n\n2021\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2013\n\n2011\n\n2003\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2020\n\n2030\n\n2050\nMid-term Management Plan 2024 and Sustainability\n\nTowards a Sustainable Society: Mid-term Management Plan 2024\n\nIn accordance with Hitachi\u2019s Mission to \u201ccontribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products,\u201d we have been working to promote Social Innovation Business leveraging its core strengths in IT (Information Technology) \u00d7 OT (Operational Technology) \u00d7 Products, and Lumada*1 to help build a sustainable society.\n\nIn order to respond to the increasingly complex global issues of recent years, it is essential that we promote management with a long-term perspective and maximally utilize Hitachi\u2019s diverse management resources to achieve further evolution of the Social Innovation Business.\n\nHitachi has responded by imagining the future\u2014what the earth, society, and people will look and act like in 2050\u2014and back-casting to determine new business opportunities that should be undertaken now and in the medium- to long term to help realize a better future. In April 2022, we established the Mid-term Management Plan 2024 to clarify this vision.\n\n*1 Lumada: Solutions, services, and technologies that leverage Hitachi\u2019s digital technology and are offered to customers to accelerate the digitization of customers\u2019 businesses.\n\nVision Targets of Mid-term Management Plan 2024\n\nToday and tomorrow, the various stakeholders and social challenges that surround us are growing more complex. On a global scale, the environment is reaching its limit to accommodate lives of abundance and safety for humans, as the thresholds of several of the nine planetary boundaries have already been crossed. Recent changes to workstyles and the diversification of personal values have made wellbeing (physical, mental, and social) a vital part of how we choose to live and work.\n\nHitachi aims to resolve the increasingly complex social issues through its business, while respecting planetary boundaries and realizing wellbeing for all individuals. To achieve these goals, we will expand Lumada business through even greater utilization of data and technology and achieve further evolution of Social Innovation Business with our three growth drivers: \u201cDigital,\u201d \u201cGreen,\u201d and \u201cInnovation.\u201d\n\nSupporting people\u2019s quality of life with data and technology that foster a sustainable society\n\nMid-term Management Plan 2024\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2022/04/220428/f_220428pre.pdf\n\nHitachi Vision 2050\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8-0cK-CZPI\nThree Growth Drivers\n\nDigital\nWith an understanding of management issues faced by customers, Hitachi will contribute to the enhancement of customer business value through a cycle of co-creation with customers, which involves designing, implementing, managing and maintaining solutions, while working to resolve subsequent issues.\n\nWe will expand earnings and achieve global growth by leveraging digital technologies to drive the value co-creation cycle.\n\nGreen\nHitachi will lead global GX (Green Transformation) by switching to renewable energy, electrification, energy conservation and automation, and contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. We will proactively invest in the green field to contribute to an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of approximately 100 million metric tons by fiscal 2024. Additionally, we will promote decarbonization in order to realize Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050, which aims to achieve carbon neutrality throughout the value chain by fiscal 2050. Leveraging knowledge gained through this process and providing environmental value tailored to each business domain and region, we aim to realize both a sustainable society and growth of the Hitachi Group.\n\nInnovation\nFocusing on its vision for the world in 2050, Hitachi will identify areas where R&D is required while striving to create innovative technologies and products contributing to the resolution of social issues. At the same time, we will increase the speed of innovation by further accelerating collaborations with promising startups, government and academia.\n\nIn April 2022, Hitachi simplified its structure, grouping together businesses with similar characteristics organized into three sectors: Digital Systems & Services (DSS), Green Energy & Mobility (GEM) and Connective Industries (CI) to streamline and speed up its management function. With the addition of the Automotive Systems Business (Hitachi Astemo), we will leverage our three growth drivers\u2014Digital, Green, and Innovation\u2014to provide value to our customers and society, and to promote sustainability management.\n\nContribution to the SDGs\n\nHitachi\u2019s Social Innovation Business aims to realize a sustainable society through contributing to the resolution of global social and environmental issues as defined by the SDGs, and we consider it to be a source of sustainable growth for us. We are striving to create social, environmental, and economic value through our Social Innovation Business, as well as working to reduce negative social and environmental impacts. We are also seeking a deeper understanding of business risks arising from social and environmental changes to ensure business continuity with greater resilience.\n\nIn 2016, we examined the relationship between the opportunities and risks associated with the SDGs and our businesses to identify 11 goals as Hitachi\u2019s priority SDG issues: five goals where we can make particularly significant impacts through our key businesses and six goals that we can contribute to through our entire corporate activities. In 2022, based on the 2024 Mid-term Management Plan, we added two more goals, Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities and Goal 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, expanding our list of priority SDG issues to 13.\n\nThrough our active involvement in a broad range of business fields, we believe we can contribute extensively to the achievement of SDGs beyond the 13 goals identified, and we will strive to contribute to the achievement of all 17 SDGs.\nMateriality\n\nToward a Sustainable Society: Hitachi\u2019s Materiality\n\nHitachi practices sustainable management, which positions sustainability as the core of its business strategy, and is working toward realizing a sustainable society through the Social Innovation Business.\n\nIn the Mid-term Management Plan 2024, we declared our new aspiration of \u201csupporting people\u2019s quality of life with data and technology that fosters a sustainable society.\u201d While some of the nine planetary boundaries have already been exceeded, Hitachi is aware of each one and works to protect the planet and maintain society. Hitachi aims to solve social challenges to realize a future that balances protection of the planet and people\u2019s individual wellbeing.\n\nThe materiality analysis process\n\nWith a comprehensive understanding of social issues, Hitachi has identified six material topics and 15 sub-material topics based on an analysis of risks and opportunities from a sustainability perspectives as well as feedback from stakeholders.\n\nBased on these material topics, Hitachi will monitor measures as well as discuss the progress of, and new initiatives for, each materiality at the Senior Executive Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nFurther, Hitachi\u2019s materiality was developed based on backcasting from 2050 and input from stakeholder dialogue in Japan and Europe, based on the Strategic Focus Area disclosed in the Hitachi Integrated Report 2021 published last year.\n\nComprehensive understanding of social issues\n\n- Identifying social issues from the SDGs, GRI standards, SASB standards, ESG external evaluation items, etc.\n\nRanking issues by priority from Hitachi\u2019s point of view\n\n- Identifying innovation areas where Hitachi should contribute based on backcasting from 2050\n- Analyzing risks and opportunities\n\nRanking issues by priority from stakeholders\u2019 point of view\n\n- Evaluating material topics based on assessments and comments from investors, NGOs, and ESG evaluation organizations\n- Evaluation through dialogue with investors, NGOs, and sustainability experts\n\nIdentifying Materiality\n\nMateriality\n\n| Environment | Contributing to decarbonization and resource circulation economy |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Resilience  | Contributing to the maintenance and rapid recovery of social infrastructure |\n| Safety & Security | Contributing to safe and secure society-building |\n| Quality of Life | Contributing to physical and mental wellness and a prosperous life |\n| Business with Integrity | Adhering to ethical standards as well as respect human rights |\n| Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) | Contributing to a society where everyone can shine |\n\nAs a climate change innovator, Hitachi will contribute to the realization of a carbon neutral society with Hitachi\u2019s superior green technologies, by providing value to customers in all business segments.

We will also continue to pursue the happiness and wellbeing of our employees, as we believe that their happiness and wellbeing is the ground on which Hitachi\u2019s future will flourish even more fully.\n\nAs a Group responsible for social infrastructure around the world, Hitachi will manage its business with honesty and integrity, trusted by society, respect human rights and provide a safe workplace. We will reflect a system of ethical and responsible business conduct, including respect for human rights, in our business activities and decision-making standards, working together with our employees, collaborative partners and communities throughout the supply chain.\n\nHitachi has a place for everyone, welcoming differences in colleagues\u2019 background, age, gender, sexuality, family status, disability, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. At Hitachi, we treat everyone fairly, recognizing differences to allow everyone to perform at their full potential. We respect and value these and other differences because only through them we can understand our markets, create better ideas and drive innovation.\n## Management\n\n### Material topics\n\n| Sub-material topics | Target | Relevant SDGs |\n|---------------------|--------|---------------|\n| **Decarbonization** | Carbon neutrality through the value chain | FY2030: Achieve carbon neutrality in business sites (factories and offices)  \nFY2050: Achieve carbon neutrality through the value chain |\n| Contributing to CO2 reduction through business | FY2024: 100 million metric tons/year |\n| **Resource circulation** | Transition to a circular economy | FY2024: Full application Eco-Design for new product development  \nFY2030: Zero*2 waste to landfill*1 from manufacturing sites |\n| Effective use of water | Reduction rate in water use per unit (compared to FY2010)  \nFY2024: 24%, FY2050: 50% |\n| **Resilience** | Strengthening supply chains | Build flexible supply chains capable of responding to disasters and risks |\n| Maintaining social infrastructure | Resilience and sophistication of maintenance through DX of social infrastructure | Contribute to stable energy supply through substation management  \nApprox. 1.9 billion people*3 |\n| **Safety & Security** | Safe and secure urban environments | Safe and comfortable transportation | A total of 15 billion people use railway services annually*3 |\n| Ensuring cyber security | Secure cybersecurity for social infrastructure and business systems |\n| **Quality of Life** | Connected and prosperous society | Increase healthy life expectancy and wellbeing | Blood tests and other physical exams: 20 billion tests/year*3 |\n| Employee happiness | More flexible working styles to increase engagement | Users of happiness service (10 thousand in FY2022 \u2192 90 thousand in FY2024) |\n| **Business with Integrity** | Business ethics and compliance | Encourage employees to apply ethical standards in day-to-day work. | Achieve a score of at least 60 (out of 100) in FY2022, the first year of results from Ethical Culture & Perceptions Assessment, improving it every year |\n| Respect for human rights | Promote human rights due diligence and strengthen monitoring of procurement partners for responsible procurement, including human rights |\n| Occupational safety | Creating a safe working environment without accidents | Zero fatal accidents |\n| **Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)** | Diverse organization that fosters innovation | Strengthen diversity in management  \n(30% in FY2030) |\n| Acquiring and developing digital talent | FY2021: 67,000 persons  \nFY2024: 98,000 persons |\n| Contribution to a diverse and equitable society | Empower DEI of society through community relationship programs | Support young generations in Asia through the Hitachi Young Leaders Initiative  \nA total of 405 students participating (as of end of July 2022) |\n\n*1 Wherever this is compatible with local conditions and regulations  \n*2 Less than 0.5%  \n*3 FY2021 results\nHitachi has mapped the 15 sub-material topics in terms of importance for Hitachi and stakeholders. The level of importance to Hitachi is defined as the gap between our goals and our current initiatives.\n\nStakeholder dialogue about the materiality\n\nWe held a stakeholder dialogue with on the theme of materiality in Japan and Europe in fiscal 2021. We received feedback on Hitachi\u2019s proposed materiality and measures for each materiality from disclosure experts, leading sustainability companies, European Commission, NGOs, international organizations, and institutional investors. In Europe, we divided the dialogue into a planet session and a people session, with Hitachi explaining its measures for the environment, human capital, and respecting human rights, while participants gave suggestions for new perspectives and improvements.\n\nPrincipal comments from stakeholders\n\n- Hitachi should indicate the direction society wants Hitachi to move along or the goals that Hitachi itself has.\n- When it comes to diversity and inclusion, it would be better to include \u201cequity\u201d and make it \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion.\u201d\n- For the circular economy, the approach shouldn\u2019t just be to reduce materials and waste but also to think about new business models.\n- With human rights and decent work, Hitachi should go beyond conventional monitoring, audit, and other compliance approaches to engage with all aspects of supply chains through partnerships with external stakeholders.\nHitachi is working to promote sustainability strategy, including the Hitachi GX Strategy, under the guidance of Vice President and Executive Officer Lorena Dellagiovanna, who was appointed to the newly established position of Chief Sustainability Officer on April 1, 2022.\n\nUnder the Global Environment Division, which is managed by the Chief Sustainability Officer, as a framework for implementing the Hitachi GX Strategy, we have established the Internal Environment Initiatives Division to promote efforts to achieve carbon neutrality throughout our in-house production activities and the value chain, 3R activities, and the Global Environment Business Division to lead growth in our environmental business.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we established a new Sustainability Promotion Meeting, with members that include the Chief Sustainability Officer, business promotion division heads at Business Units (BUs) and key Group companies, and RHQ Sustainability Officers, to discuss important measures concerning sustainability, conduct monitoring of progress in reaching targets, and more. Important matters aimed at achieving the Mid-term Management Plan are also discussed or decided on by the Senior Executive Committee and presented to the Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition, for important themes such as carbon neutrality, the circular economy, human rights due diligence (HRDD), and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), we are working to promote sustainability throughout the Hitachi Group by setting up separate meetings composed of responsible officers from individual BUs and major Group companies to consider Group-wide policies, share information, and so on.\nOverview of Sustainability Related Conference Bodies\n\n| Meeting                                      | Attendees                                                                 | Purpose                                                                 | Frequency       |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Sustainability Promotion Meeting             | Chief Sustainability Officer, Business promotion division heads at BUs & key Group companies and RHQ Sustainability Officers | Deliberation, implementation and monitoring of material sustainability initiatives | Twice per year  |\n| Internal Environment Initiatives Division Progress Meeting | Heads of Business promotion/Environment-related/ MONOZUKURI(production)/Procurement divisions from BUs and key Group companies | Formulating and implementing plans based on the environmental action plan | Twice per year  |\n| Eco-Management Meeting                       | Heads of Environment-related divisions from BUs and key Group companies   | Deliberation and implementation of actual action plan to achieve Hitachi Environmental Long-term goals | Twice per year  |\n| CN2030 Promotion Project Meeting            | Heads and members of Environment-related/ MONOZUKURI(production) divisions from BUs and key Group companies | Monitoring and implementation of CN action plan and discussion of acceleration | Every quarter   |\n| 3R Promotion Project Meeting                 | Heads and members of Environment-related/ MONOZUKURI(production) divisions from BUs and key Group companies | Promotion of actions for 3R activities toward realizing CE | Every quarter   |\n| Procurement related Meeting (Group Procurement Strategy Meeting etc.) | Chief Procurement Officer, heads of the procurement divisions at BUs and key Group companies | Disseminating Hitachi group global procurement policy and strategy, and discussion on the framework of Sustainable Procurement | Twice or more per year |\n| HRDD Execution Managers Meeting              | HRDD execution managers from BUs and key Group companies                 | Provide information and knowledge necessary for HRDD implementation, and share status of implementation in BUs and key Group companies | Once or twice per year |\n| Global DEI Council                           | DEI promotion leaders from BUs and key Group companies                    | Implement DEI promotion policies and initiatives, and share best practices | Once or twice per year |\n\nReflecting Sustainability Targets in Executive Compensation Evaluation\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Hitachi introduced evaluations that take environmental value into consideration in the executive compensation system for the first time with the aim of accelerating the creation of environmental value. All executive officers, including the CEO, set targets for environmental value and were evaluated for their achievement of individual targets.\n\nFrom fiscal 2022, in addition to environmental targets such as decarbonization and resource efficiency, we introduced quantitative and qualitative target setting for occupational health and safety and product quality in the compensation evaluation of all executive officers to further advance sustainable management.\n\nExamples of Sustainability Targets Reflected in Fiscal 2022 Compensation Evaluations\n\n| Sustainability Targets | Examples |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| Decarbonization        | Efforts to realize carbon neutrality* in business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030 |\n|                        | Efforts to achieve carbon neutrality* by fiscal 2050 throughout the value chain |\n| Resource efficiency    | Efforts related to resource efficiency |\n| Occupational health and safety | Zero fatal accidents |\n| Wellbeing initiatives  | |\n| Product quality        | Efforts to enhance product quality |\n\n*1 Regarding fiscal 2030 and fiscal 2050 decarbonization targets, single-year targets are set Groupwide and for each BU.\n\nFiscal 2021 Executive Sustainability Committee** Agenda Items\n\n| Term          | Agenda Items                                                                 |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| May 2021      | New DEI-related targets, issues associated with reaching targets, action plans, etc. |\n| June 2021     | Reviewing targets and considering promotion measures for Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050, etc. |\n| July 2021     | Hitachi Group priority human rights risk survey results (concerning migrant workers and forced labor), framework for managing human rights risks, etc. |\n| December 2021 | Progress reports for DEI-related activities, future measures necessary to link DEI to growth, etc. |\n| January 2022  | Materiality plans aimed at achieving the next Mid-term Management Plan and approaches to advancing the circular economy, etc. |\n\n** Holding sustainability-related discussions under a new committee system from fiscal 2022\nEngagement and Initiatives\n\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nIn its commitment to promoting the Social Innovation Business, Hitachi endeavors to accurately identify the various social issues facing each country and region, and to work toward resolution of these issues through engagement in collaborative creation with a wide range of stakeholders, including customers, governments and municipalities, as well as academic and research institutions. In addition, with the goal of enhancing the value of our human capital, we work to promote activities with an emphasis on maintaining direct dialogues between the management and employees as an essential management resource in the promotion of business. Furthermore, with the recent rise in ESG investment, we actively engage in dialogues with shareholders and investors as well.\n\nHitachi organizes stakeholder dialogues to invite opinions on social challenges from stakeholders representing specialized knowledge platforms, and it ensures that their insights are reflected in the business activities. In fiscal 2021, Hitachi, Ltd. held stakeholder dialogues on the theme of \u201cmateriality\u201d in Japan and Europe with the formulation of the Mid-term Management Plan 2024. We received feedback on Hitachi\u2019s proposed materiality and measures for each materiality from disclosure experts, leading sustainability companies, the European Commission, NGOs, international organizations, and institutional investors.\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nManagement\n\nCEO\u2019s Message\nChief Sustainability Officer\u2019s Message\nHitachi Group Identity\nSustainability Management\n\nEngagement and Initiatives\n\nStakeholders\nNational Governments, Municipalities, Industrial Associations\nLocal Communities\nAcademic Associations and Research Institutions\nNGOs and NPOs\nThe Environment\n\nMain Roles\nCompliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, policy recommendations, participation in industry-government-academia collaborative projects\nFullfillment of responsibilities as a corporate citizen, involvement in local communities\nPromotion of technological innovations, participation in industry-government-academia collaborative projects\nIncorporation of diverse public opinions, promotion of stakeholder-focused management, social contributions through nonprofit activities\nRealization of a decarbonized society, a resource efficient society, a harmonized society with nature\n\nMain Divisions\nGovernment and External Relations\nSocial Contributions/All Business Divisions\nResearch and Development\nSustainability Promotion\nEnvironment/All Business Divisions\n\nMeans of Engagement (FY 2021)\nAcademic research for policy recommendations to international organizations and national governments, lobbying activities\nContribution to local communities through business\nOpen innovation (joint research)\nStakeholder dialogues (annual)\nParticipation in COP26\n\nPages\nStakeholder Engagement P020-021\nMain Initiatives and Groups Hitachi Is Involved with P022\nIndustry Leadership and Policy Recommendations P023\nSocial Contribution Activities P143-146\nInnovation Management P079-080\nStakeholder Engagement P020-021\nSocial Contribution Activities P143-146\nEnvironmental P041-066\n\nESG Disclosure Study Group\n\nHow to address the rapidly changing global trend in ESG disclosure is a major challenge for many corporations and institutional investors in Japan. Hitachi, Ltd. is responding to this issue through co-creation with stakeholders. In June 2020, Hitachi took the lead in establishing the ESG Disclosure Study Group to explore ways of disclosing ESG information that contribute to long-term corporate value enhancement while also keeping an eye on global trends. The study group initially started with 19 companies, and as of June 30, 2022, more than 100 companies, institutional investors, auditing firms and public organizations are participating.\n\nStudy group activities are divided into phases according to themes, and in June 2022, the \u201cESG Disclosure Study Group Report 2022\u201d was published including the results of these activities. This report contains ESG disclosure recommendations for corporations, institutional investors and standard-setting bodies and is disseminated to relevant organizations within and outside Japan. Hitachi, Ltd. serves as the co-chairman and secretariat of this study group, and leads these activities.\n\nKyoto University and Hitachi Joint Project\n\nOne of the key initiatives for the evolution of sustainable management is to quantitatively clarify the financial impact of non-financial values such as environmental and social values created by business activities, as well as intangible asset measures such as human resource policies. This is expected to further advance management and improve engagement with stakeholders.\n\nSince 2021, Hitachi, Ltd. has engaged with these challenges through experimental research conducted in collaboration with Graduate School of Management, Kyoto University. Through academic and other approaches, it was quantitatively confirmed that Hitachi\u2019s initiatives toward the environment and human resources could have a positive impact on financial indicators (ROIC and WACC). In the future, we will clarify the causal relationship between non-financial and intangible asset measures and financial indicators, as well as employee survey results, to identify measures with a high degree of causal influence and lead them to measures to improve financial performance through non-financial and intangible asset measures.\n\nGeneral Incorporation Association of ESG Disclosure Study Group / EDSG\nhttps://edsg.org/en/\nMain Initiatives and Groups Hitachi Is Involved with\n\nBased on its corporate mission of \u201ccontribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products,\u201d Hitachi promotes its Social Innovation Business with the aim of contributing to the realization of a sustainable society. As part of this, to play its proper role as a global corporation, Hitachi actively participates in international initiatives and groups addressing social issues on a global scale.\n\n| Initiative or Group | Activities |\n|---------------------|------------|\n| United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) | Became a participant in 2009.

Accordingly, we consider international standardization activities to be of importance along with research and development work and intellectual property-related activities. In order to contribute to the resolution of social issues on a global scale with a diverse range of stakeholders, Hitachi actively engages in activities with international standardization organizations, including IEC*, ISO*, and ITU-T*.\n\nIn the environmental domain, we are engaged in efforts concerning the circular economy (ISO/TC 323) and the environmental standardization for electrical and electronic products and systems (IEC/TC 111), and, with regard to social issues, Society 5.0 (ISO/WA* 39), smart community infrastructures (ISO/TC 268/SC* 1), and unmanned aircraft systems (ISO/TC 20/SC 16).\n\nAdditionally, by contributing to international standardization efforts by various consortia and other bodies, and providing solutions consistent with international standards, we support the development of sound global markets and facilitate innovation to resolve social issues.\n\n*1 IEC: International Electrotechnical Commission.

Detailed discussions are held in working groups for each theme to promote standardization activities. In fiscal 2021, Hitachi Energy joined the Standardization Committee.\n\n*1 Steering Committee: Headed by the executive officer overseeing R&D, this entity includes chief technology officers of Hitachi business units and key Group companies. The committee is responsible for decisions on cross-departmental and companywide standardization projects.\nAchievements in Fiscal 2021\n\nOne of the principal themes selected was Society 5.0, an initiative spearheaded by the Japanese government aimed at the realization of a human-centered, sustainable society. In order to create venues in which discussions can be conducted to attain consensus among various countries and major standardization organizations looking toward realization of Society 5.0, Hitachi has actively engaged in activities related to ISO/IWA 39 (gap analysis for standardization on sustainable and human-centered societies enabled with cyber physical systems) and contributed to the completion of the IWA 39 agreement based on international consensus.\nManagement\n\nCEO\u2019s Message\nChief Sustainability Officer\u2019s Message\nHitachi Group Identity\nSustainability Management\nEngagement and Initiatives\n\nExternal Assessments and Awards\n\nAs a corporate group that promotes sustainable management, the Hitachi Group has earned high marks from numbers of external assessment organizations.\n\nInclusion in ESG Indices (Hitachi, Ltd.)\n\n2022 CONSTITUENT MSCI JAPAN ESG SELECT LEADERS INDEX\n\n(Continued inclusion in 2022)\n\nMSCI Japan ESG Select Leaders Index\nhttps://www.msci.com/our-solutions/japan-ESG-select-leaders-index\n\nTHE USE BY HITACHI, LTD.

Meeting society\u2019s expectations with innovations that mitigate environmental issues also presents major business opportunities. Hitachi\u2019s Environmental Vision states that \u201cHitachi will resolve environmental issues and achieve both a higher quality of life and a sustainable society through its Social Innovation Business in collaborative creation with its stakeholders.\u201d To uphold this vision and work toward achieving a decarbonized society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature, we have established a set of long-term environmental targets looking toward 2050 and 2030 called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050, and have been promoting Group-wide environmental activities in line with our Environmental Action Plan, which is updated every three years. To help build a decarbonized society, we aim to achieve carbon neutrality at our business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030 and throughout our value chain by fiscal 2050.\n\n**Environmental Governance**\n\n- Enhancing environmental governance\n- Enhancing environmental management system\n- Reducing environmental burdens through \u201cEco-Factories & Offices Select\u201d certification\n- Implementing environmental education for employees\n- Ensuring environmental compliance\n\n**Achieving a Decarbonized Society**\n\n- Reducing CO\u2082 emissions and achieving carbon neutrality throughout our value chain\n- Expanding the decarbonization business\n- Reducing CO\u2082 emissions and achieving carbon neutrality at business sites (factories and offices)\n\n**Environmental Data**\n\n- Registered data from about 1,500 business sites in 67 countries in the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) to estimate environmental load\n- A total score of 269 GPs in the GREEN 21 evaluation of our Environmental Action Plan\n- Under \u201cEco-Factories & Offices Select,\u201d of our approximately 1,500 facilities, recorded two new certifications, and 48 renewed certifications (total certified facilities: 50)\n- Rolled out climate change e-learning materials globally (attended by 132,773 people)\n- Implementation rate of voluntary environmental audits of business sites outside Japan by business units and Group companies (number of sites audited/number of sites): 56%\n\n**Achievements in FY 2021**\n\n- Reduction of CO\u2082 emissions per unit at business sites (factories and offices) (Compared to FY2010): 28% (FY 2021 reduction target: 21%)\n- Formulated a roadmap to achieving carbon neutrality at business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030\n- Reduction of CO\u2082 emissions per unit at business sites (factories and offices) (Compared to FY2010): 6% (FY 2021 reduction target: 9%)\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\nEnvironmental Governance\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\nEnvironmental Data\n\nWhat\n- What we are doing\n\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\n- Building a water efficient society\n- Responding to water risks\n- Building a society that uses resources efficiently\n- Transitioning to a circular economy\n\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\n- Promoting initiatives to minimize impact on natural capital\n- Managing chemical substances in products\n- Managing chemical substances in business operations\n- Promoting initiatives to preserve ecosystems\n\nHow\n- How we are doing it\n\nPromotion of the HICP framework\n- Implemented investment in energy-saving equipment in 59 cases totaling 1.46 billion yen through HICP\n\nIntroduce renewable energy\n- Increased by 56% the amount of renewable energy-derived electricity produced by in-house power generation facilities, and increased by 36% the amount of renewable energy-derived electricity purchased, as compared to FY 2020 for both\n\nLong-term environmental targets\n- Build a society that uses water and other resources efficiently with customers and society\n- 50% improvement of efficiency in use of water/resources by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010 in the Hitachi Group)\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n- Reduction of water use per unit\n  - Reduction rate in water use per unit (Compared to FY2010): 36% (FY 2021 reduction target: 26%)\n- Respond to water risks\n  - Promoted measures based on water risk survey results\n- Build a society that uses resources efficiently\n  - Promoted eco-designs for each product\n- Reduction of waste and valuables generation per unit\n  - Reduction rate in waste and valuables generation per unit (Compared to FY2010): 16% (FY 2021 reduction target: 12%)\n- Plastic recycling activities\n  - Set a target for reduction of waste plastics by fiscal 2030 (effective utilization rate: 100%)\n\nMinimize impact on natural capital\n- Achievements in FY 2021\n- Reduce the rate of chemical atmospheric emissions per unit\n  - Reduction rate in chemical atmospheric emissions per unit (Compared to FY2010): 35% (FY 2021 reduction target: 16%)\n- Promote ecosystem preservation efforts\n  - Joined the 30by30 Alliance for Biodiversity\n- Calculation of positive and negative impact on natural capital\n  - Calculated positive impacts (e.g., benefits of forest conservation activities) and negative impacts due to business activities by using data from the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS)\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\n\nThe Environmental Vision and Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050\n\nTaking into account the growing urgency of environmental issues in the world and the management policies of Hitachi, we formulated an Environmental Vision that clearly outlines our vision for society from a long-term perspective. In working toward achieving this vision, we have established a set of long-term environmental targets aimed at building a decarbonized society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature under the banner of Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 and are working to advance them.\n\nWith regard to achieving a decarbonized society, we originally set a target of reducing CO2 emissions by 80% throughout the value chain by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010) in response to the adoption of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in fiscal 2016. However, in consideration of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C, and in recognition of the corporate social responsibility Hitachi is expected to fulfill, we raised our targets. In fiscal 2020, we revised our target to achieve carbon neutrality at Hitachi business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030. And then in fiscal 2021, we revised our target again to achieve carbon neutrality in our value chain by fiscal 2050.\n\nIn seeking to realize a resource efficient society, we aim to improve the usage efficiency of water and other resources by 50% by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010 levels). And in aiming to build a harmonized society with nature, we are advancing initiatives to minimize our impact on natural capital by reducing our negative impacts and maximizing our positive impacts across the value chain.\n\nHitachi\u2019s environmental initiatives, including the achievement of these long-term environmental targets, are mandated by the short-term Environmental Action Plan which is updated every three years and pursued Group-wide.\nProgress in Reaching Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 Targets\n\nWe are making progress with major Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 targets, as shown in the table below. We are generally on track, and we will continue strengthening our environmental activities to achieve these targets. Regarding the achievement of our long-term value chain target to help build a decarbonized society, we are developing activities which help to reduce CO\u2082 emissions by providing products with top-tier environmental performance.\n\n### Efforts to Achieve a Decarbonized Society\n\n| Reduced CO\u2082 Emissions at Business Sites (Factories and Offices) |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| FY 2021 target | FY 2021 result | FY 2030 target | FY 2050 target |\n| Reduction rate of total CO\u2082 emissions (compared to FY 2010) | 20% | 37% | 100% (carbon neutrality) | (Maintain 100%) |\n\n### Efforts to Achieve a Resource Efficient Society\n\n| Enhanced Efficiency in the Use of Water at Business Sites (Factories and Offices) |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| FY 2021 target | FY 2021 result | FY 2030 target | FY 2050 target |\n| Reduction rate in water use per unit (compared to FY 2010 Hitachi Group) | 26% | 36% | \u2014 | 50% |\n\n| Enhanced Efficiency in the Use of Waste and Valuable Generation at Business Sites (Factories and Offices) |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| FY 2021 target | FY 2021 result | FY 2030 target | FY 2050 target |\n| Reduction rate in waste and valuable generation use per unit (compared to FY 2010 Hitachi Group) | 12% | 18% | \u2014 | 50% |\n\nNote: See the referenced pages for details on the figures cited.\nEnvironmental Action Plan\n\nTo achieve its Environmental Vision and the Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 long-term environmental targets, Hitachi draws up an Environmental Action Plan containing indicators and targets for the three-year period covered by the Mid-term Management Plan and steadily promotes its implementation.\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 (Fiscal 2019\u20132021)\n\nHitachi has promoted environmental activities under the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 (Fiscal 2019\u20132021) that were based on the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan. The targets set for fiscal 2021, which is the final year, as well as the actual results are as follows. GREEN 21 is used as a tool for evaluating and managing our achievements made over three-year periods toward the targets set.\n\n| Target Activities | FY 2021 targets | FY 2021 results (achievement level) |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Environmental Management** | | |\n| Promote environmental human capital development | Environmental human capital development of the Hitachi Group | | |\n| Enhance global environmental management | Implementation rate of voluntary environmental audits (number of implementing sites/number of sites outside Japan) | 80% | 56% \ufffd\ufffd |\n| **A Decarbonized Society** | | |\n| Reduce CO2 emissions of products and services | Reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit (compared to FY 2010) | 21% | 28% \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd |\n| Address climate change risks and opportunities | Identification and review of risks and opportunities | | |\n| Reduce CO2 emissions of business sites (factories and offices) | Reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit*1 (compared to FY 2010) | 9% | 6% \ufffd\ufffd |\n| Reduce CO2 emissions from transportation (shipping) | Reduction rate of transportation energy consumption per unit (Japan)*2 (compared to FY 2010) | 11% | 11% \ufffd\ufffd |\n| **A Resource Efficient Society** | | |\n| Water circulation (factories and offices) | Enhancing efficiency in the use of water | Reduction rate in water use per unit (compared to FY 2010) | 26% | 36% \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd |\n| Respond to water risks | Promotion of measures based on water risk survey results | | |\n| Resource circulation (factories and offices) | Enhance efficiency in the use of resources | Reduction rate in waste and valuables generation per unit (compared to FY 2010) | 12% | 18% \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd |\n| Reduce and recycle waste materials | | |\n| **A Harmonized Society with Nature** | | |\n| Chemical substances (factories and offices) | Reduce chemical emissions | Reduction rate in chemical atmospheric emissions per unit (compared to FY 2010) | 18% | 35% \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd |\n| Ecosystem preservation | | |\n| Reduce impact on natural capital | Calculation of negative impacts (environmental impact assessment of business activities) | | |\n| Contribute to ecosystem preservation | Promotion of ecosystem preservation activities | | |\n\n*1 Reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit refers to reductions in CO2 emissions from just Hitachi\u2019s consumption of energy.\n*2 This is a target for Japan only. Targets in other countries are set on a voluntary basis.\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2024 (Fiscal 2022\u20132024)\n\nHitachi has established a new Environmental Action Plan for 2024 (Fiscal 2022\u20132024) based on the 2024 Mid-term Management Plan as an initiative beginning in fiscal 2022. We will strengthen our efforts further in working to achieve the Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 long-term environmental targets.\n\n| Environmental Action Plan for 2024 | Items | Indicators | FY 2022 targets | FY 2023 targets | Final FY (2024) targets |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| **Environmental Management**      |       |            |                 |                 |                        |\n| Total CO2 reduction               | Total CO2 reduction (compared to FY 2010) | 32% | 35% | 50% |\n| Improvement of transportation energy consumption per unit (Japan) | Improvement rate of transportation energy consumption per unit (Japan) (compared to FY 2010) | 2% | 3% | 4% |\n| Reduce CO2 emissions of products and services | Reduction rate of CO2 emissions (compared to FY 2010) | 12% | 13% | 14% |\n| Promote eco-design | Contribution to CO2 emissions reduction | Contribution to CO2 emissions reduction of 100 million t per year (FY 2024) | 100% (FY 2024) |\n| **A Decarbonized Society**        |       |            |                 |                 |                        |\n| Enhancing efficiency in the use of resources | Number of sites achieving zero landfill waste** | 90 | 124 | 158 |\n| Reduction in waste and valuables generation per unit (compared to FY 2013) | 14% | 17% | 20% |\n| Reduction rate in water use per unit (compared to FY 2010) | 22% | 23% | 24% |\n| Effective utilization rate of plastic waste | 77% | 81% | 85% |\n| **A Resource Efficient Society**  |       |            |                 |                 |                        |\n| Respond to water risks | Respond to water risks | Minimization of business impacts regarding water risks | |\n| **A Harmonized Society with Nature** |       |            |                 |                 |                        |\n| Reduce chemical emissions | Reduction rate in chemical atmospheric emissions per unit (compared to FY 2010) | 5% | 6% | 8% |\n| Impact on natural capital | Calculation of negative impacts (business unit/Group company-level LCA implementation) / Calculation of positive impacts (forest conservation activities) | |\n\n*1 Pursued in assumed conformance with regulations, conditions, etc. and less than 0.5%\nGREEN 21 is used as a system for evaluating and managing our achievements made over three-year periods toward the targets set in our Environmental Action Plan. GREEN 21 converts the level of achievement toward the Environmental Action Plan targets at each of the approximately 160 major sites classified as category A into green points (GPs) and then makes an evaluation on a category-by-category basis. A perfect score for any category is 100 GPs. Points are awarded for meeting the Environmental Action Plan\u2019s annual targets and as an added incentive for particularly ambitious activities. Representing progress in terms of GPs shows how much each site has achieved in each category and also enables sites to be compared with each other. The results are also used in the Environmental Action Plan\u2019s PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycles.\n\nThe Sustainability Promotion Division also uses the results of the GREEN 21 evaluation as a condition for awarding its Eco-Factories & Offices Select certification for business sites that promote activities demonstrating a high level of environmental consciousness and produce notable results in that area.\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n\nThe overall evaluation, which is the sum of the evaluation scores for each category, was 269 GPs which is lower than the reference score of 320 GPs in fiscal 2021. Due to the impact of the COVID-19, business trips outside of Japan were restricted and there was a decrease in production. The scores for enhancing global environmental management and reducing CO\u2082 emissions per unit of business site came in below the targets.\nEnvironmental Governance\n\nFramework for Promoting Environmental Governance\n\nTo achieve our Environmental Vision and reach our long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050, Hitachi, Ltd. has built a global structure to support environmental decision making and implementation at Hitachi, Ltd. and consolidated subsidiaries (a total of 854 companies as of March 31, 2022).\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we established a new Sustainability Promotion Meeting, with members that include the Chief Sustainability Officer, business promotion division heads at business units and key Group companies, and RHQ Sustainability Officers, to discuss important matters concerning sustainability, including the environment, conduct monitoring of progress in reaching targets, and more. Important matters related to the environment, including decarbonization and resource circulation, that are aimed at achieving the Mid-term Management Plan are also discussed or decided on by the Senior Executive Committee and presented to the Board of Directors. At the Board of Directors in fiscal 2021, a report on Hitachi\u2019s participation in COP26 and the revision of long-term environmental targets was provided, affirming Hitachi\u2019s efforts toward the environment including carbon neutrality.\n\nFor important themes such as carbon neutrality and the circular economy, we are working to promote environmental activities throughout the Hitachi Group by setting up separate meetings composed of the heads of responsible personnel from individual BUs and major Group companies to consider Group-wide policies, share information, and so on.\n\nWith regard to the Hitachi GX Strategy, a set of comprehensive efforts aimed at realizing decarbonization and resource circulation within the Hitachi Group and in the value chain, we have newly constructed a framework for its implementation and are working to effectively promote it under the guidance of the Global Environment Division, which is managed by the Chief Sustainability Officer.\n\nHitachi, Ltd., a company with Nominating Committee, etc. under the Companies Act, has adopted a committee system to separate the responsibilities for management oversight from the execution of business operations. Under this system, the Audit Committee of independent directors conducts an audit of sustainability-related operations once a year. Reports on climate change and other environment-related material issues are made to the committee by executive officers of Hitachi, Ltd.\nSystem for Executive Compensation\nIncorporating Environmental Value\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Hitachi introduced evaluations that take environmental value into consideration in the executive compensation system for the first time with the aim of accelerating the creation of environmental value. All executive officers, including the CEO, set targets for environmental value and were evaluated for their achievement of individual targets.\n\nExamples of Environmental Targets Reflected in Fiscal 2022 Compensation Evaluations\n\n| Sustainability Targets |\n|------------------------|\n| Decarbonization        |\n| \u2022 Efforts to realize carbon neutrality*1 in business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030 |\n| \u2022 Efforts to achieve carbon neutrality*1 by fiscal 2050 throughout the value chain |\n| Resource efficiency    |\n| \u2022 Efforts related to resource efficiency |\n\n*1 Regarding fiscal 2030 and fiscal 2050 decarbonization targets, single-year targets are set Groupwide and for each BU.\nEnvironmental Management System\n\nEnhancing Our Environmental Management System\n\nHitachi has globally applicable criteria for environmental management classification to conduct environmental management properly and efficiently in accordance with the environmental load and compliance risk levels of Group business sites, both large and small. We assign a score for each classification item, such as the amount of power consumed, the volume of waste generated, water usage, and whether or not legal restrictions apply. All Group business sites are classified into one of three categories: A, B, or C, and environmental management is then conducted based on the respective level of risk. Of our approximately 1,500 business sites, about 160 major sites are classified as category A currently. Among acquired Group companies, business sites with a large environmental load (equivalent to category A) are classified as category A after a few years of adjustment during which they adapt to Hitachi\u2019s environmental management.\n\nThe business units and Group companies that manage A sites participate in drawing up the Eco-Management Meeting\u2019s Environmental Action Plan, setting targets based on it and striving to achieve these targets. The Environmental Action Plan is disseminated throughout the entire Hitachi Group by environmental strategy officers, chosen from among the heads of environment divisions of those organizations.\n\nIn addition to adhering to the in-house environmental management system, our main global category A manufacturing sites have acquired third-party certification, such as ISO 14001.\n\nEnvironmental Data Collection System\n\nAs part of its environmental management, Hitachi uses the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) to collect about 20 categories of environmental load-related data ranging from energy use, water use, and waste generation, to whether an item falls under relevant environmental laws and regulations, and environmental accounting. In fiscal 2021, data collection covered about 1,500 business sites in 67 countries. We are working to progressively expand the scope of collection to estimate the environmental load of the entire Hitachi Group. We have also set up an international help desk to support the system\u2019s operation and promote understanding of environmental management, offering support in Japanese, English, and Chinese.\n\nThe aggregated data is used to provide feedback to improve environmental measures, such as in determining business sites\u2019 environmental management classifications; identifying environmental management issues; and sharing instructive examples within the Group, as well as to calculate green points (GPs) in GREEN 21 evaluations. Approximately 160 major sites classified as category A aggregate data on key items biannually.\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\n\nEnvironmental Governance\nFramework for Promoting Environmental Governance\n\u2013 Environmental Management System\n\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nEnvironmental Data\n\nChemical Substance Management System\nHitachi manages data on chemical substances in procured materials, parts, and products using A Gree\u2019Net, a green procurement system compatible with the chemSHERPA*\u00b9 format, to grasp what chemical substances are used in our products\u2014from design and development, procurement, and production to quality assurance and shipping\u2014and to respond to export partners\u2019 legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nTo ensure proper use of chemical substances in our business operations, we operate a database for chemical substance management called CEGNET, which keeps track of the latest laws and regulations and our own voluntary regulations and supports searches for new substance risks. The system also registers chemical substances used and aggregates data on amounts handled, emitted, and transferred in our operations, helping to reduce their volume.\n\n*\u00b9 chemSHERPA: A shared transmission scheme throughout the supply chain to ensure proper management of chemical substances in products and continuing compliance with the ever-growing requirements of major global laws and regulations like the REACH regulation (EU regulation of Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) and RoHS directive (EU rules restricting the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment).\n\nData regarding chemical substances contained in approximately 1.35 million materials, parts, and products are registered in A Gree\u2019Net as of the end of fiscal 2021. Each year, we hold briefings for procurement partners on using A Gree\u2019Net on the system, chemSHERPA, and regulatory revision trends. In fiscal 2021, we held eight online briefings, for a cumulative total attendance of 2,613 people.\n\n\u201cEco-Factories & Offices Select\u201d Certification\nHitachi recognizes business sites featuring high levels of environmental consciousness with Eco-Factories & Offices Select certification based on criteria that were developed for our manufacturing (factory) and non-manufacturing (office) divisions, making evaluations for certification each fiscal year for all locations. Superior policies from certified factories and offices are shared with the entire Group, with other locations encouraged to implement them as well to raise levels of environmental awareness.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, of our approximately 1,500 facilities, two were newly certified, and 48 had their certifications renewed. The total number of certified factories and offices was 50.\n\nEnvironmental Education for Employees\nHitachi offers environmental education using e-learning for all Group employees, from new hires to executive officers. We provide once a year specialized training on environmental risks and compliance with environment-related laws and regulations for working-level employees in charge of environmental management and internal environmental auditors. Particularly in China, where we have more than 20 category A sites, we provide training focused on compliance with the country\u2019s increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations.\n\nAchievements in FY 2021: Briefings for Procurement Partners\nData regarding chemical substances contained in approximately 1.35 million materials, parts, and products are registered in A Gree\u2019Net as of the end of fiscal 2021. Each year, we hold briefings for procurement partners on using A Gree\u2019Net on the system, chemSHERPA, and regulatory revision trends. In fiscal 2021, we held eight online briefings, for a cumulative total attendance of 2,613 people.\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nEnvironmental Compliance\n\nActivities\n\nIn addition to ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and region, Hitachi strives to minimize environmental risks by setting compliance with voluntary management criteria that are more stringent than regulatory requirements and carrying out internal audits. We make periodic examinations of soil and groundwater for any contamination at business sites where hazardous chemical substances are being or were once used. If contamination is found, we will conduct cleaning and monitoring activities until decontamination is complete.\n\nIf we find a violation or receive a complaint, we take steps to share information about the causes and countermeasures throughout the Group and connect these efforts to the prevention of similar incidents. Business sites where legal or regulatory violations have occurred in particular are designated as high-risk business sites for a three-year period as a corrective measure. Appropriate guidance provided to such sites by business units and Group companies in charge of their management serves to strengthen their compliance activities on an ongoing basis and prevent recurrences.\n\nImplementation Status of Internal Environmental Audits\n\n| Implementing division | Target | Frequency |\n|-----------------------|--------|-----------|\n| Corporate division of Hitachi, Ltd.

Under GX for GROWTH, we contribute to decarbonization efforts by our customers and society through the provision of products and services with a low environmental burden. Further, under GX for CORE, we accelerate measures aimed at achieving carbon neutrality at Hitachi business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030.\n\nThe majority of our value-chain emissions result from the use of our products and services after they are sold, making this stage of our value chain the key to reducing CO2 emissions.\n\nEnvironmental Strategy for Achieving a Decarbonized Society\n\n| Target | Activities |\n|--------|------------|\n| Toward a Decarbonized Society | \u2022 Achieve carbon neutrality by fiscal 2050 through the value chain and reduce CO2 emissions by 50% by fiscal 2030 (compared to fiscal 2010) \u2022 Achieve carbon neutrality at business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030 |\n\nInitiatives for Achieving a Decarbonized Society\n\n1. Achieve carbon neutrality at our own business sites and production activities (by fiscal 2030)\n   - Introduce energy-saving and renewable energy equipment.\n   - Procure 100% non-fossil electricity across all business sites.\n\n2. Achieve the world\u2019s highest level of energy conservation in products\n   - Achieve energy conservation by developing products that take the environment into consideration from the design stage.\n\n3. Support businesses that contribute to the carbon neutrality of society as a whole\n   - Power grids business to support the expansion of renewable energy.\n   - Provision of EV systems and related infrastructure and energy-efficient high-speed trains and storage battery hybrid trains for the spread of carbon-free mobility.\n   - Provide Lumada solutions that support the realization of a decarbonized society through digitalization.\n\n4.

Work with procurement partners toward a decarbonized society\n   - Raise awareness, by distributing our Sustainable Procurement Guidelines and Green Procurement Guidelines, and requesting 70% of our procurement partners (procurement spending basis, excluding publicly listed subsidiaries) to formulate CO2 reduction plans.\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society Through the Decarbonization Business\n\nExpanding the Decarbonization Business\n\n**Approach**\n\nTo help achieve a decarbonized society as set out in Hitachi\u2019s Environmental Vision, Hitachi provides value to customers and society by pursuing a decarbonization business that contributes to the reduction of CO2 emissions, leveraging collaborative creation with our partners. Hitachi has three major sectors\u2014Green Energy & Mobility, Digital Systems & Services, and Connective Industries\u2014as well as the Hitachi Astemo, automotive business area. We are developing the following businesses that contribute to decarbonization:\n\n- Businesses that help to accelerate the energy shift aimed at realizing decarbonization\n- Businesses that provide safe, comfortable, and clean mobility\n- Businesses that help to reduce CO2 emissions by using cutting-edge digital technologies to improve the efficiency of systems that underpin society\n- Businesses that help to decarbonize industries and cities by creating a resilient supply chain\n- Businesses that contribute to the electrification and autonomous driving of vehicles\n\nWe will work to expand our decarbonization business through the provision of these varied solutions, thereby helping the world to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\n**Activities**\n\n- Power grid solutions: Enhancing efficiency of transformers, high voltage products, and power transmission/distribution\n- Grid automation: Advancing smart grid control, etc.\n- Power generation: Promoting power generation systems using wind and other non-fossil energy sources\n- Railways: Enhancing energy-saving features of rolling stock, Developing smart operating systems, Enhancing maintenance service efficiency through rolling stock monitoring\n- Finance and public-oriented solutions: Promoting digital solutions\n- Data centers: Developing smart data centers\n- Servers/storage: Enhancing energy-saving features of servers and storage\n- Smart logistics: Improving energy-saving features through fully IT-enhanced logistics\n- Factory automation: Enhancing energy efficiency through shorter lead times\n- Water business: Enhancing efficiency of water and sewage systems\n- Industrial products: Enhancing efficiency of industrial products\n- Smart cities: Reducing CO2 through comprehensive urban energy management solutions\n- Home appliances: Enhancing energy efficiency of home appliances, Promoting connected home appliances\n- Elevators: Enhancing energy-saving features of elevators and escalators through replacement, Enhancing energy efficiency through total building solutions\n- Vehicle electrification: Promoting electrification through electric powertrain systems\n- AD/ADAS (Automatic Driving, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems): Reducing CO2 by improving operational efficiency through AD/ADAS solutions\n\nExamples of Decarbonization Business: A Hitachi Focus\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\nEnvironmental Governance\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\nEfforts to Achieve a Decarbonized Society\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society Through the Decarbonization Business\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)\nClimate-related Financial Information Disclosure (Based on TCFD Recommendations)\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\nEnvironmental Data\n\nEfforts to Reduce CO\u2082 Emissions During the Use of Products and Services\n\nApproach | Activities\n--- | ---\nTo reduce CO\u2082 emissions from the use of our products and services, which make up the largest proportion of emissions in our value chain, we have established target reduction rates of CO\u2082 emissions per unit based on fiscal 2010. For each product or service subject to this initiative, we calculate the reduction rate with CO\u2082 emissions as the numerator and function size*\u00b9 as the denominator. We will also help our customers and society to reduce CO\u2082 emissions through the products and services we sell. Hitachi aims to lead the world in decarbonization by making a reduction contribution of approximately 100 million metric tons/year in fiscal 2024 through enhancing power grid resilience and promoting the adoption of renewable energy and advancement of energy conservation throughout society in our aim of realizing a sustainable society.\n\nApproach to Calculating CO\u2082 Emission Reductions\n\nThe Guidelines on Calculating CO\u2082 Emission Reductions for Hitachi Group Products and Services*\u00b2 specify the following three methods for calculating different types of CO\u2082 emission reductions. Figures considered reductions for products and services while in use under the GHG Protocol, a standard for calculation and reporting of GHG emission, are calculated using method (1). Methods (2) and (3) are for avoided emissions.\n\n(1) Energy-saving feature enhancements\nSet a reduction rate of CO\u2082 emissions per unit (compared to fiscal 2010) based on efficiency enhancements such as energy-saving feature enhancement in products and services.

We identify 30 environmental impact items that may cause climate change, resource depletion, and ecosystem degradation across the entire life cycle of products and services, assess the level of environmental burden reduction across our business activities in multifaceted ways, and strive to achieve further reductions.\n\nInitiatives for Improving Environmental Performance of Products and Services\n\n- Promoting environmentally conscious processes: In accordance with the IEC 62430*\u00b9 criteria, promote environmentally conscious processes in designing and developing products and services including by meeting environmental regulatory requirements and ascertaining the environment-related needs of our stakeholders within our existing management system.\n- Implementing Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs): For our main, priority products, quantitatively evaluate their global environmental burden in such areas as the consumption of mineral resources, fossil fuels, and water resources, as well as their impact on climate change and air pollution, disclose the results to our stakeholders, and utilize them in improving the design of next-generation products.\n\n*\u00b9 The standard developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) concerning environmentally conscious design for electrical and electronic products.\n\nCase studies of Reducing CO\u2082 Emissions Throughout the Value Chain\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/environment/casestudy/index.html#case01\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)\n\n**CO\u2082 Emission Reductions at Business Sites (Factories and Offices) and Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030**\n\nIn working toward realizing a decarbonized society, Hitachi has set the goal of realizing carbon neutrality by fiscal 2030 at all business sites (factories and offices) as part of its long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050.\n\nOur roadmap to achieving this goal sets targets of reducing CO\u2082 emissions by 50%, compared to the base year, by fiscal 2024 and 80% by fiscal 2027 toward realizing carbon neutrality by fiscal 2030.\n\nApproaches to reducing CO\u2082 emissions include installing energy-saving and renewable energy equipment (including PPAs*\u00b9) and purchasing electricity from renewable sources, renewable energy certificates,*\u00b2 and high-quality credits for neutralization (environmental value obtained by removing carbon from the atmosphere). Among these, installing energy-saving and renewable energy equipment is expected to incur high costs relative to the amounts of reduction. However, it will also lead to reduced risks associated with factors including anticipated sharp rises in energy pricing and increased costs from carbon taxes and the expansion of carbon tax transactions. It also aligns with our Corporate Mission\u2014\"To contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products\"\u2014and for this reason as well, we are placing a priority focus on this approach. Currently, we have set the target at a 33% reduction to be made by fiscal 2030, however we are working to increase that level to 50%.\n\n1) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA): An arrangement in which a company (PPA provider) that owns and manages solar power generation equipment installs a solar power generation system in a space furnished by a facility owner, such as a lot or rooftop, and the electricity generated by it is supplied to the facility for a fee.\n\n2) Renewable energy certificate: Accredits the environmental value associated with electricity generation from renewable energy sources. Unlike the purchase of renewable electricity, acquisition of this environmental value, which is separate from the electricity itself, is regarded as equivalent to reducing CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nConcrete efforts to achieve carbon neutrality at business sites, categorized by location type (factories, offices), can be outlined as shown below.\n\n**Major Initiatives for Reducing CO\u2082 Emissions at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)**\n\n**Factories**\n- Improve equipment efficiency by introducing and upgrading to high-efficiency equipment\n- Improve production efficiency and energy use efficiency during production through use of the Lumada platform and production technologies cultivated from our long years of experience\n- Optimize equipment operations and reduce wasted energy by installing smart meters\n- Optimize control of equipment operations in response to production conditions\n- Install renewable energy systems\n- Use electricity from renewable sources\n- Adopt renewable energy certificate systems\n- Introduce off-balance-sheet solar power generation for self-consumption\n- Promote investment in carbon-reduction equipment through adoption of the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HCP) framework\n\n**Offices**\n- Build/move to new facilities with high energy efficiency\n- Combine and integrate existing facilities\n- Install energy-saving equipment and optimize equipment operations in collaboration with building owners\n\n**Factories and offices**\n- Install renewable energy systems\n- Use electricity from renewable sources\n- Adopt renewable energy certificate systems\n- Introduce off-balance-sheet solar power generation for self-consumption\n- Promote investment in carbon-reduction equipment through adoption of the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HCP) framework\nThe Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing Framework\n\n**System**\n\nTo promote CO2 reduction at its business sites (factories and offices), in fiscal 2019 Hitachi introduced the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) framework.\n\nSpecifically, with reference to emissions trading and carbon taxes globally, we establish company-internal carbon prices, convert into monetary value the effect of CO2 reductions due to investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization, add this to the value of energy reduction effects, and use the result to evaluate the effect of our investment. By applying incentives like these, we aim to further expand our investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization.\n\nInitially, we set the HICP rate at 5,000 yen/t-CO2 in consideration of 2025 carbon taxes and carbon trading prices (ETS*1). Subsequently, looking ahead to 2030, we increased the rate to 14,000 yen/t-CO2 in August 2021 in consideration of anticipated carbon taxes and carbon trading prices. We will leverage this framework to provide early responses to future risks such as carbon taxes as well as to actively promote the installation of energy-saving and renewable energy equipment, our highest priority initiative aimed at achieving carbon neutrality.\n\nIncreased burdens from carbon taxes and new emission regulations can be anticipated in the future. Taking such risk factors into account from the stage of equipment investment considerations and making investments that contribute to decarbonization a higher priority will help minimize the impacts of future climate change risks and make our company more resilient. The introduction of the HICP framework is instrumental in this process.\n\n**Achievements in FY 2021**\n\nAs a result of Hitachi\u2019s creation and implementation of the HICP framework, we have made additional investments in equipment that was previously judged to be effective in reducing CO2 emissions for projects that had not originally received sufficient investment due to their low levels of investment efficiency.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we invested in 59 cases of energy-saving equipment with a total investment of 1.460 billion yen. These investments contributed to an annual reduction of 1,230 metric tons of CO2 emissions. The annual amount of CO2 emission reductions from our business sites improved 2% compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\nWith factors including the revised rate of 14,000 yen/t-CO2, 33% of overall investments contributing to decarbonization were selected through the HICP framework. The scope of investments broadened to include categories such as reducing energy use in production facilities in addition to conventional categories like upgrading to high-efficiency equipment.\n\n**Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) Framework**\n\n**Approach to Assessing Investment Effectiveness with HICP**\n\nInvestment effect in monetary terms\n\n- CO2 reduction effects are converted into monetary value and added virtually\n- Asset values increase\n- Virtual effects are realized when investments are assessed\n\n**Before introducing HICP**\n\n- Energy reduction effect\n- CO2 reduction = cost reduction\n- Facilities that generate less CO2 have higher asset values\n\n**After introducing HICP**\n\n- Energy reduction effect\n- CO2 reduction = cost reduction\n- Facilities that generate less CO2 have higher asset values\n\n**Actions and Achievements**\n\nAt Hitachi, the achievement of environmental targets for individual business sites (factories and offices) set by the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 is measured by CO2 emissions per unit. Because we conduct business in various sectors, the KPI of CO2 emissions per unit for each business site is calculated using the site\u2019s CO2 emissions as the numerator and its activity amount*1 as the denominator.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, which was also the final year of the Environmental Action Plan for 2021, the reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit was 6% against a target of 9% (compared to the base year of fiscal 2010). Reasons for not reaching the target include an increase in the operation of equipment with high energy consumption in factories and lower production efficiency due to the inability stemming from COVID-19 to procure certain components.\n\nAlso, total CO2 emissions increased by approximately 2.6%, or 88 kt-CO2,*2 compared to fiscal 2020. This was influenced by an increase in operations by materials divisions.\n\n*1 Activity amount is a value closely related to CO2 emissions at each business site (for example, production quantity, output, building floor space, and number of employees).\n\n*2 The CO2 electrical power conversion factor for total CO2 emissions is market-based.\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\nEnvironmental Governance\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\nEfforts to Achieve a Decarbonized Society\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society Through the Decarbonization Business\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)\nClimate-related Financial Information Disclosure (Based on TCFD Recommendations)\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\nEnvironmental Data\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\n- CO\u2082 emissions reduction rate per unit (Hitachi Group)\n\n| FY 2010 (base year) | FY 2021 |\n|---------------------|---------|\n| 100%                | 94%     |\n\nCO\u2082 emissions reduction rate per unit at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)\n\nFrom base year 6% reduction FY 2021 reduction target: 9%\n\nNotes:\n- As with the CO\u2082 electrical power conversion factor in calculations of CO\u2082 emissions per unit, a unified factor of 0.530 kg-CO\u2082/kWh is applied across the entire Hitachi Group.\n- The Environmental Action Plan\u2019s management values do not include amounts for our power plants in fiscal 2010 (base year) or fiscal 2021. Emissions, which provide the basis for intensity metrics, are calculated according to the boundary of environmental performance aggregation data for fiscal 2021.\n\n- 1) CO\u2082 emitted from the organization (SCOPE 1 and 2).\n- 2) Activity amount is a value closely related to CO\u2082 emissions at each business site (for example, production quantity, output, building floor space, and number of employees).\n\nIntroducing Renewable Energy\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi is promoting the generation of power through solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy at its business sites. We are advancing related efforts with the aim of raising the share of this power in our total electricity consumption to 5% by fiscal 2030.\n\nAs well, for electricity we purchase, we are also offsetting any CO\u2082 emissions that cannot be reduced through energy-saving and renewable energy equipment by adopting the use of electricity from renewable sources. Going forward, we plan to reduce the total amount of electricity acquired by promoting even greater energy-saving. Renewable electricity used will be based on the standards set by the GHG Protocol.\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n\nRenewable energy generation across the Hitachi Group in fiscal 2021 increased by 56% compared to fiscal 2020, accounting for 0.7% of the electricity consumed by the entire Hitachi Group. Also, the amount of purchased renewable electricity used by the Hitachi Group in fiscal 2021 increased by 36% compared to fiscal 2020, accounting for 3.4% of the electricity consumed by the entire Hitachi Group.\n\nTogether, generated and purchased renewable electricity accounted for 4.1% of the electricity consumed by the entire Hitachi Group in fiscal 2021.\n\nAt ten sites in the United States, Europe, and Japan all the electricity used came from renewable sources. Moreover, three Hitachi High-Tech Group sites and one Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems Group site have achieved carbon neutrality by promoting further enhanced energy-saving and purchasing high-quality credits for neutralization.\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\n\nEnvironmental Governance\n\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\n\nEfforts to Achieve a Decarbonized Society\n\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society Through the Decarbonization Business\n\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)\n\nClimate-related Financial Information Disclosure (Based on TCFD Recommendations)\n\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\n\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nEnvironmental Data\n\nBusiness Sites Fully Powered by Renewable Electricity\n\n| Company                                      | Sites | Electricity (MWh) | Type                  |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Hitachi Computer Products (US)               | 1     | 11,263            | Wind power           |\n| Hitachi Rail Italy                           | 3     | 31,635            | Hydroelectric power, etc. |\n| Hitachi Astemo (UK)                          | 1     | 3,954             | Hydroelectric power, etc. |\n| Hitachi High-Tech Group (Japan)              | 3     | 11,104            | Hydroelectric and wind power |\n| Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems Group (US) | 1     | 11,171            | Wind power           |\n| Hitachi Construction Machinery Group (Japan)  | 1     | 11,702            | Wind and solar power |\n| Total                                        | 10    | 80,829            |                       |\n\nReducing Transportation Energy Consumption\n\nAs part of its efforts to reduce energy output during transportation as well as at its business sites (factories and offices), Hitachi has established targets for the reduction of transportation energy use per unit for each business unit and Group company in Japan.\n\nOutside Japan these targets are voluntary. Our business sites are promoting a modal shift to highly efficient transportation methods by improving truck loading ratios, taking other measures to reduce transportation energy consumption and switching to the use of eco-cars for in-house operations.\n\nEco Rail Mark Certification and Initiatives\n\nConsidering a modal shift from truck to rail transportation a high priority, we are working toward \u201cEco Rail Mark company\u201d and \u201cEco Rail certified product\u201d certifications from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. Transitioning from truck to railway transportation is expected to reduce CO2 emissions per unit to one-thirteenth of its current level, and we plan to continue expanding our use of railways for long-distance transportation.\n\nEco Rail Mark Initiatives\n\n| Company                                      | Certification |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Hitachi, Ltd.                                | Eco Rail Mark company*1, Eco Rail certified product*2 |\n| Hitachi Channel Solutions                    | Eco Rail Mark company*1 |\n| Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems Group   | Eco Rail certified product*2 |\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n\nTo reduce CO2 emissions in fiscal 2021, we focused on improving efficiency when loading products for transportation, increasing the use of coordinated transportation, and optimizing transport vehicles. However, due to increased production by our materials divisions and construction machinery divisions, CO2 emissions from transportation within Japan totaled 74.3kt-CO2, an increase of 5.4kt-CO2, or 7%, compared to fiscal 2020.\nClimate-related Financial Information Disclosure (Based on TCFD Recommendations) GRI 102-12\n\nIn June 2018, Hitachi announced its endorsement of the recommendations by the Financial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The following contains key climate-related financial information in line with the TCFD\u2019s recommendations.\n\n**Governance**\n\n**Structure**\n\nHitachi sees climate change and other environmental issues as important management issues.\n\nImportant matters concerning the Group\u2019s sustainability strategy, including climate change measures, are discussed and decided on by the Senior Executive Committee and are presented to the Board of Directors according to necessity.\n\nHitachi\u2019s long-term environmental targets called Environmental Innovation 2050, which include reducing CO2 emissions, were reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors when they were established and revised, and then shared with the public.\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee of independent directors conducts an audit of sustainability-related operations once a year, and Hitachi executive officers report on climate-related issues to the committee during the audit.\n\nAs for TCFD initiatives outside the company, since 2019 Hitachi has participated in the TCFD Study Group on Green Finance and Corporate Disclosures arranged by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). In addition, we have participated in the TCFD Consortium, which holds discussions on efforts to link companies\u2019 effective information disclosure and the information they disclose with appropriate investment decisions by financial institutions and others, as a Steering Committee member and contributed to their guidance formulation.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n**Approach**\n\nWe are responding to climate change by fulfilling our responsibilities as a global company by helping to achieve a decarbonized society. Under the RCP 2.6*\u00b9 and RCP 8.5*\u00b2 scenarios of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we established long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050\u2014as a transition plan to a decarbonized society\u2014in fiscal 2016 under our Environmental Vision. Moreover, in order to help limit the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C as recommended in the IPCC Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C report, in fiscal 2020 we revised our target to achieve carbon neutrality at Hitachi factories and offices by fiscal 2030. And then in fiscal 2021 we revised our target again to achieve carbon neutrality in our value chain by fiscal 2050.\n\nOur aim is to help create a decarbonized society, and we work to achieve the ambitious targets to realize that goal.\n\n*\u00b9 A Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario under which, at the end of the 21st century, the increase in global temperatures from preindustrial levels is kept below 2\u00b0C.\n\n*\u00b2 An RCP scenario that assumes that emissions will continue to rise resulting in an approximately 4\u00b0C rise in global temperatures compared to preindustrial levels.\n\n**Identification and Assessment of Climate-related Risks and Opportunities**\n\nThe Hitachi Group operates a broad array of businesses around the world with each business having its own set of risks and opportunities. We are responding to the impact of climate change by assessing climate-related risks and opportunities in accordance with TCFD classifications. We make sector-specific assessments of risks and opportunities for important business sectors that have a relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate change. Our assessments are also categorized according to time span, namely short term, medium term, and long term as defined below.\n\n**Time Spans for Assessing Climate-related Risks and Opportunities**\n\n| Time span | Reason for adoption |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| Short term | Over the next three years from fiscal 2022 to 2024 |\n| Medium term | Through fiscal 2030 |\n| Long term | Up to fiscal 2050 |\n\n**Degrees of Impact**\n\n| Impact | Definition |\n|--------|------------|\n| Major  | Has an impact sufficient to disrupt business or cause it to substantially decrease or increase |\n| Medium | Part of the business is impacted. |\n| Minor  | There is little impact. |\nResponding to Climate Scenario Risks and Opportunities for Each Business\n\nHitachi operates a broad array of businesses with each business having its own set of risks and opportunities. We therefore selected businesses that have a relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate change and conducted scenario analyses on them. In selecting the businesses, we took into account the factors of, high sales volume within the Group, and relatively high need for fossil fuels when products and services are used, as well as high CO2 emissions.\n\nThe businesses we selected were railway systems, power generation and power grids, IT systems, industrial equipment, automotive systems, and construction machinery. For each of these businesses, we considered the business environment under the 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios and how we would respond.\n\n1.5\u00b0C scenario\nAs projected by the IPCC\u2019s RCP 2.6 climate model, the IEA 450 Scenario, and other scenarios, we are anticipating a world where stringent measures and regulations will be implemented to help realize a decarbonized society. Therefore, we investigated risks and opportunities on the premise of carbon neutrality by fiscal 2050.\n\n4\u00b0C scenario\nWe focused on there being increased climate-induced natural disasters as a result of lax regulations as projected by the IPCC\u2019s RCP 8.5 scenario and other scenarios.\n\nOur assessment of the major risks and opportunities for the selected businesses are outlined in the following table.\n\n| Target businesses | Railway systems | Power generation and power grids | IT systems | Industrial equipment | Automotive systems |\n|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| **The business environment and major risks and opportunities under the 1.5\u00b0C scenario** | | | | | |\n| **Risks** | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative emission-reducing technologies including those to improve the efficiency of railway services through digital utilization such as dynamic headway (flexible operations in response to passenger demand) and new mobility services like MaaS. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the construction of power networks that would enable the mass introduction of renewable energy with large output fluctuations. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of high-efficiency, low-loss products. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of high-efficiency, low-loss products. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of high-efficiency, low-loss products. |\n| **Opportunities** | Demand will grow for rail services and less CO2 per distance covered.

On the other hand, it is expected that businesses that currently use fossil fuels will need to adapt to a decarbonized society by adopting new technologies such as hydrogen and biomass, as well as various measures to offset CO2 emissions. Since many of Hitachi\u2019s businesses use electricity, it is clear that there is little significant risk arising from the unavailability of fossil fuels.\n\nBelow is a summary of Hitachi\u2019s overall risks under the 1.5\u00b0C scenario and the 4\u00b0C scenario. Given Hitachi\u2019s business form, we have determined that these risks related to climate change can be addressed.\n\n(1) Risks related to the transition to a decarbonized economy (applying mostly to the 1.5\u00b0C scenario)\n\n| Category          | Major risks                                                                 | Time span | Impact | Main initiatives                                                                 |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Policy and legal  | Increased business costs from the introduction of carbon taxes, fuel/energy consumption taxes, emissions trading systems, and other measures | Short to long term | Medium | Shift from fossil fuel-using to non-fossil fuel-using businesses.

Measures tailored to the water risks of each manufacturing site will be strengthened in the future based on the results of a water risk assessment now being conducted. |\nClimate-related Opportunities (Hitachi Group)\n\nTo achieve the CO2 reduction targets set forth in our long-term environmental targets and 2024 Mid-term Management Plan, it is important not only to decarbonize our business sites (factories and offices) but also to reduce CO2 emissions from the use of products and services sold, which account for a large portion of emissions in the entire value chain. Developing and providing products and services that emit zero or very little CO2 during their use will not only satisfy customer needs but also help meet society's demands for reduced emissions. This represents a business opportunity for us in the short, medium, and long term and constitutes a major pillar of the Social Innovation Business that we are promoting as a management strategy.\n\n| Category                        | Major risks                                                                 | Impact | Main initiatives                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Acute and chronic physical risks| Increased corporate value and revenue from expanded sales of products and services with innovative technology that can contribute to the mitigation and adaptation of climate change | Medium | \u2022 Expand business areas that contribute to decarbonization.                      |\n|                                 |                                                                             |        | \u2022 Promote decarbonized solutions and services through collaborative initiatives with customers. |\n|                                 |                                                                             |        | \u2022 Focusing on the fields of energy, mobility, and industry, we are promoting greater utilization of digital technology (Green by Digital) and developing products that offer world-class efficiency. |\n| Resilience                      | Provision of solutions to address climate-related natural disasters         | Medium | \u2022 Providing disaster prevention solutions such as high-performance firefighting command systems |\n\nBased on the various reviews, Hitachi did not find any significant climate change-related risks that were difficult to respond to.\n\nHitachi believes that it has high resilience in the transition to a decarbonized society in the medium- to long-term, as it closely monitors market trends and will develop its business flexibly and strategically under both the 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios.\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\n\nEnvironmental Governance\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\nEfforts to Achieve a Decarbonized Society\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society Through the Decarbonization Business\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)\n\nClimate-related Financial Information Disclosure (Based on TCFD Recommendations)\n\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\n\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nEnvironmental Data\n\nRisk Management\nHitachi evaluates and monitors climate-related risks for each business unit and Group company as part of a process of assessing risks and opportunities. The results are tabulated by the Sustainability Promotion Division of Hitachi, Ltd. and those risks and opportunities perceived as being particularly important for the Group as a whole are deliberated and decided by the Senior Executive Committee and, if necessary, deliberated by the Board of Directors.\n\nMetrics and Targets\nHitachi defines medium- to long-term metrics and targets in the Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 long-term environmental targets. It also establishes and manages short-term metrics and targets in detail every three years through the Environmental Action Plan.\n\nMetrics for climate change mitigation and adaptation use total CO2 emissions and the reduction rate in CO2 emissions per unit. Total CO2 emissions from the use of sold products in SCOPE 3, which account for most of our emissions given the nature of Hitachi\u2019s business, fluctuate greatly due to changes in sales volumes and our business portfolio. This has the disadvantage of making it difficult to see the results of energy saving and efficiency improvements. Therefore, we have established CO2 emissions per unit as a metric for providing customers and society with products and services that emit less CO2 for those featuring equivalent value. We also set and manage a metric for avoided emissions that contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society as a whole.\n\nWe continue to reduce CO2 emissions generated at our own business sites (factories and offices) by utilizing the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) system, which provides incentives for capital investments that contribute to CO2 reductions. The carbon price for HICP is set at 14,000 yen per ton-CO2.\n\nIn addition, in April 2021, Hitachi, Ltd. introduced evaluations that take environmental value into account in the executive compensation system with a view to accelerating the creation of environmental value toward achievement of its long-term environmental targets. In addition, we plan to put approximately 500 billion yen toward the energy shift, the electrification of vehicles, and so on over the next three years from now to fiscal 2024 as R&D investments to create green value.\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\n\nEfforts to Achieve a Resource Efficient Society\n\nThe issues of water and resource scarcity, triggered by increasing water demand and population growth\u2014resulting in higher volumes of resources collected, extracted, used, and eventually emitted as waste\u2014are common concerns for the entire world. Uncertainty concerning natural disasters and geopolitical situations is on the rise as well. Hitachi\u2019s business operations will respond to these issues by working with our customers and society to help build a society that uses water and other resources efficiently.\n\nInitiatives in the Value Chain\nHitachi considers the circularity of resources across the value chain to be of key importance, as well as water usage reduction that takes into consideration water risks on a region-by-region basis at each stage of the supply chain. Accordingly, we will optimize water use and wastewater treatment in the supply chain, provide water-efficient products and services, while pushing circular-design initiatives, and develop tools, applications, and services to achieve a circular economy.\n\nInitiatives at Business Sites\nWe have set a long-term environmental target of improving the usage efficiency of water and other resources by 50% by fiscal 2050 compared to fiscal 2010 levels. We will create higher economic value using less water and other resources and pursue production activities with a low environmental burden.\nBuilding a Water Efficient Society\n\nResponding to Water Risks\n\nApproach\n\nSince Hitachi\u2019s exposures to water risks in its businesses vary by region and the type of business, it is important to identify their respective risks and implement countermeasures. To facilitate risk response, we have compiled the procedures for water risk identification and countermeasures into Water Risk Guidelines, which are followed by some 140 manufacturing sites around the world that are classified as category A in our environmental management classification.\n\nWe use our Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) and various globally recognized tools for water risk assessment as well as region- and operation-specific water risk identification checklists to identify and evaluate the water risks for each business unit and Group company, per country and region, and for the entire Group once a year.\n\nWe work to reduce water use according to the characteristics of local communities and businesses, comply with wastewater standards and other water-related regulations, and strengthen water management with the aim of improving efficiency in the use of water by 50%, which we have set as a long-term environmental target.\n\nIdentification of Water Risks Using the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS)\n\n| Number of evaluation items related to water resources, water quality, water damage, regulations, reputational risk, etc. | Regional water risks | Operational water risks |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Approximately 50                                             | Approximately 70     |\n\nRisk identification method\n\nVarious water risk assessment tools, including Aqueduct, Water Risk Filter, Water Risk Filter, Flood Hazard Map of the World, are combined to identify risks based on the address information.\n\nRisks are identified from information such as a business site\u2019s volume of water intake and effluents discharged, and its water-related initiatives.\n\nRisk assessment\n\nAssessed using a five-level scale from low to extremely-high\n\nAssessed using a five-level scale from low to extremely-high\n\nRisk results\n\nHigh at 4 sites\n\nLow to medium-high at all sites, including the 4 to the left\n\nNo business sites are facing a comprehensively high water risk.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2021\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we assessed the water risks in each region and identified high regional water risks at a total of four business sites operating in India and Vietnam out of manufacturing sites that are classified as category A in our environmental management classification. With this, we then assessed the operational water risks, which were found to be \u201clow to medium-high at all business sites\u201d including the four business sites identified earlier. For this reason, Hitachi does not consider that any of its business sites face a comprehensively high water risk. The water use at the four business sites is 0.3 million m\u00b3, accounting for about 1% of the 25.6 million m\u00b3 of water used in Hitachi\u2019s main manufacturing processes.\n\nWater Resource Management System\n\nHitachi has set a long-term goal of improving efficiency in the use of water and is carrying out activities in pursuit of this goal at major manufacturing sites that are classified as category A in our environmental management classification. The Water Risk Response Working Group (WG), consisting of members of major business units and Group companies, discusses the formulation of water-related plans and their level of achievement. These are then deliberated on and finalized in the Eco-Management Meetings. Important items related to environmental initiatives, including water risk, are also discussed or decided on by the Senior Executive Committee and presented to the Board of Directors.\nManagement of Water Use at Business Sites\n\nFiscal 2021 was the final year of the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 (fiscal 2019\u20132021), which set out a target of a 26% reduction (over the base year of fiscal 2010) for water usage per unit in manufacturing processes. We achieved the target with a 36% reduction. The volume of water used declined by 30.9 million m\u00b3, equivalent to 59% from the base year. Our measures to reduce water usage include more stringent management of water intake using flowmeters, leakage control by installing above-ground water pipes, circular use of cooling water, and reuse of purified waste water.\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\n| Activities | Reduction in Water Usage*1 per Unit (Hitachi Group) |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| FY 2010 (base year) | 38.54 |\n| FY 2021 | 26.35 |\n\n*1 The total amount of water input in manufacturing processes and for other purposes, such as in offices.\n\nNote: In addition to this figure, the fiscal 2021 water inputs of an energy-related company and automotive business companies, which became consolidated subsidiaries in fiscal 2020, were 4.75 million m\u00b3/year and 3.91 million m\u00b3/year, respectively. The companies\u2019 inputs will be incorporated into the Hitachi Group\u2019s water input from fiscal 2022.\n\nCase Studies of Improving Water Use Efficiency\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/environment/casestudy/index.html#case03\n\nProducts and Services that Contribute to Resolving Water Issues\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi is committed to contributing to the effective use of limited water resources. We will strive to solve numerous issues faced by customers that are involved in the water supply and sewage business by combining our track record and know-how of operational technology (OT) and products and services cultivated over many years as a comprehensive water service provider with IT which Hitachi possesses abundant experience and knowledge of in diverse fields.\n\nHitachi\u2019s Water-related Products and Services\n\nActivity field | Products or services (implementation to date)\n--- | ---\nCreating water resources | Wastewater recycling systems\nSeawater desalination systems\nDeveloping water infrastructure | Water purification plants (approximately 700 plants in Japan)\nSewage treatment plants (approximately 900 plants in Japan)\nComprehensive digital solutions for water and sewage treatment operators\n\nWe are also engaged in verification tests and joint research with national and local governments, companies, and other organizations in various countries to establish new technologies and systems for the water business. In recent years, we have participated in a verification project for an integrated seawater desalination and water reuse system in the Republic of South Africa, a verification project to optimize the operational planning of water pumps using a virtual power plant in Japan, and joint research on the automation of water purification plants operations through the use of AI.\n\nWater Environment Solutions\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/businesses/infrastructure/product/site/water_environment/index.html\nBuilding a Society That Uses Resources Efficiently\n\nApproach to Transitioning to a Circular Economy\n\nTo help build a recycling-oriented society, Hitachi will advance a shift from the conventional linear economy to a circular economy. We strive to realize this goal with a dual approach of pursuing effective and sustainable use of resources and assets in Hitachi\u2019s business activities and achieving the circularity of resources throughout the value chain.\n\nBeyond the issues of the long-term use of products, and the reuse, repair, refurbishment, repurposing, and remanufacturing of products that are no longer needed in the course of our business activities, our customers\u2019 needs are changing from goods to experiences, or from ownership to leasing. Responding to such a society, we will promote the effective use of resources and assets, such as with leasing, pay-per-use systems, subscriptions, products as a service, reuse, and models for sharing. Also, in order to support the business model described above, at the stages of procurement, development, and design we will advance eco-designs. This includes ease of disassembly, adoption of mono-materials, durability, repairability, and resource saving as well as greater use of recycled materials and environmentally friendly materials. Having already been applying Environmentally Conscious Design Assessments and Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) for newly developed products, we have now set clear goals of achieving 100% implementation and are working to promote it.\n\nWith regard to initiatives spanning the value chain, we feel it will be imperative to advance the efforts together with a diverse range of stakeholders on a medium- to long-term basis. For example, if we introduce products as a service, we will not dispose of old products ourselves, rather, we aim to reliably attain circularity by sharing goals and engaging in co-creation with a diverse range of stakeholders in the value chain in order to realize the effective and sustainable use of resources and assets.\n\nAdditionally, we will actively promote the research and development involving raw materials, products, tools, applications, and services necessary for this and leverage the advantages of Hitachi\u2019s OT \u00d7 IT \u00d7 Products to support the achievement of circularity not only in our value chain, but in our customers\u2019 activities as well.\nManagement of Waste Generated at Business Sites\n\nFor fiscal 2021, which is the final year of the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 (fiscal 2019\u20132021), we set a target of a 12% reduction (from a base year of fiscal 2010) for waste and valuables*1 generated per unit, and bettered this by achieving an 18% reduction. The amount of waste and valuables generated was reduced by 241 kt or 18% compared to the base year. We strived to reduce waste by installing recycling facilities within our business sites as well as through closed-loop recycling, whereby the by-products and scrap from the production process are reused as resources by other business sites, and repeated use of packing and cushioning materials during transport.\n\nAlso, we are promoting activities to achieve the goal of the Zero Waste to Landfill*2 initiative, which seeks to minimize landfill disposal to realize the ongoing, sustainable utilization of resources we have used, and in fiscal 2021, 64 business sites out of 155 target sites achieved their goals. For hazardous wastes, we collect environmental load data using the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) to centrally manage the volumes of hazardous wastes generated and exported by type, and to ensure thorough compliance with laws and regulations, as well as proper disposal within the Group.\n\n*1 Waste and valuables: Materials generated through business activities. Each country has a legal definition of waste, and in Japan, the term refers to refuse, bulky refuse, ashes, sludge, excreta, waste oil, waste acid and alkali, carcasses, and other filthy and unnecessary matter, which are in a solid or liquid state according to the Waste Management and Public Cleansing Law. Valuables, meanwhile, are those materials left over after business activities other than waste, and can be sold or transferred free of charge to other parties as items of value.\n\n*2 Zero Waste to Landfill goal: Defined as a final disposal rate (landfill disposal/waste and valuables) of less than 0.5% in any given fiscal year in the Hitachi Group. Pursued in assumed conformance with regulations, conditions, etc.\nPlastic Recycling Activities\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi Global Life Solutions, whose plastic consumption accounts for around 70% of the Hitachi Group\u2019s total, uses recycled plastic in parts for washing machines and refrigerators and packing materials for ceiling lights. The company procures recycled plastic materials produced within the Hitachi Group using plastic parts recovered from end-of-life home appliances and plastic containers as well as purchasing recycled plastics from materials manufacturers.\n\nWhile large components in washing machines (such as enclosure bases in the lower parts of units) were previously made with mixtures of new and recycled materials, a switch to almost 100% recycled plastics use has been achieved through the clearing of technical problems and handling of procurement issues.\n\nHitachi Global Life Solutions works to recycle four categories of end-of-life home appliances (air conditioners, TVs, refrigerators/freezers, and washing machines/dryers) at 19 recycling plants as part of cooperative efforts among five companies*1 in response to the 2001 Act on Recycling of Specified Home Appliances. A total of 91,130 kt of recyclable materials*2 were recovered in fiscal 2021 of which approximately 81,768 kt were recycled. By product type, the recycling rate for refrigerators and freezers was 80%, exceeding the legal requirement of 70% by 10 percentage points, and for washing machines and dryers it was 94%, exceeding the legal requirement of 82% by 12 percentage points.\n\nWe are working to strengthen our activities from fiscal 2022 onward with the goal of achieving a 100%*3 effective utilization rate of waste plastics throughout the entire Hitachi Group by fiscal 2030.\n\n---\n\n*1 Hitachi Global Life Solutions; Sharp Corporation; Sony Corporation; Fujitsu General Limited; and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.\n*2 Parts and materials recovered from four categories of end-of-life home appliances (air conditioners, TVs, refrigerators/freezers, and washing machines/dryers) and recycled through in-house use, selling them, or transferring them free of charge to others who will use them. Data values are aggregated from Hitachi Global Life Solutions and Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning.\n*3 Effective utilization encompasses material recycling, chemical recycling, and thermal recovery. Pursued in assumed conformance with regulations, conditions, etc.\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\nEnvironmental Governance\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\nManaging and Reducing Chemical Substances\nPreserving Ecosystems\n\nEnvironmental Data\n\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nEfforts to Achieve a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nTo adequately preserve the ecosystem and achieve a harmonized society with nature so that we may continue to enjoy nature\u2019s benefits, we have established targets to minimize our impact on natural capital as part of our long-term environmental targets.\n\nWe classify the emission of greenhouse gases and chemical substances into the atmosphere and the generation of waste materials in the course of our business activities as negative impact activities. Providing products and services that contribute to ecosystem preservation and undertaking activities to preserve biodiversity and ecosystems are categorized as positive impact activities. We are working to quantify and minimize the gap between positive and negative impacts by 2050.\n\nInitiatives to Minimize Impacts on Natural Capital\n\nActivities\nHitachi has identified the negative impacts that our business activities have on natural capital with the aim of reducing such impacts and evaluated them using the latest version of an inventory database (IDEA v2*\u00b9). According to our estimates, approximately 80% of our total negative impacts on natural resources in fiscal 2021 were related to climate change, ecotoxicity (air), urban air pollution, and resource consumption. With regard to climate change, we will advance initiatives aimed at realizing a decarbonized society. Regarding ecotoxicity (air), urban air pollution, and resource consumption, in consideration of the findings coming to light in impact assessments concerning raw materials procurement, we will accelerate the pace of efforts intended to achieve a resource efficient society. Also, we found negative impacts were reduced by 15% in fiscal 2021 from fiscal 2020. To further reduce our environmental load to minimize our impact on natural capital, we will enhance a wide range of activities such as increasing the energy efficiency of our products and services, advancing factory efficiency, using resources more effectively, and properly managing chemical substances.\n\nAs for expanding our positive impact activities, while advancing social contribution activities like forest conservation and business activities that directly contribute to ecosystem preservation, such as building water treatment plants, we are also looking into quantifying the impact of these activities on the environment.\n\nWe estimate the benefits gained through our forest conservation activities (flood prevention, water impoundment, water purification, soil loss prevention, and carbon fixation) on an ongoing basis using evaluation methods commonly used in forestry-related public works projects. We also collect data on forested areas targeted for conservation activities using the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS). These data are needed to evaluate forest conservation efforts, and in fiscal 2021, we surveyed 0.84 km\u00b2 of such areas.\n\nNote: Calculated from version 2 of the Life-cycle Impact Assessment Method based on Endpoint Modeling (LIME2) by using IDEA v2.\n\n*\u00b9 IDEA v2: One of Japan\u2019s leading inventory databases which is needed to implement LCAs for calculating negative impacts.\nEnvironmental\n\nExecutive Summary\nAdvancing Our Environmental Vision and Long-Term Environmental Targets\n\nEnvironmental Governance\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nManaging and Reducing Chemical Substances\nPreserving Ecosystems\n\nEnvironmental Data\n\n30by30 Alliance for Biodiversity Approved by Ministry of the Environment (MOE), Japan\n\nThe 30by30 target aims to conserve or protect at least 30% of the land and sea areas in Japan by 2030 to achieve nature-positive goals of curbing biodiversity loss and promoting restoration by the same year.\n\nThe 30by30 Alliance for Biodiversity was established to promote achievement of the 30by30 target agreed to at the G7 Summit 2021 and consists of governments, companies, and NPOs. Its goals are expanding national parks, registering in an international database areas such as rural satochi-satoyama landscapes and commercial forests for which biodiversity preservation is planned by various organizations, promoting the conservation of such areas and actively sharing information concerning these activities.\n\nHitachi supports this mission and will work to advance related efforts.\n\nSigning the Call to Action Statement, Initiated by Business for Nature\n\nIn 2020, the global Business for Nature coalition issued a Call to Action*1 statement. The aim is to encourage policy makers around the world to adopt policies to \u201cto reverse nature loss in this decade.\u201d Hitachi agrees with this goal and has signed the statement.\n\n*1 The Call to Action states that healthy societies, resilient economies and thriving businesses rely on nature. It urges governments to adopt policies to reverse the loss of nature, and calls for the protection, restoration, and sustainable use of natural resources.\n\nScope of Negative Impact Calculations\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/environment/data/method.html\n\nBusiness for Nature\u2019s Call to Action\nhttps://www.businessfornature.org/call-to-action\n\n30by30 Alliance (In Japanese only)\nhttps://policies.env.go.jp/nature/biodiversity/30by30alliance/\nManaging and Reducing Chemical Substances\n\nManaging Chemical Substances\n\nApproach\n\nHitachi believes that the control and reduction of chemical substances like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the causes of urban air pollution, are important not only for reducing discharge of pollutants into the air and water environment but also for properly managing chemical substance usage, in order to minimize our impact on natural capital.\n\nBased on this belief, Hitachi formulated the Environment and CSR-Based MONOZUKURI Standards to manage chemical substances at all stages of its operations\u2014from design and development, procurement, and production to quality assurance and shipping. Chemical substances in our products are divided into two categories, prohibited substances and controlled substances, for separate management to respond to legal and regulatory frameworks at shipping destinations. With regard to chemical substances used in our business operations, we reduce risk by assigning three ranks to the use of such substances: prohibited, reduced, and controlled, as well as by educating chemical substance handlers and managers on laws and regulations and on proper risk assessment.\n\nManaging Chemical Substances in Our Products\n\nHitachi designates the chemical substances in our products requiring management as Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances. With the basic principle of taking as our model the standards of the EU, where regulations are stringent, we determine and manage controlled chemical substances regardless of export destination, type of industry, or purpose of use.\n\nThe list of managed substances and management levels is revised when necessary based on updates to the EU\u2019s REACH*1 and other regulations, with the aim of adding substances to our list of Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances six months before they are officially regulated. For instance, we have revised this list to include perfluorocarboxylic acids containing 9 to 14 carbon atoms in the chain (C9-C14 PFCAs), their salts, and their related substances due to new EU REACH regulations having been placed on them effective February 2023.\n\nClassification Examples\n\nProhibited Substances (Level 1)\n\nSubstances for which use is generally prohibited inside and outside Japan in products (including packaging) but which might be found in products from suppliers.\n\nControlled Substances (Level 2)\n\nSubstances we are required to track and manage the use of and substances requiring attention to recycling or appropriate disposal methods.\n\nManaging Chemical Substances in Our Business Operations\n\nHitachi has been cutting emissions of chemical substances from its factories and other sites through stricter management, such as by expanding the number and scope of controlled chemical substances.\n\nCase studies for reduction have been translated into English and Chinese and shared globally among Hitachi Group companies. We also follow legally prescribed procedures in measuring and managing emissions*1 of sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), whose measurement is required under the laws and regulations of our business site locations, and are advancing efforts to further restrict emissions.\n\nWe comply with Japan\u2019s Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) Law*2 through Group-wide monitoring of chemical substances released into the atmosphere or into public waters, removed outside our plants as waste, or discharged into sewage systems, reporting the results to local governments for each office or plant. Although some substances are exempt from reporting due to their small quantities, our policy is to aggregate and manage data on the handling, emission, and transfer of all PRTR substances totaling 10 kilograms or more per year.\n\n*1 Emissions of SOx and NOx: Calculated from data by business site (measured values, exhaust volume, content rate, etc.).\n\n*2 PRTR Law: Act on Confirmation, etc. of Release Amounts of Specific Chemical Substances in the Environment and Promotion of Improvements to the Management Thereof.\nIn fiscal 2021, which is the final year of the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 (fiscal 2019\u20132021), toward the target of reducing atmospheric emissions of chemical substances per unit by 18% from the base year 2010, we achieved a reduction rate of 35%. To reduce the emissions, we are switching from paints containing VOCs to water-soluble and powder paints as well as expanding their use and altering the painting and washing processes.\n\n**Environmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values**\n\n- **Reduction in Atmospheric Emissions of Chemical Substances per Unit (Hitachi Group)**\n  - FY 2010 (base year)\n  - FY 2021\n  - 100% Emissions: 3,863 t\n  - 65% Emissions: 2,499 t\n\n**Reduction in atmospheric emissions of chemical substances per unit**\n\n- **35% reduction**\n  - FY 2021 reduction target: 18%\n\n**Notes:** Atmospheric emissions of VOCs and other chemical substances are calculated from the content rate included in the ingredients.\n\n**Case Studies of Reducing Chemical Substances in Our Business Activities**\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/environment/casestudy/index.html#case05\nPreserving Ecosystems\n\nInitiatives to Preserve Ecosystems\n\nAt Hitachi, we seek to reduce negative impacts on natural capital caused by business activities and to promote positive impacts, such as by undertaking social contribution activities to protect nature and providing products and services that help preserve the ecosystem, thereby minimizing our impact on natural capital by fiscal 2050.\n\nHitachi created an Ecosystem Preservation Activities Menu citing the specific activities to be undertaken to promote the preservation of the ecosystem, including activities that are difficult to quantify but are nonetheless important, such as the protection of rare species and efforts to make biodiversity a criterion when making investment decisions. Each business site sets its goals and promotes initiatives based on the Ecosystem Preservation Activities Menu and helps realize a harmonized society with nature.\n\n| Category | Activities | No. of menu items |\n|----------|------------|------------------|\n| Production | Reducing use of resources that cannot be reused | 4 |\n| Transportation | Using packaging that takes ecosystem into consideration | 7 |\n| Collection, disposal, and recycling | Reducing hazardous materials in products | 2 |\n| Product planning, development, and design | During R&D, estimating impact on biodiversity during a product\u2019s life cycle and implementing, if needed, mitigation measures | 3 |\n| Site management | Using native species, setting up biotopes | 17 |\n| Water use | Using rainwater | 1 |\n| Investment and acquisition | Confirming impacts on biodiversity when investing in or acquiring a business, and implementing measures to minimize such impacts | 1 |\n| Market entry and expansion | Including biodiversity as an investment criterion | 1 |\n| Business development | Developing products and services to purify water, air, and soil and expanding such businesses | 1 |\n| Procurement | Preferentially procuring paper and other office supplies that take biodiversity into consideration | 17 |\n| Transportation | Implementing ballast water measures during marine transportation | 2 |\n| Sales | Implementing sales expansion of products that take biodiversity into consideration | 9 |\n| Collection, disposal, and recycling | Raising and recycling components | 7 |\n| Entire value chain | Promoting the use of renewable energy | 1 |\n| Engagement | Promoting employee activities outside the company | 3 |\n| Social contribution | Implementing desert greening and afforestation activities | 12 |\n| Water intake | Observing and collecting biota information (impact on ecosystem depending on intake volume) | 14 |\n| Water discharge | Setting up biota management indicators and making observations (species and numbers of inhabiting organisms) | 14 |\n\nCase Studies of Promoting Ecosystem Preservation\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/environment/casestudy/index.html#case06\nEnvironmental Data\n\nGHG Emissions Throughout the Value Chain\n\nCalculating GHG Emissions Throughout the Value Chain (Fiscal 2021)\n\nHitachi calculates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the value chain in conformance with GHG Protocol standards. This gives us a good grasp of emission hotspots in our value chain with which we can establish effective targets and reduction measures. Energy-related CO2 accounts for almost all of Hitachi\u2019s GHG emissions, with there being negligible releases of other gases, making it all the more important to focus on CO2 reduction efforts.\n\nAn extremely high share of our value chain emissions comes from the use of the products and services we sell. We thus believe that we can make a major contribution to decarbonization through our businesses by giving priority to enhancing the efficiency and energy-saving features of our products and services.\n\nTotal GHG Emissions: 70.75 Mt-CO2e\n\nSCOPE 1: Direct emissions from in-house fuel use and industrial processes\n- 1.27 Mt-CO2e [1.8%]\n\nSCOPE 2: Indirect emissions from production of electricity and heat purchased by the company\n- 2.14 Mt-CO2e [3.0%]\n\nSCOPE 3: Upstream\n- Other indirect emissions not covered by SCOPE 1 and 2 (Emissions by other entities related to the company\u2019s activities)\n  - 58.59 Mt-CO2e [82.6%]\n\nSCOPE 3: Downstream\n- Other indirect emissions not covered by SCOPE 1 and 2 (Emissions by other entities related to the company\u2019s activities)\n  - 8.75 Mt-CO2e [12.4%]\n\nIn-house: Within the scope of the company\u2019s organizational boundaries.

In the Research & Development Group, we are placing particular emphasis on developing top-class AI researchers*1 and established the Lumada Data Science Lab. to bring together digital human resources to foster and develop them. This helped us to realize our target (350 top-class AI researchers by fiscal 2021) ahead of schedule, with currently 399 at the end of fiscal 2021.\n\n*1 Top-class researchers who use AI/analytics, and data scientists who received internal certification.\n\nAI Ethics\n\nActivities\n\nIn February 2021, Hitachi released Principles guiding the ethical use of AI in Social Innovation Business and a white paper on Hitachi\u2019s activities in the area of AI ethics. Its goal is to ensure human-centric AI development and societal implementation.\n\nSince then, we have striven toward the development, societal implementation, and proper utilization of human-centric AI that is safe and secure. And in the AI development stage, we are working to curb the various risks that arise when using AI.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we checked approximately 800 AI projects in the planning phase, identified risks and took measures against them.\n\nHereafter, we will continue to promote the establishment of AI governance, and help to stimulate discussions throughout society. We are continually working to improve the substance and operation of this effort, while incorporating the opinions of stakeholders and changes in the external environment.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2021\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we published a special issue of Hitachi Review, AI Governance and Ethics in Social Innovation Business. It provides an in-depth explanation of Hitachi\u2019s approach to AI ethics and governance for AI implementation in research, PoC, and product development.\n\nMajor External Recognitions in Fiscal 2021\n\nIn the environmental sector, we received the 68th Okochi Memorial Prize and the 2021 Commendation for Science and Technology by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Awards for Science and Technology (Development Category) for the development of a compact and high power density inverter for EVs and PHVs, together with Hitachi Astemo. In the digital sector, together with the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience, we were awarded the R&D World Magazine\u2019s R&D100 Award for the SIP4D: Shared Information Platform for Disaster Management, together with the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience, Japan.\n\nWith regard to products, Hitachi\u2019s Urban Ace HF standard elevator was recognized in Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun\u2019s 64th (2021) Best Ten Greatest New Products Award, and the EMU3000 rolling stock built for Taiwan Railways Administration, MOTC, was awarded the Good Design Award 2021, Best 100.\n\nRecognition was also given by the Japan Association of Technology Executives to Dr. Shizu Takeda, Corporate Chief Scientist, for outstanding achievement in training female engineers and researchers with the 7th Distinguished Service Award for fostering female technologists.\nIntellectual Property\n\nApproach to Intellectual Property\n\nHitachi has positioned intellectual property (IP) activities as one of its key business strategies, and has established a basic policy for the protection of IP and brand in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct. Under the Mid-term Management Plan 2021, in line with the stated vision of becoming a global leader driving enhanced value through the use of intellectual property and the goal of realizing IP-driven social innovations, we engaged in value-based (Environment, Safety & Security, Resilience) intellectual property activities. In the Mid-term Management Plan 2024, we established a new vision to become a global leader that resolves societal issues and grows our DX and GX businesses using intellectual property. We will achieve further advances and growth in the our Social Innovation Business through the protection and use of intellectual property centered on Green, Digital and Innovative initiatives.\n\nIntellectual Property Strategy\n\nHitachi has formulated and implemented an IP strategy that consists of three pillars: Competition, Collaboration, and IP for society.\n\nIP Strategy for Competition\n\nThe IP strategy for Competition is centered on acquiring and utilizing patents and other IP rights. \"IP Master Plans\" customized for the nature of each business are formulated and implemented to enforce competitiveness.\n\nIP Strategy for Collaboration\n\nAs opportunities for co-creation with our customers and partners increase through the use of our IoT platform, Lumada, we are expanding the scope of our IP activities to include not only copyrights, patents, and trade secrets as well as information assets such as data and information, and are using IP to promote partnerships and build ecosystems.\n\nIP for society\n\nHitachi is strategically engaged in IP activities that contribute to solving social issues. In fiscal 2019, we introduced the \"IP for society\" concept, in which we promote the use of IP in certain highly public domains to maintain and evolve social norms. We will work in cooperation with external organizations (national governments, municipalities, universities, organizations in the United Nations, international standards organizations, etc.) through the use of IP to make contributions to businesses aimed at achieving SDGs.\nGlobal Deployment of Intellectual Property\n\nApproach\n\nWe are contributing to the globalization of Hitachi\u2019s business by strengthening international patent applications (PCT applications) that cover inventions that were developed through open innovation with our customers and partners in addition to inventions from our own R&D activities. We will work to promote further globalization of our IP by working in cooperation with new members of the Hitachi Group, including Hitachi Energy and GlobalLogic.\n\nFramework to Promote Global Deployment\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we changed the name of the Intellectual Property Division to the Global Intellectual Property Group. Our intent was to strengthen collaboration with companies outside of Japan and promote further global deployment of our IP activities.\n\nMoreover, we have created the new role of Chief Intellectual Property Officer (CIPO) to serve as the Hitachi Group\u2019s metaphorical control tower with regards to IP. We have also established a new CIPO Office within the Global Intellectual Property Group that will work to support the formulation and execution of CIPO strategy. The highly experienced Stephen Manetta, who comes from outside the company, has been appointed CIPO to hasten the enhancement of our system for global IP management (which promotes the protection and utilization of global IP, including at group companies outside of Japan).\n\nSpecifically, we cover our globalized business in collaboration with our IP offices in the United States (Santa Clara and Farmington Hills), China (Beijing), United Kingdom (London), Singapore, Switzerland, and India.\n\nNew Initiatives Linked to Innovation\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi is promoting activities that contribute to innovation by analyzing IP information. In the Environment field, for example, we analyze the degree of market maturity for each theme. This involves estimating the market\u2019s scale and growth potential based on the compound annual growth rate of the most recent inventions worldwide. We also use IP information and other data to estimate and analyze the degree of technological superiority Hitachi has for each theme.\n\nWe contribute to innovation through these processes by identifying markets with high growth potential, areas where we have the greatest technological advantages, and providing our findings to business divisions.\n\nIntellectual Property Activities Aimed at Creating Environmental Value\n\nActivities\n\nWe are working to create solutions that utilize IP to enhance environmental value.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we newly established an Environmental IP Enhancement Center within the Intellectual Property Division. With it, we have begun considering policies (solution creation contributing to environmental value realization, construction of IP libraries, etc.) aimed at improving environmental value from the perspective of IP. In order to maximize Hitachi\u2019s business\u2014especially environmental value\u2014by accumulating and utilizing knowledge of the results of IP activities that contribute to improving environmental value, Hitachi established guidelines and deployed them internally. With regard to IP libraries in particular, our hope is to link the IP we possess internally with the environmental value that the utilization of such IP may bring about, to visualize them and promote their use both within the company and externally.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2021\n\nHitachi has registered our wind-generation technology that contributes to solving issues of climate change with WIPO GREEN a platform for environmental technology operated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). We also share our ambition to inspire innovation by accelerating the application of environmental IP through collaboration with WIPO GREEN, and have shared this message in a video.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk18jbfqqSk\nAchieving Visualization and Scaling Beyond the Company with IP Libraries that Link IP with Environmental Value\n\nHitachi\u2019s Environmental Vision\nWorld Environmental Innovation 2050\nHigh-speed battery deterioration diagnosis (Hitachi High-Tech)*\u00b9\nVisualization of green energy*\u00b2\n\nContributing to society\nRealization of SDGs, Society 5.0, and the circular economy\n\nEnvironmental value\nEnvironmental value\n\nRegistration\nUtilization\n\nSolutions\nEnvironmental value\nIP\n\nVisualization of green energy\nCO\u2082 reduction\nIP (A)\n\nHigh-speed battery deterioration diagnosis\nCO\u2082 reduction\nIP (B)\n\nOptimization of production management\nEnergy savings\nIP (C)\n\nOptimization of building management\nCO\u2082 reduction\nIP (D)\n\nConstructing IP libraries (ex.)\n\nHome appliance recycling\nHigh-efficiency seawater desalination system\n\nAppropriate registration in IP marketplaces\n\nWIPO GREEN\n(Environmental technology transfer platform)\n\n*\u00b9 PCT application JP2020/028961\n*\u00b2 Patent application 2019-073173\n\nReward System for Employee Inventions\n\nWe motivate employees in the R&D field with an ample reward system for new inventions. To make this reward system as fair and transparent as possible, we set standards to evaluate inventions and disclose these standards to employees. We also have a mechanism for receiving inquiries about the rewards that was paid to employees, as well as opinions on the reward system.\n\nWe have established a special department within the Intellectual Property Division to plan and operate this system, while an internal Invention Management Committee made up of R&D, legal affairs, personnel management, and IP experts ensures that the system operates effectively across the whole Group.\n\nInternal Rewards for Inventors\n\nInvention Information System\nSystem allowing inventors to check the evaluation standards used to calculate rewards for inventions\n\nArbitration Committee for Invention Rewards\nCommittee to which inventors can appeal if they disagree with the amount they have been awarded\n\nBusiness Contribution Awards Annual Top 100\nPresident\u2019s awards to the top 100 inventors based on patent rewards received\n\nPatent Contribution Awards Top 50\nRanking of the top 50 young inventors (under 35 years of age) based on patent rewards received within five years of their joining Hitachi\n\nAwards for Intellectual Property\n\nWe are proud of Hitachi, Ltd.\u2019s inclusion in Clarivate Plc\u2019s Derwent Top 100 Global Innovators list for the past 11 years consecutively.\n\nOrganizer\nAward\nObject of Award\n\nFY 2021\nClarivate Plc\nSelected for inclusion in Derwent Top 100 Global Innovators (2021) list (for 11th consecutive year)\nThe most innovative companies and institutions in the world\n\nFY 2020\nJapan Patent Office, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry\nAward from Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry at the Intellectual Property Achievement Awards\nExcellent company that utilizes the IP rights system\n\nFY 2019\nJapan Patent Office\nImperial Invention Prize (top prize) at the National Commendation for Invention\nDesigns concerning UK high-speed rail vehicles\n\nFY 2018\nJapan Institute of Invention and Innovation\nThe Japan Patent Attorneys Association Chairman Award at the National Commendation for Invention\nInventions concerning x-ray fluoroscopy systems\n\nFY 2017\nImperial Invention Prize (top prize) at the National Commendation for Invention\nInventions concerning particle beam therapy systems\n\nProtecting Our Designs and Brand\n\nTo protect Hitachi\u2019s designs and brand, we take resolute measures against such infringements as making and selling counterfeit goods, copying our designs or carrying the Hitachi brand, and illegally applying for or registering trademarks of such goods.\n\nIn recent years, we are intensifying our efforts to identify counterfeiting networks, whose manufacturing methods and sales channels have become more sophisticated and diverse. We are also working with e-commerce site operators on countermeasures against online counterfeit sales.\nHitachi prioritizes human capital. In other words, Hitachi believes that employees are the source of value. As such, we aim to leverage the combined power of our global network of employees to provide value to our customers and society and contribute to achieving a sustainable society. In working toward these goals, we are committed to respecting the fundamental rights of employees, providing equal opportunities, and ensuring occupational safety and health. We will strive to build favorable relationships between employees and the company, including creating work environments conducive to feelings of pride and happiness concerning working at Hitachi, and actively engaging in dialogue regarding the treatment of employees and career advancement opportunities. We will further work to strengthen our recruitment and development of digital human capital, which is vital for implementing our growth strategy, and to promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) throughout our global operations.\n\n**Human Capital**\n\n**Why**\n\n- Putting the right person in the right place\n- Ensuring fair evaluation and compensation\n- Improving employee engagement\n- Fostering a global Hitachi culture\n\n**How**\n\n- We have set the vision of becoming the employer of choice in global markets to attract human capital eager to make social contributions and create an organization where everyone can play an active role.

Contributing to society through our Social Innovation Business will require building inclusive organizations in which diverse human resources are able to play active roles. We must also encourage a mindset where employees perceive social issues as matters of personal concern and strive to resolve them. We are working to promote a variety of HR-related measures aimed at attracting diverse human resources who aspire to contribute to society, and to creating an organization where everyone participates enthusiastically. By putting these initiatives into practice, we further aim to become an \u201cEmployer of Choice\u201d in the global markets.\n\nGlobal Human Capital Management Strategy\n\nTo advance the Social Innovation Business, Hitachi must explore customer and social issues and engage in co-creation with customers to devise unique new solutions. Human capital is the key to achieving this. In order to create new value worldwide through the Social Innovation Business, over the past 10 years we have focused on securing and developing a diverse range of human resources\u2014the driver of sustainable growth\u2014and on relevant organization-building. Over the next 10 years, we will marshal the strengths of our more than 300,000 employees, including new members we have welcomed onboard through mergers and acquisitions, and work to further enhance our human capital. Through this, we will continuously provide value to our customers and society and accelerate our global growth. The 2024 HR Strategy, formulated based on Hitachi\u2019s Mid-term Management Plan 2024, sets forth our vision of becoming an \u201cEmployer of Choice\u201d in the global marketplace, a vibrant organization where individuals aspiring to make social contributions gather and participate enthusiastically. To this end, we are advancing a variety of measures around the three key pillars of People, Mindset, and Organization, along with their underlying Foundation.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion are at the core of our efforts to promote HR strategy. We aim to build an organization in which diverse employees respect each other\u2019s differences and are able to innovate.\n**Social**\n\n**Human Capital**\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\n- Global Human Capital Management\n- Talent Development\n- Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n- Work-Life Management\n- Occupational Health and Safety\n- Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining\n\n**Human Rights**\n\n**Value Chain Management**\n\n**Community**\n\n**Social Data**\n\n---\n\n**2024 HR Strategy**\n\n**Mission**\n\nContribute to business through diverse talents, equitable opportunity, and inclusive organization\n\n**Vision**\n\nWe lead transformation into \"Employer of choice\" in global market to become a vibrant \"Talent Destination\" that contributes to society\n\n---\n\n**Pillars**\n\n**People (Talent)**\n\n- Maximize talent (human capital and individual capabilities) engagement for growth\n\n**Mindset (Culture)**\n\n- Fostering a mindset and culture for growth\n\n**Organization**\n\n- Promoting collaborations between divisions for growth and the realization of global productivity and efficiency\n\n**Foundation**\n\n- Ensure physical and mental wellbeing and safety\n- Sharpen exhaustive risk management (compliance, prevent incidents and accidents, respond to disasters, etc.)\n\n---\n\n**Key Initiatives**\n\n1.

Utilize digital technologies to transform HR with the provision of higher quality HR services and solutions\n\n---\n\n**Initiatives to Put the Right Person in the Right Place**\n\nHitachi has been building a global human capital management platform to attract, deploy, and develop the best most talented team members on a global basis.\n\n**Integrated Platform for Human Capital Management**\n\nThrough this platform, up-to-date and specific human resource information, such as professional skills and career preferences, is shared via a cloud system. The platform enables centralized management of various processes including searching for talent and accessing human capital from across the Group, utilizing that information for team management, performance management, development planning, and career development. The platform is gradually being expanded throughout the Group globally.\n\n**Hitachi Global Grade (HGG)**\n\nIn order for diverse human capital to advance our business, job and task-oriented HR management is needed. Hitachi Global Grade (HGG) is one way to realize this. This system has been adopted for all positions in all our organizations. The system consists of 11 grades, and each position is evaluated based on the global common standards of the entire Hitachi Group.\n\n**Transformation to Job-Based HR Management**\n\nHitachi is accelerating the shift to job-based HR management. This involves clarifying the duties and necessary skills and experience and assigning human resources based on their desires and abilities to perform the required duties.\n\nThrough job-based HR management in Hitachi, we can assign the right people to the right jobs according to their personal abilities and motivations, regardless of their attributes such as nationality, gender, or age. The aim of our job-based HR management is to produce organizations and human resources that generate innovations by maximizing individual and organizational performance and by improving engagement. To achieve this, Hitachi, Ltd. has been devising ways to make its jobs and human resources more visible.\n\nSpecifically, in fiscal 2020, we adopted a talent review system to investigate placement and training based on each individual\u2019s aptitude and career goals. In fiscal 2021, we introduced formal job descriptions. Through repeated discussions with the labor union, we have also focused on employee communication to encourage understanding of the need for job-based HR management and to update their thinking and behavior. The majority of Hitachi, Ltd. employees now understand the need for job-based HR management and proactive career building. In the future, we will do more to encourage each employee to change his or her behavior, and we will review our systems, transforming our entire HR management system to a job-based approach.\n\nAs part of these efforts, Group companies in Japan are carrying out similar measures. By transforming to job-based HR management, Hitachi aims to enhance employee self-motivation, create a stronger sense of unity between the company and its employees, and promote both personal and organizational growth.\n\n**Promoting People Analytics**\n\nHitachi\u2019s People Analytics initiative involves gathering and analyzing data about regular employee awareness and behavior and putting it to use in human resources and management policy.\n\nQuantifying the effect of human resources initiatives has always been difficult. Evaluations have tended to be based...\non the experience of the evaluator. With the introduction of People Analytics, however, it is now possible to implement more effective and precise human resources initiatives based on objective indicators and analysis. This includes those that encourage a change in behavior by providing insights while following the development of each and every individual employee.\n\nUtilizing Survey Analysis Results for Human Capital Management\n\nWe conducted a survey based on a unique psychological analysis developed under the academic guidance of the University of Tsukuba. The results are analyzed using IT, including AI and data analysis. The awareness of individuals as well as data on job assignments and behavior arising from the survey\u2019s results are used to assign and develop employees and to maintain and improve organizational health and productivity. This strengthens our human capital by energizing talent and organizations.\n\nEnsuring Fair Evaluation and Compensation\n\nHitachi believes that a fair global system of employee evaluation and compensation is essential for attracting diverse and highly engaged human capital regardless of nationality. Accordingly, we have established a Global Compensation Philosophy: A management framework shared by all Group companies based on the principles of \u201censuring market competitiveness,\u201d \u201cpaying based on performance,\u201d and \u201cmaintaining transparency.\u201d\n\nWe have developed a performance-based compensation system for regular employees that is fair and competitive in the context of the labor market for each national or regional industry. Each employee\u2019s compensation is based on an annual performance review. Feedback on this review helps further development.\n\nWe ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and region in which we operate when determining compensation. For instance, in Japan, to ensure compliance with minimum wages, etc., we conduct comprehensive and periodic checks through our system to confirm that there are no violations.\n\nGlobal Performance Management (GPM)\n\nGlobal Performance Management (GPM) forms the foundation for business management and performance enhancement with the aim of promoting the sustainable growth of organizations and individuals. There are five items including the perspective of corporate ethics and compliance that are particularly important for Hitachi to become a global leader in the Social Innovation Business. They have been set as common competencies (behaviors) for the Hitachi Group and are applied to all employees. Supervisors provide coaching and feedback to their staff to help them achieve their targets. They encourage continuous performance improvements which lead to the medium- and long-term development of employees. By clarifying the skills and behaviors that individuals need to demonstrate, while explaining how their actions contribute to the success of the business, we cultivate employee fulfillment at work and encourage employees to take ownership over their work and self-development.\n\nImproving Employee Engagement\n\nEmployee wellbeing is critical to Hitachi\u2019s sustainable growth. Accordingly, as part of our human capital management, we have set improvement in employee engagement*1 as a KPI. We monitor employee engagement annually through Hitachi Insights, a global employee survey, and work to plan and promote human capital management measures aimed at making relevant improvements.\n\nSpecifically, senior management and managers share the survey results for their own organizations with workplace\nmembers to identify organizational issues. Actions are then planned and implemented as countermeasures through the PDCA cycle, leading to improvements.\n\nAlso, with regard to the content of the fiscal 2022 survey, questions related to wellbeing, such as those concerning psychological safety and feeling connected to others, and questions related to environmental and sustainability awareness and behavior have been expanded based on the 2024 HR Strategy. In addition, the number of languages available has been expanded from 14 to 20, and improvements have been made to its usability. We will continue to enhance our use of the employee survey to provide more appropriate management of employees worldwide.\n\n*1 Employee engagement: Hitachi uses the term \u201cengagement\u201d to refer to employees\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s strategies and policies as well as their job satisfaction and desire to take actions on their own initiative to bring about results.\n\n**Global Result and Target of the Global Employee Survey**\n\n| Number who took survey (response rate) | Approx. 210,000 people (86%) |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| FY2021 result                          | 65%                         |\n| 2024 target                            | 68%                         |\n| Percentage of positive responses to employee engagement questions*1 | 65% +3% YoY +12% from FY 2013 (1st survey) |\n\n*1 Employee engagement in fiscal 2021 is measured in terms of four factors: pride in working for Hitachi; whether it is a great place to work that one would recommend to others; feeling of personal accomplishment in work; and intention to continue to stay at Hitachi for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Fostering a Global Hitachi Culture**\n\nHitachi has welcomed approximately 100,000 new employees through several large-scale M&As in recent years. We share Hitachi\u2019s Mission and Values (Founding Spirit) with these new colleagues, and are working to foster a global Hitachi culture that achieves growth and innovation by combining the strengths and advantages of employees worldwide.\n\n**Activities**\n\n- **Town Hall Meetings**\n  Senior management continues to hold town hall meetings with employees to deepen mutual understanding through direct dialogue. In fiscal 2021, 26 town hall meetings with the President & CEO and Vice Presidents were held, counting meetings in and outside Japan.\n\n- **Establishment of Hitachi Origin Park**\n  In November 2021, Hitachi opened a corporate museum, Hitachi Origin Park, in Hitachi City, Ibaraki Prefecture, where the company was founded. Hitachi Origin Park introduces the corporate philosophy and founding spirit that Hitachi has passed down since its founding in 1910, along with examples of how the company has solved social issues. It is a place where Hitachi Group employees can learn about Hitachi\u2019s origins and deepen their understanding of our corporate philosophy and founding spirit. It is also a place to create new dialogues with local communities and our business partners around the world.\n\n**Communication to Fuse Corporate Cultures with New Colleagues in the Hitachi Group**\n\nIn July 2021, a town hall meeting was held at GlobalLogic, a new member of the Hitachi Group, with approximately 6,000 participants. Participants were extremely positive as the Executive Chairman, President & CEO, and other executives shared their thoughts on creating future synergies and answered questions from employees.\n\n\"Make a Difference!\" New Business Proposal and Job Improvement Idea Contest\n\nSince fiscal 2015, Hitachi has been running the \"Make a Difference!\" employee idea contest to create a stronger culture based on an \u201cI will\u201d mindset. The number of entrants has expanded across the Group globally, and members of Hitachi Energy and GlobalLogic, who are new to the Group, are participating actively.\n\n**Hitachi Origin Park**\n\nhttps://origin.hitachi.co.jp/en/\nTalent Development\n\nApproach to Talent Development\n\nHitachi has traditionally placed great emphasis on developing human resources, including the establishment of the Apprenticeship Training School, a predecessor of today\u2019s Hitachi Industrial Skills Academy, in 1910, the year of Hitachi\u2019s own founding. The pedagogical principles established in 1959 as our Educational Guidelines emphasized the spirit of yuuki (guidance through assistance) and jikyo (endeavor through one\u2019s own efforts).\n\nThat spirit has been maintained to the present day. In addition to on-site training through work tasks, we are also expanding training programs globally across the Group to improve individual capabilities, skills, and specialties. We will continue to support the growth of each and every individual employee with the goal of developing employees who can contribute to resolving social issues.\n\nFostering Autonomy of the Individual\n\nHitachi recognizes the diversity and independence of individual employees. We work to create an organizational culture that makes the most of individuality, thereby fostering autonomy and support individuals who demonstrate career ownership.\n\nSince fiscal 2015, we have implemented the \u201cMake a Difference!\u201d employee idea contest on the theme of \u201cI will\u201d mindset transformation. Employee support is being expanded for personal development, including subsidies under the Cafeteria Plan and recommendations relating to materials for self-development. We are also continuing to provide regular education so that each employee can acquire the skills they need.\n\nFiscal 2021 Make a Difference! Winning Idea\n\nIn fiscal 2021, out of 457 applications received from around the world, five teams made it to the final round of judging and gave presentations to a panel of executive judges. Two teams received the Gold Ticket, awarded to the best and most feasible ideas, and three teams received the Outstanding Spirit Award, recognizing their endeavors taken with an \u201cI will\u201d mindset. One new business idea that won the Gold Ticket was praised for its focus on people, especially women and diversity, and its initiative to provide useful information combining career development, health information, and life events.\n\nThe other Gold Ticket award was for a job improvement idea submitted by a team from GlobalLogic, which participated in the contest for the first time this year. The team\u2019s unique idea to focus on the engagement of Hitachi employees and use an app to reach out to employees not only in terms of their individual careers, but also with respect to social aspects (hobbies, volunteer work, self-development activities, etc.) to lead them to success was evaluated highly. Since both ideas are aimed at employee retention, which is a top priority for the company, the two teams will collaborate to implement and realize these projects.\nManagement-Level Leadership Development\n\nHitachi takes a medium- to long-term approach to developing management-level leadership that will drive transformation with top management and the Nominating Committee playing a central role.\n\nWhen developing candidates for appointment in the next and subsequent term to executive positions including CEO, CXO, and division heads several hundred candidates are selected from the Hitachi Group\u2019s human capital around the world and given both on-the-job training (OJT), including tough assignments, *1 and off-the-job training (Off-JT) such as external training and coaching.\n\nWe also select around 50 outstanding emerging employees as candidates for management-level leadership as members of the \u201cFuture 50\u201d program. By giving this Future 50 members tough assignments opportunities for direct discussions with independent directors and so on, we perform their development with focused educational activities.\n\n*1 Assigning highly demanding tasks.\n\nLeadership and Management Training (Global)\n\n| Training | Overview | FY 2021 results |\n|----------|----------|-----------------|\n| Global Leadership Acceleration Program for Key Positions (GAP-K) | Selective training held for five months to accelerate the development of future management-level leaders | 33 participants from 12 countries |\n| Global Advanced Program for Leadership Development (GAP-L) | Training held twice a year for local leaders expected to perform well in subsidiaries outside Japan with the aim of developing the superior leadership, mindset, and skills necessary to drive Hitachi\u2019s global growth business | 43 participants from 13 countries |\n| Global Group Executive Development Course (Global GEC) | E-learning course to give leaders of Hitachi subsidiaries outside Japan a basic understanding of Hitachi\u2019s management and provide the latest information to lead Social Innovation Business | 49 participants from five regions |\n| Global Leadership Acceleration Program for Managers (GAP-M, Ready to Lead) | Leadership training with global common content for senior managers and new managers | 2,921 participants, classes in eight regions |\nBolstering Recruitment and Development of Digital Talent\n\nTo accelerate our Social Innovation Business using digital technologies and realize Hitachi\u2019s growth strategy, we are working to secure and develop human capital (digital talent) that can lead a digital transformation (DX).\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we increased our digital talent to approximately 67,000 people. This was achieved with the addition of GlobalLogic, a leading digital engineering services company, to the Hitachi Group, as well as the hiring of outside talent that can contribute immediately and the development of internal talent through DX training and other programs. We also increased our data scientists with specialist knowledge of data analysis including AI, IoT, and the utilization of big data to approximately 10,000, up from around 2,000 at the end of April 2020.\n\nWe have set a target of increasing our digital talent to approximately 98,000 people, mainly outside Japan, by fiscal 2024. We will accelerate our efforts to bolster our digital talent needed for business growth by acquiring talent globally through GlobalLogic and other means, and by developing internal talent through expansion of training programs and other measures.\n\nAiming to further develop and strengthen our digital talent, we consolidated our various training institutes into the Hitachi Academy in April 2019. We also have constructed a DX training system that organizes, categorizes, and systematizes the processes and tasks needed for digital transformation.\n\nEvery year, we brush up our DX training system consisting of more than 100 courses, which were taken by a cumulative total of approximately 24,000 employees in fiscal 2021. In addition, we are enhancing the development of individuals who can apply DX to their own work by developing training courses for each skill required of digital talent. Furthermore, in fiscal 2020, we began an e-learning basic training program to improve DX literacy among all Group employees in Japan. In fiscal 2021, we widely expanded the program to Group companies outside Japan to foster a common understanding of digital business promotion throughout the Group worldwide.\n\nAt the same time, we are training the people in the leadership class who are in charge of DX projects by providing them with on-the-job training in actual projects and other practical experience.\n\nWe will continue to strengthen our digital talent development with broader fundamental training aimed at acquiring basic knowledge and skills by participating in training, and specialized education to develop the leader class and specialists.\nUtilizing a Common Global Learning Platform\n\nAt Hitachi, all employees can use Hitachi University, a common global learning platform, to check their past learning progress and take necessary training in a timely manner to achieve their business goals and develop their future careers in consultation with their managers. This promotes autonomous, workplace-based talent development. In addition, the HR department utilizes training transcripts to implement effective talent development measures.\n\nCareer Development Support\n\nHitachi, Ltd. has developed a broad range of career development support that focuses on \u201cinternal careers,\u201d namely, employees\u2019 individual values and rewarding activities, as well as their views on the meaning of their work. In a career development program to provide direct support for individual career development, we hold the Hitachi Career Development Workshop (H-CDW). Through self-analysis work, participants consider the direction they should proceed in, their career goals, and their career path, and then engage in self-directed efforts to develop their career and abilities. Around 15,300 people have participated in the program so far (as of March 31, 2022) with a focus on assistant manager-rank personnel working as technicians, researchers, and administrative office workers in their thirties.\n\nIn addition to those programs, Hitachi also offers programs targeting specific age groups such as career education for young groups and training for middle-aged or older groups to help them prepare for the changes ahead in their careers.\n\nWe also operate a Career Consultation Room so that employees can speak with professional counselors about any challenges they have regarding their work, their career, or interpersonal relationships in order to help them find a solution.\n\nWe will continue to promote self-understanding while respecting each employee\u2019s individuality and personal aspirations. By doing so, we will develop individuals with autonomy to think and act for themselves, promote mutual understanding as a way of fostering a sense of unity and teamwork while capitalizing on individuals\u2019 engagement and motivation within the organization. We provide support and create mechanisms to link individual abilities and creativity to the enhancement of organizational strength and performance.\nInitiatives at Regional Headquarters to Develop Employee Skills\n\nHitachi is a company with global operations, so its skills development programs are implemented primarily by its regional headquarters in keeping with the focus of each region\u2019s business operations and cultural environment.\n\nThrough these efforts, we seek to identify and nurture the human capital who will become Hitachi\u2019s leaders globally across the Group.\n\n**Hitachi America, Ltd.**\n\nFor employees in the Americas aspiring to become global leaders, in addition to a global management training program, the company provides a variety of learning and individual training options utilizing the Hitachi University.

Treating people \u201cfairly\u201d is not the same as treating them the same. We recognise that each of us is different, and each of us needs different conditions to thrive. We put in place policies, tools and adaptations to allow everyone to access the same opportunities.\n\n**Inclusion:**\nInclusion is a state in which the uniqueness of each person is recognized and enabled to contribute to the organization at their best.\n\nIn Hitachi, Inclusion means that everyone feels respected, heard, and involved.\n\nFor colleagues to feel included means being accepted and valued, able to speak up and to contribute. It implies an open, empathetic culture and attitude. Including the different voices and varied perspectives that diversity brings enables us to reach better decisions and unlock innovative ideas.\n\nIn line with this commitment, all of our initiatives to enhance Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) share these basic goals:\n\n- Make Hitachi a truly global company, with talent from all over the world\n- Enable Hitachi to better serve global customers, improve our footprint and open new markets\n- Drive innovation and creativity\n- Support attraction and retention of talent\n- Allow employees to feel more engaged and connected, to be a part of Group strategy and actively contribute to it\n\n**Policy**\n\nHitachi Group Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/sustainability/download/pdf/Global_DEI_policy_EN.pdf\nGlobal DEI Strategy\n\nUnder the leadership of the Chief Sustainability Officer and Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer (CDIO), Lorena Dellagiovanna, in fiscal 2020 we conducted a gap data analysis, looking at external assessments and working with the Business Units (BUs), corporate functions, and Group companies to review their current status and business strategies. Based on this analysis, we formulated our global DEI strategy for the medium to long term.\n\nDiversity refers to all the different characteristics that distinguish people one from another. Some of these differences are immediately visible, but many more are intrapersonal\u2014for instance thinking styles, personality type, and background experiences\u2014at least until people really get to know each other.\n\nHitachi commits to tackle all dimensions of diversity, however we identified three themes that are common in every region and business.\n\nOur global DEI themes:\n1. Gender-balance: More women across the business, especially within leadership roles\n2. Cultural diversity: A team which reflects the global nature of our company\n3. Multi-generation: Colleagues are recognized based on competence, not on age\n\nIn line with the above three global DEI themes, we set targets for BUs, corporate functions, and Group companies. The procedure to define the targets included individual meetings, where discussions focused on how DEI efforts can help to address issues in the business, since Hitachi operates in a variety of industries and markets.\n\nThese targets are promoted through the \u201cfive pillars of implementation\u201d:\n\n| Pillars       | Description                                                                 |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Leadership    | \u2022 President & CEO and other senior stakeholders show their clear commitment to the DEI vision  \n\u2022 Leaders are accountable for DEI progress |\n| Culture       | \u2022 Improving workplace culture and cultural focus on inclusion are a business mandate  \n\u2022 We attract and hire diverse people  \n\u2022 We conduct diagnostic analysis and review our recruiting channels and practice, monitoring the recruiting funnel |\n| Recruitment   | \u2022 We attract and hire diverse people  \n\u2022 We conduct diagnostic analysis and review our recruiting channels and practice, monitoring the recruiting funnel |\n| Retention     | \u2022 We provide different benefits and support robust Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), driving cultural relevant programming |\n| Advancement   | \u2022 We produce diverse leaders  \n\u2022 We promote diverse individuals based on competency |\n\nTo achieve our aspirations, Hitachi has created a structure to lead its global and local initiatives.\n\nAt a global level, DEI themes are discussed both at the executive level and the implementation level, in order to promote the Group\u2019s policies and initiatives.\n\nThe Global DEI Council is aligned with the global DEI strategy and conducts discussions on specific actions in partnership with the HR departments of Group companies around the world. Material matters are reported and deliberated on in the Senior Executive Committee, and are reported to the Board of Directors when necessary.\n\nRegional DEI lead positions have been created to drive initiatives aligned to local needs and business strategies.\n\nThe Global DEI team supports the implementation of global and regional initiatives, promoting the DEI strategy to foster an inclusive culture. The team implements a thorough set of DEI performance indicators.\n\nTo promote communication among all functions, BUs and Group companies, the Global DEI team facilitates working group sessions. These sessions involve all key internal stakeholders, and participants discuss specific DEI topics, seeking to share best practices, identify common issues, and find practical solutions.\nDEI Global Target\n\nWe have set the strengthening of diversity in management as a global DEI target, with a KPI of the ratio of executive and corporate positions held by women and non-Japanese persons.\n\nAs of June 2022, 12.2% of executives and corporate officers were women, compared to 10.1% as of June 2021. Furthermore, 17.6% of executives and corporate officers were non-Japanese persons, compared to 11.6% as of that same date. By 2030, our target is for 30% of our executives and corporate officers to be women and 30% to be non-Japanese persons.\n\nGlobal DEI Theme 1: Gender-balance\n\nImproving our gender balance means empowering women across the business. Starting with giving broader access to all roles through recruitment, we are offering opportunities for their progression into leadership positions and providing support to ensure a workplace where women can thrive.\n\nOur goal is that all women at Hitachi feel that they have a place, have a clear and distinctive voice, and enjoy the freedom to contribute to our innovation. Furthermore, in regards to employee compensation, it is set according to each individual's role and achievements, with no divisions or differences based on gender or age.\n\nInitiatives to Support Our Global DEI Themes\n\nTo advance DEI across our three global themes, the Hitachi businesses have a range of ongoing initiatives. These initiatives champion the global themes and enable Hitachi to meet its global DEI Policy.\n\nGlobal DEI Theme 1: Gender-balance\n\nImproving our gender balance means empowering women across the business.

The program will be expanding globally from 2022.\n\nGlobal DEI Theme 2: Cultural Diversity\nBeing culturally diverse is about creating a team which reflects the global nature of our company. Hitachi has grown into a global innovation business from its Japanese roots, and our aspiration is to see the global and diverse nature of our business portfolio reflected in our people, particularly at the decision-making levels, and supported by an inclusive culture.\n\nBy providing the opportunity for more individuals from different nationalities to progress into leadership, we create opportunities for Hitachi to access new markets and sustain our global growth.\n\nInitiatives of Hitachi Astemo\nHitachi Astemo organized its very first Diversity Month in May 2021.

Addressing managers in its first phase, the material will be translated in 2022 and be offered to all indirect employees in a second step. Among other topics, this online course tackles the importance of diversity in the business, and equips managers to better support DEI. A toolbox was distributed to managers in March 2022 to raise awareness about unconscious biases that may be at work during employee performance reviews.\n\nInitiatives of GlobalLogic\nGlobalLogic is now designing its own unconscious bias training, based on storytelling (\u201cLet me explain what it means to be the only woman in the room\u201d). These are customized by region in terms of the content and format.\n\nInitiatives of Hitachi High-Tech\nHitachi Hi-Tech hosts the \u201cHitachi High-Tech WAY\u201d a series of inclusive gatherings consisting of 25 town hall meetings per year with a total of 4,000 people. These meetings provide an opportunity for all employees to speak up about any work or nonwork matters in an environment with guaranteed psychological safety.\n\nThe business recognizes the links between DEI and innovation and works to address \u201cWorkstyle Improvement,\u201d \u201cDiversity & Inclusion Acceleration,\u201d \u201cPeople Development,\u201d \u201cWomen at Hitachi,\u201d and \u201cEmployee Mentorship\u201d at a global level.\nWork-Life Management\n\nApproach to Work-Life Management\n\nHitachi goes beyond \u201cwork-life balance,\u201d in which employees are simply balancing work and private life, to promote \u201cwork-life management\u201d which encourages employees to proactively take charge of improving the quality of both their work and private lives. We believe that practicing work-life management will enrich employees\u2019 work and private lives, enhance professionalism, and build personal character, resulting in both individual and organizational growth sustainably. Based on this philosophy, we have established systems to support work-style reforms and a balance between employees\u2019 work and private lives.\n\nPromoting Work-style Reform\n\nHitachi, Ltd. promotes the companywide work-style reform initiative, Hitachi Work-style Innovation, to develop workstyles allowing talent from diverse backgrounds to work with enthusiasm and demonstrate strong performance.\n\nToday, approximately 95% of all regular employees may take advantage of our programs to work from home or satellite offices, including managerial-level employees, discretionary labor system workers, and regular employees who need to balance work with child care, nursing care, or medical treatment. This provides regular employees with flexibility concerning where and when they work. The programs do not require the applicants to come into the office for a certain amount of time nor are there any limitations on the number of times for doing so, which allows regular employees to work from wherever they need to be for child care or nursing care. If posted away from their families, they can work from their family home. We are also rolling out location-free work for managerial-level employees, which allows them to perform their duties from anywhere when approved by the company.\n\nCoverage of working from home and satellite office programs\n\nApprox. 95%\nIntroducing and Expanding Support Systems for Balancing Work and Child Care/Nursing Care\n\nSupport Systems for Balancing Work and Child Care\nHitachi, Ltd. and certain Group companies in Japan are working to introduce and expand various programs to help employees balance work and child care, and to create even more supportive workplaces. Specifically, we have provided an allowance to support child care and work; launched Hokatsu Concierge child-care matching service, an information-providing service for finding nurseries; and provided a child-care matching service in collaboration with company-led nurseries. To create an environment in which both men and women can balance work and child care, from fiscal 2022 we offer \u201ce-learning for managers\u201d to help managers understand management and other issues related to the revised Child Care and Family Care Leave Act. We also offer \u201cexpectant-father and expectant-mother seminars\u201d to promote understanding of child care and child-care leave systems among employees who themselves or their spouses are expecting a baby.\n\nTo help employees balance work and child care, Hitachi, Ltd. has established an in-house child-care facility with a capacity of approximately 70 children at its Yokohama Office in cooperation with the labor union and 17 Group companies.\n\nSupport System for Balancing Work and Nursing Care\nAs Japan\u2019s population ages, the number of employees facing the challenge of providing nursing care for elderly family members is growing. Consequently, Hitachi, Ltd. regularly conducts employee awareness and internal fact-finding surveys concerning nursing care. Based on the results of these surveys, the company is working to continually enhance measures to help employees balance their work and home nursing care responsibilities.\n\nSpecifically, Hitachi, Ltd. has been offering financial support for these employees by establishing programs such as work-caregiving balance support points under the Cafeteria Plan. Through seminars for all employees 40 years of age and older on how to balance work and nursing care responsibilities, the company provides useful information that raises their awareness of the work-life balance. This includes learning about the significance of continuing to work while fulfilling nursing care responsibilities along with expert information on how to achieve this balance.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. and certain Group companies have introduced a service that warmly supports employees dealing with nursing care concerns. In addition to helping employees apply for public programs and find care-giving facilities, it established services that arrange counseling to help employees cope with the emotional challenges. The understanding and cooperation of others, including superiors and workplace colleagues, is essential for balancing work and nursing care. Accordingly, we are making efforts to reform our organizational culture, including by holding management e-learning for all managers and seminars by experts in fiscal 2021.\n\nNew Measures in Fiscal 2021\n\n| Measures | Main Details and Purpose |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n| Expectant-father and expectant-mother seminars (pilot conducted in March 2022, and started full-scale in FY 2022) | Conducted for regular employees who are expecting a baby or whose spouse is expecting a baby, to promote understanding of child care and child-care leave systems and to encourage regular employees to use the necessary leave and work systems |\n| E-learning for managers on balancing work and child care (April 2022) | Conducted to help managers understand basic knowledge for management and promotion of male employees to take child-care leave in accordance with the revised Child Care and Family Care Leave Act |\n| E-learning for managers on balancing work and nursing care (September 2021) | Conducted to help managers understand the knowledge necessary to manage subordinates with nursing care situations and to be able to respond appropriately |\n| Seminar by an expert on the state of nursing care in Japan (February 2022) | Provided various perspectives on the nursing care situation in Japan, with the aim of fostering awareness and an organizational culture that considers nursing care issues from viewpoints of both the company and individuals |\nSupport Systems and Measures that Meet Diverse Employee Needs\n\n**System**\n\nHitachi, Ltd. and the Hitachi Group companies in Japan are working to meet the needs of employees as their lifestyles become more diverse. Through domestic Group-wide lifestyle support programs and measures, we have implemented systems that provide the necessary level of support based on the business environment of each company and the needs of employees. These measures include the following:\n\n- A Cafeteria Plan program, housing support such as dormitory and family housing and a housing allowance system, systems for balancing work with child and nursing care, retirement and pension plans, a consolation payment system, an employee stock ownership program, Hitachi Group insurance, a property accumulation promotion system, internal sales, and a Health Insurance Society.\n\nIn the past, these lifestyle support programs and measures were only available in principle to regular employees. Based on Japanese laws with bearing on equal pay for equal work that came into effect in 2020, some systems have been updated so that they also cover limited-term contract employees. In addition, for those measures that are unsuitable for limited-term contract employees due to the purpose and nature of the program concerned, we provide support to employees regardless of their employment type. This includes the provision of welfare allowances as an alternative measure.\n\nWith regard to retirement benefit programs, Hitachi Group companies in Japan have partially or fully implemented defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans, and lump-sum retirement allowance plans. These plans respond to the diverse needs of people in old age by providing supplementary benefits in addition to public pensions and play an important role in allowing retired people to live more affluent.\n\n**Achievements in Fiscal 2021**\n\nWith the expansion of working from home, Hitachi, Ltd. has restructured its lunch allowance, which was previously provided on the premise that employees come into an office to work, to make it fair regardless of where they choose to work. The company decided to grant an additional 60,000 yen worth of points per person per year through the Cafeteria Plan starting in January 2022, in part to subsidize the cost of working from home. Equivalent support is provided to limited-term contract employees who are not eligible for the Cafeteria Plan. Through such efforts, we will promote more flexible work styles and encourage the active participation of diverse talent.\nPrevention of Long Working Hours and Overwork\n\nHitachi complies with the laws and regulations of each country and region concerning long working hours and overwork.\n\nWith a view to maintaining employee health and improving productivity through a balanced work schedule, Hitachi, Ltd. sets company-wide KPIs for work-style reform in Japan each fiscal year, and works to strengthen workplace management and review business processes. The company provides e-learning programs to ensure compliance with laws and regulations related to working hours and the taking of annual paid leave. Projects with issues that lead to long working hours are managed individually. In addition, for working-hour management, we have introduced a system that links PC on/off times to an attendance management system to check actual operating hours. We also provide a labor management dashboard*\u00b9 and send out alerts to help supervisors monitor the working conditions of their subordinates in a timely manner, thereby supporting appropriate management in the workplace.\n\nWe communicate with employees by sending out messages that promote positive working habits and inform them of their actual total monthly hours worked. Through this communication, we encourage individuals to reflect on their workstyle and autonomously increase productivity. In this way, we are trying to change work culture to that of working efficiently (producing results in less time) and taking breaks after working (maintain high performance by recharging and preparing for the next workday).\n\nApproach\nActivities\n\nWorking in the New Normal in the Pandemic\n\nIn the new normal following the spread of COVID-19, we are accelerating the shift to working from home as the standard way of working in a wide range of positions, further evolving the diversification of employee workstyles with working from home as a driver of change.\n\nHitachi strives to prevent the spread of the virus, placing the safety and health of all employees first and foremost. As well as promoting working from home for, in principle, all positions except those requiring a physical presence for society to function, we are undertaking initiatives to protect employees from infections and support working from home. With the evolving diversity of our employees\u2019 work styles, we are further promoting the creation of a rewarding workplace where each employee can play an active role.\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s impact is global, and our countermeasures in each region are informed by the conditions at regional headquarters. Hitachi Europe asked employees working from home what they needed, and developed an action plan to provide it. At Hitachi India, an e-learning course on COVID-19 was created and shared to raise awareness of the virus and how employees can prevent its spread.\n\nApproach\nActivities\n\n*\u00b9 Labor management dashboard: A business tool that integrates and visualizes information and data related to labor management\n\nHitachi Ltd.\u2019s Main Measures Supporting New Workstyles for the New Normal\n\n| Support for flexible workstyles | Flexible working hours | Promote and realize autonomous and flexible workstyles by eliminating the minimum daily work hours for discretionary work and flextime work by choosing their own start and finish times, and allowing employees to set \u201cnon-working days\u201d |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Flexible work locations        |                        | Give employees greater flexibility to choose time- and location-free work by allowing work at locations such as travel destinations or parents\u2019 homes, to realize autonomous workstyles and further improve productivity |\n| Main policies for supporting working from home medium- to long-term | Appropriate health support for long-term workers from home | Remote counseling by occupational physicians and other medical staff, provision via intranet of information for staying mentally and physically healthy, etc. |\n| Provision of communication activation tools | | Using Hitachi\u2019s unique indicator \u201cHappiness Level,\u201d which measures people\u2019s feelings of contentment, to stimulate communication |\nInitiatives at Regional Headquarters to Create a Good Working Environment\n\nHitachi supports workstyles that are conducive to each employee achieving their full potential. Region-specific policies are also implemented by our regional headquarters.\n\n**Hitachi America, Ltd.**\n\nVarious systems and measures are in place to improve employee wellbeing. There is a monthly No Meeting Day for individuals to focus on their work. There is a hybrid and flexible work hour system, and a system for individuals to switch to permanent working from home at their discretion, creating a more comfortable work environment for employees.\n\n**Hitachi (China) Ltd.**\n\nIn order to improve productivity and support diverse workstyles, work-style reform is promoted, and working from home has been introduced in addition to flexible work hours. Emphasizing work-life balance, average overtime hours are well below the legally mandated maximum, and employees are encouraged to take annual leave. Town hall meetings are held with executives, and interdepartmental business exchange meetings are held to continuously enhance vertical and horizontal communication within the workplace. The network built through these activities contributes to a sense of unity in the company, a comfortable work environment, and smoother business operations.\n\n**Hitachi Asia Ltd.**\n\nEfforts to make Hitachi Asia the best place to work in Asia include providing equal opportunities for all employees and creating workplaces that foster and retain outstanding human capital. The company provides opportunities for recreation in order to further enhance communication among employees and boost engagement. It has also introduced staggered work hours and provides more flexible ways of working to create new workstyles and enhance employees\u2019 work-life balance.\n\n**Hitachi Europe Ltd.**\n\nHybrid working arrangements have been instituted to protect the health and safety of employees and to support diverse workstyles. In addition, staggered work hours and other systems are used to encourage a better work-life balance and help employees balance their work and private lives.\n\n**Hitachi India Pvt. Ltd.**\n\nFor every employee to work in a style they are most comfortable with, Hitachi India introduced a hybrid style of working. Employees can come to the office whenever required and utilize to the utmost working from home for a suitable work life balance.\nOccupational Health and Safety\n\nThe Basic Principle for Occupational Health and Safety\n\n\"Health and Safety Always Comes First,\" is the basic principle underlying the Hitachi Group Health and Safety Policy which is shared by all Hitachi Group companies around the world. Employees work together with all related companies, including contractors and procurement partners, to develop a safe, secure, comfortable and healthy workplace for everyone involved in our business activities.\n\nMoreover, we communicate our belief to everyone who works at the Hitachi Group that occupational injuries and illnesses can be prevented and that each of us is responsible for our own safety and health. We also strive to actively adopt practices to protect our own health and safety and foster a culture of raising mutual awareness.\n\nHitachi Group Health and Safety Policy\n\n\"Health and Safety Always Comes First\"\n\nIn accordance with our mission, \"Contribute to society through the development of superior original technology and products,\" the Hitachi Group will endeavor to ensure safe and healthy workplaces under the principle of \"Health and Safety Always Comes First.\"\n\nTo accomplish this, we will:\n1. Continuously be involved in taking health and safety activities in order to prevent occupational injuries and illnesses through designating the health and safety of employees as management's top priority\n2. Comply with the local laws and regulations in each company regarding health and safety\n3. Develop a safe and comfortable work environment by encouraging employees to maintain their own health and taking a proactive stance on health and safety activities in the workplace\n4. Require an understanding of Hitachi's principles and the promotion of health and safety awareness from all the business partners of the Hitachi Group (contractors, cooperating companies, procurement partners, etc. involved in the Hitachi Group's business activities)\n5. Contribute to the creation of a safe and pleasant society by emphasizing activities that make health and safety a top priority in all of Hitachi's business activities\n\nEstablishing Occupational Health and Safety Management System\n\nIn April 2021, the Hitachi Group established the Safety and Health Management Division to promote occupational health and safety, and oversee our global occupational health and safety management system.\n\nEvery other month, the Safety and Health Management Division holds a Health and Safety Leaders Meeting attended by the officers in charge of health and safety at each Group company, and those responsible for health and safety in each division. The meeting checks the progress of each division's efforts toward targets and sets Group-wide KPIs. Participants also work to continually improve our occupational health and safety management system by analyzing the factors behind accidents and implementing thorough measures to prevent recurrence, sharing best practices, and promoting training. The number of accidents and responses to occupational health and safety risks are reported and deliberated on in the Senior Executive Committee, and are reported to the Board of Directors.\n\nIn Japan, each business site (BU) or other location convenes a monthly health and safety commission, which is attended by the business operators, labor union, and employees. Participants analyze the factors leading to accidents and develop countermeasures, share information, and discuss health and safety activities considering the situation regarding employees who have taken sick leave. If serious injuries or fatal accidents occur at worksites outside of Japan, depending on the circumstances, the Safety and Health Management Division gets directly involved in supporting improvement activities.\n\nThe Hitachi Group has also obtained international certifications such as ISO 45001 at multiple sites.\nSocial\n\nHuman Capital\n\nExecutive Summary\nGlobal Human Capital Management\nTalent Development\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWork-Life Management\nOccupational Health and Safety\nFreedom of Association and Collective Bargaining\n\nHuman Rights\nValue Chain Management\nCommunity\nSocial Data\n\nGlobal Occupational Health and Safety Targets\n\nHitachi aims to create a safe workplace, free of accidents, and has set a global goal of zero fatal accidents. To achieve this target, we have set up and deployed an occupational health and safety management system tailored to each company\u2019s business, conduct periodic risk assessments and audits, and are working to expand training related to occupational health and safety globally.\n\nSafety Targets and Progress Achieved in 2021\n\nUnfortunately, we were not able to meet our safety targets for 2021. We deeply regret that two fatal accident occurred within the Hitachi Group (including contractors) in 2021, and there were 434 lost-time accidents Group-wide. While the occurrence rate decreased from the previous year, there is still room for improvement.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, there have been multiple cases of employees and contractors being fatally electrocuted in work conducted outside of our sites during business hours. So, we recognize the need to strengthen integrated safety management systems in order to identify risks and implement countermeasures for employees and contractors working on tasks and equipment that pose a high risk of electric shock.\n\nSafety Targets and Achievements in 2021, and Targets for 2024\n\nNote: Since safety-related targets are generally based on calendar year statistics, numerical targets are established and managed on a calendar year basis, instead of on a fiscal year basis.\n\n*1 Including contractors\nWe carried out the following action plans in fiscal 2021. Based on our awareness of these issues, we continue striving to enhance occupational health and safety.\n\n**Fiscal 2021 Action Plan**\n\n1. Effectively utilize risk assessment\n   - Build a framework for identifying and mitigating risks\n2. Build and operate an global occupational health and safety management system\n   - Clarify rules and processes\n3. Education and training\n   - Transform ways of thinking to encourage voluntary occupational health and safety behaviors\n4. Utilize IT and digital tools\n   - Measures to digitize and improve data reports\n\n---\n\n**Hitachi Group\u2019s Global Safety Figures (Occurrence Rate)**\n\n| Year | North America | Central and South America | Europe | India | China | Asia (excluding India, China, and Japan) | Oceania | Africa | Overseas total | Japan | Global total |\n|------|---------------|---------------------------|--------|-------|-------|----------------------------------------|---------|-------|----------------|-------|-------------|\n| 2017 | 24.33         | 1.62                      | 10.82  | 1.44  | 1.53  | 4.41                                   | 24.41   | 9.93  | 7.42           | 1.85  | 4.22        |\n| 2018 | 27.96         | 0.44                      | 6.08   | 1.44  | 1.46  | 3.34                                   | 21.94   | 11.76 | 7.43           | 1.64  | 4.20        |\n| 2019 | 20.76         | 0.57                      | 4.78   | 1.63  | 1.17  | 2.63                                   | 29.07   | 9.72  | 5.78           | 1.53  | 3.45        |\n| 2020 | 18.98         | 2.12                      | 3.09   | 1.07  | 1.12  | 1.55                                   | 12.95   | 25.37 | 4.90           | 1.34  | 3.45        |\n| 2021 | 18.46         | 1.69                      | 3.71   | 0.53  | 1.06  | 1.30                                   | 5.32    | 1.43  | 3.80           | 1.20  | 2.89        |\n\n**Risk Assessment for High-risk Activities and Equipment**\n\nSince 2021, we have been advancing efforts to identify and evaluate the hazards in high-risk activities and equipment, and implementing measures to reduce risk, on a global scale. We also have been working to modify high-risk activities and equipment, including strengthening the response to risks of electric shock in all our BUs globally. Thus, we have formulated measures to prevent accidents which clearly designate the accountable person in charge of safety at each BU, and we are carrying out physical measures and investment to this end.\n\n---\n\n**Occupational Health and Safety Risk Assessment**\n\nHitachi sets and operates its own standards for high-risk activities and equipment as a common global measure. We also promote occupational health and safety activities that fit each company\u2019s business. We have also built a system for globally monitoring risk identification, evaluation, and countermeasure implementation. We conduct internal audits into the status of risk assessment for locations that are determined to have significant risks through this monitoring. And we are working to improve safety measures in both hard and soft aspects using IT and digital technologies for accident prevention. Moreover, since July 2020, we have increased the frequency of global accident statistic reporting from twice a year to once a month. This acts as a mechanism for getting an accurate handle on information such as accident statistics.\nInternal Audits\nThe Audit Committee holds annual deliberations on the policies, plans, and results of our occupational health and safety activities. It also reports at least once a year to the Senior Executive Committee, meetings of Group company presidents, and other bodies, about important issues such as fatal accidents and potentially serious events. For measures and activities that require particular improvement, the results of monitoring are reported at the above relevant meetings.\n\nExternal Audits\nIn fiscal 2018, the Hitachi Group commissioned independent external audits on safety diagnostics at four of our BUs in Japan. The auditors identified issues that we needed to address in order to implement out Hitachi Group Health and Safety Policy; we are making improvements in response to each of these issues (See the table below).\n\nDuring fiscal 2019 and 2020, we focused on activities that built a foundation for understanding the current situation and solving problems. In fiscal 2021, we performed independent outside safety diagnoses when fatal accidents occurred at Group companies outside of Japan and are strengthening the health and safety systems in the relevant region, reconsidering our action plans, and working to improve safety awareness.\n\n| Issues Identified | Items to deal with | Concrete actions taken |\n|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Establishment of Group-wide safety management systems | Build and operate an occupational global health and safety management system | Ascertain capacity for global safety governance |\n| Raising safety awareness of employees by strengthening leadership at the organization\u2019s top management | Transform ways of thinking to encourage voluntary health and safety behaviors through training | Conduct survey and interviews with business entities involved in building occupational health and safety management systems |\n| Clarifying the accountability for implementing safety activities and expanding basic countermeasures in the event of an accident | Effectively utilize risk assessment | Create rules, documents, and regarding occupational health and safety management systems (in Japan) |\n| | Build a framework for identifying and mitigating risks | Publish occupational health and safety management system guidelines |\n| | Digitize and improve data reports using IT/digital technology | Formulate common standards for Hitachi Group occupational health and safety management systems (Begin implementation in Japan in 2022, and outside of Japan from 2023) |\n\nTo prevent occupational accidents, Hitachi aims to rebuild its safety culture by implementing appropriate occupational health and safety training for all executive officers and employees. Each Hitachi Group company distributes work guidelines and procedures relating to their own business and industry. We also conduct safety-focused training to each organizational level, as well as education and drills tailored to each organization and business type, for line managers and safety staff, and workers engaged in specific hazardous activities in the field. We provide individual guidance to new hires and temporary workers in particular, as they are at a higher risk of injury. This is accomplished through on-the-job training to increase awareness and understanding of work procedures and dangers before engaging in work.\n\nSince fiscal 2020, we have carried out safety-focused leadership training for managerial staff, with the goal of strengthening awareness of, and building commitment to, their roles and responsibilities concerning safety. Following training, we also evaluate their changes in awareness and behavior through one-on-one interviews with external consultants. As of fiscal 2021, we had held 13 training sessions attended by 240 people.\n\nEnsuring the Occupational Health and Safety of Contractors\nHitachi conducts gap analysis for its safety management systems, rules, and operations both within inside and outside its factories. This is based on the occurrence of accidents in which contractors were injured during construction, installation, service, and maintenance work outside of our\nSocial\n\nInnovation Management\n\nHuman Capital\n\nExecutive Summary\nGlobal Human Capital Management\nTalent Development\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWork-Life Management\nOccupational Health and Safety\nFreedom of Association and Collective Bargaining\n\nHuman Rights\nValue Chain Management\nCommunity\nSocial Data\n\nInitiatives to Improve Employee Health\n\nHitachi believes that the wellbeing of its employees are essential for its sustainable growth. So, we are working to create a workplace in which all Group employees can work safely and be healthy in both mental and physical health.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we added questions relating to wellbeing to our annual Global Employee Survey, and we expanded these questions from fiscal 2021 onward. Going forward, we will evaluate the effectiveness of measures related to employee wellbeing.\n\nIn Japan, we will steadily implement health management measures, strengthen mental health support in accordance with new workstyles, and work to thoroughly prevent lifestyle-related diseases. Over the medium and long term, we will implement measures based on a Group-wide Health and Hygiene Policy after ascertaining the actual conditions of occupational health measures globally and identifying issues.\n\nFiscal 2021 Targets and Results for Health Management and Fiscal 2022 Targets\n\n| Scope | FY 2021 Targets | FY 2021 Achievements | FY 2022 Targets |\n|-------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| Rate of mental illness | Hitachi Group (Japan) | 10% decrease from fiscal 2020 (less than 10.4%) | 12.8% | Less than 10% |\n| Percentage of employees who have received special health guidance | 40% of employees | 40.3% (estimate) | 50% or more of employees |\n\nHealth Support Initiatives in Japan\n\n- Occupational healthcare provided by occupational physicians, nurses, and other occupational healthcare personnel located both on-site and at regional health-management centers serving multiple business locations\n- Health maintenance measures provided based on periodic medical exams and other examinations to prevent serious disease\n- Medical interviews and advice to prevent mental and physical disorders among employees working long hours\n- Consultations and guidance by occupational healthcare workers to address employees\u2019 health concerns and encourage regular exercise\n- Qualitative improvement of occupational healthcare activities and the human capital development of occupational healthcare workers through regular meetings, study groups, and training sessions attended by both occupational healthcare workers and human resources staff\n- Prevent mental health problems by promoting consultations and interviews with internal and external consultation services (in addition to the interviews with doctors required by law), as a proactive approach to employees who have been identified through the stress check system as having high stress\n- Provide opportunities to help employees quickly resolve a wide range of concerns by creating an environment in which employees can consult internal and external EAP*\u00b9 consultation service\n\n*\u00b9 Employee Assistance Program\n\nAbsences Rate Trend\n\n| Year | Mental | Physical |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| 2017 | 0.60   | 0.26     |\n| 2018 | 0.64   | 0.24     |\n| 2019 | 0.65   | 0.25     |\n| 2020 | 0.62   | 0.22     |\n| 2021 | 0.66   | 0.21     |\n\nNote: Percentage of employees taking sick leave for seven or more consecutive days and formally taking leaving system (Number of employees taking sick leave per month / Number of employees per month \u00d7 100)\nAddressing Mental Health\n\nHitachi has established measures addressing mental health to be taken by employees, workplace managers, occupational healthcare workers, and human resources divisions. We are working to spread basic mental health knowledge and understanding of ways to deal with stress as well as reinforcing the ability of those in positions of authority to respond to these issues. The mental illness incidence rate among employees in fiscal 2021 was higher than in the previous year, therefore we have continued to take a proactive approach to increases in mental strain such as that caused by the prolongation of the pandemic.\n\n(1) Regular one-on-one interviews\n(2) Expansion of a system for remote consultations with occupational physicians\n(3) Introduction of an external EAP consultation service in addition to our internal one\n(4) Individual interviews with employees who are stationed at customer company\n(5) Tips for working from home posted on the intranet\n(6) Identification of health issues using a survey of employees working from home\n(7) Sending emails promoting non-statutory interviews (consultations) to employees identified through a stress check as highly stressed\n(8) Providing a handbook for care by line managers when working from home\n\nWe will also clarify which target levels require special attention based on our survey of employees working from home, a global employee survey, and the opinions of occupational physicians. And we will promote taking an effective and active approach.\nPromoting Collabo-Health*\u00b9\n\nAs well as carrying out individual health improvement initiatives according to their own unique characteristics, Group companies in Japan strive to maintain and improve the health of employees by taking full advantage of the services offered by the Hitachi Health Insurance Society.*\u00b2 Hitachi is also working to ensure that all Group companies are certified under the Health and Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program by Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Health promotion initiatives are also evaluated on an annual basis with recognition of the most accomplished companies and BUs within the Group heightening the motivation among business owners and employees to pursue such activities.\n\n*\u00b9 Collabo-Health: A concept involving insurers like the Health Insurance Society proactively working with business owners, with a clear division of labor and a good working environment, to effectively and efficiently improve the health of insured persons (employees and their families), including preventive strategies.\n\n*\u00b2 Hitachi Health Insurance Society: Hitachi Group employees and their families are members of this organization which is one of Japan\u2019s largest health insurance associations. As of the end of March 2022, there were 197 participating corporations and 409,943 insured persons (206,301 members and 203,642 dependents).\n\nEncouraging Employees to Receive Medical Exams and Quit Smoking\n\nIn Japan, Hitachi has established a system offering financial support for medical exams by the Health Insurance Society and encourages employees aged 35 and over, to receive the general physical and other exams specified in law as well as targeted screening based on age, in order to promote early diagnosis and treatment such as for lifestyle related diseases and cancers.\n\nFurthermore, as a response to the rise in metabolic syndrome, and in addition to special health guidance made compulsory for the Health Insurance Society, we actively promote policies to prevent and control conditions such as diabetes, cerebral strokes, and myocardial infarctions.\n\nHitachi has also continued its online quit smoking program so that employees do not need to visit a clinic during the pandemic. This helps employees to stop smoking while working from home. Of the approximately 360 employees who signed up, more than 70% have succeeded in stopping smoking.\n\nNumber of Hitachi Health Insurance Society Member Corporations Certified Under the Health and Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program\n\n| Category                  | FY 2020 | FY 2021 |\n|---------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Large companies           | 58      | 75      |\n| (Including seven with \u201cWhite 500\u201d status) |         |         |\n| Small-and medium-sized companies | 41      | 66      |\n| (Including three with \u201cBright 500\u201d status) |         |         |\n\nMedical Exam and Screening Attendance Rates\n\n| Year | General physical exam | Breast cancer screening | Uterine cancer screening | Stomach cancer screening | Intestinal cancer screening | Lung cancer screening |\n|------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|\n| 2017 | 92.9                  | 81.4                    | 51.8                    | 39.3                     | 31.5                      | 30.9                |\n| 2018 | 93.2                  | 81.3                    | 53.2                    | 37.1                     | 31.0                      | 30.9                |\n| 2019 | 95.8                  | 80.7                    | 56.3                    | 38.7                     | 31.1                      | 30.9                |\n| 2020 | 96.8                  | 82.7                    | 56.6                    | 39.1                     | 31.3                      | 30.9                |\n| 2021 | 98.0                  | 85.5                    | 57.1                    | 39.3                     | 31.5                      | 30.9                |\n\nSmoking Rate Trend\n\n| Year | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| %    | 31.5 | 30.9 | 29.8 | 28.4 | 27.6 |\n\nNote: Employees aged 35 and over (results of specific medical examinations)\nMeasures to Prevent Infectious Disease\n\nIn addition to measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we have been vaccinating employees against hepatitis A, tetanus, and cholera to prevent them from contracting infectious diseases during business travel outside Japan.\n\nIn Japan, the Health Insurance Society has established an incentive point system to reward influenza vaccine recipients, including employee family members, with the aim of preventing influenza outbreaks in the workplace. As an initiative to prevent catching influenza, we recommend employees get vaccinated before the flu season gets underway. The program is used by about 120,000 employees and their families every year.\n\nFrom fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2021, we introduced an incentive point system in cooperation with the Health Insurance Society to encourage applicable employees to receive an antibody test for and vaccination against measles and rubella\u2014both of which are now free of charge. This is part of our efforts in Japan to target male employees of the generation not covered by the national MR vaccination program as children.\n\nPromoting Measures to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19\n\nAs a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we ask all employees to check their temperature and physical condition before leaving for work, and to always stay home if they have a fever or feel unwell. We encourage the full implementation of the government\u2019s infection prevention guidelines. We have implemented full-scale infection prevention measures according to the type of work. This includes providing disinfectant and masks to employees engaged in the maintenance of social infrastructure. Hitachi has taken a whole range of other preventive measures such as mandatory mask wearing at all sites as well as thorough temperature checks and workplace disinfection based on the installation of thermal cameras, non-contact thermometers, and automatic sanitizer dispensers at building entrances.\n\nWe have also spaced-out seating in offices, employee cafeterias, and conference rooms, installed droplet blocking partitions, limited the number of passengers in elevators, suspended the use of smoking rooms and ensured physical distancing in common areas.\n\nThe Hitachi Group recommends that employees get vaccinated against COVID-19 to prevent infection and serious illness. In Japan, we conducted workplace vaccinations, and offered vaccination to the families of employees at some of our locations. Altogether, we have vaccinated approximately 75 thousand people.\n\nHelping to Protect Employees Against COVID-19\n\nWe are providing a wide range of support to address a broad array of mental and physical health concerns among long-term workers from home. For example, we provide remote healthcare counseling, offer tips on staying healthy while working from home, support foreign employees seeking medical services in Japan, and ensure the human rights of COVID-19 infected employees.\n\nHitachi Group companies outside Japan have also been supporting employee health during the pandemic. Their efforts include holding mental health workshops and providing EAP consultation services.\n\nHealth Promotion Initiatives for Employees and Their Families\n\nTo encourage healthy lifestyles among employees and their families, the Hitachi Health Insurance Society has established a portal site for individuals entitled MY HEALTH WEB. By providing information on health exam results and a system of incentive points allowing employees to receive rewards for entering health-related activities, the site raises health awareness, helps employees understand the state of their own health, and offers a range of support for adopting a healthier lifestyle.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we completely overhauled MY HEALTH WEB and increased the employee utilization rate to 80% through various promotional activities.\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n\nIn fiscal 2020, in order to encourage regular checkups, Hitachi added an online service that allows employees and their families to make appointments for medical examinations using MY HEALTH WEB. Furthermore, in fiscal 2021, to support employees\u2019 health management in the COVID-19 pandemic, we held our first \u201cAutumn Walking Campaign\u201d in two years, with about 50,000 participants.\nHelping Employees in Japan Stay Healthy and Promote Further\n\n| Initiative | Outline |\n|------------|---------|\n| Remote counseling by occupational physicians | Established remote counseling by occupational physicians and nurses as an early-response measure to address the mental and physical health concerns of employees working long-term from home |\n| Tips on staying healthy while working from home | The website provides advice for maintaining physical and mental health as well as contact information for health consultation providers.

The Nuclear Power Plant and Reactor Exporters\u2019 Principles of Conduct were formally revealed on September 15, 2011. They were adopted by all involved in their development, and we have also indicated our adherence to them.\n\nRegarding our employees and other persons employed at nuclear sites under the Hitachi Group umbrella, we have performed thorough exposure management based on our internal management systems and performed evaluation of radiation damage (dose management).\n\nFor health management in particular, our management indicators for radiation exposure are stricter than those set by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We monitor physical and mental health along with exposure doses even for employees of partner companies, and an occupational physician from Hitachi visits sites to perform examinations and offer health advice.\n\nNuclear Power Plant and Reactor Exporters\u2019 Principles of Conduct\nhttps://www.hitachi-hgne.co.jp/en/principle/index.html\nFreedom of Association and Collective Bargaining\n\nRespecting the Rights of Employees\n\nHitachi respects and supports human rights as recorded in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. And the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct call for the upholding of the fundamental rights of employees in line with international standards and in accordance with the laws of each country and region. In addition, we have signed the United Nations Global Compact, which states that, \u201cbusinesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining\u201d of employees.\n\nApproach\n\nHitachi Group Codes of Conduct\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/corporate/about/conduct/index.html\n\nMutual Communication Between Employees and Management\n\nThe relationship between employees and management at Hitachi, Ltd. and Group companies in Japan is stable with healthy ongoing dialogue.\n\nIn Japan, the Group companies espouse the three fundamental rights of labor unions (to organize, to bargain collectively, and to act collectively), and we are working to promote mutual understanding through Dialogue between employees and management throughout the entire Group. Plus, the Central Management Council, the Business Units Management Council, and the Business Sites Management Council work to enhance mutual communication between employees and management. This contributes to smooth management and business development and helps improve working conditions for union members. We usually negotiate with the Hitachi Workers Union, from February to March each year, to determine wages, bonuses, and collective agreements for the next fiscal year. We have also established 13 committees, advisory panels, and round-table conferences, including the Next 100 Labor and Management Committee, the Central Wages Committee, and the Employment and Work Style Advisory Panel. These committees each meet one to four times a year to share information, exchange opinions, and hold discussions.\n\nAt Hitachi, Ltd., all employees, with the exception of management, can join the Workers Union, and the membership rate is approximately 96%, as of March 31, 2022.\n\nAt Hitachi, Ltd., we also hold quarterly Hitachi Group management meetings with the labor unions of group companies in Japan that belong to the Federation of Hitachi Group Workers Unions (FHGWU), to share information and exchange views and opinions on Group business conditions. In addition, we have established five round-table conferences and committees, such as the Hitachi Group Health and Safety Round-table Conference, which each meet once or twice a year to share information and exchange opinions.\n\nGroup companies outside Japan also actively pursue dialogue with individual labor unions and their representatives in accordance with the laws and regulations in each country and region to deepen mutual understanding of employee working conditions and treatment as well as business conditions.\n\nLabor Management Dialogue at Regional Headquarters in China and Europe\n\nHitachi (China) Ltd.\n\nTo maintain good communication with employees, Hitachi China holds management roundtable meetings with labor unions to share information on corporate management conditions and issues. In fiscal 2021, the 22nd meeting was held online. Moreover, the company and its labor unions work to deepen mutual understanding and protect the rights of employees by forming contracts related to working conditions, wage revisions, protection of female employees, and the like.\n\nHitachi Europe Ltd.\n\nSince 1996, our European labor management meeting has been held every year as a place for senior management and employees to exchange opinions on the Group\u2019s business environment and strategies.\nNotification of Work-related Transfers and Reassignments\n\nThe collective agreement between Hitachi, Ltd. and the Hitachi Workers Union states that any transfer or reassignment of an employee for work-related reasons should adequately take into consideration the situation of the employee as well as requiring the company to promptly inform the Hitachi Workers Union of the decision. More specifically, in cases of large-scale transfers, reassignments, or moving the company will consult with the labor union regarding the basic issues involved.\n\nLabor-Management Cooperation toward Improving Occupational Health and Safety Levels\n\nHitachi, Ltd. and the Hitachi Workers Union are dedicated to improving occupational health and safety levels through employee management cooperation. This includes signing a collective agreement on the promotion of, among other things, occupational health and safety measures, a health and safety committee, education and training programs, and health checks for employees.\n\nThe committee works to ensure a healthy and safe work environment through their initiatives that include planning and tracking occupational health and safety activities each year, reviewing their measures to prevent occupational accidents, and sharing information on whether employees have received their annual health check-ups.\nHitachi Sustainability Report 2022\n\nContents  Introduction  Management  Environmental  Social  Governance  Assurance\n\nSocial\n\nHuman Rights\n\nWhy\n\nHitachi understands that respecting human rights in business activities is not only essential for corporate sustainable development but is also a responsibility that all companies must fulfill. In 2013, to clarify corporate responsibility with respect to human rights, we established the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy based on Hitachi\u2019s Corporate Mission and Group Vision and designated it one of the highest codes governing our internal regulations. Under the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, we pursue initiatives to ensure respect for human rights including human rights due diligence (HRDD) to mitigate human rights risks, not just within Hitachi itself, but for everyone in our supply chain or otherwise involved with our business activities, products, or services.\n\nWhat\n\n- Group structure for promoting human rights\n- HRDD initiatives\n- Working with procurement partners\n- Human rights education and awareness raising for employees and executive officers\n\nHow\n\nHitachi is working to strengthen human rights risk management worldwide with efforts that include tasking the Chief Sustainability Officer with Group-wide human rights promotion and determining policies based on a grasp of the status of HRDD progress throughout the Hitachi Group. Also, HRDD Execution Managers Meetings are held once or twice a year as occasions for Group-wide information sharing and deliberation.\n\nPolicy and promotion structure\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n\nHRDD initiatives\n\nInvestigated the actual situation concerning potential forced labor and violations of migrant workers\u2019 rights, which were identified as common priority risks for the Hitachi Group.\n\nProvided guidance to operational sites where there were issues to be improved based on the results of investigation of the actual situation and implemented appropriate measures there.\n\nWorking with procurement partners\n\nConducted investigations of the actual situation concerning potential forced labor and violations of migrant workers\u2019 rights for procurement partners as well.\n\nRaise human rights awareness among executives and employees\n\nContinuously worked to raise human rights awareness among all Hitachi Group employees through opportunities such as trainings, and message from the President & CEO on Human Rights Day.\n\nCarried out executive human rights training taught by an external lecturer.\n\nGlobal Group grievance mechanisms\n\nThe facts related to all reports, including those concerning harassment and human rights issues, are subject to thorough investigation. Reporters are informed of the investigation results, and remedial action is taken when necessary.\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nRespect for Human Rights Throughout the Value Chain\n\nRespecting the Human Rights of All People\n\nApproach\n\nAt Hitachi, we believe that respecting human rights is our duty as a global company, and essential to conducting business.\n\nWe are making continuous efforts not to engage in any acts that may impair individual dignity or discriminate on bases such as sex, sexual orientation, age, nationality, race, ethnicity, ideology, belief, religion, social status, family origin, disease, or disability.\n\nEngagement with stakeholders is vital to understanding and managing our impact on human rights.\n\nHitachi Group Human Rights Policy\n\nPolicy\n\nIn May 2013, we formulated the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy and positioned it as one of our highest internal standards. This policy declares our respect for human rights as recorded in the International Bill of Human Rights\u00b9 and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The declaration stipulates the basic rights at work, including freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor, the effective abolition of child labor, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. This policy shapes Hitachi\u2019s approach to meeting the responsibility to respect human rights including implementing human rights due diligence (HRDD)\u00b2 in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\u00b3\n\nHitachi has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2009. We have declared our support for the UN Global Compact, which outlines a set of universal principles that companies should adhere to in the four areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. Accordingly, we are promoting efforts in each area.\n\nWith respect to the human rights of children, we are striving to ensure there is no child labor nor forced labor in our company or supply chain. The Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct stipulates that consideration be given to human rights, including those of children.\n\n\u00b9 International Bill of Human Rights: Collective name for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenants on Human Rights adopted by the United Nations.\n\u00b2 Human rights due diligence (HRDD): An ongoing process to identify and assess potential and actual human rights negative impacts, take appropriate action to prevent or mitigate potential impacts, track the effectiveness of actions to address impacts, and communicate externally.\n\u00b3 Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Included in the March 2011 \u201cReport of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie\u201d (A/HRC/17/31).\n\nHitachi Group Human Rights Policy\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/sustainability/esg_summary/pdf/human_rights_policy.pdf\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nHRDD Initiatives\n\nIn line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Hitachi manages human rights risks in accordance with the following HRDD processes.\n\nAssess: Assessing actual and potential human rights impacts\n\n- Prioritizing Risks\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the entire Hitachi Group addressed the issues of forced labor and violations of the rights of migrant workers, which the Group had defined as a common priority risk for the Group. We identified these priority risks by analyzing and reevaluating information such as the results of our HRDD to date and feedback from human rights NGOs on them, human rights issues identified in Hitachi rules and guidelines, information and observations by NGOs, experts and the media, evaluation criteria for corporate efforts based on international initiatives, the results of internal inspections by procurement partners and Group companies, and trends in international legislation.\n\nUnderstanding the Situation\n\nTo understand the actual situation surrounding these priority risks, we created a priority risk questionnaire to assess the situation within the Hitachi Group and procurement partners. This questionnaire has been reviewed by the ASSC (The Global Alliance for Sustainable Supply Chain), an NGO with experience and expertise in supporting companies from the perspective of sustainability, including human rights and environmental issues. They provided advice regarding questions to include, and consistency with industry and international standards such as those of the ILO. This questionnaire goes beyond simply understanding the level of our efforts, and aims to lead to continuous improvement through consideration and implementation of remedies and countermeasures based on the evaluation results for each BU or Group company.\n\nWe investigated the actual situations of manufacturing workers (including temporary workers, technical interns) working at operational sites with 300 or more employees for a total of 15 major BUs and Group companies. In Southeast Asian countries, which are said to have challenges on forced labor and violations of migrant workers\u2019 rights, as NGOs and the media have indicated as well, we surveyed all manufacturing workers at manufacturing sites regardless of the site\u2019s size. The questionnaire was composed of about 30 questions relating to labor, occupational health and safety, and mechanisms for responding to grievances, with each offering four choices to evaluate the level of efforts implemented. Each choice clearly specified the target conduct in objective terms so that each operational site surveyed was able to understand what needs to be done to improve the current level of their own business site.\nSocial\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nRespect for Human Rights Throughout the Value Chain\n\nHuman Rights\n\nHuman Rights\n\nSocial Data\n\nValue Chain Management\n\nHuman Rights\n\nSocial\n\nAnswer Choice Levels for the Questionnaire\n\n| Choice | Level |\n|--------|-------|\n| A      | Efforts in accordance with international standards (best case) |\n| B      | Borderline acceptable for Hitachi efforts |\n| C      | Below the borderlines required by Hitachi |\n| D      | No efforts made on this matter |\n\nSummary of Investigation Results\n\nThe results concerning labor, occupational health and safety, and the grievances mechanism were as follows.\n\nSurvey Results\n\n- General: 83.2%\n- Labor: 86.4%\n- Occupational health and safety: 96.1%\n- Grievances mechanism: 95.1%\n\nBreakdown of responses from operational site\n\n| Country/Region       | Percentage |\n|----------------------|------------|\n| Japan                | 64%        |\n| Southeast Asia       | 35%        |\n| Europe               | 26%        |\n| China                | 24%        |\n| India                | 20%        |\n| North America        | 18%        |\n| Central, and South America | 10% |\n| Oceania              | 2%         |\n| Middle East          | 2%         |\n| Taiwan               | 2%         |\n| South Korea          | 1%         |\n| Russia               | 1%         |\n\nGrievances Mechanism\n\nMany operational sites had put in place policies and procedures for handling reporting and maintaining confidentiality. On the other hand, there were several operational sites that answered that there was no reporting mechanism in place, or that there was one, but it was not available in a language that the workers could understand. We realized that we needed to further publicize the existence of the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline established in fiscal 2020 as a unified contact point for consultation and reporting.\n\nIn July 2021, ASSC, which was commissioned to review the priority risk questionnaire, facilitated a workshop for BUs and Group companies that were involved in the survey to analyze the response results and consider countermeasures. We also published the A Guide for Considering Measures to Address Hitachi Group Priority Risks (Forced labor and violations of the rights of migrant workers). This guide is useful for making corrections and improvements at each operational site.\n\nIntegrate and Act: integrating and acting upon the findings\n\nIn response to the results of this survey, each BU and Group company is working to make improvements and provide guidance for issues to operational sites where there were issues to be improved. Examples of the primary measures taken by operational sites are listed below:\n\nKey Countermeasures Implemented by Operational Sites\n\n| Item | Example Countermeasure |\n|------|------------------------|\n| Control of identification documents, etc. | \u2022 Because some sites were keeping IDs, the sites changed the rules to ensure the documents be retained by workers. |\n| Recruitment fees borne by directly employed workers | \u2022 Installed a personal safe for each employee, so that they can manage these documents themselves. |\n| Recruitment fees paid by temporary workers | \u2022 Requested that staffing agencies refund workers. |\n| Collective bargaining | \u2022 Developed guidelines that stipulate that if an employee requests to negotiate, the company will accept the request, and ensure that site managers are aware of these guidelines. (Malaysia) |\n| Entering provided housing | \u2022 Directed operational sites to install locks on rooms for the sake of employees. |\n| Health & Safety Training | \u2022 For foreign workers (temporary workers), provide work standards and safety training materials in their native languages with the cooperation of temporary staffing agencies. |\n| Fire and emergency response | \u2022 Employed diagrams and other tools so that all workers could understand. |\n| Grievance mechanisms | \u2022 Directed operational sites to make available through the Hitachi Global Hotline. |\n**Social Data**\n\n**Community**\n\n**Value Chain Management**\n\n**Human Rights**\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\n- Respect for Human Rights Throughout the Value Chain\n\n**Human Rights**\n\n**Value Chain Management**\n\n**Social Data**\n\n---\n\n**Track: Tracking responses**\n\nWhile majority of operational sites implemented their countermeasures during fiscal 2021, several operational sites carried implementation over into fiscal 2022, as they were still developing internal rules. We will conduct a follow-up investigation on these operational sites during fiscal 2022.\n\n**Communicate: Communicating how impacts are addressed**\n\nWe disclose information on initiatives concerning respect for human rights, including HRDD, through our Sustainability Report, websites, and other means. We also strive to deepen understanding of Hitachi\u2019s initiatives through appropriate communication concerning questions, observations, and the like from investors, ESG evaluation organizations, NGOs, and media outlets, and incorporate opinions from inside and outside the company when considering future countermeasures.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we took measures to address priority risks common to the entire Group. From fiscal 2022, we will apply the knowledge gained through our efforts in fiscal 2021 to evaluate the human rights risks for each BU and Group company, with consideration for the characteristics specific to each business and value chain.\n\n**Our HRDD Initiatives to Date**\n\nHitachi has engaged in HRDD since 2013, with the cooperation of NGOs, NPOs, and outside experts.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation Status of HRDD**\n\n| Initiatives | FY 2013 | FY 2014 | FY 2015 | FY 2016 | FY 2017 | FY 2018 | FY 2019 | FY 2020 | FY 2021 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Implemented HRDD pilot program at specific Group companies with the support of the NPOs Shift and Business for Social Responsibility (BSR). Also analyzed and evaluated human rights risks in six ASEAN countries. | Implemented countermeasures (provided corrective guidance, held workshops, published countermeasure consideration guide, etc.) at each BU and Group company, based on the fiscal 2020 survey, to address the Group\u2019s common priority risks that are grounds for concern. | Created guidance documents for implementing HRDD in collaboration with Shift. | Initiated HRDD in procurement divisions under the guidance of Shift. Headquarter, BUs and Group companies assessed and prioritized human rights risks that employees are likely to confront in the supply chain and explored mitigation strategies. Identified priority items and high-risk countries based on information concerning countries\u2019 corruption-related situations published by NGOs and others, publicly available information such as human rights-related reports, trading conditions, results of procurement partners\u2019 sustainability audits, externally indicated matters, and so on. Based on this, received feedback from Human Rights NGOs regarding priority issue identification methods and future measures, led to revision of CSR Procurement Guidelines for procurement partners and checklists for sustainability monitoring, expansion of the countries subject to audits, and holding of information sessions for procurement partners. | Initiated HRDD in human resources divisions under the guidance of Shift. Assessed and prioritized human rights risks for employees through interviews held with the human resources personnel of BUs and Group companies in Japan and subsidiaries outside Japan and explored mitigation strategies. In HRDD efforts in human resources divisions in fiscal 2016, country-specific assessments of risks for employees were performed. Although situations vary among countries, we identified the top risks as those concerning working hours, workplace health and safety, harassment/discrimination, and freedom of association. Many of those items were already being addressed as human resources measures, so we decided to continue them. Improving grievance mechanisms was another matter that came up and led to measures including the improvement of Intranet-based guidance and integration with the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline. | Incorporated results of HRDD in procurement divisions into the revision of CSR procurement guidelines for suppliers, revised the checklist used in procurement partners sustainability monitoring. | Assessed and prioritized human rights risks and considered medium-term action plans for several BUs and Group companies under the guidance of Shift. Also held workshops for the human resources division at headquarters, verified the results of HRDD in fiscal 2016, and considered countermeasures. | Used our checklist for procurement partners to perform self-checks of approximately 100 Group companies in Southeast Asia under the guidance of Verite Southeast Asia. The necessity of enhancing measures to prevent forced labor and respect the human rights of migrant workers was observed at some operational sites. | Analyzed and reassessed results of HRDD to date to determine human rights risks that the Hitachi Group must address as a whole. | Established the HRDD Promotion Project Team. Prepared and deployed a survey concerning priority risks common to the Hitachi Group (forced labor and violations of the rights of migrant workers) within the Group with the support of the NGO The Global Alliance for Sustainable Supply Chain (ASSC). Created our Human Rights Risk Management Implementation Manual. This manual, incorporated Shift\u2019s advice on consistency with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and explanations of each step in HRDD. Implemented measures to improve grievance mechanisms, such as consolidating the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline. |\nWorking with Procurement Partners\n\nActivities\n\nGRI 408-1/409-1\n\nTo ensure respect for human rights throughout our entire supply chain, Hitachi is promoting understanding of Hitachi\u2019s policy with respect for human rights among procurement partners by including the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy in our Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines. And we are working to ensure they are put into practice. Moreover, these guidelines make it clear that child labor and forced labor should be eliminated. We are working to ensure complete awareness throughout our supply chain through efforts such as distributing them to our procurement partners, and holding sustainable procurement seminars.\n\nHuman Rights Awareness Initiatives Targeting Procurement Partners and Procurement Personnel\n\n| Target | Initiatives |\n|--------|------------|\n| FY 2018 | European Group companies: Procurement personnel from European Group companies formed the Responsible Supply Chain Working Group. |\n| FY 2019 | European Group companies: Procurement partners in China: Created a webinar titled \u201cImplementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\u201d for procurement personnel in the working group mentioned above. |\n| FY 2020 | European Group companies: Procurement partners in China, Thailand, and other Asian countries: Introduced human rights risk analysis into the selection of procurement partners which should be included in sustainability monitoring. The above-mentioned working group discussed the self-check results under the guidance of Shift and explained the situation regarding the development of due diligence legislation in Europe. |\n| FY 2021 | European Group companies: Procurement partners in China and other Asian countries: Held online information sessions in China and other Asian countries. In China, we explained our policy and activities concerning sustainable procurement activities including HRDD. In other parts of Asia, we raised procurement partners\u2019 awareness by inviting outside experts familiar with environmental and human rights issues to provide training, and shared the results of monitoring, thereby helping each procurement partner to enhance its sustainability activities. |\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we ascertained actual conditions at our procurement partners using a survey similar to the survey on forced labor and violations of the rights of migrant workers that we used within the Hitachi Group.\n\nHuman Rights Education and Awareness Raising for Employees and Executive Officers\n\nGRI 412-2\n\nIn accordance with the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, Hitachi continually strives to familiarize all Hitachi Group employees with human rights by conducting human rights e-learning, distributing human rights messages on the importance of respect for human rights from the President & CEO on Human Rights Day, and other efforts.\n\nAnnually in Japan, we aim for every employee to attend group training, lectures, or video-based educational activities held at each business site or Group company. Also, in an effort to prevent harassment, we held video-based training on the theme of harassment (in the workplace). The objective was to increase the skills of those responsible for handling harassment issues (counselors), including managerial personnel. The training was attended by 1,200 employees across the Hitachi Group. In addition to this, we use various training and educational activities, such as onboarding training directed at new hires, training for job positions, and training for employees transferred abroad, to convey the significance of respecting human rights in their own work to every employee.\n\nFor Group companies outside of Japan, the regional headquarters plays the role of promoting and supporting collaboration. To this end, we invited lecturers from NPO Shift to conduct implementation training for promotion representatives.\n\nImplementation Status of Activities to Raise Awareness of Human Rights\n\n| Target | Details | Number of participants in FY 2021 |\n|--------|---------|----------------------------------|\n| Hitachi Group executives and employees | Distributed a human rights message by President & CEO on Human Rights Day (every year) | Distributed to approx. 238,000 messages |\n| Hitachi, Ltd. | E-learning course on business and human rights (provided in 15 languages, taken about once every three years) | Not implemented in FY2021 (A total of more than 160,000 people took it in FY2019) |\n| Hitachi, Ltd. | Lecture on human rights by an outside expert (held annually) | Attended by 27 people |\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nSocial\n\nInnovation Management\nHuman Capital\nHuman Rights\nExecutive Summary\n\u2013 Respect for Human Rights Throughout the Value Chain\nValue Chain Management\nCommunity\nSocial Data\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2021\n\nEvery year, we provide human rights training to executives of Hitachi, Ltd. In fiscal 2021, this training was conducted by an external lecturer. He gave lectures on changes in the social context that have made human rights issues closely related to business, how to enhance human rights risk management while conducting business globally, and how it is essential to always be aware of human rights risks when making management decisions.\n\nGlobal Group Grievance Mechanisms\n\nHitachi has established a Group-wide internal reporting system called the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline. We investigate all reports, including those concerning human rights and harassment, and following verification of the relevant facts, inform those who submitted reports of the investigation results. We make every effort to deal with situations as appropriate, including taking remedial action when necessary.\n\nHandling Various Human Rights Issues\n\nWe are working to appropriately handle various human rights issues, including problems concerning the work environment of foreign technical interns in Japan, and global supply chain issues related to Uighurs.\n\nResponses to Human Rights Issues\n\n| Human Rights Issue | Timeline | Event/Handling |\n|--------------------|----------|----------------|\n| Problems concerning foreign technical interns | 2018 | Hitachi, Ltd. and 10 Group companies received recommendations for improvement of practical training from Japanese Organization for Technical Intern Training for alleged violations related to the Act on Proper Technical Intern Training and Protection of Technical Intern Trainees. |\n| | September 2019 | Hitachi, Ltd. received improvement orders from the Immigration Services Agency of Japan and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare regarding establishment of its system for carrying out proper technical intern training according to authorized plans. |\n| | October 2019 | Each company that was subject to a recommendation for improvement or improvement order submitted a report to the Organization for Technical Intern Training that it had completed improvements according to the content of the improvement order, and all of them were accepted. |\n| | March 2020 | Established Group-wide policies, guidelines, and check systems for conducting technical intern training. |\n| | November 2020 | The entire Group is thoroughly committed to preventing recurrence through internal audits and the like. In accordance with the intent of relevant laws and regulations on the Technical Training Program as well as the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, we continue striving to implement appropriate technical training from the viewpoint of respect for human rights. |\n| Response to Issues Concerning Uighurs | March 2020 | A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute pointed out that one of our procurement partners may be involved in forced labor of Uighur people. |\n| | December 2020 | Hitachi, Ltd. conducted an audit through a third party based on international standards of the management system of the procurement partner identified, particularly with respect to personal management. As a result, we found no issues related to forced labor. Hitachi will continue to strive, through various forms of engagement, to ensure respect for the human rights of not only those within our Group, but of our procurement partners as well. |\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nInitiatives to Promote Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) in South Africa\n\nAs Hitachi conducts business in South Africa, it pursues activities aligned with the country\u2019s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE)*1 policy to create employment and economic development. As of August 31, 2022, Hitachi Energy in Southern Africa has achieved level 1 on B-BBEE.\n\nHitachi Energy South Africa is obliged to meet the Employment Equity Act (EEA)*2 targets and plans, which are reviewed every 3\u20135 years with annual progress reporting. Its ultimate aim is to ensure that it maintains diversity in the workforce, including gender diversity.\n\nThe company\u2019s training strategy is aligned with the Skills Development targets as linked to B-BBEE and the company also invests in its current employees, in line with diversity and equity, to enhance the performance and promotability of internal talent. Hitachi Energy South Africa hires graduates and trainees with Historically Disadvantaged South Africans (HDSA) backgrounds annually.\n\nCurrently, employees with HDSA backgrounds comprise 26.4% of those in management/supervisory positions at Hitachi Energy South Africa.\n\n---\n\n*1 B-BBEE: Companies and organizations in South Africa are scored on their B-BBEE approaches and contributions, and are rated on a scale from level 1 (the highest) to 8, and \u201cnon-compliant.\u201d\n\n*2 Employment Equity Act (EEA): A South African law that promotes fairness and equal opportunities in the workplace for all employees.\nValue Chain Management\n\nWith the globalization of the Hitachi Group\u2019s businesses, procurement risks are also increasing in supply chains. That is why we are going beyond merely understanding and mitigating supply chain risks to pursue sustainable procurement instead. We recognize that we must actively work with our procurement partners to improve social, environmental, and economic value for our customers, and we are working with procurement partners to achieve carbon neutrality throughout our value chain as well.\n\nHitachi was founded on the principles of \u201cHarmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit.\u201d We ensure product quality and safety by adhering to these principles, along with the basics and ethics, and by putting right and wrong before profit and loss. All employees embrace our policy of making quality and reliability a top priority, and this strengthens our quality assurance activities. By continuing to provide high-quality, thoroughly safe products, Hitachi will maintain the trust of customers and society.\n\nWhy\n\nWhy it matters\n\nResponsible Procurement\n\nWhat\n\nWhat we are doing\n\n\u2022 Implementing sustainable procurement\n\u2022 Encouraging procurement partners to reduce their environmental load\n\u2022 Implementing procurement BCP initiatives\n\u2022 Responding to the conflict minerals issue\n\nPolicy and promotion structure\n\nPositioning the Hitachi Group Global Procurement Code as the highest code, Hitachi promotes sustainable procurement based on the heads of procurement divisions at Business Units (BUs) and major Group companies. In fiscal 2021, we established the new Sustainable Procurement Office to strengthen sustainability activities pursued in cooperation with our procurement partners.\n\nHow\n\nHow we are doing it\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n\nRaising awareness of the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines\nRevised the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines and distributed them to procurement partners to raise awareness of them as a code of conduct for procurement partners.\n\nSustainability monitoring of procurement partners\nAssessed and analyzed the status of procurement partners\u2019 sustainability initiatives through surveys with a focus on human rights and environmental risk assessment.\n\nConducting sustainability audits\nConducted sustainability audits of procurement partners in China and other Asian countries (Target: 25 companies).\n\nHolding sustainable procurement seminars for procurement partners\nHeld sustainable procurement seminars online on Hitachi Group sustainability initiatives for procurement partners (Target: 359 companies in China and the rest of Asia).\n\nEncouraging procurement partners to reduce their environmental load\nTo coincide with COP26, organized \u201cTowards Net Zero\u2014Hitachi Value Chain Innovators,\u201d an online event concerning value chains.\n\nResponding to the conflict minerals issue\nRevised the Hitachi Group\u2019s Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy to formulate the Hitachi Group\u2019s Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals in response to the expanded scope of responsibilities expected of companies in their procurement of minerals.\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nQuality and Product Safety Management\n\n- Engaging in quality assurance activities\n- Commissioning external audits concerning product quality assurance\n- Acquiring international standards certification for our quality management system\n- Providing quality and reliability education\n- Acting to provide product safety\n- Responding when incidents occur\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n- Ensured technical law compliance\n- Pursued thorough safety design and safety monitoring for products and services\n- Commissioned regular external audits concerning product safety\n- Surveyed the number of certified business sites\n- Provided various forms of training and education in accordance with the target recipients\n\nCustomer Satisfaction\n\n- Implementing initiatives to improve communication with customers\n- Conducting digital marketing\n- Engaging in advertising activities\n- Providing comprehensive customer support online\n- Engaging in activities to improve customer satisfaction (CS) regarding home appliances\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n- Held seminars and forums to improve CS\n- Promoted communication activities based on our Advertisement Guidelines and Social Media Policy\n- Conducted a CS survey using the evaluation survey for customer repair services (Satisfaction rate: 95.4%)\nResponsible Procurement\n\nBasic Procurement Guidelines\n\nWe believe that putting sustainability at the core of our business throughout our value chain will lead to mutual prosperity for procurement partners and the Hitachi Group. We are also working to proactively identify and mitigate procurement risks.\n\nHitachi instituted the Hitachi Group Global Procurement Code. This is our highest code for procurement activities. It calls on Group companies and procurement partners to give due consideration to human rights, labor practices, safety, ethics, quality, and security in the supply chain. Procurement partners are also selected strictly in accordance with the code\u2019s provisions.\n\nWe also established the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines, which are a code of conduct for procurement partners. We aim to develop sustainable business and society together with procurement partners by promoting procurement activities that adhere to this code.\n\nSustainable Procurement Management Framework\n\nPolicies and initiatives related to sustainability are discussed within Hitachi\u2019s Value Integration Division, which reports directly to the President & CEO of Hitachi, Ltd. Policies and initiatives adopted after this discussion are thoroughly disseminated throughout the Hitachi Group through the Sustainable Procurement Conference, which includes the heads of the procurement divisions at Business Units (BUs) and major Group companies. We established the Sustainable Procurement Office in fiscal 2021 to strengthen our sustainability activities in coordination with procurement partners. This division takes the lead in planning and formulating sustainable procurement measures in close cooperation with stakeholders both inside and outside of the company. It also promotes these activities by cooperating with Hitachi Group procurement divisions both inside and outside of Japan.\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nImplementing Sustainable Procurement\n\nHitachi is implementing the following wide variety of initiatives to promote and ensure sustainable procurement. And, when we start to do business with new procurement partners, we work to enhance risk management by making careful selections based on the Hitachi Group Global Procurement Guidelines, and distributing the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines to each partner.\n\nMaking the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines Known to All\n\nThe Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines, revised in July 2021, informs procurement partners what we want them to comply with. The contents fall into seven major categories: labor, health and safety, environment, business ethics, management system, product quality and safety, and prevention of personal and confidential information leakage. It is also positioned as a communication tool to inform procurement partners about Hitachi Group initiatives, and describes our policies and initiatives related to sustainability.\n\nWe make these guidelines available in four languages (Japanese, English, Chinese, and Thai), and distribute them to approximately 30,000 procurement partners. We also ask them to comply with. The contents fall into seven major categories: labor, health and safety, environment, business ethics, management system, product quality and safety, and prevention of personal and confidential information leakage. It is also positioned as a communication tool to inform procurement partners about Hitachi Group initiatives, and describes our policies and initiatives related to sustainability.\n\nSustainability Monitoring of Procurement Partners\n\nWith the purpose of risk management and engagement with procurement partners, the Hitachi Group evaluates and analyzes the state of sustainability initiatives by procurement partners through surveys. In fiscal 2021, we focused on human rights and environmental risk assessment.\n\nHuman Rights Initiatives Survey\n\nAs part of human rights due diligence (HRDD) initiative in fiscal 2021, we conducted a survey of efforts to address forced labor and violations of the rights of migrant workers, which we have defined as a human rights risk that the entire Hitachi Group should handle. In this survey, 2,524 procurement partners performed self-evaluations concerning initiatives related to (1) labor, (2) health and safety, and (3) a point of contact for reporting. After analyzing the results of the survey, we provided feedback to the procurement partners.\n\nDetails of Feedback\n\n(1) Introduction to Hitachi Group initiatives and approach to human rights (Familiarization with Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy)\n(2) Survey results and analysis\n(3) Approach to measures addressing key points\n(4) Request for efforts toward remedy and improvement\n\nEnvironmental Initiatives Survey\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we selected approximately 1,000 procurement partners which accounts for 70% of our procurement spending (excluding publicly listed subsidiaries), to be environmental focus partners, then carried out a survey of environment-related initiatives. We received replies from 708 companies about the status of: (1) establishment of a policy on climate change, (2) efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and (3) measurement of energy consumption. Based on the information we obtained through this survey, we intend to move forward with sharing issues and pursuing concrete CO2 reduction measures through dialogue with a number of procurement partners who are implementing advanced initiatives, and encouraging lessons and successful practices developed through this initiative to be adopted and applied by our environmental focus partners.\n\nStarting in fiscal 2022, we have adopted the EcoVadis\u2122 third-party evaluation platform for monitoring and evaluating the sustainability performance of our procurement partners. We are working towards further strengthening engagement with our procurement partners.\n\nConducting Sustainability Audits\n\nHitachi, Ltd., has been auditing the manufacturing bases of its and Group companies\u2019 procurement partners in China and other Asian countries. For these audits, we engaged external evaluators such as auditing company Intertek Certification. Our audits are based on the international SA8000 certification standard developed by Social Accountability International (SAI). These audits investigate our workplace practices, and a Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)-recognized auditor checks procurement partners\u2019 sustainability initiatives from the perspectives of labor and human rights, health and safety, the environment, and ethics. Procurement partners needing improvement were requested to submit improvement action plans, and Hitachi, Ltd., together with Group companies, will work with and advise the procurement partners until they complete the planned improvements.\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nIn fiscal 2021, audits were conducted of 25 procurement partners in China and other Asian countries. Though there were no significant violations, minor problems with the following issues were identified for some procurement partners, which they were asked to remedy accordingly.\n\n- Provision of emergency exits\n- Management of overtime hours\n- Construction of frameworks for initiatives that promote human rights\n- Identification of physically demanding tasks such as work that requires standing for long hours\n\nHolding Sustainable Procurement Seminars for Procurement Partners\n\nWe held sustainable procurement seminars in an effort to deepen procurement partner understanding of Hitachi policies and the importance of sustainability.\n\nActivities in 2021\n\nTo prevent the spread of COVID-19, in fiscal 2021 we held these seminars online for partners in China and other Asian countries just as we did in fiscal 2020. Our seminars in China were attended by approximately 200 people from 133 companies. We explained policies and measures for sustainable procurement activities, including carbon neutrality and HRDD. We also asked partners to comply with the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines.\n\nOur seminars in other Asian countries were attended by approximately 300 people from 226 companies. We shared the details of our Group-wide sustainable procurement activities, and invited two experts in human rights and environmental issues as guest lecturers to conduct training on the importance of sustainability (latest trends, specific approaches to human rights and environmental initiatives, etc.). We also shared the results (average score) of the sustainability monitoring for each item, and worked to raise awareness to strengthen the sustainability activities at each company.\n\nStrengthening Global Partnerships\n\nWith the worldwide expansion of Hitachi\u2019s business, our procurement partners have become increasingly globalized as well, and we now have dealings with around 30,000 procurement partners in over 60 countries. Accordingly, we have appointed procurement officers to oversee procurement activities locally in China, other Asian countries, Europe, and the Americas in order to encourage procurement from locally based partners in line with the principle of promoting local production for local consumption. These officers carry out activities such as sustainability monitoring, sustainability audits, and sustainable procurement seminars for procurement partners in their respective regions to strengthen sustainable procurement.\n\nLocal procurement officers in China are also responsible for addressing environmental risks in China. Through the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, an environmental NGO, the officers obtain information about polluting enterprises made public by China\u2019s central and regional government bodies. They use this information not only for screening businesses which have transactions with these enterprises but also for urging the enterprises themselves to make improvements.\n\nRate of Local Procurement of Materials for Main Regions (Fiscal 2021)\n\n- China: 95%\n- Other Asian countries: 87%\n- Europe: 83%\n- Americas: 83%\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nEncouraging Procurement partners to Reduce their Environmental Load\n\nSharing Our Green Procurement Guidelines and Related Initiatives\nWe distribute the Green Procurement Guidelines that define our basic position on procuring environmentally friendly parts and products as well as our requirements of procurement partners. The guidelines set out requirements, such as establishing environmental management and recommend obtaining environmental certificates. They also include environmental conservation\u2014reducing the impact of products supplied to Hitachi, such as conserving resources and energy, recycling, managing chemical substances in products, and fully disclosing related information.\n\nTo address the issue of chemical substances in products, we recommend using chemSHERPA*\u00b9 CI/AI, a standardized format for communicating information on chemical substances in products throughout the supply chain.\n\n*\u00b9 chemSHERPA: Developed by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry to facilitate the management of chemical substances in products by creating a standardized format throughout the supply chain. The chemSHERPA-CI standard is applicable to chemical substances contained in chemical products and chemSHERPA-AI to those contained in molded products.\n\nExpanding Our Green Purchasing Rate for Office Supplies\nWe are working to expand the green purchasing rate*\u00b9 for office supplies Group-wide. We are striving to increase the number of items eligible for green purchasing, and encouraging our employees to purchase them.\n\n*\u00b9 Green purchasing rate: The percentage, by monetary value, of products with the Eco Mark among all products purchased subject to the Act on Promoting Green Procurement.\n\nReceived the Highest Rating for CDP Supplier Engagement\nHitachi, Ltd. was recognized for its efforts to realize a net-zero society, including the reduction of CO\u2082 emissions throughout its supply chain. The CDP, an international NGO working in the environmental sector, selected the company as a Supplier Engagement Leader, which is their highest rating for supplier engagement.*\u00b9\n\n*\u00b9 Supplier Engagement Rating: Used to evaluate corporate supply chain engagement on climate issues, and select companies with particularly outstanding initiatives as Supplier Engagement Leaders.\n\nProcurement BCP Initiatives\nWe are working to enhance procurement-related business continuity plans (BCPs) across Group companies worldwide to ensure that significant incidents*\u00b9 do not disrupt our business and seriously impact society.\n\n*\u00b9 Events such as natural disasters (including major earthquakes) serious enough to disrupt business\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nResponse to the Conflict Mineral Issue\n\nIn fiscal 2013, Hitachi formulated its Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy, declaring its stance and commitments regarding conflict minerals. The policy was revised in fiscal 2018 to explicitly lay out measures to be implemented to ensure responsible procurement. Expanding the scope of corporate responsibilities for the procurement of minerals is a global trend, with companies increasingly expected to address broader overall risks to human rights not limited to the risk of being complicit in conflicts, and recognize responsibilities that extend beyond the countries adjoining the Democratic Republic of the Congo to a wider area where the risks are high. In consideration of this, in fiscal 2021 we revised this policy to formulate the Hitachi Group\u2019s policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals.\n\nSystem and Initiatives\nSales divisions, business groups, manufacturing sites, procurement divisions, and other divisions within individual BUs and Group companies work together to respond to investigation requests and inquiries relating to conflict minerals. We also strive to grasp developments in conflict mineral-related laws and regulations in each country and region and what global society demands of enterprises, and work to share information within the Group.\n\nEach BU and Group company investigates its use of conflict minerals and reports the results to customers when requested. Supply chain investigations are carried out with the cooperation of the relevant BUs\u2019 and Group companies\u2019 sales, procurement, and Sustainability divisions. In addition, Hitachi, Ltd. is a member of the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA)\u2019s Responsible Minerals Trade Working Group. This working group has been addressing the issues of conflict minerals with other members of the association. In June 2021, the working group held an online information session targeted at personnel in-charge of investigation of conflict minerals at companies and organizations that face common issues related to Responsible Minerals. The working group explained the background behind responsible minerals to 1,700 people.\n\nEmployee Education\nIn 2021, about 270 employees participated in the Hitachi Group Conflict Minerals Seminar, which was held for the sales, procurement, and Sustainability divisions of our BUs and Group companies, with the aim of enhancing our Group response to conflict minerals issues. A visiting lecturer gave talks to deepen understanding of human rights violations in mineral producing countries (which are the root cause of the conflict minerals problem), risk of corporate complicity, regulatory trends relating to conflict minerals, the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), and the Hitachi Group\u2019s Policy the Responsibility Supply Chain of Minerals.\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nQuality and Product Safety Management\n\nApproach to Quality Assurance Activities\n\n**Approach**\n\nHitachi was founded on the principles of \u201cHarmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit.\u201d We ensure product quality and safety by adhering to these principles, along with the basics and ethics, and by putting right and wrong before profit and loss. We engage in quality assurance activities through our unique practice of OCHIBO-HIROI, which means \u201cgleaning\u201d in English and involves analyzing and learning from failure to further develop our technologies.\n\nAs stipulated in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, we aim to provide products and services that meet the needs and requirements of our customers, complying with relevant laws and standards and ensuring quality and safety by setting additional standards of our own where necessary. We strive to ensure quality and safety by setting independent standards as necessary, in addition to complying with all relevant laws and standards. The Quality Assurance Standards in our corporate regulations also set out our basic principles for quality assurance and aim to promote employees\u2019 awareness of them.\n\n**Framework for Quality Assurance**\n\nTo ensure full control over quality governance, Hitachi has made quality assurance divisions within business divisions independent from product design divisions and manufacturing divisions, creating a framework for activity in which the safety and trust of customers are the top priorities. In order to strengthen this framework further, we have made quality assurance divisions independent of business divisions and reinforced the report line of the quality assurance divisions of Business Units (BUs) and Group companies to the Corporate Quality Assurance Group at Hitachi, Ltd., and established systems for close information sharing between the two sides. We are also strengthening governance by giving greater authority to the Corporate Quality Assurance Group.\n\nWhen a production incident occurs in the Hitachi Group, the quality assurance division in the BU or Group company that manages the company that caused the accident reports it to the Corporate Quality Assurance Group. Then, weekly reports are provided to management executives, including the Executive Chairman, and the President & CEO at Hitachi, Ltd. Also, for a serious incident, the quality assurance division in the BU or Group company reports the incident to management executives, including the Executive Chairman, and the President & CEO at Hitachi, Ltd. as soon as it is known.\n\n**Global Quality Assurance Framework**\n\nAgainst a backdrop of the increased number of mergers and acquisitions outside Japan, in recent years, we have been working to strengthen our global quality assurance framework as a high-priority initiative. Specifically, we are promoting awareness of Hitachi\u2019s basic principles of quality assurance globally, receiving incident reports from Group companies outside Japan, and, as in Japan, we are also establishing international quality assurance reporting lines that are independent of the business divisions, as well as practicing OCHIBO-HIROI.\n\n**Quality Assurance Activities**\n\nWe are strengthening the organization and management, technology, and human capital aspects of our quality assurance activities in every process\u2014from planning and development to design, manufacturing, testing, delivery, and maintenance. Furthermore, under our approach of \u201cmaking prevention the duty of quality assurance,\u201d we are going beyond the strengthening of reoccurrence prevention and striving to prevent incidents from occurring in the first place.\n\n**Technical Law Compliance Activities**\n\nHitachi promotes internal awareness of product regulations, amendment trends, and enforcement dates in each country and region. We also work to clarify product-specific laws (with our product-specific laws map) as well as promoting regulatory compliance and implementing continuous process improvements with our product compliance management system.\nThorough Safety Design and Safety Monitoring for Products and Services\n\nWhen developing products, Hitachi makes the safety of our customers\u2019 lives, health, and property the top priority in product design and works to ensure safety at every step, from development and production to sales and maintenance. We strive to ensure safety through risk reduction according to the following order of priority: design (fundamental safety design), protective measures (safeguards), and usage information such as user instruction manuals. Also, we conduct risk assessments from a wide perspective in collaboration with related BUs and research laboratories.\n\nService, Software, and Security Quality Enhancement Activities\n\nFor our services business, which continues to grow in scale, we have established a Service and Software Quality Enhancement Division and are sharing quality activities and current challenges. We are also applying our solutions division\u2019s software development capabilities and reliability enhancement expertise to assist our product divisions (embedded software development divisions) in enhancing the reliability of embedded software as the field becomes more advanced and complex.\n\nExternal Audits of Product Quality Assurance\n\nFor certified products and other products, Hitachi has been commissioning regular external audits of product safety. Relevant marks indicate products that have received certification.

In addition to implementing e-learning courses on Hitachi\u2019s philosophy regarding quality for all employees, quality assurance is also featured as a theme in position-specific and executive-oriented training, as well as new employee education. In addition, we conduct field-specific technical lectures for engineers engaged in MONOZUKURI (manufacturing) at a range of levels from basic to expert. Each BU also conducts specialized technical courses regarding manufacturing, quality assurance, and maintenance at their quality assurance training centers.\n\nProduct Safety Response when Incidents Occur\n\nWhen an incident occurs, the division responsible acts swiftly to resolve the problem. We not only investigate the technical causes, but also thoroughly discuss the process, framework, and motivating factors leading up to the occurrence, along with ways to prevent reoccurrences, in order to ensure product safety.\n\nIn the case of a severe incident, we work to provide a prompt status report to top management, reports to government agencies in line with legal requirements, and relevant information disclosure to customers on our website and through other communication channels. At the same time, we have a framework in place to ensure that fast and appropriate action is implemented at all companies across the Group.\n\nIn the case we determine that retroactive action is necessary, we notify customers via newspaper advertising and websites in order to carry out the necessary repair or replacement program.\nReoccurrence Prevention Measures in Response to Inappropriate Conduct Discovered by Hitachi Astemo\n\nHitachi Astemo, discovered inappropriate conduct, such as issues involving periodic testing of some of the brake components manufactured at its Yamanashi Plant (Minami-Alps City, Yamanashi Prefecture) and suspension components manufactured at its Fukushima Plant (Koori Town, Date District, Fukushima Prefecture), based on information that was shared by an employee.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the significant inconvenience we may have caused our customers and concerned parties.\n\nAt Hitachi Astemo, to ensure such incidents do not occur again, in April 2021, we established a new governance office to function as a headquarters and strengthen risk management in addition to a dedicated auditing organization in the Quality Management Division, and in December 2021, we established a special investigation committee through external legal counsel to investigate the facts and root causes of the issue independently and objectively. We are working to enact sweeping measures to prevent reoccurrences. Going forward, we are fully committed to strengthening compliance even further to regain the trust of our partners and customers.\n\nNotice of Inappropriate Conduct for Certain Products, Including Unperformed Periodic Tests\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2021/12/211222.pdf\nCustomer Satisfaction (CS)  GRI 103-2\n\nInitiatives to Improve Communication with Customers\n\n| Initiative | Outline |\n|------------|---------|\n| Executive seminars | Strengthen ties with customers through customer-oriented seminars and use these opportunities to develop sales activity proposals that reflect customer needs. |\n| Hitachi Social Innovation Forum | Encourage co-creation with customers and business partners worldwide with these events, which consist of seminars and exhibits, with the aim of realizing a sustainable society through our Social Innovation Business. |\n| Technology Community program | Facilitate direct dialogue between researchers and customers regarding Hitachi\u2019s diverse range of advanced technologies and contribute to co-creation through new businesses matching Hitachi technology with customer needs. |\n\nDigital Marketing\n\nBased on strict personal information-protection rules, Hitachi collects and analyzes customer information acquired from participants in various online seminars and events, and from website browsing-history data.

All items on the checklist are confirmed in multiple languages when creating advertisements.\n\nWhen conducting communications and promotional activities on social media channels, we abide by the Hitachi Social Media Policy, which consists of the Communication Guidelines and the Guidelines for Employees, to not only protect our brand, but also to avoid violating the rights of others. It stipulates our policies for social media use and specific promotional methods.\n\nTo raise awareness of this policy among members of the company, we carry out e-learning activities in Japanese, English, and Chinese about the use of social media and addressing associated risks.\n\nSocial Media Communication Guidelines\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/utility/socialmedia/index.html\nComprehensive Customer Support Online\n\nActivities\nHitachi offers comprehensive global customer support on its website to respond to customer inquiries, opinions, requests, and complaints.

We believe that Hitachi, as a company seeking to resolve social issues through innovation, has an important mission to foster not only its own human capital but also the talent that will contribute to society in the field of science and technology more broadly. We are focusing our efforts on activities related to science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM*1) education, which has gained attention as a tool for fostering human capital capable of using cutting-edge technologies to enhance their creativity, expressivity, and problem-solving skills. As a global company, we also support charitable and volunteer activities among employees, because it is essential for employees to actively volunteer their time and to participate in charitable work to address local issues and needs if we are to build trust with local communities and grow together with them as a good corporate citizen.\n\n*1 STEAM: Acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics\n\n---\n\n**Social Contribution Activities**\n\n**Why**\n\nHitachi considers social contribution activities to be of importance in contributing to the sustainable development of both society and business.

It is people themselves who create innovation to solve social issues and bring about social impact and social good. Based on this belief, we have adopted the social contribution statement, \u201cNurturing People, Connecting to the Future,\u201d and are engaged in various activities in three areas: STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics), the environment, and community support.\n\nFunding for Social Contribution Activities and Number of Participating Employees\n\nHitachi and The Hitachi Global Foundation provided 1.8 billion yen funding toward social contribution activities worldwide, including initiatives to cultivate a talented younger generation and financial donations and other support for disaster-struck areas. A total of 33,585 Hitachi Group employees (around 9.6% of total employees) participated in social contribution activities. Due to the impact of the continuous spread of COVID-19, we are shifting to online events.\n\nBreakdown of Funding for Social Contribution Activities in Fiscal 2021\n\n- Human development (including 10.6% for STEAM): 27.4%\n- Environment: 1.9%\n- Community support: 15.8%\n- Other (including 7.7% for disaster relief): 54.9%\n\nFunding includes monetary and in-kind donations, independently organized programs, participation or dispatch of employees, community use of facilities, and employee donations; excludes personnel costs incurred from the participation or dispatch of employees.\n\nFunding for Social Contribution Activities*1 and Number of Employee Participations\n\n*1 Japan: Hitachi, Ltd., 103 Group companies, and the Hitachi Global Foundation.

We are actively working on a wide range of issues at global and local community levels and implementing programs to support development of next-generation leaders and science and engineering human capital.\n\nThe cultivation of talented IT professionals in particular is a global challenge, especially with the rapid development of information technology, such as AI and big data. In recent years, we have therefore been focusing on educational activities related to STEAM, which has gained attention as a tool for fostering human capital capable of utilizing cutting-edge technologies to enhance their creativity, expressivity, and problem-solving skills.\n\nFostering next-generation leaders in Asia through the Hitachi Young Leaders Initiative\n\nHitachi Ltd. and Hitachi Asia have been supporting the \u201cHitachi Young Leaders Initiative\u201d since 1996 with the aim of developing young leaders who will lead the next generation in Asia. A four-day program consisting of forums, workshops, and fieldwork are usually prepared for university and graduate students from seven ASEAN countries and Japan. Participants are to discuss and exchange opinions on social issues facing ASEAN and on the final day of the program, they make specific proposals for solving such social issues. As of the end of July 2022, a total of 405 program participants are each playing an active part in various fields such as international organizations, government, companies, and NPOs.\n\nSocial Contribution Scheme Enabling Hitachi and Its Employees to Make Donations Together (Matching Funds)\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the Hitachi Group introduced a social contribution scheme (matching funds) through which donations made by employees in response to disasters, accidents, disease outbreaks, and so on will be matched by the Group in full. This will serve to increase employee engagement in social contribution activities as well as promote the embodiment of the Hitachi Group corporate mission and further solidify the Hitachi Group identity. In fiscal 2021, Hitachi donated a total of approximately 77.2 million yen through the matching funds.\n\nDonations for Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine\n\nThe Hitachi Group donated 360 million yen to the Japanese Red Cross Society and the Japan Committee for UNICEF to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the situation in Ukraine and those who have fled to neighboring areas. In addition, the entire Hitachi Group made donations to Red Cross and UNICEF around the world, and World Central Kitchen through a scheme in which employees make donations and the company matches the amount. (Fiscal 2021 results: A total of approximately 63.7 million yen was donated for humanitarian aid to Ukraine through the matching funds)\nContributing to Society Through The Hitachi Global Foundation\n\nThe Hitachi Global Foundation was established in 2015 through the merger of five existing foundations, including one for supporting scientists and another for supporting the development of university lecturers in Southeast Asia. The Hitachi Global Foundation conducts social contribution activities centered on the three areas of \u201cpromotion of academic research, science, and technology,\u201d \u201chuman development,\u201d and \u201crealization of an inclusive society\u201d in accordance with the intention of Namihei Odaira, the founder of Hitachi, to contribute to society through business activities.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2021\n\nIn fiscal 2020, in the area of promotion of academic research, science, and technology, Hitachi responded to the issues created by the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing the Hitachi Fund Support for Research Related to Infectious Diseases with donations from Hitachi, Ltd., its executives and employees, and Group company executives. Five research projects have been selected for funding from the Fund, which has been providing research grants since fiscal 2021. The Hitachi Global Foundation\u2019s second Asia Innovation Award was also held in fiscal 2021, and the research findings of the award winners have been shared publicly.\n\nIn the area of human development, the Hitachi Future Innovator Program at elementary schools was conducted fully online.

To this end, we take the strengthening of corporate governance to be one of our most material management issues. We are working to develop and further strengthen our corporate governance system by such means as thoroughly separating management oversight from execution and establishing a system for prompt business execution.\n\nWhat\n\n- Implementing all of the principles of the Corporate Governance Code\n- Conducting board meetings in a way that sustainably enhances corporate value and shareholders\u2019 common interests\n- CEO appointment, dismissal, and succession plan\n- Determining appropriate compensation for directors and executive officers\n- Reflecting sustainability targets in the executive compensation evaluation\n- Implementing internal controls over financial reporting\n- Enhancing collaboration through tripartite audits\n- Building a more effective and efficient auditing system\n\nHow\n\nPolicy and promotion structure\n\nHitachi, Ltd. adopted its current committee system in 2003 and has established an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating Committee. Independent directors chair these committees and comprise the majority of the members. The company has also created a system that enables sufficient exercise of supervisory functions by separating the execution and supervision of business management.\n\nAdministrative performance of the Board of Directors\n\nTo formulate the Mid-term Management Plan 2024, the Board of Directors held numerous discussions between executive officers and directors on the plan\u2019s direction and priority issues.\n\nEnsuring legality, soundness, and transparency of Hitachi\u2019s business\n\nAnalyzed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nReviewing executive compensation systems\n\nIn addition to environmental targets such as decarbonization and resource efficiency, we introduced quantitative and qualitative target setting for occupational health and safety and product quality in the compensation evaluation of all executive officers.\n\nA restricted stock compensation unit system was introduced as compensation for non-Japanese executive officers and corporate officers, and the scope of the system was applied to executives at some Group companies.\nCorporate Governance\n\nHistory of Hitachi\u2019s Corporate Governance Reform\n\n| Activities | Year |\n|------------|------|\n| Introduction of Objective Perspective Management Advisory Committees | 1999 |\n| Demarcation of Management Oversight and Execution | 2003 |\n| Enforcement of Companies Act | 2006 |\n| Enhancement of Interactions with Capital Markets | 2010 |\n| Acceleration of Global Management | 2012 |\n| Development of Guidelines for Strengthening Governance | 2014 |\n| Development of Stewardship Code | 2015 |\n| Began Application of Corporate Governance Code | 2016 |\n| Enhanced Dissemination of Information about Medium- to Long-term Sustainability | 2019 |\n\nHitachi\u2019s Corporate Governance Framework and Features (as of July 2022)\n\n- **Structure**\n  - General Meeting of Shareholders\n  - Board of Directors\n  - Audit Committee\n  - Compensation Committee\n  - Nominating Committee\n  - President & CEO\n  - Executive Vice Presidents and Executive Officers\n  - Senior Executive Committee\n  - Executive Officers\n\n- **Activities**\n  - **POINT 1** Transparency in Management\n    - Transitioned to a company with committees (currently a company with a nominating committee, etc.) in 2003.\n    - Hitachi established the Nominating Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Audit Committee, with independent directors comprising the majority of members and serving as chairpersons. This system ensures transparency in management, separates the oversight and execution of management, facilitates the full exercise of oversight functions, and enables discussions and reports to be conducted appropriately within these three committees.\n  - **POINT 2** Independence of the Board of Directors\n    - Increased the number of independent directors, including non-Japanese directors, in 2012.\n    - The Board of Directors, which is chaired by an independent director, has 12 members, including nine independent directors, two directors who are also serving as executive officers, and one director who is not serving as an executive officer. The chairman of the Board is an independent director. In addition, we have established a system that facilitates the full exercise of oversight functions by maintaining a separation between management oversight and execution.\n  - **POINT 3** Enhanced Collaboration through Tripartite Auditing\n    - Hitachi\u2019s Audit Committee and internal audit sections collaborate with third-party accounting auditors to strengthen Tripartite Auditing aimed at increasing the effectiveness of internal controls.\nExperience, Knowledge and Capabilities Required for Directors\n\nHitachi Directors need to have a wide range of experience and knowledge in the

Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors approves basic management policy for the Hitachi Group and oversees the execution of the duties of executive officers and directors in order to sustainably enhance corporate value and the shareholders\u2019 common interests. The basic management policy includes the Mid-term Management Plan and annual budget compilation. The Board of Directors focuses on strategic issues related to the basic management policy, as well as other items to be resolved that are provided in laws, regulations, the Articles of Incorporation, and the Board of Directors Regulations.\n\nFiscal 2021 was a year in which we formulated the next Mid-term Management Plan, with the Board of Directors holding numerous discussions between executive officers and directors on the plan\u2019s direction and priority issues. At a Board meeting held in October 2021, then CEO Toshiaki Higashihara (currently Executive Chairman of the Board) provided a progress report on the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, facilitating a common understanding among directors regarding issues that need to be strengthened in the next Mid-term Management Plan. This process was aimed at sharing Hitachi\u2019s aspirations as a Company and examining specific plan details. In promoting the execution of management strategies, more time is spent discussing and deliberating than is used to explain quarterly financial reports and business strategies. As for GlobalLogic, which plays a major role in promoting Hitachi\u2019s digital strategy, the Board of Directors is informed of the post-acquisition PMI plan and progress, and the status of promotion is shared on a regular basis. In terms of environmental initiatives, a report on Hitachi\u2019s participation in COP26 and the revision of long-term environmental targets was provided, affirming Hitachi\u2019s efforts toward the environment including carbon neutrality.\n\nProviding Information to Independent Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors holds individual meetings and site visits to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and increase opportunities for information sharing. Site visits were conducted on a limited basis in fiscal 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but through online participation in the Hitachi Social Innovation Forum, attendance at Internal Business Conference and Research Presentation Meeting held at research institutes, we provided opportunities to deepen understanding of the business and engage in dialogue with senior management and front-line employees.\n\nActivities of the Three Committees\n\nNominating Committee\n\nThe Nominating Committee has the authority to determine proposals submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for the election and dismissal of directors. The Nominating Committee consists of four directors, three of whom are independent directors. This committee determines director candidates, holds preliminary discussions concerning the appointment and dismissal of the CEO and receives advance reports on the selection and dismissal of executive officers.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the Nominating Committee held meetings on 10 days.\n\nPrimary Activities\n\nIn addition to deciding upon the contents of proposals made concerning director appointments at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the Nominating Committee confirmed and deliberated proposals for CEO appointments.\nand confirmed receipt of a preliminary report on the executive officer system implemented in fiscal 2022. In addition, it promoted committee-related activities, including discussions and individual interviews aimed at developing candidates for future management and leadership positions.\n\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee has the authority to audit the execution of duties of directors and executive officers and to decide on proposals submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for the election and dismissal of accounting auditors. The Audit Committee currently consists of five directors, including four independent directors and one standing Audit Committee member.\n\nHiroaki Yoshihara, the chairman of the Audit Committee, has been involved in accounting and other business practices at the KPMG Group for many years and possesses a considerable wealth of knowledge concerning finance and accounting.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the Audit Committee held meetings on 15 days.\n\nPrimary Activities\nThe Audit Committee conducted activities that were focused on its priority matters for consideration, which included the strengthening of collaboration and the facilitation of information sharing under a \u201cTripartite Audit\u201d (audit by the Audit Committee, internal audit and audit by accounting auditors), and auditing of the establishment and operation of internal control systems from the perspective of risk management and validity of execution of duties. In addition, a standing committee member worked to obtain information as needed in a timely and accurate manner, mainly by collaborating with the Internal Auditing Office, among other departments, and attending important internal meetings such as the Senior Executive Committee, and facilitated information sharing with other committee members.\n\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to determine remuneration policies for directors and executive officers and remuneration for individuals (including amounts of remuneration) based on them. Currently composed of four directors, including three independent directors, the committee strives to ensure objectivity, transparency, and fairness in the remuneration determination process. In addition, the Compensation Committee verifies and reviews details of the process used for determining remuneration for individuals, including assessments concerning basic remuneration amounts, evaluations of progress made toward individual targets, and performance appraisals that are tied to short-term incentive compensation.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the Compensation Committee held meetings on five days.\n\nPrimary Activities\nThe Compensation Committee determined remuneration amounts for individual directors and executive officers in accordance with established policies while verifying and reviewing the processes and results of appraisals for performance and individual targets tied to short-term incentive compensation for executive officers.\n\nIn addition, the committee reviewed the executive compensation system while giving due consideration to compensation granted to managers at global companies and the goal of sharing value with shareholders, and decided upon policies covering remuneration for directors and executive officers in fiscal 2022.\n\nCEO Appointment, Dismissal, and Succession Plan\nAfter a preliminary report to the Nominating Committee, Hitachi\u2019s Board of Directors decides upon the appointment and dismissal of executive officers with the goal of constructing an optimal business execution system for management. As stipulated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our basic policy concerning the CEO requires that individuals serving in the position of CEO have extensive experience and achievements in the field of company management. They must also be considered optimally suited for conducting management aimed at achieving Hitachi\u2019s goals of continuously raising its corporate value and further serving the common interests of its shareholders. Decisions regarding the appointment or dismissal of the CEO shall be made based on prior deliberations and proposals by the Nominating Committee.\n\nRegarding our CEO Succession Plan, as the speed of change in the management environment accelerates, we are striving to build a system that enables us to appropriately and promptly secure and develop (both internally and globally) necessary management personnel who will provide leadership that will allow us to realize our growth strategies. Accordingly, we are also concentrating on providing training for selected employees while targeting the early development of candidates for future management positions. Moreover, we are developing next-generation leaders capable of acting authoritatively and resolutely by establishing forums where participants can discuss what is necessary for Hitachi\u2019s future growth and make recommendations to management.\nAnalysis and Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nHitachi evaluates the effectiveness of its Board of Directors each year in a continuous effort to maintain and improve its functions.\n\n**Fiscal 2021 Evaluation Process**\n\n1. Questionnaire-based self-assessment by each director (February\u2013March 2022)\n   - Composition: Diversity on the Board, the number and proportion of Inside and Outside directors, etc.\n   - Viability of responsibilities and roles of the Board\n   - Meeting operation: Meeting frequency, deliberation time, agenda setting, quality of deliberation, Chairman\u2019s role, etc.\n   - Contribution: Contribution to strategy building and change of company culture, contribution to constructive discussions, utilization of Director\u2019s knowledge and experience, discussions contribution to CEO succession plan, etc.\n   - Understanding of the Company: Hitachi Group Identity, risk factors, potential challenges and opportunities.\n   - Three committees: Composition, responsibilities and roles, coordination with the Board, etc.\n   - Supporting system for the Board: Provision of necessary information such as the Board materials, etc.\n\n2. Discussions among independent directors (March 2022)\n   - Independent directors had a meeting and discussed the Board effectiveness there referring to the Board\u2019s activities in each evaluation items set out in the above 1.\n\n3. Discussions at the Board meeting (May 2022)\n   - The Board analyzed and evaluated its effectiveness as a whole and confirmed the policy on approaches to further enhance the Board\u2019s effectiveness based on the results of the preceding process, considering comparison to the evaluation results of the previous year and measures taken for improving its effectiveness in fiscal 2022.\n\n**Evaluation Results and Future Initiatives**\n\n**Evaluation results**\n\n- The Board assessed that Board members are diverse and make use of their knowledge and expertise to speak out, having vigorous discussions especially on matters related to business strategies such as the Mid-term Management Plan targeting the medium- to long-term growth of corporate value. The Board concluded that the effectiveness of the Board as a whole is maintained.\n\n**Future initiatives**\n\n- Provide opportunities to freely discuss corporate culture and the overall future of the business portfolio to deepen discussions.\n- Discuss specific strategies including important themes (such as GX and DX) in each sector and BU to confirm consistency with the Mid-term Management Plan.\n- Post COVID-19, increase opportunities for meetings with BU CEOs and others and restart Independent Director visits to Group sites.\n- Further improve structure and content of materials for Board meetings and ensure provision of materials well in advance of meetings.\n\n**Policy regarding strategic shareholdings**\n\n**Policy on listed company strategic shareholdings**\n\nHitachi\u2019s basic policy is not to acquire or hold other companies\u2019 shares except in cases where acquiring or holding such shares is necessary in terms of transactions or business relationships. We will promote reducing shares already held unless significance of holding shares or economic rationale of holding are confirmed.\n\nThe Board of Directors verifies the appropriateness of all stock holdings every year. To this end, each individual stock was re-examined as to the purpose of holding the shares and whether benefits from holding shares are in line with target level of capital efficiency. As the result of verification, we promote the sales of shares for which significance of holding shares and economic rationale are not confirmed. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we reduced the number of shares held in 10 listed stocks (total amount sold: 47,750 million yen).\n\n**Strategic shareholding status**\n\n| Year | Number of stocks held*1 |\n|------|-------------------------|\n| 2012 | 396                     |\n| 2013 | 401                     |\n| 2014 | 375                     |\n| 2015 | 332                     |\n| 2016 | 309                     |\n| 2017 | 288                     |\n| 2018 | 272                     |\n| 2019 | 233                     |\n| 2020 | 217                     |\n| 2021 | 198                     |\n\n*1 Total of listed and unlisted shares\n\nTotal amount recorded on balance sheet *1 (Millions of yen)\n\n| Year | Total amount recorded on balance sheet *1 |\n|------|------------------------------------------|\n| 2012 | 244,181                                  |\n| 2013 | 353,957                                  |\n| 2014 | 334,617                                  |\n| 2015 | 239,993                                  |\n| 2016 | 324,323                                  |\n| 2017 | 270,336                                  |\n| 2018 | 179,668                                  |\n| 2019 | 141,859                                  |\n| 2020 | 201,055                                  |\n| 2021 | 274,470                                  |\n\n*1 Total of listed and unlisted shares\nDirector and Executive Officer Compensation\n\n**System**\n\n**Basic Policy**\n\n- Compensation shall be such that it enables the Company to attract necessary personnel to achieve an improvement in corporate value through global business growth.\n- Compensation shall be commensurate with the roles and responsibilities of each Director and Executive Officer.\n- Compensation for Directors shall be such that it enables them to the management oversight functions effectively.\n- Compensation for Executive Officers shall be such that it enables them to contribute to sustained improvement in corporate value through the execution of business and employs an appropriate balance between short-term performance and medium- and long-term performance.\n- The level of compensation shall be determined considering compensation levels at other companies as well as economic and market trends.\n- The Compensation Committee utilizes external experts to gain expert advice and an objective viewpoint, if necessary, for considering the details and amounts of compensation.\n\n**Compensation Structure**\n\n(1) **Directors**\n\nCompensation for Directors is basic remuneration as fixed pay. The amount of basic remuneration is decided by adjusting a basic amount to reflect fulltime or part-time status, committee membership and position, and travel from place of residence, etc. A Director concurrently serving as an Executive Officer is not paid compensation as a Director.\n\n(2) **Executive Officers**\n\nCompensation for Executive Officers consists of basic remuneration as fixed pay and short-term incentive compensation and medium- and long-term incentive compensation as variable pay.\n\nThe basic amount of basic remuneration, short-term incentive compensation and medium- and long-term incentive compensation is set based on the ratio of 1:1:1 as the standard, taking into account the composition of executive compensation for major global companies, in order to improve corporate value through the growth of global businesses. The higher the position an Executive Officer holds, the greater the proportion of variable pay is set to the total annual compensation.\n\nIf it is found that an executive officer has engaged in misconduct during their term of office, any compensation already paid shall be returned to the Company (clawback provision).\n\nPlease refer to Compensation to Directors and Executive Officers on page 96 of the Annual Securities Report (The 153rd Business Term)\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/IR-e/library/stock/hit_sr_fy2021_4_en.pdf\n\nReflecting Sustainability Targets in Executive Compensation Evaluation\n\n**System**\n\n**GRI 102-35/102-36**\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Hitachi introduced evaluations that take environmental value into consideration in the executive compensation system for the first time with the aim of accelerating the creation of environmental value. All executive officers, including the CEO, set targets for environmental value and were evaluated for their achievement of individual targets.\n\nFrom fiscal 2022, in addition to environmental targets such as decarbonization and resource efficiency, we introduced quantitative and qualitative target setting for occupational health and safety and product quality in the compensation evaluation of all executive officers to further advance sustainable management.\n\n**Examples of Sustainability Targets Reflected in Fiscal 2022 Compensation Evaluations**\n\n| Sustainability Targets | Decarbonization | Resource efficiency | Occupational health and safety | Product Quality |\n|------------------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|\n| Efforts to realize carbon neutrality*1 in business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030 | Efforts to achieve carbon neutrality*1 by fiscal 2050 throughout the value chain | Efforts related to resource efficiency | Zero fatal accidents | Efforts to enhance product quality |\n| Wellbeing initiatives | | | | |\n\n*1 Regarding fiscal 2030 and fiscal 2050 decarbonization targets, single-year targets are set Group-wide and for each BU.\nCompensation to Executive Officers (Fiscal 2022)\n\n1 Basic remuneration\nSet according to the relevant position by adjusting that amount to reflect financial results and individual performance.\n\n2 Short-term incentive compensation\nThe amount of short-term incentive compensation is decided within a range of 0 to 200% of a basic amount set according to the relevant position by adjusting that amount to reflect financial results and individual performance.\n\nFrom fiscal 2022, we are also working to further strengthen accountability by linking the achievement of KPIs, including sustainability indicators specified in the Mid-term Management Plan, to the performance evaluation of executive officers.\n\n3 Medium- and long-term incentive compensation\nShares of restricted stock were introduced in fiscal 2019 as compensation for Japanese executive officers and corporate officers (the executive positions next to Executive Officers) to promote management from a medium- and long-term perspective and to provide incentives to bring about a sustainable increase in enterprise value by further promoting senior management\u2019s shared values with shareholders through the holding of shares during their term of office. In fiscal 2020, a restricted stock compensation unit system was introduced as compensation for non-Japanese executive officers and corporate officers. In fiscal 2021, the scope of the restricted stock compensation unit system was expanded to executives at some Group companies.\n\nShares of restricted stock\n- The restriction on transfers shall be lifted if executive officers resign from all of the positions of the company\u2019s executive officer, director, and corporate officer.\n- With regard to one-half of the granted shares of restricted stock, the number of shares for which the transfer restriction is lifted shall be determined after ex-post evaluation. In the ex-post evaluation, the total shareholder return (TSR) of Hitachi stock over the three years from the beginning of the fiscal year when the medium- and long-term incentive compensation is granted is compared to growth rate of TOPIX over the same period.\n\n| TSR/TOPIX growth rate | Shares for which the transfer restrictions are lifted |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 120% or more          | Transfer restrictions are lifted for all granted shares. |\n| Between 80% or more but less than 120% | Transfer restrictions are lifted for part of granted shares*. |\n| Less than 80%         | No granted shares have transfer restrictions lifted. |\n\n*1 A system in which restricted stock compensation units are granted to the eligible persons, and over three years from the start of the business year in which the restricted stock compensation units were granted, one-third of the number of restricted stock compensation units granted is paid in each fiscal year that passes, as Hitachi stock or cash.\n\n*2 Number of shares for which the transfer restrictions are lifted = Number of granted shares \u00d7 (TSR/TOPIX Growth Rate Ratio + 1.25) \u2013 0.5\n\nShares whose transfer restrictions are not lifted shall be acquired by Hitachi without consideration.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nTo ensure the reliability of its consolidated financial reporting, the Hitachi Group is establishing and implementing relevant internal controls. We evaluate their effectiveness by adhering to standards for the evaluation of internal controls related to financial reporting that are generally accepted as fair and reasonable.\n\nFurthermore, we have established the J-SOX Committee with the goal of raising the effectiveness of these internal controls. This committee evaluates internal control effectiveness and establishes frameworks designed to improve and strengthen them.\n\nEnhanced Collaboration through Tripartite Audits\n\nIn pursuit of sustainable growth in corporate value, Hitachi\u2019s Audit Committee and internal audit section collaborate with third-party accounting auditors to strengthen its \u201cTripartite Auditing,\u201d which aims to increase the effectiveness of internal controls. The three parties communicate closely to share risk information and assessments concerning risk response while securing transparency and ensuring appropriate checks and balances.\n\nBuilding a More Effective and Efficient Auditing System\n\nAudit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee formulates audit plans in accordance with risk-based approaches and conducts audits for each consolidated business unit. Cooperating with the internal audit section audits, Audit Committee members meet directly with business unit heads. These members share concerns and issues related to the implementation of business strategies aimed at achieving sustainable growth that require attention with the internal audit section. At that time, the committee also verifies matters that carry high levels of risk in terms of quality, measuring these risks through employee awareness surveys and thorough implementation of business strategies.\n\nInternal Audit Section\n\nHitachi\u2019s internal audit section performs regular internal audits of each business unit, business division and subsidiary. This section reports directly to the President and is independent from organizations that are subject to its audits. The internal audit section also formulates audit plans based on past audit records and the most recent business circumstances. In addition, this section performs audits while sharing information with the Audit Committee, ensuring their effectiveness. The internal audit section at Hitachi is responsible for confirming the legality and appropriateness of all business operations, including those related to accounting, production management, sales, purchasing, IT systems, compliance, and human resources. Furthermore, acting on behalf of our management team, the internal audit section confirms whether employees are well versed in the ideas and policies of management, whether operations are being carried out based on these ideas and Policies, and whether business strategies are being implemented in a way that will efficiently lead to sustainable growth.\nAccounting Auditors\nAccounting auditors perform audits that focus on the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements. First, they adopt a risk-based approach in response to the group\u2019s overall financial status. Applying this approach, they then determine the scope and methods of the audit, formulate an audit plan, and share opinions with the Audit Committee. Next, based on the audit plan, they perform audits on each of the five sectors and the business units that comprise them, enabling effective and efficient understanding of data related to Hitachi\u2019s finance department and each of its business segments. If, during the auditing process, our accounting auditors discover a degree of risk that could impact future financial statements significantly or issues that, even if monetarily small, could have a large qualitative effect, they share related information regarding these risks and issues and the progress on a response from the related divisions with the Audit Committee and internal audit section. They also work to improve and raise the effectiveness of audits by submitting \u201cmanagement letters\u201d containing points of concern and improvement suggestions through the finance department. Recently, they have also been working to raise the efficiency of checks on the accuracy of numerical figures by using some IT systems to investigate all cases rather than performing test-checking through sampling.\n\nSector Corporate Auditor System\nTo further raise audit effectiveness, sector corporate auditors were assigned in each core business field (sector) in April 2019. Through this action, we expanded the internal control system spearheaded by chief auditors and enhanced collaboration with executive vice presidents managing each sector, as well as with the Audit Committee.\n\nAlthough sector corporate auditors do not act as organs under the Companies Act, they still assume responsibility for governance in each sector. Statutory auditors, which function as organs at Hitachi subsidiaries under the Companies Act, also report to sector corporate auditors and work to improve the effectiveness of Hitachi\u2019s internal control systems.\n\nIT Utilization\nWhen conducting business audits, we use IT systems to expeditiously search for reference information contained within materials submitted prior to audit in an attempt to improve efficiency. We are currently enhancing a system that will allow our internal audit section to share information with professional accounting auditors using a data lake. When reading audit reports submitted to the President by the internal audit section, the President must be able to quickly understand the issues identified by these reports and make prompt judgments concerning whether immediate action is required. In the future, our internal audit section will continue to maintain its transparency and independence while working to improve audit efficiency as one member of our Tripartite Audit system.\nBusiness Ethics and Compliance\n\nWhy\n\nWith the globalization of the economy, overarching regulations and differences in governmental and economic frameworks, the importance of building a culture based on ethics, honesty and integrity are key. Today more than ever, corporations are called upon to be ethical, fair and transparent in the way they do business. This obligation is rightly front and center in the minds of Hitachi\u2019s stakeholders. Additionally, with stricter regulations in countries and regions around the world regarding important business practices such as bribery prevention and adherence to competition laws, Hitachi has formulated in-house regulations in line with international standards and is sharing these regulations and enforcing strict compliance with them throughout the Group.\n\nWhat\n\n- Complying with Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct\n- Cultivating a Culture of Ethics and Compliance\n- Ethics and Compliance Risk Assessments\n- Enhancing the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline\n- Preventing bribery and corrupt practices\n- Complying with competition laws\n- Carrying out strict export controls\n- Implementing thorough tax compliance\n\nHow\n\nThe Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct (including the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance) spell out decision-making procedures and actions for all Hitachi Group executives and employees. To promote compliance, the Hitachi Group Head of Ethics and Compliance leads the One Hitachi Compliance Program, a program for global compliance initiatives. We work together with the Ethics and Compliance representatives, located in group companies around the globe, to streamline business ethics standards to drive efficiencies and the effectiveness of the One Hitachi Compliance Program.\n\nPolicy and promotion structure\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n\n- Complying with Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct\n  - Translated into multiple languages and shared with Hitachi Group executive officers and employees around the world.\n\n- Cultivating a Culture of Ethics and Compliance\n  - Set a global target to measure and improve Hitachi\u2019s ethical culture.\n  - Conducted ethics and compliance training for all executive officers and employees. (Participation rate: 99.1% in the Hitachi Group globally)\n  - Joined Ethisphere\u2019s Business Ethics Leadership Alliance.\n\n- Enhancing the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline\n  - Received 1,023 reports from all Group companies worldwide.\n\n- Implement prevention of bribery and corrupt practices and compliance with competition law\n  - Established Standards for the Value Limits and Frequency of Entertainment and Gifts Applicable to Commercial Parties and revised the Approval Procedures on Donation Expenditures.\n  - Revised guidelines for preventing cartel activity.\nBusiness Ethics and Compliance\n\nDoing Business Ethically, Honestly and Transparently\n\nHitachi counts on employees \u2013 including supervisors, managers, leaders \u2013 and business partners to know and follow the ethical, legal, and policy requirements that apply to their jobs and for reporting any suspected violations of law or the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct (including the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance; the same shall apply hereinafter) to help Hitachi create a work environment where everyone is empowered to speak up, and to perform at the highest standards. This is fundamental to consistently delivering excellence to our stakeholders, while complying with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nOur focus on business ethics makes Hitachi stronger. It helps us attract, retain, and engage the best employees and select the right business partners. It protects our reputation and relationships with stakeholders. It helps us deliver on our Mission, Values and Vision\u2014the Hitachi Group Identity.\n\nAlthough the Compliance Division of Hitachi, Ltd. oversees the One Hitachi Compliance Program, which is a group-wide initiative to enhance compliance, doing what is right is everyone\u2019s responsibility.\n\nAdditionally, we have formulated the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines in which we request our procurement partners to share our commitment to doing business with the highest levels of ethics and integrity and complying with applicable laws and regulations, as well as to share our commitment to human rights.\n\nComplying with the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct\n\nHitachi has formulated the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, which all executives and employees across the entire Group pledge to uphold. The Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct is translated into more than 15 languages from Japanese and shared with Hitachi Group executive officers and employees around the world.\n\nThe Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct explains our standards as well as our legal and ethical responsibilities and provides guidance for expected behaviors. It covers a range of topics such as business ethics, conflicts of interest, fair competition, sustainability, human rights and care for our communities.\n\nThe Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct is posted on Group company intranet sites and the Hitachi, Ltd. website to ensure that it is known and practiced by all officers, employees and relevant stakeholders.\n\nThe Compliance Division will review annually the Codes to ensure its effectiveness and that legislative and regulatory updates as well as change in social conditions are reflected.\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nCultivating a Culture of Ethics and Compliance\n\n**Target**\nAt Hitachi, we encourage employees to apply high ethical standards in their day-to-day work as we strive to build a highly ethical corporate culture. To measure and improve Hitachi\u2019s ethical culture, as part of the initiatives of the Ethisphere\u2019s Business Ethics Leadership Alliance, we started conducting Ethisphere\u2019s best-in-class the Ethical Culture & Perceptions Assessment in fiscal 2022 and 2023. The results of this assessment will be monitored and used to develop tailored KPIs to improve Hitachi\u2019s ethical culture. We aim to achieve a baseline score of 60 or above (out of 100) in fiscal 2022, the first year, and to improve the score in fiscal 2023 and each year thereafter.\n\n**Activities**\nThe global ethics and compliance team develops and implements strategy and initiatives to drive an ethical culture throughout Hitachi\u2019s 800+ Group companies. This is part of Hitachi\u2019s effort to provide all employees with guidelines and resources that ensure they can understand and do what is right, make ethical decisions, and support compliance with company policies, procedures, and legal requirements.\n\n**Business Ethics and Compliance Training**\nOur annual ethics training on the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct reinforces Hitachi\u2019s commitment to business ethics and keeps all executive officers and employees (including part-time) informed and updated on our high ethical standards and obligations.\n\n**Achievements in Fiscal 2021**\nOur fiscal 2021 training course covered business ethics, bribery and corruption, gifts, travel and entertainment, anti-money laundering laws, fraud, antisocial forces, fair competition, export control, company assets, information owned by others, data protection, conflicts of interest, reporting and non-retaliation and Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline.\n\nAfter completing the training, employees acknowledge that they understand and agree to comply with the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct and ethics-related policies and protocols.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we reached 99.1% completion of our annual ethics and compliance training.\n\n**Ethisphere\u2019s Business Ethics Leadership Alliance**\nHitachi became a member of Ethisphere\u2019s Business Ethics Leadership Alliance in October 2021. The Business Ethics Leadership Alliance (BELA) is a globally recognized organization leading companies collaborating to share best practices in governance, risk management and ethics. Hitachi receives access to the BELA Member Hub, a repository of resources provided by BELA companies that are intended to cultivate the exchange of ideas and inspire companies.\n\n**Ethics and Compliance Risk Assessments**\n\n**Activities**\nHitachi conducts ongoing and comprehensive risk assessments including risks of bribery and corruption practices at our Group companies every three to four years to help assure that Hitachi\u2019s Compliance Program effectively mitigates and manages top risks. In cases where these reviews identify necessary improvements, corrective measures are developed and implemented.\n\n**Due Diligence of Third Parties**\nFrom fiscal 2017, Hitachi Group has implemented a compliance due diligence program including the introduction of a third-party management system to identify reputational risks associated with bribery, corruption and other factors. This has prevented Hitachi from engaging with parties that have acted or are likely to act in a manner inconsistent with Hitachi\u2019s ethical culture.\n\n**Strengthening our Speak-up Culture**\nHitachi believes that a speak up/listen up culture\u2014where employees are encouraged to raise concerns and feel confident that they can do so without fear of retaliation\u2014is essential to early detection and prevention of ethical and regulatory problems.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring our employees feel safe to speak up, to share ideas, and to challenge how business is conducted without fear of retaliation. Employees may raise concerns and ask questions through their managers, a next-level manager or any other manager, Human Resources, Compliance or Legal team members, or using the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline, our whistleblower system.\nWe encourage employees to seek guidance on ethics and business conduct questions and report possible violations of the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, company policy or the law.\n\n**Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline (Whistleblower System)**\n\nThe Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline is a 24/7, confidential and anonymous helpline and online reporting system. It is managed by an independent third party and is available to all Hitachi Group employees, contractors, business partners (including procurement partners) and other stakeholders who can seek guidance on ethics questions including human rights and harassment issues and report any concerns or actual or suspected breach of the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct or any other improper or illegal conduct. Breaches of the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct by any of Hitachi\u2019s contracted third parties may also be reported.\n\nPhone numbers for the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline are available for all employees to speak to a representative in their native language. The phone lines are staffed by specially trained third-party representatives, with translators in more than 50 languages. Web-based reporting is also available to employees. Data supplied in a report is maintained on secure servers maintained by the third party who administers the hotline.\n\nTo efficiently address and resolve contacts to the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline, we assign inquiries to a resource who is a subject matter expert. After a confidential review of the concern, the investigator determines which reports require an investigation. If an investigation is needed, an appropriate investigative resource is assigned. For concerns that are substantiated, disciplinary actions may be taken. Discipline comes in many forms from warnings to suspensions to termination.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we received 1,023 reports from all Group companies worldwide.\n\n### Categories\n\n| Areas where whistleblowing cases occurred | 1 HR issues (Labor management, travel expenses, commuting costs, etc.) | 2 Harassment | 3 Financial | 4 Procurement | 5 Competition law | 6 Bribery | 7 Others | Total |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|------------------|----------|---------|-------|\n| Americas                                | 64                                              | 104         | 3          | 6            | \u2014                | 3        | 58      | 238   |\n| Europe (Including CIS)                  | 26                                              | 12          | \u2014          | 2            | \u2014                | 4        | 54      | 98    |\n| Middle East North Africa                | 16                                              | 4           | \u2014          | \u2014            | 1                | 1        | 32      | 54    |\n| Sub-Sahara                              | 1                                               | \u2014           | 2          | 4            | 1                | \u2014        | 5       | 13    |\n| APAC (excluding Japan)                  | 50                                              | 42          | 15         | 10           | 1                | 22       | 94      | 234   |\n| Japan                                   | 69                                              | 179         | 7          | 4            | \u2014                | \u2014        | 127     | 386   |\n| **Total**                               | **226**                                         | **341**     | **27**     | **26**       | **3**            | **30**   | **370** | **1,023** |\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\nAnti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption\n\nWe require all employees and those with whom we do business to maintain the highest ethical standards in full compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws. We have zero-tolerance for bribes, kickbacks or any other illegal business practices.\n\nHitachi has established the Hitachi Group Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, with associated rules, and clarified the standards and procedures concerning entertainment, gifts, and other arrangements provided to or received from public officials and non-public officials alike.\n\nUnder the Policy, when providing or accepting entertainment or gifts, or making donations or political contributions, executive officers and employees must not exceed the scope of actions permitted by anti-bribery laws and regulations and must comply with Hitachi\u2019s internal rules. These indicate specific spending limits in terms of monetary value and the number of times that entertainment, gifts, and other arrangements may be provided to public officials. We also have policies banning facilitation payments and requiring due diligence procedures for business partners. With anti-corruption regulations growing stricter in recent years around the globe, we work hard to ensure that we remain in strict compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and all other relevant laws and regulations in the countries and regions where we do business.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2021\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we established the Standards for the Value Limits and Frequency of Entertainment and Gifts, applicable to Commercial Parties regarding Hitachi Group Gifts, Travel and Entertainment Protocol and revised the guidelines for the Hitachi Group Charitable Donations and Political Contributions Protocol. The revised guidelines include, the prohibition of donations for illegal profit acquisition and periodic risk assessments of the existing beneficiary based on a risk-based approach.\n\nBy doing business in accordance with such Protocols, Hitachi will develop fair and ethical business activities around the world.\n\nEducational Activities for Preventing Bribery and Corrupt Practices\n\nTo ensure awareness of the stipulations on prevention of bribery and corruption speeded out in the internal Hitachi Group Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and Business Conduct, we offer teaching materials for use by Group companies worldwide.\n\nFair Competition\n\nHitachi engages in business in accordance with the law and with business ethics, and practicing fair and open competition. Business standards and guidelines related to these principles are included in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct as well as the internal Hitachi Group Fair Competition Policy. In fiscal 2021, we revised the guidelines for preventing cartel activity and improved the relevant forms based on the revised guidelines.\n\nEducational Activities for Preventing Violations of Competition Law\n\nParalleling our initiatives to prevent bribery and corrupt practices, we are also rolling out global learning and development programs on competition law, while also ensuring compliance with all related rules, business standards, and guidelines. To enhance awareness of ethical principles and practices worldwide, we have issued a global version of our standards on contact with competitors.\nPrevention of Antisocial Transactions and Money Laundering\n\n**Approach**\n\nTo cut off all relationships with antisocial forces, in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, we have laid out provisions stating that we will never engage in antisocial transactions under any circumstances, and will refuse any improper demands and unfair deals. We conduct eligibility checks on all new as well as existing business partners. In Japan, we insert antisocial-force rejection clauses in contracts so that if it is determined that a business partner belongs to an antisocial force, we can promptly void the contract and end the relationship. The entire Hitachi Group acts decisively to eliminate approaches from antisocial forces in partnership with external specialist institutions (the National Center for Removal of Criminal Organizations or the police).\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we revised our rules, adding provisions on the prevention of money laundering in addition to the prevention of antisocial transactions, seeking to clarify Hitachi\u2019s stance of not tolerating money laundering as well as to strengthen concrete initiatives. We establish these concrete initiatives to eliminate the possibility of involvement with persons or organizations engaged in money laundering or other illegal activities in and outside Japan. To that end, we conduct due diligence on all customers and business partners, including checking the sanctions lists of each country, checking payment details, and including clauses in business contracts to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\n**Activities**\n\nFor basic export control policies, we have adopted The Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, which states: \u201cWe will help maintain international peace and security through compliance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning import and export, and will operate appropriately according to our internal rules and policies.\u201d Hitachi, Ltd. has established Corporate Regulations concerning Security Export Control based on this policy to ensure implementation of strict export control practices in line with relevant laws and regulations, screening all goods and technologies intended for export against such factors as destination countries and regions as well as intended end use and end users. We provide guidance and educational support for the formulation of regulations and the establishment of frameworks to Hitachi Group companies to ensure that all Group companies follow the same export control policies in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nAs part of our educational program for all Group companies, we operate online courses and e-learning programs on export controls. We operate a basic e-learning program in 14 languages and an e-learning program for practitioners in Japanese and English. Hitachi is working to ensure that export controls are thoroughly enforced throughout the Group.\n\n**Export Controls**\n\n**Approach**\n\nFor basic export control policies, we have adopted The Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, which states: \u201cWe will help maintain international peace and security through compliance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning import and export, and will operate appropriately according to our internal rules and policies.\u201d Hitachi, Ltd. has established Corporate Regulations concerning Security Export Control based on this policy to ensure implementation of strict export control practices in line with relevant laws and regulations, screening all goods and technologies intended for export against such factors as destination countries and regions as well as intended end use and end users.

We operate a basic e-learning program in 14 languages and an e-learning program for practitioners in Japanese and English. Hitachi is working to ensure that export controls are thoroughly enforced throughout the Group.\n\n**Hitachi\u2019s Tax Compliance Approach**\n\n**Approach**\n\nUnder the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Hitachi has built a system of tax governance designed to address tax risks associated with the globalization of its business, such as indications made by the tax authorities and tax-related legal proceedings in each country. Specifically, we have established tax-related rules for the purposes listed below.\n\nTo ensure thorough compliance with these rules, we are striving to raise awareness of them among all employees involved in tax management (filing and paying taxes, handling tax audits, and managing tax risk) and the handling of other tax-related matters.\n\n1. Group companies strictly comply with all relevant laws and implement tax management when pursuing their business activities, bearing in mind such international tax-compliance standards as the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as that body\u2019s Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).\n\n2. Group companies effectively, continually, and proactively manage tax-related issues in a manner befitting their status as socially responsible organizations, while maintaining Hitachi brand value and seeking to maximize shareholder value.\n\n3. Group companies build sincere and positive relations of trust with the tax authorities in the regions where these companies do business, and strive to maintain and develop those relations.\n\nIn accordance with these rules, we have established rules on transfer pricing management for Group companies, seeking to identify and mitigate potential taxation risks related to transfer pricing in transactions with foreign-affiliated parties, and to help ensure compliance. As stated above, we are striving to raise awareness of these rules and ensure that they are followed.\nGovernance\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nBusiness Ethics and Compliance\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\u2013 Business Ethics and Compliance\n\nRisk Management\n\nInformation Management\n\nGovernance Data\n\nTax Compliance Initiatives\n\nActivities\n\nBy following the relevant tax-related rules applicable to the Group as a whole, Hitachi manages tax risks associated with globalization. For example, we are strengthening our risk management as well as compliance with laws and regulations by identifying and sharing indications made by the tax authorities and tax-related legal proceedings in each country. The results of our tax filings and tax audits in Japan are reported to the CFO, and we are continuously working to ensure appropriate tax reporting and prevent fraud. In preparing tax filings, we determine whether anti-tax haven legislation applies, and when it does, we reflect it properly in the tax filing to ensure that we make appropriate tax payments.\n\nHitachi follows rules for transfer pricing management and also manages transfer pricing in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the laws and regulations on transfer pricing in each country or region where Group companies are located.\n\nIn the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we paid 248.4 billion yen*\u00b9 in corporate income tax (68% in Japan and 32% outside Japan*\u00b2).\n\n*\u00b9 Refer to income taxes paid in consolidated statements of cash flows of Hitachi, Ltd.\n\n*\u00b2 Based on the percentage in the country-by-country report submitted to tax authorities.\n\nViolations of Laws and Regulation\n\nActivities\n\nGRI 205-3/206-1/419-1\n\nIn fiscal 2021, there were no incidents in which Hitachi was prosecuted or penalized by authorities for bribery, corrupt practices, competition law or export control. Regarding tax compliance, Hitachi acts in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and did not receive any significant fines or nonmonetary sanctions for noncompliance with tax laws and regulations in fiscal 2021.\nSocial issues, including rapid advancements in digitalization and complex changes in political and economic situations occurring worldwide, along with environmental issues, including climate change, resource depletion, and major disasters, are bringing changes to the business environment that are difficult to predict. Hitachi monitors and analyzes this business environment, conducts risk management in terms of both responding to risks that should be anticipated and opportunities for further growth in light of social issues, Hitachi\u2019s competitive advantage and management resources, and strives to create revenue opportunities while controlling risks.\n\nIn April 2022, a Risk Management Meeting that deliberates important matters related to Hitachi management was established within the Senior Executive Committee. Chaired by the CEO with the Chief Risk Management Officer (CRMO) as vice chair, the meeting discusses and makes decisions on important matters relating to companywide risks. By centrally managing the various risks faced by Hitachi, which has operations around the world, we are working to achieve a solid management foundation that is linked to growth strategy.\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n\n- Strengthened risk management systems\n- Established a Risk Management Meeting that deliberates important matters related to Hitachi management within the Senior Executive Committee and selected top risks based on global risk trends\n- Set up six risk-specific working groups under the Risk Management Meeting: investment risks, business risks, crisis management, compliance, Group governance and regional risks, and each WG coordinates Group corporate functions across the organization while conducting activities to mitigate the respective risks\n- Assessed and appropriately responded to risks and opportunities related to investments (e.g., M&A, sale of assets, orders for projects) and assets held on the group\u2019s consolidated balance sheet\n- Implemented crisis and compliance management initiatives\n- Disclosed climate-related information based on the TCFD recommendations\nGovernance\n\nAchievements in FY 2021\n\n- Strengthening Business Continuity Plans (BCPs)\n- Improving the safety of employees sent to dangerous regions\n\nTo increase preparedness for major disasters and other risks across the entire Group worldwide, we have issued the Hitachi Group Guidelines for Developing Business Continuity Plans. We are strengthening our measures against COVID-19 and natural disasters as part of Pandemic and Natural Disaster BCPs, and the procurement divisions in business units and key Group companies in Japan have created procurement BCPs to minimize the impact of disasters that may occur.\n\n- Under the COVID-19 task force\u2019s leadership, our regional headquarters around the world gathered local information as well as share information on the measures taken by Hitachi Group companies in their respective regions.\n- Conducted an earthquake drill on the assumption that there is a mix of those who come to the office and those who work from home.\n- Expanded the number of business sites utilizing the Procurement BCPs Management System for our procurement partners in Japan and to digitize information.\n- Provided medical assistance for Hitachi Group employees outside Japan.\nAddressing Risks and Opportunities\n\nWith the rapid advance of digitalization and complex developments in the political and economic landscape globally, the business environment is changing day by day. Hitachi monitors and analyzes this business environment, conducts risk management in terms of both responding to risks that should be anticipated and opportunities for further growth in light of social issues, Hitachi\u2019s competitive advantage and management resources, and strives to create revenue opportunities while controlling risks.\n\nStrengthening of the Risk Management Structure and Its Aims\n\nIn April 2022, a Risk Management Meeting that deliberates important matters related to Hitachi management was established within the Senior Executive Committee. Chaired by the CEO with the Chief Risk Management Officer (CRMO) as vice chair, the meeting discusses and makes decisions on important matters relating to company-wide risks. By centrally managing the various risks faced by Hitachi, which has operations around the world, we are working to achieve a solid management foundation that is linked to growth strategy.\n\nSix risk-specific working groups have been set up under the Risk Management Meeting, investment risks, business risks, crisis management, compliance, group governance and regional risks. Each working group coordinates Group corporate functions across the organization while conducting activities to mitigate the respective risks.\n\nFor example, the Business Risks Working Group discusses risks and responses in the global supply chain. Since control of consolidated management is important for Hitachi as a group made up of more than 800 companies, we must also develop plans to disseminate and manage guidelines and policies. This is an area the Group Governance Working Group will discuss going forward. Addressing regional risks in an effort to review the roles of local subsidiaries and achieve overall optimization at global sites, we will ensure that Hitachi\u2019s assets are utilized effectively.\n\nInitiatives about investment risks, crisis management and compliance are introduced on the following pages.\n\nSelecting Top Risks based on Global Risk Trends\n\nIn the Mid-term Management Plan 2024, we are utilizing knowledge from inside and outside the Group to collect and analyze information on the external environment surrounding Hitachi and select top risks through the Risk Management Meeting.\n\nSpecifically, we have organized major risks under classifications such as disasters, accidents and epidemics; geopolitics and geoeconomics; economics, finance and markets; sustainability; investment and orders for projects; and operations. We then assess and narrow down the risks from the perspectives of the nature of risk events, expected time period, likelihood of occurrence and seriousness when occurring, and select the top risks, such as the risk of a major natural disaster in Japan that may significantly impact Hitachi\u2019s business. The six working groups consider and implement policies to respond to each of the top risks.\nAddressing Investment Risks and Opportunities\n\nTo ascertain and appropriately respond to risks and opportunities related to investments (e.g., M&A, sale of assets, orders for projects), Hitachi has established a decision-making framework based on the following flowchart. Decision-making regarding individual investments (e.g., execution, business plan changes) is delegated from the Board of Directors as the highest level body to the head office Senior Executive Committee (which generally meets twice a month) or the relevant sector or business unit, based on the size and specifics of the matter. This facilitates flexible and appropriate decision-making. For important matters that fall under deliberation by the head office Senior Executive Committee, the Investment Strategy Committee working as its advisory body checks the risks, response measures for the matter from economic value perspectives such as profitability and cash flow as well as in terms of the impact on social value and environmental value. Following deliberation, the Investment Strategy Committee delivers a report that includes approval or rejection recommendations to the Senior Executive Committee, of which the CEO is also a member.\n\nAfter executing an investment, Hitachi regularly monitors the achievement of business objectives and plan while taking into account changes to the risk climate including the external environment. By generally having monitoring performed by the relevant business units, which are accountable for profits and closely associated with field operations, flexibility can be maintained, while head office can still become involved depending on the importance of the matter. For changes to business plans, business withdrawals, asset sales and other matters related to important investment targets, the head office Senior Executive Committee engages in similar deliberations to the initial investment stage. For investment targets whose business is not proceeding as planned, a framework has been established to deliberate the merits of continuing a business, including the prospects of withdrawal, in an effort to enhance capital efficiency.\n\nQuantitative Understanding of Risks\n\nHitachi calculates expected maximum risks (Value at Risk) assumed by statistical methods according to the type of assets held on the group\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. We avoid missing out on growth opportunities by visualizing the capacity for growth investment, etc., considering consolidated net assets and other factors. We also engage in monitoring and hold discussions through the Risk Management Meeting to ensure that risks are not excessively unbalanced compared to Hitachi\u2019s consolidated financial strength.\n\nWe also quantitatively analyze and understand the state of risks and profitability on a regional and per-sector basis.\nCrisis Management Initiatives\n\nBased on the selected top risks, the Crisis Management Working Group promotes the development of response measures, including crisis management structures, for each risk. By making preparations under normal conditions, we have put systems in place to respond swiftly in the event a risk does materialize.\n\nCompliance Initiatives\n\nThe Compliance Working Group is made up of members from the Compliance Division, Sustainability Promotion Division, Corporate Quality Assurance Group and Safety and Health Management Division.\n\nFor major compliance-related risks falling under business ethics and compliance, environmental compliance, quality compliance, and health and safety (fatal and serious incidents, etc.), information on the measures implemented by each department under regular conditions (development of regulations, training, monitoring, audits, etc.) and the response methods implemented in the event of an emergency (communication with internal and external stakeholders including top management when a major risk has materialized, etc.) are linked and shared amongst member of the Working Group as management methods for the different risk areas. By pursuing a greater level of global collaboration, we will strive to raise the level of risk management in each field and mitigate various risks.\n\nSafety-First Risk Management\n\nThree Hitachi Group companies, namely GlobalLogic, Hitachi Energy and Hitachi Vantara have sites in Ukraine. The safety and health of our employees and their families is the highest priority for the Hitachi Group. GlobalLogic, which has an engineering site in Ukraine, has approximately 7,500 employees (as of May 31, 2022). Based on the business continuity plan, top priority has been given to the safety of the site\u2019s employees and their families, and measures were taken to evacuate them to safe locations in Ukraine or out of the country. The company is now returning to normal operations with an operating rate of 96% as of May, and is working to maintain business continuity while ensuring safety.\nBusiness Continuation Initiatives\n\nApproach on Business Continuity Plans (BCPs)\n\n**Approach**\n\nGiven the close relationship of our business to social infrastructure, we are enhancing our BCPs to ensure that the impact of risks does not disrupt our business and thereby significantly affect society. The Hitachi Group Guidelines for Developing Business Continuity Plans (Overview) and the Hitachi Group Guidelines for Developing Business Continuity Plans (By Department) were issued in Japanese and then translated into English and Chinese for distribution to all Hitachi Group companies to enhance preparedness for major disasters and other risks.\n\nRegarding infectious diseases, we released the Hitachi Group Guidelines for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness in Japanese, English, and Chinese. In fiscal 2021, they served as a useful tool in dealing with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nWe have also appointed personnel with responsibility for risk-response policies at our main overseas bases. Around 300 Group companies outside Japan prepared BCPs to strengthen their ability to respond to business risks including major disasters, infectious diseases, political instability, social disruption, and acts of terrorism. We will reflect in our BCPs the current environment of significantly more people working from home and the experienced gained in the course of recent COVID-19 measures.\n\n**Formulation of BCPs**\n\nSince fiscal 2011, Hitachi, Ltd. and its Group companies in Japan have formulated BCPs for each business in preparation for major earthquakes, wind and flood damage, and novel strains of influenza. Each business unit regularly reviews its BCP and revises it as necessary to reflect the latest risk assessment results. Group companies outside Japan have formulated BCPs in light of risks of concern in their respective locations.\n\nFrom fiscal 2022, we will strengthen our BCPs especially for infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and for mega-earthquakes.\n\n**Pandemic and Natural Disaster BCPs Initiatives**\n\n**Activities**\n\nA COVID-19 task force, headed by the President & CEO of Hitachi, Ltd., was established at Group headquarters to provide instructions on preventive measures to Group companies. Similarly, each Group company formed its own task force to secure the safety of its employees and business continuity while helping to maintain the social infrastructure through their business operations. Our regional headquarters around the world gather local information as well as share information on the measures taken by Hitachi Group companies in their respective regions.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. is also strengthening its measures against natural disasters by conducting annual earthquake drills, which simulate a major seismic event. In fiscal 2017, we developed action plans including setting up substitute headquarters in the Kansai region in case our Tokyo headquarters temporarily ceases to function. From fiscal 2019 we have conducted drills that assume remote work. In such ways, we are making sure that our efforts are in line with reality.\n\n**Drill Simulating Earthquake Measures**\n\n| Year | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| FY 2018 | Initial response drills simulating a major earthquake in the suburbs of Tokyo |\n| FY 2019 | Drills to set up a substitute headquarters in the Kansai region in case our Tokyo headquarters temporarily ceases to function |\n| FY 2020 | Drills to set up an earthquake task force on a remote-work basis on the assumption that a major seismic event had occurred on a holiday, shutting down traffic |\n| FY 2021 | Drills to set up an earthquake task force on a remote-work basis on the assumption that all work must be conducted remotely |\n| FY 2021 | Remote drills using a Web conferencing system on the assumption that not everyone can assemble at the office on weekdays and that there is a mix of those who come to the office and those who work from home |\nProcurement BCPs Initiatives\n\n**Approach**\n\nHitachi is also working to enhance BCPs for procurement across Group companies worldwide so that the occurrence of incidents* does not disrupt business and have a significant impact on society.\n\nTo minimize the impact of disasters that may occur, the procurement divisions in business units and key Group companies in Japan do the following: (1) standardize and use generic parts to make procurement as flexible as possible; (2) cultivate multiple suppliers; (3) distribute production across several locations; (4) budget inventory strategically; and (5) consider and promote substitute products.\n\nWe also hold desktop exercises to check the effectiveness of procurement BCPs against earthquakes and to make further improvements hold group discussions about what should be done during and after such disasters.\n\nWe share these activities with procurement divisions in business units and key Group companies outside Japan as appropriate, making use of them in reviewing strategies in an effort to enhance procurement BCPs throughout the Group worldwide.\n\n* Incidents: Events that interrupt business operations, such as major earthquakes and other natural disasters\n\n**Activities**\n\nIn January 2020, we introduced the Procurement BCPs Management System for our procurement partners in Japan to efficiently share information among Hitachi Group companies during disasters.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we worked to expand the number of business sites utilizing the system and to digitize information to help shorten recovery time.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2021\n\nIn January 2020, we introduced the Procurement BCPs Management System for our procurement partners in Japan to efficiently share information among Hitachi Group companies during disasters.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we worked to expand the number of business sites utilizing the system and to digitize information to help shorten recovery time.\n\nImproving Safety for Employees Sent to Dangerous Regions\n\nWhen sending employees to countries and areas at high risk of conflicts, terrorism, and other threats, we take all possible measures to ensure their safety. On-site surveys are also conducted by in-house and outside experts beforehand.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. is also contributing to safety measures at other Japanese corporations operating outside Japan. To help enhance collaboration between the private and public sectors in this area, we participate in the Council for Public-Private Cooperation for Overseas Safety organized by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2021\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Hitachi, Ltd. undertook a range of measures to ensure the safety of its employees working around the globe. These included the timely provision of information by alerts on conflicts occurring around the world and also the COVID-19 pandemic as well as information from outside risk consultants contracted by Hitachi, Ltd. posted on its intranet. In addition, the company employed an outside specialist to provide medical assistance to Hitachi Group employees outside Japan.\nEven as the development of IoT creates new value, cyberattacks are growing increasingly sophisticated and widening in focus from traditional IT to encompass the IoT/OT field as well. The risks for corporations include leaks of information, operational stoppages, and even direct disruption to business, making information security one of the most critical issues companies face. Hitachi, in expanding its Social Innovation Business worldwide, has highlighted the importance of working to ensure cybersecurity as a key management issue and is engaged in information security governance efforts.\n\nAlso, amid rapidly expanding data use with the development of digital technologies, privacy risks are increasing as well. In working to provide a safe and secure social infrastructure system, Hitachi is prioritizing personal information protection efforts in order to realize the secure management of personal information entrusted to us by our customers, personal information related to business operations, and more.\n\n**Information Security**\n\n**Why**\n\nWhy it matters\n\nEven as the development of IoT creates new value, cyberattacks are growing increasingly sophisticated and widening in focus from traditional IT to encompass the IoT/OT field as well.

Accordingly, we have formulated Information Security Policy in line with our corporate management policies and based on our cyber security risk management.\n\nWe have our data centers and other divisions certified by the ISMS Accreditation Center in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System international standard. This certification has been received by seven divisions of Hitachi, Ltd. and 27 divisions of 23 Group companies.*\u00b9\n\nAt Hitachi, Ltd., the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who is the C-level executive with ultimate authority and responsibility regarding the handling of information security and personal privacy issues, oversees the promotion of information security for all Hitachi products, services, and internal facilities.\n\nChaired by the CISO, the Information Security Committee determines all policies and procedures for information security and personal information protection. Business Units (BU) and business sites establish information security promotion divisions, with the heads of the units and sites serving as information security officers. These divisions work to implement information security management in each workplace and provide relevant education to employees.

Education and training\n5. Preventing incidents and taking action when they occur\n6. Ensuring business processes are optimized within the corporate group\n\n*\u00b9 As of September 30, 2021.\nInformation Security Management\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi has established information security management based on ISO/IEC 27001 and has been working to strengthen information security by reviewing regulations with the U.S. government standards SP800-171 due to the intensifying cyberattacks in recent years. These rules are globally distributed by Hitachi, Ltd. and its Group companies. Other measures include actively promoting the use of shared security services and related support for information security provided by regional headquarters in the Americas, Europe, Southeast Asia, China, and India.\n\nThe Information Security Promotion Council and other bodies convey policies and procedures for information security and personal information protection determined by the Information Security Committee internally and to other companies in the Hitachi Group. Information security officers at business sites and Group companies ensure that these decisions are implemented in the workplace.\n\nDetails of our information security initiatives are contained in our Information Security Report.\n\nAchievements in Fiscal 2021\n\nAs Hitachi promotes new workstyles based on telecommuting, the vulnerability posed by employees\u2019 security awareness becomes a risk. Considering this threat, we are working to raise security awareness among our employees with an employee-centered approach alongside IT-based security measures. Also, given the vigorous acquisition and sale of companies in recent years, we keep an eye on the security conditions during deals/post-merger integration, and take measures to reduce security risks.\n\nSecurity Monitoring\n\nIn Hitachi, the Security Operation Center (SOC) monitors security on an around-the-clock basis so global-scale cyberattacks can be detected and countermeasures initiated right away. The Incident Response Team (IRT) collects and develops threat intelligence*\u00b9 and manages the response to any security incidents.\n\nCyberattacks become more sophisticated each year, with damage tending to increase as attacks slip past conventional detection and go undiscovered for longer periods. To counter this risk, we are working to enhance cyber monitoring by using endpoint detection and response to monitor equipment operation, as well as implementing authentication. We continue improving and strengthening our cyber monitoring environment using the latest technology.\n\nPreventing Information Leaks\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi takes the following IT steps to prevent information leaks: encrypting devices; using thin clients;*\u00b9 employing electronic document access control and expiration processing software; maintaining ID management and access control by building an authentication infrastructure; and filtering e-mails and websites. In response to the recent spate of targeted e-mail attacks and other cyberattacks, we are participating in an initiative to share information between the private sector and the government. We are also enhancing various IT measures such as a defense in depth strategy.\n\nTo prevent leaks from our procurement partners, we review their information security measures based on Hitachi\u2019s own standards before allowing them access to confidential information. We also provide tools to procurement partners for security education and for checking business information on computers. In addition, we require procurement partners to check and remove business information from personal computers.\n\nNote: Hitachi normally refers to its suppliers (including vendors or providers) as \u201cprocurement partners\u201d who build business together on an equal footing.\n\n*\u00b9 Threat intelligence: An approach to countering cyberattacks using knowledge of new threats gathered from multiple sources of information on cyber security.\n\n*\u00b9 Thin client: A terminal with the minimum necessary software. Thin client computing significantly enhances cyber security by storing applications and data on the server.\nEducation on Information Security\n\nTraining\n\nHitachi holds annual e-learning programs on information security and personal information protection for all executive officers and employees. Approximately 35,000 employees at Hitachi, Ltd. take these programs, and the percentage of employees completing these programs reaches 100% every year (excluding those who cannot attend for reasons such as being on leave). The company offers a variety of courses that have different goals and are tailored to different target audiences, including new employees, new managers, and information system administrators. Hitachi, Ltd. also implement simulation training to educate employees about phishing attacks and other cyberattacks. Employees are sent deceptive e-mails as phishing simulations to heighten their awareness of security through direct experiences.\n\nEducational programs from Hitachi, Ltd. are shared within the Group to provide Group-wide education on information security and personal information protection.\n\nThorough Personal Information Protection/Information Security Audits and Inspections\n\nActivities\n\nThe Hitachi has developed its approach to security based on the PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle for its information security management system that Hitachi, Ltd. established. Hitachi conducts annual internal audits of personal information protection and information security at all Group companies and BUs.\n\nThe President & CEO of Hitachi, Ltd. appoints officers to conduct internal audits. These officers are not allowed to audit their own units, underlining our commitment to fairness and objectivity in auditing.\n\nThere are 169 Hitachi Group companies*\u00b9 in Japan that conduct internal audits in the same way as Hitachi, Ltd., and all results are subject to confirmation by Hitachi, Ltd. Hitachi requires Group companies outside Japan to use a common global self-check approach to ensure Group-wide auditing and inspections. All BUs conduct annual self-inspections for Confirmation of Personal Information Protection and Information Security Management, and monthly inspections for operations that involve processing important personal information (740 registered operations as of March 2022). This regular control mechanism ensures ample safety management and implementation.\n\nA dedicated internal security team at Hitachi, Ltd. conducts regular on-site assessments of the state of information security measures, and investigates external vulnerabilities in public-facing servers once every fourth quarter. In this way, Hitachi, Ltd. is working to reduce security risks by identifying discrepancies with self-checks.\n\n*\u00b9 Including partner companies that have submitted voluntarily\nPersonal Information Protection\n\nPersonal Information Protection Policy\n\nHitachi places great importance on protecting personal information that is entrusted to us by customers or related to our business operations. As a member of the global community, Hitachi commits to protecting personal information in accordance with a vision for personal information protection summarized as providing safety and trustworthiness, and recognizing the importance of individuals\u2019 rights.\n\nHitachi, Ltd.\u2019s Personal Information Protection Policy sets out its corporate philosophy and principles on personal information protection. The policy is disseminated to all executive officers and employees as well as being publicly available.\n\nHitachi has also established a personal information protection management system based on this policy. Through the rollout of the system, Hitachi is ensuring protection of personal information by such means as safe handling of personal information, educational programs for all employees, and periodic audits.\n\nResponding to Personal Data Protection Laws Around the World\n\nWith the increasing risk of privacy violations in recent years due to the advent of the digital age following advances in IT and the globalization of socio-economic activities, lawmakers are actively seeking to create and modify relevant laws and legislation in countries and regions around the world. Hitachi ensures thorough global compliance with legal frameworks, continues to monitor related legal frameworks and social trends, and implements appropriate measures.\n\nIn Japan, Hitachi will report any leakage of personal information and notify affected individuals, as required by the Amended Act on the Protection of Personal Information. In the event that a leak could result in a situation that would harm the rights and interests of individuals, we will promptly report it to the Personal Information Protection Commission and notify the affected individual(s).\n\nHitachi, Ltd. has also formulated a Group-wide internal code of conduct concerning the protection of personal information, which takes into consideration international legal frameworks such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and put this code of conduct into effect from April 2022. Furthermore, each Group company is strengthening its system for protection of personal information, and is working to ensure thorough and appropriate protection of personal information on a global scale.\n\nPrivacyMark Certification\n\nHitachi, Ltd. has received PrivacyMark*1 certification. The entire Hitachi Group is committed to personal information protection; 37 Hitachi Group companies in Japan have been granted the PrivacyMark as of March 31, 2022.\n\nHitachi also strives to safeguard personal information globally at Group companies outside Japan, based on each company\u2019s personal information protection policy, and ensures that they comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country and region as well as they respond the expectations of society at large. In addition, there were no cases of personal information leakage by Hitachi, Ltd. during fiscal 2021.\n\n*1 PrivacyMark: A third-party certification established in April 1998 that is granted by the assessment body the Japan Information Processing Development Corporation to businesses that have taken appropriate security management and protection measures related to personal information.\nManagement of Customer Information\n\nActivities\n\nHitachi has deployed customer relations management (CRM) systems, which allow us to collect and accurately manage customer and transaction information, in addition to use as a marketing tool. The data collected in these CRM systems enable us to formulate more effective sales strategies and offer collaborative solutions through cooperation by multiple business sites.\n\nPrivacy Protection Initiatives by Hitachi\u2019s Digital Business Division\n\nApproach\n\nUnder the Digital Systems & Services Sector, which drives our digital business, we have assigned a personal data manager to unify our handling of personal data, and established a privacy protection advisory committee to support risk assessments and develop countermeasures based on its knowledge and expertise of privacy protection. In accordance with the policies set by the committee, our employees implement privacy impact assessments for processes where personal data will be handled and take measures to prevent privacy violations.\n\n[Hitachi Privacy Protection Initiatives for the Utilization of Personal Data (In Japanese only)]\nhttps://www.hitachi.co.jp/products/it/bigdata/bigdata_ai/personaldata_privacy/index.html\n\n[Thorough Personal Information Protection/Information Security Audits and Inspections]\n## Governance Data\n\n### Corporate Governance\n\n#### Leadership Demographics\n\n| Unit | Gender | Nationality |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n|      | Total  | Male | Female | Japanese | Non-Japanese |\n| Directors*1 | 12*1 | 10 | 2 | 7 | 5 |\n| Executive officers*1 | People | 34 | 33 | 1 | 31 | 3 |\n| Executive officers and corporate officers*1 | 74 | 65 | 9 | 61 | 13 |\n\nRatios of female and non-Japanese executive officers and corporate officers\n\n| % | 12.2 | 17.6 |\n\n*1 As of June 2022\n\n*2 Including 9 independent directors (seven from Japan and two from outside Japan)\n## Business Ethics and Compliance\n\n### Business Ethics and Compliance Training\n\n| Reporting Boundary | Unit | FY2017 | FY2018 | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|--------------------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of participants of business ethics and compliance training*1 | Hitachi Group | people | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 341,888 |\n| Participation rate of business ethics and compliance training* | Hitachi Group | % | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 99.1 |\n\n*1 Disclosures began in fiscal 2021.\n\n### Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline (Whistleblower System)\n\n| Reporting Boundary | Unit | FY2017 | FY2018 | FY2019 | FY2020 | FY2021 |\n|--------------------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of compliance reports*1 | Hitachi Group | (By category) | Cases | \u2014 | \u2014 | 1,023 |\n| | | HR issues (Labor management, travel expenses, commuting costs, etc.) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 226 |\n| | | Harassment | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 341 |\n| | | Financial | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 27 |\n| | | Procurement | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 26 |\n| | | Competition law | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 4 |\n| | | Bribery | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 30 |\n| | | Others | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 270 |\n| | | (By area) | Cases | \u2014 | \u2014 | 234 |\n| | Americas | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 234 |\n| | Europe (Including CIS) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 98 |\n| | Middle East/North Africa | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 54 |\n| | Sub-Saharan | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 13 |\n| | Asia (excluding Japan) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 234 |\n| | Japan | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 386 |\n\n*1 Disclosures of the total number of cases began in fiscal 2019 and the breakdown in fiscal 2021.\nTo enhance the reliability of the data disclosed in the Hitachi Sustainability Report 2022, we have received independent assurance of key environmental, social and governance performance indicators by KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd. The indicators that were assured are marked with a \"\u2713\".\n\nThe standards, guidelines, and calculation methods used in collecting environmental data are posted on our website.\n\nCalculation Methods for Environmental Load Data\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/environment/data/method.html\n\nIndependent Assurance Report\n\nTo President & CEO of Hitachi, Ltd.\n\nWe were engaged by Hitachi, Ltd. (the \u201cCompany\u201d), to undertake a limited assurance engagement of the environmental, social and governance performance indicators marked with \"\u2713\" (the \u201cIndicators\u201d) for the period from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022 (or as of June 30, 2022 for the Ratio of Female and Non-Japanese Executive and Corporate Officers) included in its Hitachi Sustainability Report 2022 (the \u201cReport\u201d) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Responsibility\nThe Company is responsible for the preparation of the Indicators in accordance with its own reporting criteria (the \u201cCompany\u2019s reporting criteria\u201d), as described in the Report.\n\nOur Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Indicators based on the procedures we have performed. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u201d and the ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements\u201d issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The limited assurance engagement consisted of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other procedures, and the procedures performed vary in nature from, and are less in extent than, a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance provided is thus not as high as that provided by a reasonable assurance engagement. Our assurance procedures included:\n\n\u2022 Interviewing the Company\u2019s responsible personnel to obtain an understanding of its policy for preparing the Report and reviewing the Company\u2019s reporting criteria.\n\u2022 Inquiring about the design of the systems and methods used to collect and process the Indicators.\n\u2022 Performing analytical procedures on the Indicators.\n\u2022 Examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the generation, aggregation and reporting of the Indicators in conformity with the Company\u2019s reporting criteria, and recalculating the Indicators.\n\u2022 Visiting the Nakajo business office of Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems Co., Ltd. selected on the basis of a risk analysis.\n\u2022 Evaluating the overall presentation of the Indicators.\n\nConclusion\nBased on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Indicators in the Report are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Company\u2019s reporting criteria as described in the Report.\n\nOur Independence and Quality Control\nWe have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. In accordance with International Standard on Quality Control 1, we maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n/s/ Kazuhiko Saito\nKazuhiko Saito, Partner, Representative Director\nKPMG AZSA Sustainability Co.,
