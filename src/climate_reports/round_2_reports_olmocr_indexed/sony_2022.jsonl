Accordingly, Sony addresses sustainability from a Group-wide perspective and incorporates issues into management action as necessary. The Sustainability Section and other sections in charge of headquarters functions then implement sustainability activities throughout the Group by ensuring that Sony\u2019s policies and initiatives are conveyed to business units and group companies around the world.\n\nPursuing Sustainability Activities in Management and Business Units\n\nStarting from fiscal year 2020, Sony has adopted a key performance indicator for sustainability initiatives as part of the evaluation pertaining to the remuneration linked to business results for Senior Executives. In addition, from fiscal year 2021, Sony is incorporating initiatives that address sustainability issues into the mid-range plans of each of its businesses, such as measures related to employees and the environment identified as key to each respective business, and Sony has set KPIs for those initiatives as part of its business performance evaluations.\n\nInformation Disclosure and Dialogue with Stakeholders\n\nThrough the issuance of various reports such as its Corporate Report and Sustainability Report, and through its ESG Briefing and websites, Sony communicates its approach to sustainability and information about initiatives regarding sustainability.\n\n- Corporate Report\n- ESG Briefing\n- Sustainability\n\nRaising Employee Awareness\n\nSony recognizes the importance of boosting employee awareness of sustainability and engages in a variety of initiatives to do so.\n\n- Sustainability Awards\n- Events such as the Sustainability Forum\n- Sustainability-themed sessions at global online meetings open to all employees\n- Dissemination of information via intranet websites\n- E-learning training programs\n\nReports to the Board of Directors for Review\n\nThe Sustainability Section submits quarterly reports on its activities to the Board of Directors.

For matters of great importance, the senior executive and department in charge of a particular matter provide regular reports for the Board of Directors to review.\nMessage from the Senior Executive in charge of Sustainability\n\nShiro Kambe\nSenior Executive Vice President\nCorporate Executive Officer\nOfficer in charge of Sustainability\nSony Group Corporation\n\nSony\u2019s responsibility and contribution to Society and the Global Environment\n\nSony develops diverse businesses globally in alignment with its purpose to \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology\u201d and corporate direction of \u201cgetting closer to people.\u201d The Sony Group Code of Conduct states, \u201cIt is the core corporate responsibility of Sony to society to pursue its corporate value enhancement through innovation and sound business practices and contribute to developing a sustainable society.\u201d\n\nFor Sony to continue to provide emotion and create social value, it is necessary for the society and global environment in which we live to be healthy. Our daily lives, and Sony Group businesses, are being significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather events around the world, and various social issues including those related to human rights and diversity, providing a stark reminder that the health of the global environment and society is not something we can take for granted.\n\nIt is our responsibility to directly acknowledge the environmental and social impact of our business operations and strive to prevent and mitigate potential adverse impact on human rights. Sony\u2019s goal is to create value for society through an array of businesses centered on people. Sony is fostering diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) throughout the entire Group, where differences in background, gender and ability are viewed as strengths. The Group is also promoting initiatives aimed at fostering diversity and social justice in its engagement with greater society.\n\nIn 2020, Sony established the Global Social Justice Fund to support initiatives that promote social justice and human rights and foster DE&I around the world. We also established the Sony Global Relief Fund for COVID-19 to support those around the world affected by COVID-19. In order to provide humanitarian aid for people impacted by the conflict in Ukraine and those who have taken refuge in neighboring countries, in March 2022 Sony made donations to relevant international organizations and NGOs, and employees held fund-raising initiatives.\n\nRegarding human rights risks in the supply chain of electronics products, we are strengthening our efforts to implement the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, and we are also working collaboratively with global companies and other stakeholders.\n\nSony actively discloses its sustainability-related initiatives through ESG briefings, the Corporate Report and the Sustainability Report. We also place great importance on dialogue with our stakeholders. Sony Group employees are also important stakeholders, and, in addition to top management\u2019s commitment to sustainability initiatives, Sony strives to foster a corporate culture in which each employee recognizes that sustainability is an issue that affects them personally. Sony has established sustainability awards as an in-house award system to encourage initiatives in each business and region. We also strive to boost employee awareness of sustainability by sharing information at online meetings for all Sony Group employees and by holding forums.\n\nGoing forward, Sony will continue to engage in dialogue with various stakeholders, develop our sustainability initiatives even further, and fulfill our responsibility and contribution to society and the global environment.\n\nSustainability Report 2022\nMateriality\n\nOverview and Purpose of Materiality Analysis\n\nThe Sony Group develops diverse businesses globally. Sony recognizes that stakeholders expect it to maintain a well-defined stance and take action to address the issues facing society and the global environment, in addition to delivering emotional experiences through its business.\n\nIn response to such expectations, and to various social and environmental changes, Sony reviewed material topics in sustainability from the standpoints of all its businesses in FY2022. In that process, Sony designated creativity and technology, two components of its Purpose, as drivers for value creation along with diversity of employees and businesses, and defined materiality as \u201cmaterial topics that are related to sustainability, impact Sony\u2019s value creation, and are determined with longer-term social change and diverse stakeholder needs in mind.\u201d\n\nThe Materiality Assessment Process\n\nStep 1: Identify and classify material topics\n\nBased on internal and external information and documents, Sony selected material topics with high relevance. References included the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards, which are global guidelines for sustainability reporting, the ISO 26000 international standard for corporate social responsibility, and the SDGs, which are globally agreed goals for building a sustainable world.\n\nStep 2: Assess the topics from the perspective of Sony and its stakeholders\n\nThe topics identified and classified in the Step 1 were assessed from the perspectives of Sony and its stakeholders. The senior executives in charge of Sony headquarters functions assessed each topic from the angle of its mid- to long-term positive or negative impact on value creation at Sony to determine its importance from the company\u2019s perspective. The assessment of the importance of each topic from the perspective of stakeholders was based on information published by NGOs, investors, ESG rating agencies, the mass media and other sources.\n\nStep 3: Identify the most important topics\n\nThe most important topics were specified after being reviewed by top management and the Board of Directors on the basis of the assessment conducted in Step 2.\n\nAnalysis Results and Sony Group Material Topics\n\nAs a result of the aforementioned assessment process, climate change; diversity, equity and inclusion; respect for human rights; and technology for sustainability as the most important.\n\nThe Sustainability Report 2022 classifies Sony\u2019s material topics, including the above, into eight categories: environment, employees, respect for human rights, responsible supply chain, quality and customer service, community engagement, ethics and compliance, and corporate governance.\n\nImportance from Stakeholder Perspective\n\n| Importance from Group\u2019s Perspective |\n|------------------------------------|\n| Greater Importance |\n| Most Important |\n| Important |\n\nSony Group Material Topics\n\n- Climate change\n- Diversity, equity and inclusion\n- Respect for human rights\n- Technology for sustainability\n\nThe Sustainability Report 2022 classifies Sony\u2019s material topics, including the above, into eight categories: environment, employees, respect for human rights, responsible supply chain, quality and customer service, community engagement, ethics and compliance, and corporate governance.\n### Summary of Actions\n\n| Area of focus | Key focus | Achievements in fiscal year 2021 | Future initiatives | Coverage

Sony sees great value in contributing to solving social and environmental issues through technology and business.\n\n**Contributing via Technological Development**\n\n**Intelligent Vision Sensors \u201cIMX500\u201d: Edge AI Solutions That Help Solve Social Issues**\n\nIn May 2020, Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation (SSS) announced the commercial release of its IMX500 intelligent vision sensors, the first image sensors in the world to be equipped with AI processing functionality. They feature a stacked configuration consisting of a pixel chip and logic chip, which are key technologies of SSS image sensors. The logic chip is equipped with SSS\u2019s original DSP (Digital Signal Processor) dedicated to AI signal processing, and embedded memory for the AI model.\n\nThe spread of the IoT has made cloud AI processing systems commonplace. However, there is a concern that this will lead to increased CO2 emissions as IP traffic and data center electricity consumption rise due to higher data volumes from a growing number of IoT devices. Edge AI processing addresses these problems by employing IoT devices that process and analyze data. SSS developed the IMX500 to be capable of outputting the desired metadata as semantic information. Because it only extracts necessary data, the data transmission latency, power consumption, and communication costs are reduced. Furthermore, privacy concerns are addressed by not outputting information that can identify an individual. One next-generation solution utilizing the IMX500 is an initiative to curb climate change. The issue being tackled is that most commercial buildings currently keep their heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems running whether people are present or not. Nomad Go is an American company that creates computer vision technology. With the aim of finding a solution to that issue, it utilized the IMX500 and Microsoft\u2019s Azure AI to effectively develop an intelligent building solution. Computer vision technology detects whether people are present in a commercial space and, if so, how many for how long. It precisely adjusts the room air conditioning as necessary, reducing energy use and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. SSS also announced the launch of its AITRIOS\u2122 edge AI sensing platform in October 2021. AITRIOS is a one-stop platform that provides various partners involved in development with all the features they need to efficiently develop and deploy solutions. The platform supports partners in efforts to build optimal systems in which the edge and the cloud function in synergy and address global environmental issues, thereby helping to solve issues with cloud systems.\n\n*AITRIOS and AITRIOS logos are the registered trademarks or trademarks of Sony Group Corporation or its affiliated companies.*\n\n**IoT for a Sustainable Society: Sony\u2019s Earth MIMAMORI platform**\n\nIn order to realize a sustainable society, it is necessary to constantly protect various regions such as mountain forests, satoyama (woodlands surrounding rural settlements), rivers, and coasts. Furthermore, it requires the detection of anomalies to prevent problems from arising, instead of addressing environmental issues after they have already arisen. Such systems can only be realized through the ability to acquire and transmit data in a global sensor network extending to mountainous and coastal areas not serviced by conventional mobile networks. They also require devices and networks that can function in areas where electricity service is difficult.\nSony has a range of technologies to realize these systems.\n\n- lidSGO, intelligent vision sensor equipped with AI processing functionality\n- Low-power edge AI devices such as SPRESENSE\u2122 that offer advanced sensing in a battery-powered device\n- Radio signal processing technology that enables low power and low bitrate data transmission with a range of over 1,000 km\n- Prediction One, an analysis tool that makes useful predictions from the data collected\n\nAnd more\n\nCombining these technologies enables sensing all around the world, even in locations where humankind is not active. The data from such sensing can be collected by low-orbit satellites and the necessary information relayed to human society via AI processing. Sony calls this concept \u201cMIMAMORI\u201d and is engaged in research and development to make this mechanism to change human behavior patterns a reality. Within frameworks such as a comprehensive joint research and demonstration tests at various locations around the globe. These projects will help to prevent environmental destruction and predict emergencies such as river flooding and wildfires, as well as increase agricultural and livestock productivity.\n\n**Synecoculture\u2122 and Augmented Ecosystems**\n\nConventional agriculture largely focuses on increasing productivity from a single crop, by plowing top soil, spreading fertilizer, and applying agrochemicals. These practices damage ecosystems and cause environmental problems. Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL) successfully conducted demonstration tests for Synecoculture, a new agricultural practice that balances productivity and biodiversity, moving closer toward sustainability. Synecoculture is already being used in the Sahel region in Africa and has the potential to have a major global impact by contributing to desert greening and helping local economies around the world.\n\nSynecoculture eliminates the need for the plowing, fertilizing, and agrochemical use that impact the environment, by taking maximum advantage of the material cycling that occurs naturally in ecosystems, aiming to create rich ecosystems with a diverse mix of plants that coexist together and grow lushly. The importance of building ecosystems with a high degree of biological diversity and functionality is increasing in response to climate change, food crises, and pandemics. Synecoculture provides a fundamental solution to such global agenda. Sony CSL is also working to supply new value through augmented ecosystems, which expand the applications for Synecoculture beyond food production to the creation of ecosystems with diverse objectives and functions. The project supports education to enhance the understanding of natural environments and adds new value to the basic infrastructure of urban and living spaces. Building on this project, Sony founded SynecO Inc. to create sustainable environments and industries based on the renewable natural capital in which society should be rooted.\n\n* Synecoculture is a registered trademark of Sony Group Corporation or its affiliates.\n\n**STAR SPHERE**\n\nIn August 2020, Sony announced the development of a nano/micro-satellite equipped with Sony camera equipment that can be operated by users to shoot images, and a joint development and technology demonstration agreement with the University of Tokyo and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).\n\nUp until now, space missions for industrial purposes such as planetary exploration or space communication and surveys have dominated, and only a few people, such as astronauts, have experienced manned space flights. Believing it important that ordinary people can experience the universe for themselves and see Earth in a new light, as a planet in space, if humanity is to create sustainable societies and find solutions to environmental issues, Sony, the University of Tokyo and JAXA founded STAR SPHERE, a project that takes \u201cUnleash Space\u201d as its motto. The three partners aim to launch a man-made satellite in 2022.\n\nThe STAR SPHERE satellite will be highly maneuverable with 360 degree attitude control so that members of the public can explore and discover new aspects of the Earth and stars through the camera, such as the ever-changing hues of the aurora for example. Since half of the satellite\u2019s orbit will be at night, it will be installed with Sony high-sensitivity image sensors to help boost its environmental efficiency in operations such as the visualization of night-time economic activity. Sony intends to deliver \u201can experience connecting space and reality\u201d via images captured in real time by checking the live stream from the camera when the satellite passes over an antenna on the ground station.\n\nUp until now, satellites have been operated by specialized engineers, but Sony released a prototype shooting simulator in January 2022 that is simple and fun for laymen to use. Web content has been used to give the simulator intuitive operability, and Sony\u2019s Mappy 3D web map technology is leveraged for beautiful expression - the map data is optimized for 3D. The simulator can set shooting sequences as well as time frames for images to be shot.\n\nSpace is also a place where we can learn about Earth, and Sony has launched the Space Inspiration Competition in tandem with schools and educational institutes to use the power of entertainment to expand people\u2019s view of space.\n\nGoing forward, Sony aims to help to make people aware of just how precious Earth is by letting them see it from space, and to contribute to building a sustainable society where that value is shared worldwide.\nCreating new businesses and supporting the business growth of Sony has participated for many years in the global ecosystem for Corporate Venture Capital and sustainable society.

This is why Sony is so determined to fight climate change, preserve resources, manage chemical substances, conserve biodiversity, and take other needed steps to protect the environment.\n\nTrue to this commitment, Sony conducts its business in a sustainable manner and provides environmentally conscious products and services, always seeking to deliver innovation and develop uniquely superior technologies. Sony also works hand-in-hand with stakeholders to help build a more sustainable society.\n\nThe Basics\nSince the early 1990s, Sony has pursued environmental initiatives in accordance with its environmental principles and targets. In April 2010, Sony announced the \u201cRoad to Zero,\u201d a new global environmental plan, the goal of which is to realize a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of its products and business activities by the year 2050. In May 2022, Sony made the decision to bring forward the target year of achieving a zero environmental footprint in the climate change area by ten years from 2050 to 2040.\n\nWorking toward a zero environmental footprint, once every five years Sony sets concrete medium-term environmental targets for each stage of the life cycle for its products with respect to climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity.\n\nStructure\nSony is implementing and continually improving its globally integrated environmental management system with the aim of realizing the Sony Group Environmental Vision, achieving its medium-term environmental targets and complying fully with legal requirements, regulatory demands and internal policies established for the Group.\n\nIn addition, Sony has set up specialized functions to handle individual areas of activity within headquarters environmental functions.\n\nCorporate Executive Officers oversee these functions as Sony Group Corporation senior management.\n\nLooking to the Future\nActing on the basis of Green Management 2025, which sets medium-term environmental targets for fiscal year 2021-2025, Sony continues to strengthen its own internal initiatives, encourages business partners, consumers, and other stakeholders to take action and works together to build a sustainable society. By 2030, Sony will convert the electricity used at our manufacturing sites to 100% renewable energy and make direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2) of its own operations carbon neutral. By 2035, Sony will reduce GHG emissions for scope 3 products by 45%, and aim for net zero emissions for the entirety of scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 2040. Moving forward, Sony will continue to strengthen our efforts to achieve a zero environmental footprint.\n\nMilestones\n1976: Company-wide Sony Environmental Conference established\n1993: Sony Global Environmental Policy and Environmental Action Program developed\n1995: Began to acquire ISO14001 certification at manufacturing sites in Japan\n2002: Green Partner Environmental Quality Approval Program introduced\n2006: Integration of environmental management systems at sites around the world completed\n2009: 100% renewable electricity use achieved at all European sites\n2010: Road to Zero environmental plan announced\n2015: Approved as Science Based Targets (SBT)\n2018: Sony joins RE100 Global Initiative\n2022: Sony announced the bringing forward of the target year of achieving a zero environmental footprint in the climate change area and \u201cRE100\u201d by 10 years.

Sony is putting effort into measures against climate change from two perspectives: responsibility to aim to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to zero, and contribution to innovation for industry and society. Since the early 1990s, Sony has been operating under environmentally-conscious policies and action plans. Road to Zero, an environmental plan established in 2010, is designed to reduce the Group\u2019s environmental footprint to zero by 2050 by following a specific road map including goals set from four perspectives on environment, namely: climate change, resources, chemical substances and biodiversity. To address climate change, Sony has committed to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to zero in both business operations and in its products throughout their life cycles. Sony sets medium-term environmental targets every five years, backcasting from the final goals of the plan for 2050, with each business pursuing its respective action plan to achieve them. The current mindset in society in response to the increasingly serious effects of climate change is to support requiring corporations worldwide to accelerate measures to address climate change. For example, the international Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) now stipulates a global temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels as the new target level, from 2040 to 2030 (see the chart above). Moreover, Sony\u2019s net zero target for 2040 was approved as the net zero target for the Science Based Targets initiative in August 2022.\n\nPriority Initiatives to Achieve New Targets\n\nTo achieve these new targets, the Sony Group will continue to make an across-the-board effort to promote the use of renewable energy at all its business sites while reducing energy consumption. One example is the new Fab5 building at the Nagasaki Technology Center for image sensor production, which commenced operations in April 2021. Here, AI-assisted advanced control technology has been employed in semiconductor production to operate clean-room chillers and boilers, along with a system to recycle waste heat from production equipment to drive boilers, resulting in clean-room energy consumption efficiency being improved by 30% compared to the FY2015 level. Across the entire life cycle of Sony products, greenhouse-gas emissions are highest when they consume electricity during customer use. With that in mind, Sony will pursue innovation in areas such as product design while accelerating initiatives promoting a net zero society. Specifically, Sony is exploring investment opportunities in startups working on technology for the environment, mainly through the Sony Innovation Fund: Environment, a corporate venture capital fund established in 2020, as well as through making proposals to national governments and industry associations worldwide. Carbon removal/fixation is a particularly vital challenge to meet in order to realize net zero carbon emissions by 2040. Going forward, Sony is looking into various technologies leading to carbon removal/fixation via both technological removal and natural absorption by ecosystems. Sony will contribute to carbon fixation via both technological removal and natural absorption by ecosystems.\nBasic Policy\nSony reduces our environmental footprint and prevents environmental pollution throughout the lifecycle of our products and business activities by complying with all applicable environmental regulations and also by continually improving our global environmental management systems. Sony formulates the following goals in four key environmental perspectives and takes proactive actions to achieve those goals.\n\nClimate Change\nSony reduces energy consumption and strives to achieve zero emissions of greenhouse gases* generated throughout the lifecycle of our products, service and business activities.\n\n* Gases that raise the temperature of the earth\u2019s surface by absorbing infrared radiation from reflected sunlight. Seven typical examples are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxides, hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)\n\nResources Conservation\nIn order to minimize resource inputs for our business activities, Sony identifies \u201cKey Resources\u201d and strives to achieve zero usage of those virgin materials. Sony also uses water efficiently, minimizes wastes from sites and maximizes our effort for take back and recycling products from markets.\n\nManagement of Chemical Substances\nSony minimizes the risk of chemical substances that we use causing serious harm to human health and the environment. Sony maintains strict control over the chemical substances we use, while, in line with the precautionary approach, taking steps whenever possible to reduce, substitute and eliminate the use of substances that have potentially significant impacts on the environment even in the cases where scientific evidence is not fully proven.\n\nBiodiversity Conservation\nSony protects and utilizes ecosystem services in a sustainable manner, while actively promoting maintenance and recovery of biodiversity through our business and local contribution activities.\n\nIn order to realize the Environmental Vision, Sony formulates targets and concrete plans and initiates actions to implement, while contributing to a better society through partnerships and communications with internal and external stakeholders.\n\nEnvironmental Plan\n\u201cRoad to Zero,\u201d Sony\u2019s Global Environmental Plan\nAs stated in the Sony Group Environmental Vision, Sony strives to realize a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of its products and business activities. It is this long-term goal that prompted Sony to name its new global environmental plan \u201cRoad to Zero.\u201d Under this plan, Sony aims to bring its environmental footprint to zero by 2050 and works to achieve medium-term environmental targets toward this end. In May 2022, Sony made the decision to bring forward the target year of achieving a zero environmental footprint in the climate change area by ten years from 2050 to 2040.\n\n\u201cRoad to Zero,\u201d Sony\u2019s Global Environmental Plan\nFour Focus Points for a Zero Environmental Footprint\n\nSony efforts to achieve a zero environmental footprint focus on four important environmental perspectives: climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity.\n\nFocus on Climate Change\n\nSony aims to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions in its business activities, as well as throughout the entire life cycle of its products and services. In order to reduce emissions, we conduct scenario analysis* in accordance with TCFD Recommendations, analyze and ascertain climate-related risks and opportunities, and review the countermeasures. To achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions, Sony works to maximize energy-saving measures and introduce as much renewable energy as possible. In addition to such measures as reducing the amount of electricity used at business sites, promoting the installation of solar power generation equipment, and maximizing energy efficiency in Sony products and services, Sony also encourages similar measures in the supply chain, including at contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components, to reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Sony also investigates ways to offset any greenhouse gas emissions that might remain through efforts such as carbon removal.\n\n* See below for more information on scenario analysis in accordance with TCFD Recommendations.\n\nDisclosure of Climate-related Information in Accordance with the TCFD Recommendations\n\nFocus on Resources\n\nSony seeks to minimize the consumption of resources and maximize resource recycling in order to use resources effectively in its business activities and throughout the life cycle of its products and services, based on the globally prescribed promotion of a circular economy. Sony minimizes resource consumption by reducing the weight of products, minimizing the use of packaging materials, and utilizing resources more efficiently in its internal operations. Concurrently, Sony also works to extend the life of products through quality and durability enhancements, while undertaking environmentally conscious design, such as making products easier to repair, in order to indirectly reduce resource consumption. Additionally, as part of its efforts to respond to the growing global problem of plastic pollution in the ocean, Sony continues to work toward reducing the amount of single-use plastic product packaging. Sony aims to reduce the number of parts derived from virgin resources to zero by identifying certain key resources* in terms of environmental impact due to the depletion, uneven distribution and mining of resources, loss of biodiversity due to mining, and the effects of these impacts on local communities. In terms of waste, Sony recycles waste generated from internal operations, with the goal of eliminating landfilled waste. Additionally, Sony designs products to facilitate recycling and implements ongoing programs to collect and recycle end-of-life products according to the needs of local communities, while also promoting advanced recycling with recycling companies.\n\n* At Sony, \u201ckey resources\u201d are designated by taking the following factors into account: resource depletion, resource availability, environmental impact of resource extraction, and loss of biodiversity and community impacts from resource extraction.\n\nFocus on Water Use\n\nAlthough water circulates around the earth continuously through the water cycle, the amount of water available for use by the planet\u2019s inhabitants is limited. With population growth and other issues putting further pressure on water supplies, the importance of conserving this resource will increase in the years ahead. Taking into account the locations of its sites, as well as regional differences, Sony will continue taking steps to minimize its withdrawal of water and to ensure the water it returns to water sources is of a quality that does not negatively impact the environment.\n\nFocus on Paper Resources\n\nRecognizing that paper resources are limited, under the Sony Group Paper / Printed Material Purchasing Policy, Sony constantly works to reduce paper consumption while prioritizing the procurement of environmentally preferable paper, such as paper made from resources sourced from certified forests and recycled paper.\n\nSony Group Paper / Printed Material Purchasing Policy [PDF: 427KB]\n\nFocus on Chemical Substances\n\nSony endeavors to minimize the risk that chemical substances it uses might cause serious harm to human health and the environment. Chemical substances used in Sony products are suitably managed based on available data including national regulations, toxicity, environmental impacts, applications, and content level in components and products. Sony adopts a precautionary approach and takes steps to identify and strive to eliminate substances considered to be high-risk, even in cases where scientific evidence is insufficient, thereby reducing potential impact on the environment. Sony manages the type and application of chemical substances used at business sites, and for high risk substances sets criteria for managing each substance to either prohibit their use or reduce emissions or amounts transferred. Sony also prohibits the use of certain substances in manufacturing processes in the supply chain which are restricted under international frameworks because of environmental impacts throughout the life cycle.\n\nFocus on Biodiversity\n\nRecognizing the importance of natural capital,* as the very foundation of human life, and the ecosystem services* it supplies, Sony endeavors to maintain and recover biodiversity, both in its business activities and through community initiatives. At each stage of the product lifecycle, Sony business activities are either dependent on or related to natural capital and biodiversity. We set and work toward goals with this in mind, especially at stages where this link is particularly prominent. For example, Sony aims to eliminate parts derived from virgin resources and prevent the loss of biodiversity due to mining in our procurement of raw materials and parts. For paper resources closely tied to biodiversity, we are continuing efforts to reduce the amount of paper used, and prioritize the purchase of environmentally conscious paper.\n\nLand use is another factor causing the loss and deterioration of biodiversity. In response, Sony promotes nature restoration and biodiversity conservation efforts that meet regional needs for the green areas on the premises of Sony sites as well as the surrounding area. Sony takes seriously the issue of plastic pollution in the oceans, which has become a worldwide crisis in recent years. We promote activities to reduce the amount of plastics used in products and in manufacturing sites, as well as the collection of plastic waste and cleanup activities at sites.\n\nSony also recognizes that food is essential to the lives all our employees and humanity as a whole. This is also linked to environmental issues such as soil pollution, deforestation, food loss and global warming. We work to communicate these issues to our employees and encourage them to have an environmentally conscious diet.\n\n* The natural assets include elements of the natural environment such as forests, rivers, the atmosphere and soil, as well as living organisms. Natural capital is the source of ecosystem services, fossil fuels and minerals.\n\n** Services produced by natural capital and received by humans from nature include groundwater, lumber, and climate regulation.\n\nDisclosure of Climate-related Information in Accordance with the TCFD Recommendations\n\nFocus on Water Use\n\nAlthough water circulates around the earth continuously through the water cycle, the amount of water available for use by the planet\u2019s inhabitants is limited.

Natural capital is the source of ecosystem services, fossil fuels and minerals.\n\n** Services produced by natural capital and received by humans from nature include groundwater, lumber, and climate regulation.\nMedium-Term Environmental Targets\n\nSony is working toward its goal of having a \u201czero environmental footprint\u201d, setting medium-term (5-year) environmental targets progressively backcasted from targets based on current achievement levels. This approach will enable Sony to work steadily toward achieving the zero environmental footprint goal, while making ongoing adjustments based on current progress. In 2011, Sony established the Green Management 2015 medium-term environmental targets (fiscal year 2011\u20132015), which was the first step on the road to a zero environmental footprint, and took the second step in 2016 with the Green Management 2020 medium-term environmental targets (fiscal year 2016\u20132020). Sony is currently implementing initiatives to achieve the goals it has set under the Green Management 2025 medium-term environmental targets (fiscal year 2021\u20132025).\n\nGreen Management 2025\n\nSony Moves Even Closer to Zero with 2025 Targets\n\nSince April 2021, Sony has been working to achieve the goals it has set under the Green Management 2025 medium-term environmental targets (fiscal year 2021 - 2025). Sony continues to accelerate its environmental activities in order to move even closer to a zero environmental footprint.\n\nGreen Management 2025 in Context\n\nIn light of the urgent environmental issue of climate change, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must be reduced to virtually zero by 2050 in order to keep the global average temperature increase below 1.5\u00b0C as recommended in the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C approved by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)* in 2018. In order to realize a decarbonized world with virtually zero GHG emissions, companies will need to develop energy saving products, introduce renewable energy, and reduce emissions throughout their supply chains. At the same time, in order to achieve sustainable use of resources, economic growth must be balanced with environmental impact; societies must shift to circular economies; and the recent problem of ocean plastic pollution must be addressed.\n\n*IPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\nFormulating Green Management 2025\n\nSony believes that encouraging business partners, consumers, and other stakeholders to take action and work together to build a sustainable world is equally as important as its own environmental activities. When formulating Green Management 2025, Sony examined its past environmental activities and conducted a group-wide materiality analysis focused on what is important to Sony, its stakeholders and society at large. Based on these results and the wider social context, Sony reaffirmed the importance of the four environmental aspects that it has been working to address: climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity. The following three areas are particular key priorities.\n\nFocus Point 1: Improve Energy- and Resource-Efficiency of Products\n\nSony continues to pursue energy efficiency during product use, which accounts for the majority of GHG emissions throughout the life cycle of its products. In addition to minimizing the consumption of resources, Sony takes action to reduce the amount of plastic used in products and packaging in order to address the growing problem of ocean plastic pollution.\n\nFocus Point 2: Expand Renewable Energy Use\n\nSony is a member of RE100 and aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity utilization at all Sony Group sites by 2030.* Sony will further accelerate efforts to achieve this goal by expanding the use of renewable electricity to at least 35%* of the total amount of electricity used at all Sony sites around the world.\n\n* Revised May 2022\n\nFocus Point 3: Enhance Supply Chain Engagement to Reduce Environment Impact\n\nSony has been working to reduce the environmental impact of the entire supply chain by working even more closely with raw material and component suppliers and contractors to which it outsources manufacturing. Sony endeavors to further enhance its engagement with these partners, encouraging them to set targets for reducing GHG emissions and water consumption and managing their progress.\n\nIn addition, Sony has helped raise awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those in relation to the environment, through its entertainment content reaching more than 2 billion people around the world. Green Management 2025 also focuses on promoting these activities and encouraging engagement in environmental activities with the aim of getting over 2.5 million people to take action.\n\nSpecific Green Management 2025 Targets\n\nFor a list of Green Management 2025 targets, please click on the following link.\n\n[Green Management 2025]\nGreen Management 2025 Targets and Progress\n\nUnder the Green Management 2025 (GM2025) medium-term environmental targets, which spanned from fiscal year 2021 through fiscal year 2025, Sony set targets for each stage of the product lifecycle and took action accordingly. The targets and fiscal year 2021 progress of activities for each stage are outlined below.\n\nProduct/Service Planning and Design\n\nSony provides products and services with low environmental impact in all business areas. We are promoting electronic products with designs that reduce environmental burden throughout their lifecycle, and promoting the use of recycled plastics in our products alongside the reduction of plastic packaging. Particularly in its entertainment business, Sony also makes the most of the content it creates to develop and promoting the use of recycled plastics in our products alongside the reduction of plastic packaging.\n\nOperations\n\nSony has adopted renewable energy at worksites throughout the Sony Group as part of its focus on reducing its environmental impact. Sony has been accelerating the adoption of renewable energy since 2021. In May 2022, we moved our target year for using 100% renewable energy up from 2040 to 2030. Our GM2025 goal for renewable energy-derived electricity in 2025 was also increased from 15% to 35%. Furthermore, in 2021, we began working on environmental consideration in food, providing menus using environmentally conscious ingredients at employee cafeterias and conducting activities to raise employee awareness.\n\n| Items | Targets (base year: 2018) | Fiscal year 2021 Progress |\n|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Overall | Centering around the entertainment business, raise the awareness of more than 2 billion people on sustainability issues and engage more than 2.5 million people by the entire Sony Group | Utilize entertainment content to raise the awareness of more than 0.43 billion people across the entire group, and promote participation to a total of 16 million people through events and social media |\n| Climate Change | Reduce annual energy consumption per product unit by 5% | Approx. 3.3% increase |\n| Resource | Reduce the amount of virgin oil-based plastics per product unit (excluding packaging materials) by 10% | Approx. 3.1% reduction |\n| Chemical Substances | Eliminate plastic packaging for newly-designed small products | Released in 2021, the WF-1000XM4 headphones, Xperia PRO-1 Smartphone, \u03b17 IV Full-frame Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Camera, etc., realize zero plastic in individual packaging. |\n| Chemical Substances | Eliminate high-risk applications of \u201cControlled Substances\u201d*1 that are of high concern and use alternative substances | Promoted use of alternative substances based on Sony standards for management of chemical substances.

These targets are listed below and have been approved by the Science Based Targets (SBT)* initiative as consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C goal. In May 2022, the target year was moved up to 2040, and our goal of achieving net zero in scopes 1 to 3 across the entire value chain was approved as an SBT net zero target in August 2022.\n\n*SBT is an international initiative to encourage companies to set science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets in order to limit the increase in the average global temperature due to climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.\n\nRE100 Membership\n\nIn 2018, Sony joined RE100* and itself is working toward sourcing 100% renewable electricity for the worldwide operations of the Sony Group by 2040. This target was moved up to 2030 in May 2022. Sony has already switched to 100% renewable electricity in Europe and China. In Pan Asia, North America and Japan, we are increasing renewable energy use using various strategies including deploying solar energy systems. Particularly, to address its energy-intensive operations in Japan, Sony has installed solar power generation equipment at its main sites and is promoting intracompany transfers of surplus power generated by the solar power systems at Sony sites (including some off-site power systems) to supply power to another Sony site. Sony will also cooperate with other RE100-member companies to shape renewable energy markets and realize regulatory changes that will lead to the plentiful and stable supply of affordable renewable energy throughout the world.\n\n*RE100 is a global initiative led by the non-profit The Climate Group in partnership with CDP in which participating companies set a goal of procuring 100% renewable electricity for power used in their global business operations.\n\nUse of Renewable Energy\n\nTackling Ocean Plastic Pollution with the One Blue Ocean Project\n\nSony is promoting One Blue Ocean activities for products and sites based on the following four initiatives.

Acquisition of ISO 14001 certification at all sites was completed in fiscal year 2000. Since then, Sony has expanded this effort, establishing a group-wide environmental management system integrating its headquarters with environmental departments, business units and sites globally, while taking advantage of the management systems already operational at each business site, and acquiring integrated ISO 14001 certification for the entire Sony Group in fiscal year 2005. As of March 31, 2022, integrated ISO 14001 certification had been obtained by 91 of the Sony Group\u2019s business units and sites around the world.*2\n\n*1 \u201cSites\u201d refers to manufacturing and non-manufacturing sites.\n*2 The scope of integrated ISO 14001 certification is all manufacturing, distribution centers with 100 or more employees and non-manufacturing sites with 1,000 or more employees.\n\nPromoting the Use of Environmentally Conscious Food with the Food for the Future Project\nThe production, transportation and consumption of food resources is profoundly affected by environmental issues such as soil pollution, deforestation, food loss and global warming. Sony believes that solving these environmental issues is important to everyone, so we started promoting the Food for the Future project in 2021.\n\nIn this project, Sony promotes the project based on the two following actions, encouraging every employee to raise their awareness of environmental considerations for food in their lives at home and in their meals in the cafeteria. The main achievements of fiscal year 2021 are also outlined below.\n\n(1) Make sustainable food a part of daily life\nSony compiles a guidebook containing ideas that can be incorporated into daily lives and distributes this to employees. We also hold seminars to join our employees in considering the importance of having a sustainable diet.\n\nFiscal year 2021 Results\n\u2022 Distribution of a guidebook on environmentally conscious food to sites worldwide\n\u2022 Established the Sony Group Food Month and held seminars in Japan\n\n(2) Choose sustainable food at the employee cafeteria\nWe incorporate environmentally conscious food into the meals offered at our employee cafeterias in order to deepen employee understanding of environmentally conscious food.\n\nFiscal year 2021 Results\n\u2022 Provision of environmentally conscious food at employee cafeterias at 32 sites worldwide\n\nOne Blue Ocean Project\n\nThe Sony Group Global Environmental Management System (As of March 31, 2022)\n\n| Business divisions and sites: Practice environmental management and conduct internal audits |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| North America | Latin America | Europe | Japan/East Asia |\n| 7 bases | N/A | 58 bases | 14 bases |\n\n| Regional environmental offices: Clarify rules and regulations and conduct corporate audits in each region |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| North America | Latin America | Europe | Japan/East Asia |\n| 1 base | 1 base | 1 base | 1 base |\n\nIntegrated ISO 14001 certification for 91 Sony Group sites worldwide\nContinual Improvement by Using the PDCA Cycle\n\nIn compliance with ISO 14001, the global standard for environmental management systems that is based on the rationale of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, Sony\u2019s corporate headquarters conducts annual assessments of the environmental impact of the entire Sony Group and, after identifying risks and opportunities, incorporates its findings into medium-term environmental targets and annual plans. In line with these plans, individual business units and sites establish and implement their own annual plans, incorporating essential elements of guiding principles established by the headquarters. Progress on the implementation of these business plans is reviewed regularly by a committee that is headed by the officer in charge of environmental affairs, contributing to ongoing improvement efforts. Awards are given annually at the global level to recognize outstanding activities in core businesses. For all businesses of the Sony Group (except for certain operations such as the financial services), the results of environmental initiatives are assessed as part of the annual review of business results, and the assessment is used to determine bonuses for employees of Sony\u2019s main business units. Additionally, environment related matters are taken into account as a factor in evaluating the remuneration linked to business results of Senior Executives and Senior Vice Presidents in charge of each business unit.\n\nThe Sony Group Environmental Management System PDCA Cycle\n\n- **Plan**\n  - Sony Group Environmental Vision\n  - Medium-Term Environmental Targets\n  - Formulation of Sony Group environmental rules and annual business plans\n  - Implementation of environmental management based on the annual business plan\n\n- **Do**\n  - Audit and review of annual business plan and Medium-Term Environmental Targets as well as performance assessments and decisions regarding awards\n\n- **Check**\n  - Review by top management, continual improvements\n\n- **Act**\n  - Based on the annual business plan\n\nTo gauge the progress of these environmental activities, Sony has developed an online data system for periodically collecting performance data, among others, power consumption by products, energy used by sites, and volume of waste generated. To ensure the effective functioning of the PDCA cycle, Sony has created an environmental document structure in line with the requirements of ISO 14001. The structure covers overall elements of environmental management such as management procedures on site and in the business groups, internal environmental communications, efforts to make products more environmentally conscious, and internal audits. Another means by which the Sony Group facilitates environmental action is to provide broad environmental education for employees that is tailored to specific objectives or the type of work they perform.\n\nEnvironmental Audits\n\nSony has established an integrated environmental audit system that combines three kinds of audits \u2014 internal, corporate and external \u2014 and aims to facilitate continual improvements to the Sony Group\u2019s environmental management system, prevent environmental accidents at sites, and ensure the reliability of environmental data. In internal audits, business units and sites independently confirm the effectiveness of their own organization\u2019s environmental management system. In corporate audits, headquarters or regional environmental offices conduct audits of business units and sites in order to verify compliance with corporate rules. In external audits, an external certification body conducts audits to determine the effectiveness of environmental management systems throughout the Sony Group.\n\nThe Sony Group Environmental Audit System\n\n- **Business Units and Sites**\n  - Division operations assess the effectiveness of the environmental management system in each business unit and site.\n\n- **Headquarters and Regional Offices**\n  - Headquarters and regional environmental offices audit business units and sites and confirm compliance with corporate rules.\n\n- **External Certification Organization**\n  - An external certification body confirms the effectiveness of environmental management systems throughout the Sony Group.\nOverview of Sony\u2019s Environmental Impact\n\nAssessing Greenhouse Gas Emissions over the Entire Value Chain\n\nThe recent escalation of climate change issues has prompted corporations to broaden the scope of efforts to ascertain the greenhouse gas emissions not just of their own operations but also those throughout their entire value chain. Sony has determined emissions from its major component suppliers and manufacturing contractors. Furthermore, based on the level of emissions identified, Sony has estimated greenhouse gas emissions for its entire value chain. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions from Sony\u2019s overall value chain in fiscal year 2021 is estimated to be approximately 17.36 million tons. The largest volume of emissions, approximately 10.73 million tons, was from \u201cenergy consumed during product use.\u201d The next largest category was \u201cgoods and services procured,\u201d which includes raw materials and components, at approximately 3.81 million tons. Sony will continue to strive to identify and manage greenhouse gas emissions over the entire value chain.\n\n*1 Value chain refers to the entire product life cycle process, from procurement of materials through to manufacturing, use and disposal. It includes upstream and downstream manufacturing processes.\n\n*2 Estimated greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s scope 3 accounting and reporting standard and guidelines published by Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions from the Value Chain\n\n- Other: 402,000 tons\n- Upstream transportation and distribution (category 4): 208,000 tons\n- Capital goods (category 2): 1,016,000 tons\n- Purchased goods and services (category 1): 3,810,000 tons\n- Use of sold products (category 11): 10,725,000 tons\n- Sites (Scope 1): 211,000 tons\n- Sites (Scope 2): 984,000 tons\n- Scope 3: 16,160,000 tons\n\nEnvironmental Data\nOverview of Environmental Impact\n\nThe chart below shows Sony\u2019s impact on the environment over the entire life cycle of its business activities, including energy and resources used in business activities, energy consumed by Sony products when used by customers, and the recycling and disposal of products after use. The chart shows the principal environmental impact during fiscal year 2021 for items that Sony can recognize and manage directly.\n\nEnvironmental Data Collection Methods and Rationale\n\nOverview of Sony\u2019s Environmental Impact\n\n*1 Total volume of reused/recycled materials used in products\n*2 Relevant primarily to Sony Group companies in Japan, Europe and North America\n*3 Volume of Class 1-4 chemical substances handled\n\nNote: Business processes other than those shown in this chart\u2014including the production of purchased materials used and the recycling of products\u2014may also have an impact on the environment.\nDisclosure of Climate-related Information in Accordance with the TCFD Recommendations\n\nSony recognizes that its business depends upon the sustainability of the global environment and societies where people can live in security. Based on this understanding, Sony is constantly moving forward with environmental and social initiatives throughout the value chain. In particular, Sony is tackling climate change as one of its priority issues. On May 27, 2019, Sony Group Corporation announced its endorsement of the final report published by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the \u201cTCFD Recommendations\u201d) established by the Financial Stability Board. Sony Group Corporation also participates in the TCFD Consortium, which was established to facilitate implementation and discussion among companies and financial institutions that endorse the TCFD Recommendations in Japan. Sony Group Corporation will continue its climate-related information disclosure in accordance with the TCFD Recommendations.\n\nPolicy on Climate Change\n\nSony reduces energy consumption and is striving to achieve zero greenhouse gases throughout the lifecycle of its products, service and business activities. Specifically, Sony has designated the following initiatives to achieve its medium-term environmental targets, and is working to reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOn-site\n- Promoting efficient energy use\n- Switching to energy sources that are lower in GHG emissions\n- Promoting use of renewable energy\n- Reducing GHG emissions from non-energy related sources\n\nOff-site\n- Developing and providing energy-efficient, environmentally conscious products and services\n- Working with manufacturing subcontractors and suppliers of raw materials and components\n\nGoverance\n\nUnder the Companies Act of Japan, Sony Group Corporation has adopted the \u201cCompany with Three Committees\u201d corporate governance system as the most appropriate system for the company. Under this system, the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) determines Sony\u2019s fundamental management policies and other material matters, while broadly delegating the decision-making authority to conduct Sony\u2019s business operation to Senior Executives in line with their respective responsibilities as defined by the Board, with a view to promoting timely and efficient decision-making within Sony. The Board regularly deliberates and decides upon the mid-term management plan and annual business plan, taking into account various risks and opportunities, including climate change, in its deliberations and decisions. Senior Executives implement strategies according to the management plans and the business plan while carrying out business execution, and the Board receives and discusses reports on the status of business execution as needed. With authority delegated by the Board, the CEO of Sony Group Corporation, who is a member of the Board has responsibility and authority to establish and determine the Sony Group Environmental Vision, which stipulates the corporate philosophy on the global environment and corporate principles including on climate change matters and medium-term environmental targets (Green Management 20XX) both are applicable to entire Sony. The Corporate Executive Officer in charge of sustainability including environmental matters is appointed by the Board, then established the Sony Group Environmental Management Structure, which consists of internal regulations that stipulate the basic framework for global environmental management at Sony. Through the environmental department, this Corporate Executive Officer supervises the initiatives implemented by each business unit and business site to achieve the Sony Group Environmental Vision, and also supervises their operation of and adherence to the Sony Group Environmental Management Structure. In order to address the TCFD Recommendations, environmental department leads the analysis and identification of climate related risks and opportunities through scenario analysis and review the countermeasures. (For more details, see the following \u201cStrategies\u201d section.) The progress on initiatives implemented under this environmental execution framework are regularly reported to and reviewed by the Board. The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine the compensation policy on the content of individual compensation for Senior Executives and other officers, including the CEO, and to determine or oversee the amount of individual compensation paid to Senior Executives. Sustainability including environmental matters is taken into account as a factor in evaluating remuneration linked to business results of Senior Executives. Furthermore, KPIs for initiatives to address sustainability issues that each business emphasizes are set and incorporated into the performance evaluation of each business.\n\nStrategies\n\nIdentifying and Addressing Business Risks\n\nTackling environmental issues is consistent with Sony\u2019s commitment to build a sustainable world and is important in terms of ensuring business continuity. Sony seeks to identify various environment-related risks and address foreseeable risks. This applies to transition risks such as adoption of carbon taxes, regional expansion of emissions trading schemes, stronger regulation of energy efficiency standards for products, and market changes driven by shifting consumer attitudes. It also applies to physical risks such as abnormal weather events and sea level rise due to climate change.\n\nCreating and Expanding Business Opportunities\n\nSony believes that tackling environmental issues also leads to business opportunities. For example, the Paris Agreement*1 that emerged from the COP 21*2 meeting in December 2015 addressed climate change issues, and with increasing public awareness, consumer demand is shifting toward energy-efficient products. Sony has already increased the energy efficiency of many of its products. In light of these social trends, demand for energy-efficient products may continue to grow. One example of this is the development of IM0500, an intelligent vision sensor with AI processing functionality in its image sensor logic chip. We expect it to be used in IoT fields. Processing information through the sensor on its edge enables the transmission of metadata only (semantic information). This reduces the amount of data transmitted to the cloud as well as the amount of data to be processed, which we believe will reduce power consumption.\n\n*1 The Paris Agreement was adopted at COP 21 held in Paris, France and serves as an international framework for climate change action starting from 2020.\n*2 COP 21 refers to the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nScenario Analysis\n\nAnalysis Methodology and Assumptions\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the TCFD Recommendations and advice from external experts, we have conducted Scenario Analysis twice. The first analysis is on climate change impact for the Sony Group conducted from September 2019 to July 2020 (excluding financial business). The same applies after in the first analysis.\n\nTo assess the impact of climate change across the Sony Group, each business segment assessed the degree to which climate change impacts its industry on a four-point scale of \u201cVery Significant,\u201d \u201cSignificant,\u201d \u201cModerate,\u201d and \u201cMinor.\u201d The rating was based on how often climate change impacts were mentioned in the guidelines and assessment methodologies for investors, ESG assessment institutions, and investor initiatives. Based on the analyses, climate change was found to have a moderate impact on the Imaging & Sensing Solutions (I&S&S), Electronics Products & Solutions (Entertainment, Technology and Services from April 1, 2022), and Game & Network Services segments, while having a minor impact on the Music and Pictures segments.\n\nOf the three business areas that are moderately impacted by climate change, the I&S&S segment generates the most greenhouse gas emissions. Sony Group Corporation conducted scenario analyses using multiple scenarios for the segment, in order to identify the risks and opportunities from changes in the external environment that are connected to climate change. For simplicity of analysis, it was assumed that the major businesses comprising the I&S&S segment would not change significantly from fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2030. For the external environment in 2030, we used the 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C temperature rise scenarios predicted by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nIn the second analysis from November 2021 to March 2022 we targeted the financial sector, a key sector in TCFD Recommendations. In order to evaluate impact across the entire financial sector, we conducted scenario analysis on Sony Life Insurance, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank based on individual business characteristics and the exposure of assets held. As prerequisite scenarios, we used the 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenarios.\n\nAnalysis Results and Countermeasures\n\nAs a result of two analyses based on the above prerequisites, recognized risks and opportunities and countermeasures which are unique to the I&S&S segment and financial sector are as shown in the table below.\n\nBased on the results of the above scenario analysis, the entire Sony Group is working toward using 100% renewable electricity in its own operations by 2030 to achieve its RE100* target. Specifically, Sony Group Corporation is examining measures such as directly purchasing renewable electricity from power utilities and purchasing renewable electricity certificates.\n\nAlong with these efforts, in each business segment, Sony develops and enhances risk management and business continuity plans (BCPs) from the perspective of improving risk management across supply chains, through the identification, analysis, and assessment of business continuity risks. Flood damage has grown in recent years due to the impact of climate change, prompting Sony to reassess the flood risk at its manufacturing sites in Japan and implement preventative measures that will mitigate flood damage and facilitate rapid recovery. Sony is collaborating with relevant companies and organizations, and conducts hands-on drills to address foreseeable risks, in an effort to enhance business continuity and accelerate flood recovery.\n\nSony will continue to increase its resilience to climate change, based on its analyses and initiatives.\n\n* A global initiative in which participating corporations aim to operate on 100% renewable electricity. It is headed by an international non-governmental organization, the Climate Group, in partnership with the CDP.\n\n### I&S&S segment\n\n| Assumed scenario | Recognized risks and opportunities | Countermeasures |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 2\u00b0C scenario     | Stiffer regulations due to national decarbonization policies worldwide and the introduction of carbon pricing will lead to an increase in crude oil and fossil fuel prices.

Actual events may differ from the scenarios.\nRisk Management\n\nEach business unit, subsidiary/affiliated company and corporate division of Sony periodically reviews and assesses risks for the area of which it is in charge and works on finding, reporting, reviewing and responding to the risks. In addition, Senior Executives have established and maintain a system to identify and control risks that may cause losses to Sony, in the areas of which they are in charge. The Corporate Executive Officer in charge of group risk control comprehensively promotes and manages the establishment and maintenance of the systems as stated above through the activities with related departments. The Board of Directors receives regular reports on the framework and its operational status, to confirm the validity of the framework. Under the framework, each business unit, subsidiary/affiliated company and corporate division also assesses and analyzes climate-related risks, when assembling business strategies and business plans.\n\nMetrics and Targets\n\nIn 2010, the Sony Group formulated the Road to Zero global environmental plan, which aims to reduce its environmental footprint to zero by 2050. The target year for our goal of achieving carbon neutrality group-wide was moved up from 2050 to 2040 in May 2022. For climate change action, Sony is developing and supplying environmentally conscious products and services in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions not only from manufacturing at its sites, but also throughout the life cycle of its products. Sony is also making energy-efficiency improvements at its business sites and shifting to renewable energy, while encouraging contract manufacturers and component suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn September 2020, Sony Group Corporation announced its Green Management 2025 medium-term environmental targets to achieve by the end of fiscal year ending on March 31, 2026 and has been implementing initiatives to meet these targets since April 2021. In GM2025, the life cycle of products has been divided into five stages: product/service planning and design, operations, supply chain, logistics, take back and recycling. At each stage, Sony has set specific targets from the four perspectives of climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity, and implemented initiatives to achieve these targets. Climate change targets include a 5% reduction in annual energy consumption per Sony product (compared to fiscal year 2018). Along with moving up the year to meet our climate change targets, we have also changed the target rate for renewable electricity used in our facilities from 15% or more to 35% or more. Both our 1.5\u00b0C target to be achieved by 2035 and our net zero target to be achieved by 2040 are approved by the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative as climate change targets based on scientific grounds. In the financial sector, we have long made investments and loans in a variety of sustainable bonds, including green bonds. We established the Sony Financial Group ESG Investment Policy in April 2022, and our financial group companies are now proceeding to establish systems for ESG investment in accordance with this policy.\n\n* An international initiative to encourage companies to set science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets in order to limit the increase in the average global temperature due to climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.\n\n\u21d2 Green Management 2025\n\u21d2 Green Management 2025 Targets and Progress\nContributions to Solving Environmental Issues\n\nDevelopment of Environmental Technologies\n\nSony regards working to realize a sustainable society as a key theme and is conducting technological development to solve both environmental and social issues, not only in our business\u2019s technology development departments, but also in our R&D Center, Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL), and other R&D organizations. This includes the promotion of next-generation development in projects like Sony\u2019s Earth MIMAMORI platform, which utilizes sensing on a global scale to help prevent environmental destruction, and Synecoculture\u2122, which creates a rich ecosystem through new farming methods.\n\nThere are a variety of departments responsible for the development and utilization of technologies that contribute to sustainability. Among these, we established the Sustainability Technology Liaison Meeting, which meets regularly to identify issues, search for, and share solutions. At meetings, information is actively exchanged, such as on a framework that organizes items to be considered while balancing social and economic viability of business activities and technology related to sustainability, and also on a map that visualizes activities in each department.\n\n\u2192 Contributing via Technological Development\n\nEnvironmentally and Socially Beneficial Products and Services\n\nSony works to create products, services and systems that solve environmental and social issues through electronic equipment and a wide range of business areas.\n\nLicensing of New Material Triporous\u2122\n\nTriporous is a plant-based porous carbon material with excellent adsorption qualities. Sony obtained end-to-end patents on this material and began licensing Triporous in 2019. Triporous is made from rice husks, which Japan alone generates around two million tons per year, and this excess biomass is part of approximately 100 million tons generated annually worldwide. Manufacturing Triporous can reduce air pollutants and greenhouse gases more than using incinerator disposal. Thanks to its microstructure derived from rice husks, Triporous has unique adsorption properties different from those of activated carbon. This porosity can be leveraged for a variety of applications, such as for high-performance environmental cleaning filters and facilities that remove pollutants in water and air. Triporous is currently being applied in apparel for deodorizing fibers and in the health care field for cleaning agents. As apparel with deodorizing fibers, it has also been selected as an idea of daily necessities to be installed on the International Space Station. Through our Triporous business, Sony will work with partners to solve a variety of social issues, helping to realize a more environmentally conscious, recycling-oriented society.\n\n\u2192 Contributing via Technological Development\n\nExternal Sales of SORPLAS\u2122 Recycled Plastic\n\nSony commenced external sales of its proprietary Sustainable Oriented Recycled Plastic (SORPLAS) in 2014. SORPLAS is a flame-retardant recycled plastic that offers excellent heat resistance, durability, and recyclability. It contains up to 99% recycled materials. SORPLAS was first used in Sony products in 2011 and has since been incorporated into a wide variety of Sony products. By now offering SORPLAS to other companies, Sony aims to promote the recycling of resources and help reduce the environmental impact of society as a whole. Many companies are interested in using SORPLAS. It is already being used in a wide variety of products, including televisions, cameras, smartphones, computers, lighting fixtures, and daily necessities such as travel goods and stationery.\n\n\u2192 Contributing via Technological Development\n\nMore information about the environmental performance of Triporous\u2122\n\nNews Release: Sony Begins Licensing of New Material Triporous\u2122\n\nNews Release: Proposal for using Triporous\u2122 selected as an idea for daily necessities aiming to be installed on the International Space Station (in Japanese)\nSocial Implementation of the Open Energy System\u2122\n\nSony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL) is developing a distributed scalable energy system to promote the introduction of locally produced and consumed renewable energy, as well as the decarbonization of local communities. To this end, the Autonomous Power Interchange System (APIS), a core module of the proprietary microgrid Open Energy System\u2122, was made open source and has been available free of charge since 2020.\n\nIn addition to a past demonstration test with the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduated University, Sony CSL additionally launched the UMABA Project in July 2021 at the working vacation facility, Umaba School Cottage, in Miyoshi, Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. This demonstration test is conducted with various partners from academia, industry and local governments and communities. In this test, we aim to demonstrate how the consortium and its technologies can contribute to decarbonization through sharing of renewable energy via storage and battery-based electric vehicles over an alternative current network.\n\nSony CSL does not maintain exclusive rights to these OES-related technologies. Instead, by making APIS, the core module, open source, we aim to promote rapid and widespread adoption of renewable energy with greater cooperation from stakeholders in order to realize a sustainable society.\n\nFeliCa\u2122 IC Card Passenger Ticketing Systems\n\nSony\u2019s smart card passenger ticketing system, based on FeliCa contactless IC card technology, is helping to alleviate air pollution in Bangladesh. The city is facing serious air pollution issues due to increasing traffic congestion. The national bus company decided to adopt a FeliCa smart card passenger ticketing system in order to encourage the residents of Bangladesh to use municipal buses. The FeliCa based system has made it easier for users to get on and off buses. This added convenience has attracted more riders, which is in turn helping to alleviate traffic congestion.\n\nSupporting Environmental Projects Using Drones\n\nThe Sony Group\u2019s Aerosense Inc. combines automated flight drones with cloud services to build and provide various industrial solutions. They enable high-precision drone surveying that helps save labor at civil engineering sites nationwide. This technology is also used for confirmation work in natural disaster response and prevention, bolstering national resilience by allowing damage to be quickly investigated during such events. Safe and efficient inspection and investigation methods that do not require people to travel to the sites are needed as occurrences of natural disasters increase due to abnormal weather. As one such solution, in 2021, Aerosense successfully completed a demonstration test to collectively inspect multiple sand control dams through drones suited to wide flight areas that utilized LTE* communications. This technology enables safe and efficient mountain surveying, paving the way for disaster response and prevention through regular inspections and emergency surveys immediately following a natural disaster.\n\nIn 2021, we conducted a demonstration test of logistics by drones in depopulated areas in five projects in coordination with the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.\n\nDigital Cinema Systems\n\nPrevious film development required a massive amount of positive film, water and chemicals. To rectify this issue, Sony developed the HDW-F900, the world\u2019s first digital video camera for cinema production, back in the year 2000, and began offering 4K digital cinema projection systems consisting of projectors and other devices in 2007. Since then, we have continued to provide digital cameras to movie production sites and theaters worldwide. These cameras save both resources and power and improve operation efficiency.\n\nOur VENICE Digital Cinema Camera was released in 2018. This camera was both smaller and lighter than conventional models, yet capable of 6K recording. Then, in 2022, we released VENICE 2, which supports internal recording within the camera, making filming systems even smaller and lighter.\n\n* LTE: Long Term Evolution. This communication standard is used for mobile wireless communication in smartphones and other cellular phones, and is capable of sending large amounts of data.\n\nMore information about the compact and lightweight VENICE 2 Digital Cinema Camera\nReducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nSony products consume electrical power while used by their owners, resulting in indirect emissions of CO2. Sony has adopted the target of reducing annual energy consumption per product* from product use by 5% by fiscal year 2025 compared to the fiscal year 2018 level. Sony sets specific fiscal year targets in every product category and is implementing diverse measures to reduce energy consumption. Annual energy consumption of products in fiscal year 2021 was up 3.3% compared to 2018. For example, select BRAVIA\u2122 televisions include a sensor*2 that detects user movement to automatically reduce screen brightness, reducing power consumption when no one is in front of the TV. PlayStation\u00ae5 incorporates energy efficient features to suspend and resume game play at 0.5 watts or less if activated and uses around 80% less electricity in rest mode compared with the latest models of PS4 and PS4 Pro (on average). However, due to larger products, higher levels of performance and additional functions, 2021 power consumption Sony-wide increased by 10.73 million tons, which was 0.9% higher than in fiscal year 2018.*4\n\nConserving Resources\n\nReducing Resources Used in Products\n\nSony is working to reduce the average mass of products in order to minimize resource inputs. In fiscal year 2021, the total volume of resources used in products* was approximately 436 thousand tons, which was 15% lower than in fiscal year 2018. This is due to continuous efforts to reduce the size and weight of both products and packaging in a wide range of product categories, as well as a decrease in the number of units sold.\n\nUsing Fewer Resources in Products and Packages\n\nSony is working to make its products and packages even more lightweight and compact across a wide range of product categories in order to conserve resources.\n\nExtending Product Life to Save Resources\n\nSony indirectly reduces resource consumption by extending product life. The Xperia\u2122 Smartphone, released in fiscal year 2021, features unique charging optimization technology that adjusts the amount of charge according to a user\u2019s individual usage habits, and a \u201ccareful charging\u201d function that reduces load on the battery during charging. These features promote long-lasting batteries that don\u2019t deteriorate, even after three years* of use. This allows for a product to be used long-term, reducing battery and product waste.\n\n* Based on a simulation that repeatedly charges and discharges with the same type of battery (for USB charging). Battery life varies by use.\nSony is working to reduce paper use across a wide range of its businesses. For our electronics products, we continue to prioritize ease of customer understanding for instruction manuals, while moving online in a variety of product categories to reduce paper use. We had previously included instructions for multiple languages for overseas models of audio products such as Walkman\u00ae or headphones, but have now unified these after-purchase instructions by introducing the Textless Quick Start Guide (TQSG), which uses illustrations that users can easily understand regardless of language since 2015. For our LinkBuds, released in 2022, we removed after-purchase paper instructions entirely, instead providing a QR code on the packaging to enable users to use their smartphone to access the online Help Guide. Further, we revised the precautions and specifications that must be provided in paper manuals to reduce paper included in packaging by 85%. Moving forward, we intend to extend these efforts to additional audio products and further reduce paper usage. The Sony Financial Group has been reducing the use of paper for contracts and transactions, employing digital technology to both to conserve paper resources and reduce mailing, which produces carbon emissions.\n\n**Saving Resources in Promotional Materials**\n\nSony is working to reduce resource consumption in products and packaging as well as in shop-front promotional materials. In Japan, make-to-stock has been the main system for promotional material production, but by shifting to build-to-order, only the required number is produced and sent directly to the shopfront. Further, we have adopted a long-life design that can be reused for multiple years, saving resources used for promotional materials.\n\n**Reducing Use of Virgin Plastics**\n\n**Virgin Plastic Used Per Product**\n\nWith the target of reducing virgin oil-based plastic used per product by 10% from the fiscal year 2018 level, by fiscal year 2025 (excluding packaging), Sony is working to expand its use of recycled plastics and make its product chassis more lightweight and compact while also minimizing plastic packaging. In fiscal year 2021, virgin oil-based plastic used per product was down approximately 3.1% from the fiscal year 2018 level. This is mainly due to the advancement of recycled plastics across a wide range of product categories, such as televisions.\n\n**Incorporating Recycled Plastic**\n\nTo reduce the consumption of virgin plastic, Sony has expanded the use of recycled plastics in a broad range of product categories by developing recycled plastics while elevating quality and reducing manufacturing costs. Sony is using its original recycled plastic SORPLAS\u2122 in the rear cover of select BRAVIA\u2122 televisions. Recycled plastic is now used in some soundbar and headphones models as well. In fiscal year 2021, the Sony Group used some 21 thousand tons* of recycled plastic in its products. This amount consisted of approximately 37% recycled plastic content from scraps and other waste materials generated from manufacturing by the Sony Group and other companies, and approximately 63% post-consumer recycled plastic content from used products, containers, and other sources. We have used approximately 184 thousand tons* of recycled plastic from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2021.\n\n* Consumption of recycled plastic is based on the gross value including virgin plastic and additives that are mixed with recycled materials.\n\n**SORPLAS\u2122, Sony\u2019s Original Flame-Retardant Recycled Plastic**\n\nIn 2011, Sony began practical use of Sustainable Oriented Recycled Plastic (SORPLAS), a flame-retardant recycled plastic made possible by a proprietary compounding technology that combines an original, non-halogen and non-phosphorus flame retardant\u2014itself produced using a Sony-developed process\u2014and waste plastics (polycarbonate resin) from various sources in an optimal blend. Thanks to Sony\u2019s novel flame-retardant, which makes it possible to impart flame-retardancy by the addition of a very small amount of less than 1% of total content while conventional flame retardants require an addition amount of around 10%, SORPLAS not only surpasses conventional flame retardant plastics in terms of durability, heat resistance and recyclability, but also achieves an outstanding utilization rate of up to 99% waste plastics. The effective utilization of SORPLAS has been shown to reduce CO\u2082 emissions in product manufacturing by up to 80%.* Moreover, Sony\u2019s versatile waste-plastic compounding technology makes it possible to tailor SORPLAS to the needs of a variety of products. Sony first used SORPLAS in its products in 2011 and has since incorporated it into a wide variety of Sony products such as select models of BRAVIA\u2122, Xperia\u2122 Smartphones, compact cameras and camcorders.\n\n* In the case of SORPLAS in the BRAVIA\u2122 LCD TV KDL-40EX52H, based on Sony calculations, assuming plastic manufacturing (including shipping)\n\n**External Sales of SORPLAS\u2122 Recycled Plastic**\n\nLeading the development of recycled plastics\n\n**Volume of additive required for material to meet flame-retardancy standard (V-O rating at 1.5 mm)**\n\n![Graph showing the volume of additive required for material to meet flame-retardancy standard (V-O rating at 1.5 mm)](image)\n\n**BRAVIA\u2122 Environmental Initiatives**\n\n**Soundbar and Wireless Speaker Initiatives**\n\n**Headphones Initiatives**\n\n**SORPLAS\u2122, Sony\u2019s Original Flame-Retardant Recycled Plastic**\n\nIn 2011, Sony began practical use of Sustainable Oriented Recycled Plastic (SORPLAS), a flame-retardant recycled plastic made possible by a proprietary compounding technology that combines an original, non-halogen and non-phosphorus flame retardant\u2014itself produced using a Sony-developed process\u2014and waste plastics (polycarbonate resin) from various sources in an optimal blend. Thanks to Sony\u2019s novel flame-retardant, which makes it possible to impart flame-retardancy by the addition of a very small amount of less than 1% of total content while conventional flame retardants require an addition amount of around 10%, SORPLAS not only surpasses conventional flame retardant plastics in terms of durability, heat resistance and recyclability, but also achieves an outstanding utilization rate of up to 99% waste plastics. The effective utilization of SORPLAS has been shown to reduce CO\u2082 emissions in product manufacturing by up to 80%.* Moreover, Sony\u2019s versatile waste-plastic compounding technology makes it possible to tailor SORPLAS to the needs of a variety of products. Sony first used SORPLAS in its products in 2011 and has since incorporated it into a wide variety of Sony products such as select models of BRAVIA\u2122, Xperia\u2122 Smartphones, compact cameras and camcorders.\n\n* In the case of SORPLAS in the BRAVIA\u2122 LCD TV KDL-40EX52H, based on Sony calculations, assuming plastic manufacturing (including shipping)\nReducing Plastic Packaging\n\nMarine pollution due to plastic waste is a growing issue worldwide that Sony takes very seriously. Sony has adopted the targets of reducing plastic packaging used per product by 10% and eliminating plastic packaging from newly-designed small products, and is actively working to reduce the amount of single-use plastic packaging used in a range of product categories.\n\nIndividual packaging uses zero plastic*1 for the WF-1000XM4 headphones, the Xperia PRO-I Smartphone and the \u03b17 IV - Full-frame Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Camera released in 2021. For the individual packaging of the WF-1000XM4, Sony\u2019s proprietary Original Blended Material paper is used for everything except the label.\n\n*1 Individual packaging refers to the individual product box and packaging inside the box.\n\nFor PlayStation\u00ae5 (PS5\u2122), we shifted to paper to eliminate as much plastic packaging as possible, resulting in a 1-7% plastic usage rate for console and peripheral packaging (by weight, varies by product).\n\nThe plastic film to protect the display and the plastic bag to protect the body of the Xperia\u2122 Smartphone were replaced with paper for the Xperia PRO-I released in 2021. Furthermore, our \u03b17 IV - Full-frame Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Camera uses pulp molds and other recyclable*2 materials.\n\n*2 Coating and adhesive materials excluded.\n\nReducing Plastic inside Product Boxes\n\nBy minimizing packaging materials using packaging drop simulation technology, Sony reduced the amount of plastic packaging used for the 4K LCD TV KJ-55X85K, launched in 2022, by approximately 35%.*1\n\nFor PlayStation\u00ae5 (PS5\u2122), we shifted to paper to eliminate as much plastic packaging as possible, resulting in a 1-7% plastic usage rate for console and peripheral packaging (by weight, varies by product).\n\nManaging Chemical Substances\n\nSony\u2019s Proprietary Global Standards for the Management of Chemical Substances\n\nMany of Sony\u2019s electronics products contain between a few hundred and a few thousand parts that are made of a variety of chemical substances, some of which may be classified as hazardous and may harm the environment if they are not properly controlled prior to product disposal. To prevent such environmental harm, some countries and regions have introduced laws and directives. In the European Union, certain chemical substances in products are restricted by Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive*1 and REACH*2 regulation. In Japan, products that contain certain chemical substances are required to carry the J-Moss*3 mark, while in China it is required to disclose information on chemical substances contained in products in line with the Management Methods on the Pollution Control of Electronic Information Products, often referred to as China RoHS.*4\n\nIn light of the global nature of its markets and supply chains, Sony has established its own global standards for the management of chemical substances, titled \u201cManagement Regulations for the Environment-related Substances to be Controlled which are Included in Parts and Materials (SS-00259),\u201d*5 taking into account the related laws and regulations around the world and simultaneously the opinions of various stakeholders. In line with these standards, Sony ensures globally consistent management of chemical substances in parts and materials.\n\n*1 Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electric and electronic products (RoHS).\n\n*2 REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) is a regulation for managing chemical substances introduced in Europe, whereby companies are required to, among others, register, apply for authorization, notify, restrict and communicate information on certain chemical substances.\n\n*3 J-Moss refers to Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) for marking the presence of certain chemical substances in electrical and electronic equipment.\n\n*4 Management Methods on the Pollution Control of Electronic Information Products regulates the use of six substances, including lead and mercury, in electronic products and components sold in the Chinese market.\n\n*5 Management Regulations for the Environment-related Substances to be Controlled which are Included in Parts and Materials (SS-00259) refers to Sony standards that are used for giving directions to suppliers on chemical substances for items procured by Sony. (For more information, please refer to \u201cControlled Substances - SS-00259 for General Use\u201d at the Sony website.)\n\nManagement Regulations for Environment-related Substances to be Controlled which are Included in Parts and Materials (SS-00259)\nComplying with Regulations Governing Chemical Substances in Products\n\nSony has set up necessary procedures to ensure compliance with the EU\u2019s REACH regulation requirements and revised RoHS Directive. In response to its obligation under REACH to provide information to customers, as well as to the CE marking requirement of the RoHS directive, Sony has adopted the chemSHERPA*1 scheme based on IEC 62474.*2 This enables Sony to collect data on specified chemical substances in parts and materials purchased from suppliers for management in an internal database.\n\nManagement in Quality Control/Quality Assurance Processes\n\nNew parts and materials are tested to ensure conformity with SS-00259 standards in addition to compliance with conventional quality control standards. Data on the content of certain chemical substances collected from suppliers are thoroughly evaluated for this purpose. By implementing these strict management procedures worldwide, incompitant products are prevented from entering the market.\n\nUtilization of Chemical Analysis\n\nTo prevent prohibited substances from accidentally entering products, Sony requires suppliers to conduct ICP analysis on the specific parts and materials. For some high-risk substances Sony has also implemented internal control systems that involve using, for example, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and other measurement devices, to Sony sites worldwide, to help confirm that prohibited substances are kept out of products.\n\nThree Core Principles for Managing Chemical Substances in Products\n\nTo guide its efforts to manage chemical substances in products in compliance with Sony\u2019s own global standards for management of chemical substances, titled \u201cManagement Regulations for Environment-related Substances to be Controlled which are included in Parts and Materials\u201d (SS-00259), Sony has established three core principles:\n\nUpstream Management\n\nIn 2002, Sony established the Green Partner Environmental Quality Approval Program, which outlines Sony\u2019s Green Partner Standards for chemical substance management. Sony audits suppliers based on these standards. Sony purchases electronic parts only from suppliers who have passed this audit and have been certified as Green Partners. Sony also applies the Green Partner Environmental Quality Approval Program to manufacturing partners. To further enhance the efficiency of the system to manage chemical substances, in 2003 Sony introduced the Green Book, a raw materials database, which was made available to Sony\u2019s direct suppliers via its electronic supplier portal. In the Green Book, Sony has registered only those materials that it has measured and confirmed compliance with the SS-00259 standards for Sony\u2019s designated raw materials such as recycled plastics and wires, and also for molding resins, paints, inks, and other materials that are commonly used by multiple first tier suppliers. To assist REACH compliance, Sony has collected information on raw materials listed in Green Book data on the content of certain chemical substances and makes this data available to its suppliers and contract manufacturers.\n\nSystem for Managing Chemical Substances in Products\n\nSubstance Management in Xperia\u2122 Smartphones\n\nIn the smartphone category, Sony began phasing out brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in circuit boards, casings, and cables starting in 2002, making it one of the first companies in the industry to phase out BFRs. Since then Sony has continued the journey and phased out BFRs in all parts, and also phased out chlorinated flame retardants (CFRs), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), as well as phthalates, beryllium, and antimony trioxide in plastic and resin. Going forward, Sony will continue phasing out all brominated and chlorinated compounds as well as antimony.\n\nManagement of Chemical Substances in Packaging Materials\n\nSony takes precautions to increase the safety of its packaging materials and ensure that hazardous substances, including heavy metals, are not mixed into packaging materials by managing materials in line with its proprietary \u201cManagement Regulations for Environment-related Substances to be Controlled which are included in Parts and Materials\u201d (SS-00259). The packaging section of SS-00259 is based on, among others, EU directives on packaging and packaging waste.\n\nNote: Since fiscal year 2003, Sony\u2019s raw materials database (the Green Book) has been available to Sony\u2019s direct suppliers via its electronic procurement system.\nReduction and Replacement of Chemical Substances of Very High Concern\n\nSony defines \u201cEnvironment-related Substances to be Controlled\u201d (hereafter \u201cControlled Substances\u201d) as certain chemicals that it has determined to have significant impact on both humans and the global environment, including substances that may not be controlled by laws (please refer to Management Regulations for Environment-related Substances to be controlled which are included in Parts and Materials (SS-00259)). Sony either prohibits the use of these substances in parts or phases them out wherever a viable alternative that meets all product quality and technical requirements is available. In addition, Sony specifies high-risk applications from collected application- and content-related information, considering the hazardous nature and extent of exposure (volume) as risk factors, and proceeds to prohibit the \u201cControlled Substances\u201d in the specified use.\n\nManagement Regulations for Environment-related Substances to be controlled which are included in Parts and Materials (SS-00259)\n\nPolyvinyl Chloride (PVC)\n\nImproper disposal of PVCs poses a risk of generating hazardous substances. For example, Sony is concerned about the possibility that its small electronic products, in particular, could be collected to obtain valuable materials, and then the unwanted parts could be improperly incinerated and disposed of in landfills, thus causing adverse environmental impacts. In addition, there are also concerns about the environmental and health impact of some of the substances used as plasticizers and stabilizers in PVCs. Although PVCs are not currently regulated by any laws that apply to chemical substances used in electronic products, Sony works to reduce PVC content in individual components. As a result, Sony does not use PVCs in product packaging materials (with the exception of some packing materials for devices, semiconductors, batteries, and similar items) or in sheets/laminates used for product housings, contactless IC cards, and carrying bags/cases for products (excluding those for professional use). Sony has also successfully replaced PVCs by substitute materials for internal components that are difficult to remove prior to recycling, such as flexible flat cables, insulation plates, and heat-shrink tubes (excluding those for batteries). Also, Sony is working to end the use of PVCs in the housings and internal wiring of small electronic devices (the adoption of alternatives is subject to the ability to resolve issues relating to quality, technology, and supply). As of the end of July 2022, Sony has replaced PVCs in new products and new models in the following products with alternative substances.\n\n| PVC-Free Product Categories* | BFR-Free Product Categories* |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Xperia\u2122 Smartphone          | Xperia\u2122 Smartphone          |\n| MP3 players WALKMAN\u00ae        | MP3 players WALKMAN\u00ae        |\n| IC recorder / Portable Radio Recorder / Sound Monitoring Receiver | IC recorder / Portable Radio Recorder / Linear PCM Recorder / Sound Monitoring Receiver |\n| Video Camera Handycam\u00ae      | Video Camera Handycam\u00ae      |\n| Digital Still Camera Cyber-shot\u2122 | Digital Still Camera Cyber-shot\u2122 |\n| Interchangeable lens camera \u03b1\u2122 | Interchangeable lens camera \u03b1\u2122 |\n| Memory Stick\u2122               | Memory Stick\u2122               |\n| SxS\u2122 memory card            | SxS\u2122 memory card            |\n\n* Parts in which PVC is eliminated are as below (excluding bundled/standalone accessories):\n  - Xperia Smartphones: in all plastic components.\n  - Products other than Xperia Smartphones: in casings and internal wiring.\n\nExamples of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) - Free Products and Brominated Flame Retardant (BFR) - Free Products\n\nBrominated Flame Retardants (BFRs)\n\nSome BFRs are harmful to human health and tend to remain in the environment and accumulate in living organisms. As is the case with PVC, improper incineration of BFRs carries a risk of releasing harmful substances into the environment. Sony has banned the use of the components and materials containing any of three specified BFRs \u2014 polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polybrominated biphenyls, or hexabromocyclododecanes \u2014 and is working to phase out BFRs (the adoption of which is subject to the resolution of issues relating to quality, technology, and supply).\n\nSony has banned the use of tris (2-chloro ethyl) phosphate, a chlorinated flame retardant identified as carrying risks similar to those associated with brominated flame retardants, as well as phosphoric acid tris (2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ester (TCP) and tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP). Also, Sony is working to use Sony developed environmentally sound, bromine-free flame retardant for the manufacture of a polycarbonate plastic flame retardant in some product categories such as LCD TV. As of the end of July 2022, Sony has replaced BFRs in new products and new models in the following products with alternative substances.\nCreating Environmentally Conscious Products\n\nPromoting Environmentally Conscious Design\n\nSony has set medium-term environmental targets for products, including reducing annual power consumption, promoting resource conservation and managing chemical substances. Business units set areas of focus based on Sony medium-term environmental targets and targets based on the specific characteristics of the environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of targeted product categories. In the course of product design, environmental targets are set for each product according to business unit targets and feedback about previous models to execute an environmentally conscious design. Environmental assessments are conducted and progress toward these targets is reviewed before mass-production of a product begins. Business units receive feedback on the results of this review, conduct their own review of progress with their medium-term environmental targets for each product, and report results to the department in charge of environmental functions at headquarters. In turn, this department evaluates the targets and progress of each business unit and conducts an overall review of the Sony Group\u2019s progress on achieving its medium-term environmental targets. Based on the results of this review, Sony determines areas of focus for the subsequent fiscal year. This method enables Sony to execute ongoing environmentally conscious processes for the department in charge of environmental functions at headquarters, as well as each business unit and product, which in turn ensure the development of environmentally conscious products.\n\nDesigning Environmentally Conscious Products: Key Considerations\n\n| Observe relevant laws in individual countries | \u2022 Product energy efficiency regulations  \n\u2022 Regulations concerning chemical substances in products  \n\u2022 Product recycling regulations |\n| Reduction of energy consumption | \u2022 Aim for zero energy use in standby mode  \n\u2022 Reduce power use in all modes  \n\u2022 Enhance the efficiency of external power supply  \n\u2022 Incorporate energy-saving features in products |\n| Resource conservation | \u2022 Ease of disassembly/repairability  \n\u2022 Use recyclable materials  \n\u2022 Reduce product weight  \n\u2022 Extend product life |\n| Management of chemical substances | \u2022 Controlled substances  \n\u2022 Compliance with technical standards |\n| Other | \u2022 Improve shipping efficiency by limiting weight of packaged products |\n\nManagement Structure for Environmentally Conscious Product Development\n\n- **Headquarters (Department in charge of environmental functions)**: Determine areas of focus based on medium-term environmental targets.\n- **Business Unit**: Formulate business unit targets and review progress of business unit targets.\n- **Product design**: Set environmental targets for each product, execute environmentally conscious design, and review progress toward targets before mass-production begins.\n- **Issue Report**: Review progress of business unit targets and overall Sony Group targets.\n\nExamples of Environmental Features in Sony Products\n\nSony is working on environmentally conscious and recycling-friendly designs and is improving environmental performance in terms of energy and resource conservation in a wide range of product categories. Signature products for these efforts are introduced on Sony Group Portal Website \u201cEnvironment.\u201d\n\nDesigning Recyclability and Reparability into Products\n\nOne initiative Sony is taking to ensure that its products are environmentally conscious involves designing them with recyclability and reparability in mind. This means, for example, labeling the material type of plastic used in parts to make it easier to extract resources from used products during recycling, and reducing the number of screws to make it easier to dismantle and repair the product. These specific environmental considerations are compiled and incorporated into the design of each product. For example, Sony has issued Environmental Design Standards and Guidelines for TVs and Serviceability Standards, which are used when planning and designing new products, and monitors progress on meeting these standards. These design standards and guidelines reflect the trends in regulations inside and outside of Japan as well as Sony\u2019s medium-term environmental targets. Sony conducts an annual review and revision of these guidelines based on industry trends and the latest recycling information, which is gathered via regular sharing of information and opinions with the Green Cycle Corporation, an affiliate of Sony engaged in the recycling business. Additionally, in order to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations regarding circular economy in Europe, Sony provides information on repair and disassembly of the display products such as TVs and commercial monitors on the support page of the website for repair shops and recyclers, and provides dealers and retailers with reparability index information for TV and smartphone products sold in France.\nUtilizing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)\n\nProduct life cycle assessment (LCA) is a means of identifying and quantifying the environmental impact of products at all stages of their life cycles, which include the manufacture of materials and parts used in products, the assembly and transport of products, product use and standby mode, and end of life (i.e., disposal and recycling). LCA of major products helps us to clarify priorities for product improvement for all product categories and reduce the environmental impact of Sony products.\n\nAs shown in the graph to the right titled \u201cBreakdown of CO2 Emissions Over the Life Cycle of Signature Sony Products,\u201d we see that the life cycle stages responsible for generating a large portion of a product\u2019s CO2 emissions differ depending on the product category. For example, for product categories such as LCD televisions, and Blu-ray Disc\u2122/DVD players, emissions during product use account for a large proportion of total emissions. For this reason, reducing the power consumption of these products during use is particularly important. Conversely, among product categories such as smartphones and interchangeable lens camera \u03b1\u2122, a large portion of CO2 emissions occur in the production of materials and parts, rather than during use. For these products, such measures as reducing product weight are crucial in lowering life cycle CO2 emissions. LCA results are reflected in medium-term environmental targets and utilized in product design for the environment.\n\n* The \u201cBlu-ray Disc\u2122\u201d word mark is a trademark of the Blu-ray Disc Association.\nSupply Chain\n\nReducing Environmental Impact Across the Supply Chain\n\nWorking with Material and Component Suppliers and Outsourcing Contractors to Reduce the Impact on the Environment\n\nAs a part of its efforts to reduce environmental impact across the supply chain, we request that our materials and components suppliers and subcontractors handle both greenhouse gas and water depletion issues. For GHG emissions, Sony requests them to monitor emission levels, set medium- and long-term targets for emissions reduction and perform progress management. For water depletion, Sony requests them to set targets for water consumption reduction in consideration of water depletion risk in the areas where the site is located. Sony conducts surveys on efforts to reduce environmental burden in order to understand the impact greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, etc., by sites on manufacturing materials, components and products, delivered to Sony.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, Sony obtained answers about a variety of data from materials and components suppliers which account for approximately 80% of the total transaction value and from subcontractors which account for approximately 90% of the total transaction value. We encourage accurate calculation of GHG emissions for suppliers for whom this information cannot be calculated.\n\nOur 1.5\u00b0C Science Based Target (SBT) stipulates materials and components suppliers and subcontractors will set SBT-consistent reduction targets equivalent to 10% of supply chain GHG emissions by fiscal year 2025. To this end, Sony provides SBT guidance during surveys to them and supports target setting and certification acquisition of SBT-consistent targets for some suppliers.\n\nWith regard to chemical substances, Sony requires its materials and components suppliers and subcontractors to comply with laws and regulations in each country restricting or banning the use of chemical substances in materials, components, semi-finished goods and finished products delivered to Sony based on Sony\u2019s own chemical substance management standards. Sony requests that substances restricted under international frameworks and separately designated by Sony not be used in the manufacturing process and continues to investigate the use of these substances.\n\nPromoting Green Purchasing\n\nHaving set internal standards for green purchasing, Sony chooses environmentally conscious products when procuring nonproduction materials such as printing paper, stationery and office equipment in Japan. At the same time, in principle, Sony carefully examines needs, amounts to be used and stock levels to purchase appropriate quantities. In addition, when choosing products to be purchased, Sony prioritizes select recommended products in consideration of environmental impact at all stages of a product\u2019s life, from resource extraction through to production, distribution, use and disposal. Information on recommended products is included in Sony\u2019s purchasing system of nonproduction materials, making it possible for individuals in charge of purchasing decisions to give priority to environmentally conscious products.\n\nOur 1.5\u00b0C Science Based Target (SBT) stipulates materials and components suppliers and subcontractors will set SBT-consistent reduction targets equivalent to 10% of supply chain GHG emissions by fiscal year 2025. To this end, Sony provides SBT guidance during surveys to them and supports target setting and certification acquisition of SBT-consistent targets for some suppliers.\nIn fiscal year 2021, emissions of CO2 from energy use at Sony sites amounted to approximately 8,000 tons. Going forward, Sony will take efforts to restrict greenhouse gas emissions through infrastructure-related measures, including the installation of high-efficiency equipment and the promotion of energy recycling, and to enhance nonstructural measures, notably the introduction of training programs designed to foster energy-saving leaders.\n\n**Emissions of PFCs and Other Greenhouse Gases**\n\nPFCs and other greenhouse gases with high global warming potential are used in cleaning and etching processes during the manufacturing of semiconductors. Emissions of PFCs and other greenhouse gases in fiscal year 2021 (calculated in terms of CO2) totaled approximately 105,000 tons, up about 7,000 tons from fiscal year 2020. Introduction of PFC abatement equipment and other reduction initiatives have been carried out, but total emissions increased due to the growth in semiconductor device production.\n\n**Promoting Efficient Energy Use**\n\nTo achieve its fiscal year 2025 reduction targets, Sony is working on various energy conservation activities at its sites around the world. A sample of these initiatives follows.\n\n**High Efficiency Energy Systems for Factories**\n\nSony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Nagasaki Technology Center (Nagasaki TEC) aimed to be the most energy efficient factory in the semiconductor industry upon construction of the Fab 5 building. In the refrigerators and boilers that control the temperature and humidity of clean rooms used for semiconductor manufacturing, AI is utilized, and advanced control technology operates the refrigerators at minimum power, while another system reuses the production equipment exhaust heat to power the boiler. These innovations improved clean room energy efficiency by approximately 30% compared to fiscal year 2015. Sony Device Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd (SDT), installed an energy-efficient air conditioning system when it reconstructed its clean room for semiconductor production. The system requires less airflow than conventional air-conditioning systems to keep the work area clean, enabling it to reduce its annual CO2 emissions by approximately 2,700 tons, a 67% reduction compared to the previous system.\n\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Project at STT-C**\n\nSony Technology (Thailand) Chonburi Plant (STT-C) has reduced greenhouse gas emissions from its cooling system thanks to a collaborative project with Kansai Energy Solutions (Thailand) in which the two companies designed, operate and manage a highly efficient chiller system* that reduces CO2 emissions by approximately 1,700 tons per year.\n\n* A chiller system that supplies chilled water to a plant\n\n**Helping to reduce our plant\u2019s footprint**\n\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Project at STT-C**\n\nOutside Nagasaki TEC where Fab 5 began operation\n\nChiller system installed at STT-C\n\n**CO2 Emissions from Energy Use at Sites**\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, emissions of CO2 from energy use at Sony sites accounted for approximately 1.07 million tons, out of the approximately 1.20 million tons, of total greenhouse gas emissions at Sony, up by approximately 7,000 tons from fiscal year 2020. The above CO2 emissions resulting from energy use at Sony sites include emissions from fuel used by Sony-owned business vehicles. In fiscal year 2021, CO2 emissions resulting from fuel used in vehicles amounted to approximately 8,000 tons. Going forward, Sony will take efforts to restrict greenhouse gas emissions through infrastructure-related measures, including the installation of high-efficiency equipment and the promotion of energy recycling, and to enhance nonstructural measures, notably the introduction of training programs designed to foster energy-saving leaders.\nEnergy Conservation: Initiatives Driven by Plant Employees\n\nSony promotes a broad range of energy-saving efforts at its sites around the world. In addition to increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and equipment, in recent years Sony has actively implemented activities for reducing energy consumption suggested by manufacturing site employees. These activities focus on the formulation and implementation of energy-saving solutions for manufacturing sites, which consume more electricity than any other part of Sony\u2019s manufacturing operations. Employees set ambitious project targets and take steps to shed light on energy consumed in different manufacturing processes. This enables employees to identify unnecessary uses of energy in such processes, as well as to develop and test solutions and, having confirmed the effectiveness thereof, to effect ongoing improvements. Particularly outstanding solutions are subsequently expanded to other sites.\n\nThese activities were prompted by the effectiveness of the Eco Challenge Project implemented in 2009 at Sony Group Corporation\u2019s Sendai Technology Center and Sony Storage Media Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Tagajo site. Similar energy conservation activities are now being implemented at Sony manufacturing sites around the world.\n\nUsing AI-Based Data Analysis to Improve Heat Source System Efficiency\n\nSony\u2019s headquarters building is using CALC\u2122, a suite of technologies developed by Sony Computer Science Laboratories that uses AI to analyze large-scale data sets. The tool is being used to improve energy efficiency by analyzing data from the building\u2019s heat source system and identifying factors that increase efficiency. CALC uses proprietary methods and algorithms that merge statistical and physics theory with technologies to precisely analyze observational data and deduce hidden factors. Sony\u2019s headquarters building utilizes sewage heat energy supplied from the nearby Shibaura Water Reclamation Center for its HVAC systems, which significantly reduces electricity consumption. Using CALC revealed the potential to improve the operation of sewage waste heat pumps, which led to adjustments in the operational controls and the realization of further energy savings.\n\nCALC: A Big Data Analysis Tool\n\nFactor analysis using CALC\n\nEco Challenge Project at Sony EMCS (Malaysia)\nUse of Renewable Energy\n\nUse of Renewable Energy and Renewable Electricity Rate\nSony\u2019s original goal to use renewable energy* (renewable electricity rate) for 15% or more of the electricity used in operations at business sites by fiscal year 2025 was updated to 35% or more by 2025 in May 2022. Sony is working to adopt renewable energy in ways suited to the regional circumstances of its business locations worldwide, employing strategies such as installing solar power systems in site buildings, procuring renewable energy from power utilities, and utilizing renewable energy certificates. In fiscal year 2021, 356,679MWh of renewable electricity was used, which is approximately 14.6%.\n\n* Renewable energy includes solar, wind, water, geothermal, and biomass. This is energy that comes from sustainable sources.\n\nRenewable Energy Procurement Policy\nSony has always considered the surrounding environment when introducing renewable energy, so we have updated our procurement policy with additional environmentally conscious items for the introduction and operation of power generation equipment.\n\nKey Procurement Policy\nEvaluate environmental impact when introducing or operating power generation equipment, taking care to prevent adverse effects on the environment.\n\nExamples of Environmentally Conscious Items:\n- Land stability (outflow of earth or equipment due to slope collapse, etc.)\n- Noise generated from power conditioners, etc.\n- Impact of reflected solar panel light on living environment\n- Impact on landscape\n- Impact on animals, plants and ecosystems\n- Check laws and regulations, and communicate with the local community during off-premises installation.\n- Hydroelectric power generation must be 30 MW or less.\n- Carry a sense of forward movement to promote proliferation of new renewable energy power generation as much as possible.\n- Choose a renewable energy power source that already exists in the country or region of the site.\n\nRE100 Membership\nIn 2018, Sony joined RE100,* a global initiative to use 100% renewable energy, in addition to internally set targets. Our goal of working toward sourcing 100% renewable electricity was originally 2040, but was moved up to 2030 in May 2022.\n\nMajor Sony sites that have installed solar power equipment\n\n| Country | Site Name | Capacity |\n|---------|-----------|----------|\n| Japan   | Sony Music Solutions JARED Oigawa Center | 1.7MW |\n| Japan   | Sony Global Manufacturing & Operations Kohda Site | 1.2MW |\n| Japan   | Sony Pictures Entertainment Studio | 1.8MW |\n| Japan   | Sony Customer Service (Japan) Togane Technology Site | 0.20MW |\n| Japan   | Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Kumamoto Technology Center | 2.9MW |\n| Austria | Sony DADC Europe Thalgau Plant | 0.84MW |\n| UK      | Sony Europe UK Technology center | 0.25MW |\n| Thailand| Sony Technology (Thailand) Chonburi Factory | 1.8MW |\n| Thailand| Sony Device Technology (Thailand) | 4.6MW |\n| Malaysia| Sony EMCS (Malaysia) | 0.83MW |\n\n* RE100 is a global initiative led by the non-profit The Climate Group in partnership with CDP in which participating companies set a goal of procuring 100% renewable electricity for power used in their global business operations.\n\nSony accelerates target to achieve a zero environmental footprint by ten years\n\nRegional Initiatives\nEven before joining RE100, Sony had been taking action on renewable energy at sites around the world. It has already achieved 100% use of renewable energy in many regions. In fiscal year 2008, it was one of the first enterprises in Europe to make the switch to 100% renewable energy for the electricity consumed at its sites. Since then, it has achieved 100% use of renewable energy in China (in fiscal year 2020) and in the Pan Asia region (in fiscal year 2021). This success in the Pan Asia region is due to the installation of solar power systems at its sites and the active use of renewable energy certificates. Sony is systematically increasing the amount of renewable energy it sources in North America, with the aim of achieving 100% in fiscal year 2030. Similar introduction through a variety of initiatives is underway in Japan, as well. In fiscal year 2021, we installed a 1.2 MW large-scale solar power generation facility at the Kohda Site of Sony Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation, and an 1.8 MW facility at the Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Kumamoto Technology Center. We also continue to promote use of 100% renewable energy at our business activities at Sony City Minato Mirai, such as introducing electricity derived from renewable energy. We also began introducing FIT Non-Fossil Certificate With Tracking* certificates in 2021.\n\n* Certificates of the value of electricity generated by renewable energy, which are subject to the Feed-in Tariff (FIT). Also identifies the power plant from which the certificate is derived.\n\nSolar power generation equipment newly installed at the Kohda Site\nReducing Waste Generation\n\nAmount of Waste Generated at Sites\n\nWith the target of reducing waste amount intensity value from Sony sites by 5% relative to fiscal year 2020 levels by fiscal year 2025, Sony has implemented a variety of measures to reduce waste and use resources more effectively. In fiscal year 2021, waste intensity value at Sony business sites worsened approximately 7.6% compared to fiscal year 2020. Sites generated approximately 52,000 tons of waste, which is up approximately 0.5% from fiscal year 2020. Although Sony is promoting reduction by continuously improving production site processes and reducing waste generated, the volume of waste increased, mainly due to the expansion of semiconductor factories and increased production. Furthermore, about 7,000 tons of industrial waste generated was plastic waste.\n\nLandfilled Waste Rate for Sony Sites\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the landfilled waste rate for all Sony Group sites was approximately 0.5%. The rate for sites in Japan was 0.2%. However, the landfilled waste rate for Sony sites became approximately 1.5% when the calculation includes waste that Sony is required by law or ordinance to dispose by landfills. Sony strives to reduce the rate of waste disposed in landfills by recycling wastes generated by sites.\n\nManagement of Industrial Waste\n\nSony takes precautions to ensure waste from its sites is not inappropriately disposed of. For example, in Japan Sony has set consistent internal standards for selecting waste disposal contractors and inspecting disposal sites on an ongoing basis. It has also established an internal system of accreditation for disposal site inspectors, and is stepping up efforts to minimize risks associated with contracting out waste disposal. To reinforce this system, Sony implements periodic on-site inspections in the waste disposal contractors, thereby ensuring rigorous management procedures.\n\nExample of Waste Reduction\n\nSony is reducing waste at all its business sites. Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation changed the flocculant used in the treatment of wastewater generated from production machinery to a biobased polymer flocculant that offers improved setting and flocculating performance. This led to a reduction of sludge, which accounts for the majority of waste. This led to a reduction of both conventional primary flocculant (inorganic flocculant) and inorganic flocculant-derived sludge. Sludge was further reduced by processing excess sludge in a dehydrator. These, in addition to other measures, have reduced waste by about 1,300 tons annually.\n\nIn 2021, the Kagoshima Technology Center, in cooperation with a subcontractor company, recycled sludge from on premises into a block to create a flowerbed. A signboard describes this recycled block, giving customers and locals an opportunity to learn about environmental activities while also raising the awareness of people on premises.\n\nImproving Component Packaging\n\nAt all of its sites, Sony works to reduce the amount of waste through overall reviews of the packaging used in components and the optimization of this packaging. For example, a range of measures are employed to reduce the amount of materials used in component packaging materials and hence curb the amount of waste. These include the complete elimination of protective bags for components, modifications to increase the capacity of containers used to store components, and the switch from disposable containers to multi-use returnable boxes. In particular, Sony is working to standardize the sizes of, and materials used in, returnable containers while aiming to expand the range of items for which such containers are used.\n\nCO\u2082 Emissions from Transport of Finished Products\n\nReturnable container used to transport components at Sony Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation\n\nFlowerbed made from blocks of recycled sludge\nProper Water Management to Protect the Local Environment\n\nWater Usage and Risk at Sony Sites\n\nWater is a constantly circulating and unevenly distributed resource, which makes water issues very regional in nature. To tackle this issue, Sony set the goals of improving water usage intensity value on sites that use high volumes of water by 5% relative to fiscal year 2020 and implementing risk reduction measures at sites located in water risk areas. In fiscal year 2021, water usage intensity value at sites worsened approximately 1.7% relative to fiscal year 2020. Water usage was approximately 19.55 million m\u00b3, an increase of 4.5% relative to fiscal year 2020. Sony is making efforts to recycle water and save water on production sites, but the amount of water used has increased, mainly due to the expansion of semiconductor factories and increased production. Sony also takes steps to ensure the quality of wastewater at its sites. In addition to observing related laws and regulations in each of the countries and territories in which it operates, Sony manages wastewater quality criteria further than is required. For example, the introduction of sophisticated water treatment facilities has enabled it to reduce BOD and COD levels* in wastewater.\n\n* Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD)\n\nEfforts in Water Usage and Local Water Risk\n\n- Sony\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing sites use the largest volumes of water and are located in areas where water risk is low, but we continue to promote wastewater recycling to reduce usage.\n- We have set voluntary standards for environmental pollutants in wastewater, and are working to reduce the risk of wastewater pollution at Sony manufacturing sites where wastewater pollution risk is high.\n- We have non-manufacturing sites located in areas with a high risk of water depletion and drought. The volume of water consumed at these sites is low, but we continue to work to reduce water usage.\n\nReducing Water Use at Manufacturing Sites\n\nFor semiconductors and electronic devices, vast amounts of water are needed not only in the manufacturing process but also in the recycling process. At its plants all over the world, Sony is taking a variety of measures to preserve local water resources, including wastewater, recycling and initiatives for reducing water usage.\n\nIncreasing Semiconductor Production while Reducing Water Usage\n\nSony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (SCK) is working toward reducing the amount of water it uses for the semiconductor production while increasing the production capacities. Nagasaki Technology Center is working to reuse wastewater from gas detoxifying equipment used in the semiconductor manufacturing process, and is reusing about 80% of the wastewater. Kumamoto Technology Center (Kumamoto TEC) is aiming to reduce water used for combustion treatment to remove exhaust gas emitted from the semiconductor production lines. To do this, they have enhanced the equipment to increase the proportion of recycled water, thereby lowering the amount of fresh water needed by about 50%. In addition, in order to help preserve the abundant aquifer in the Kumamoto region, Kumamoto TEC has for many years been conducting \u201cgroundwater recharge\u201d efforts. This involves flooding fields with river water that slowly permeates into the water table during times before planting or when no crops are being grown. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 3.09 million m\u00b3 water intake was recharged, a volume that exceeds that used by Kumamoto TEC.\n\nAvailable water resources vary greatly in terms of quantity and quality, depending upon the region. In manufacturing, it is necessary to consider water resources from the perspective of securing enough water for production while maintaining good stakeholder relations. Sony uses water risk assessment tools provided by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to perform water risk assessments for the regions where Sony sites are located. Sony is working with local stakeholders to ensure proper use of water by promoting activities that reflect the water risks in each region.\n\nWater risk reduction at Sony Group manufacturing sites\n\nKumamoto TEC\u2019s facility for recovery of water used for gas combustion treatment\n\nWater Usage at Sony Sites\n\n| Region                  | Water Usage (Million m\u00b3) | (FY)2020 | (FY)2021 | (FY)2025 |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| North America           | 18.70                    | 19.55    | 19.95    | 19.7     |\n| Mainland China and Hong Kong Region | 95 | 100 | 100 | 100 |\n| Pan Asia                | 60                       | 60       | 60       | 60       |\n| Europe                  | 60                       | 60       | 60       | 60       |\n| North America           | 20                       | 20       | 20       | 20       |\n| Japan/ East Asia        | 10                       | 10       | 10       | 10       |\n\nWater usage intensity\n\nJapan/ East Asia: Japan, South Korea and Taiwan Region\n\nMainland China and Hong Kong Region\n\nNorth America\n\nPan Asia\n\nEurope\n\nWater usage intensity\n\nSony\u2019s Purpose & Values\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct\nApproach to Sustainability\nEditorial Policy\nBusiness Overview\nSony\u2019s Sustainability\nAddressing Social and Environmental Issues\n\nEnvironment\n\nManagement Approach\nHighlight\nEnvironmental Policies and Targets\nContributions to Solving Environmental Issues\nProducts and Services\nSupply Chain\n\nSites\nLogistics\nProduct Recycling\nEnvironmental Communication\n\nEmployees\nRespect for Human Rights\nResponsible Supply Chain\nQuality and Customer Service\nCommunity Engagement\nEthics and Compliance\n\nSustainability Report 2022\n\nGRI Standards Content Index\n\nSustainability Report\nReducing Water Usage in Various Ways\n\nGreen Cycle Corporation, an affiliate of Sony that engages in the recycling of home appliances, began harvesting rainwater in fiscal year 2014. The rainwater undergoes rigorous quality tests before being used in recycling processes that involve crushing machines, etc. Via measures such as turning the entire 2,500 m\u00b2 rooftop of Plant No. 2 into a rainwater collection area, Green Cycle Corporation was able to harvest 1,429.9 m\u00b3 of rainwater in fiscal year 2021, which covered 40% of the plant\u2019s total water usage.\n\nThe Sony headquarters building uses treated wastewater to cool its heating equipment. By using water treated at the nearby Shibaura Water Reclamation Center to cool heating equipment, the amount of tap water used, as well as the amount transferred as air, water, or soil emissions and waste, in countries where no legal reporting requirements exist for chemical management, Sony sites apply standards based on Japan\u2019s Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) as internal rules. Chemical substances are classified as follows:\n\nClass 1 substances: Prohibit use\n- The substances regarded as having a serious impact on the human body or environment (carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, toxicity for reproduction, acute toxicity, ecotoxicity, etc.) which are prohibited to be produced or used under international treaties or individual countries\u2019 regulations\n- The substances considered to have a high risk of environmental pollution such as soil contamination\n\nClass 2 substances: Prohibit use (Exemptions granted for certain applications)\n- The substances regarded as having a serious impact on the human body or environment (carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, toxicity for reproduction, acute toxicity, ecotoxicity, etc.), which are subject to regulations that require their registration or to monitor the amounts released and transferred because they are of high risk.\n- The substances recognized as needed to be eliminated because they are regarded as high risk in their management after\n\nClass 3 substances: Reduce the amounts released and transferred\n- The substances having a serious impact on the human body or environment, which are subject to regulations requiring monitoring of the amounts released and transferred.\n- The substances which are recognized as needed to be reduced in the amount of release and transfer after considering the trend of regulations or the social circumstances.\n- Volatile organic compounds (VOC) other than Classes 1 and 2\n\nClass 4 substances: Comply with the relevant laws and regulations and use under appropriate control\n- The substances not classified as Class 1, 2, or 3. Note that water and air are not required to be managed as chemical substances.\n\nManaging Chemical Substances\n\nThe Sony Group has developed a group-wide approach to the management of chemical substances used at sites where the use of these chemicals is controlled by legislation, designated as having a potentially harmful impact on the environment, or used in large quantities.\n\nReinforcing Standards for Managing Chemical Substances\n\nSony categorizes chemical substances into four classes and carefully manages and reduces the amounts of these chemical substances used, as well as the amount transferred as air, water, or soil emissions and waste. In countries where no legal reporting requirements exist for chemical management, Sony sites apply standards based on Japan\u2019s Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) as internal rules. Chemical substances are classified as follows:\n\nClass 1 substances: Prohibit use\n- The substances regarded as having a serious impact on the human body or environment (carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, toxicity for reproduction, acute toxicity, ecotoxicity, etc.) which are prohibited to be produced or used under international treaties or individual countries\u2019 regulations\n- The substances considered to have a high risk of environmental pollution such as soil contamination\n\nClass 2 substances: Prohibit use (Exemptions granted for certain applications)\n- The substances regarded as having a serious impact on the human body or environment (carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, toxicity for reproduction, acute toxicity, ecotoxicity, etc.), which are subject to regulations that require their registration or to monitor the amounts released and transferred because they are of high risk.\n- The substances recognized as needed to be eliminated because they are regarded as high risk in their management after\n\nClass 3 substances: Reduce the amounts released and transferred\n- The substances having a serious impact on the human body or environment, which are subject to regulations requiring monitoring of the amounts released and transferred.\n- The substances which are recognized as needed to be reduced in the amount of release and transfer after considering the trend of regulations or the social circumstances.\n- Volatile organic compounds (VOC) other than Classes 1 and 2\n\nClass 4 substances: Comply with the relevant laws and regulations and use under appropriate control\n- The substances not classified as Class 1, 2, or 3. Note that water and air are not required to be managed as chemical substances.\n\nEfforts to Reduce VOC Emissions to Air\n\nWith the target of reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released into the air to fiscal year 2010 levels or lower, Sony is working on a variety of initiatives, such as transitioning to VOC alternatives and reducing the amount of VOCs used in the manufacturing process. In fiscal year 2021, VOC emissions into the air were approximately 609 tons, down approximately 49% relative to fiscal year 2010. The decline was the result of a series of measures that include replacing VOCs with alternative substances and reducing VOC use in manufacturing processes.\n\nRelease of VOCs into the Air\n\n| Year | Release (Tons) | Target (Tons) |\n|------|---------------|---------------|\n| 2010 | 1,184         | 1,184         |\n| 2021 | 609           | 1,184         |\n| 2025 | 500           | 1,184         |\n\nWastewater treatment recycle plant installed at STT-C.\nExample of Reduction in Chemical Substance Usage\n\nSony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (SCK) collaborated with an equipment manufacturer to develop a proprietary volatile organic compound (VOC) treatment system as part of efforts to reduce the amount of VOCs released. Conventional VOC treatment systems are installed near ventilation duct outlets. Since such equipment is designed to treat extremely rarefied organic substances, it is very large, making space and cost constraints an issue for semiconductor plants that want to install these types of systems. SCK responded by focusing on production equipment for highly concentrated organic substance and developed a small, fixed condensing-type VOC treatment system in conjunction with an equipment manufacturer. The newly developed system can be installed near production equipment and is able to treat VOCs efficiently.\n\nOzone-Depleting Substances\n\nSony succeeded in completely eliminating first-generation chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from its manufacturing processes in 1993 and banned the use of second-generation hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) at the end of fiscal year 2000. Sony business sites currently prohibit the use of ozone-depleting substances stipulated under the Montreal Protocol. Sony uses CFCs as a refrigerant in some air-conditioning units only. Compliance with laws and regulations in each country is ensured, and strict care is taken to prevent leakage of semiconductor plants that want to install these types of systems. SCK responded by focusing on production equipment for highly concentrated organic substance and developed a small, fixed condensing-type VOC treatment system in conjunction with an equipment manufacturer. The newly developed system can be installed near production equipment and is able to treat VOCs efficiently.\n\nEnvironmental Risk Management at Sony Sites\n\nTo carry out effective risk management of chemical substances and emergency responses, the Sony Group has enacted the Sony Group Standards for Site Environmental Risk Management, which set the management standard and give examples of improvement measures. Based on these standards, at each site Sony has implemented accident prevention measures, including prohibiting the burial of tanks for chemical substances and pipes, and various leak prevention measures. In addition, Sony rigorously works to prevent environmental accidents through ongoing improvements to its systems based on regular audits at each site, information sharing among sites and other initiatives. Sony has established a system whereby its sites are required to promptly report environmental accidents to the authorities and to take appropriate countermeasures. No such accidents were reported at any of Sony\u2019s sites in fiscal year 2021.\n\nResponse to Soil and Groundwater Contamination\n\nIn the event that an incident of soil or groundwater contamination is identified at a Sony site in a voluntary check or other assessment, remediation processes are implemented in compliance with pertinent local laws and ordinances. For example, Sony Group companies in Japan deal with the occurrence of contamination of soil and groundwater at Group sites by taking steps in line with the Sony Group Standard for Assessing Soil and Groundwater, an internal document that sets out procedures that comply with Japanese laws and ordinances. This manual stipulates that issues be addressed through the following three phases:\n\nPhase 1: Investigate past and present chemical use and confirm the existence or otherwise of used or unused underground tanks, buried piping, other similar equipment, or previous incidents, at the site. Perform an inspection of the site to ascertain whether there is any residual soil or groundwater contamination.\n\nPhase 2: Based on the investigations undertaken in Phase 1, carry out an assessment of the areas that are potentially contaminated. Undertake measurements at these locations in line with the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act.\n\nPhase 3: If any contamination is identified based on these results, carry out prevention and remediation procedures.\n\nIncidents of soil and groundwater contamination resulting from operations have been confirmed at Sony Group sites as follows. In response, Sony has been remediating the contamination and submitting regular reports to authorities. Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Nagasaki Technology Center completed the treatment of contaminated soil in a 613.3 m\u00b2 area that had been designated as an area requiring notification of character change to land, and the designation was lifted on June 25, 2021.\n\nProgress of Soil and Groundwater Remediation (as of August 2022)\n\n| Site | Sony Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation\u2019s Inazawa Site (Japan) | Atsugi Technology Center, Sony Group Corporation |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Date Contamination Confirmed | June 2001 (Result of voluntary assessment) | March 2022 (Result of voluntary assessment) |\n| Substance(s) Detected | Fluorine | Fluorine and its compounds |\n| Cause | Leak from crack in drainage pipe | Leak from loose drainage pipe fitting |\n| Response / Current Status | The site has discontinued use of the equipment that caused the contamination and is remediating and monitoring groundwater. Analysis conducted in fiscal year 2021 found a groundwater concentration of 0.87mg per liter. | An administrative report indicated there was soil and groundwater pollution on site, but because there is no possibility of this pollution flowing outside the site, it was designated as an area without health risk in June 2022. Contaminated soil will be removed from the leak point, and we will continue to monitor groundwater contamination. |\n\nPlease see below for the latest information on site status.\n\nProgress of Soil and Groundwater Remediation\nExamples of Biodiversity Conservation Initiatives\n\nGuiding Principles for Biodiversity Conservation Initiatives\n\nRecognizing the importance of natural capital, as the very foundation of human life, and the ecosystem services it supplies, Sony endeavors to maintain and recover biodiversity, both in its business activities and through regional biodiversity conservation initiatives. Changes in land usage have been indicated as one of the causes of loss and deterioration of biodiversity. From a land use perspective on the site, we consider the impact of our business activities on neighboring ecosystems, carrying out biodiversity conservation and restoration initiatives in the green areas of our manufacturing sites, as well as in the ecosystems of the surrounding area according to the region\u2019s specific needs.\n\nConservation Initiatives\n\nConservation Activities in Sony Forest to Promote a Richer Ecosystem\n\nSince its inception in 1972, the Kohda Site of Sony Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation, a producer of products such as digital still cameras, has protected a natural woodland on its site, naming it Sony Forest. Sony Forest was designated as a wildlife sanctuary* (Kohda Northern Wildlife Sanctuary, Aichi Prefecture, Japan), and is vital to the neighboring ecosystem. Owls are at the top of the ecosystem pyramid, so in order to build a rich ecosystem inhabited by them, we continue activities at the Kohda Site such as building spaces for owls to fly and feed, as well as installing nest boxes. As a result of these efforts, inhabitation of endangered owls has been confirmed every year since 2016.\n\nThen, in 2011, the Kohda Site began carrying out activities to secure and share seedlings of native species, necessary for regeneration of the local ecosystem. It has been promoting this through collaboration with local government, residents, and companies. In recognition of these activities, Sony Forest was certified by the Japan Committee for the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity as the sixth exemplary project in 2015.\n\n* In Japan, a wildlife sanctuary is an area considered important for the protection of wild birds and mammals.\n\nRemoval of Invasive Species in Yamagata Prefecture\n\nLocated about 8 km from Miyakozawa Wetland in Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Yamagata Technology Center (Yamagata TEC) produces CMOS image sensors. The center carries out its business activities in consideration of the neighboring ecosystem, which is home to a variety of native species. Miyakozawa Wetland spreads across the banks of Oyama Shimo-ike, itself a Ramsar site. The location is rich with biodiversity and has been confirmed to be home to valuable native species such as the endangered Monochoria korsakowii. However, there have been concerns about ecosystem impact, such as decreases in native species such as medaka, due to the introduction of non-native animals and plants such as Procambarus clarkii and Canada goldenrod. Therefore, each year under the guidance of the Tsuruoka city government and local organizations, Yamagata TEC employees participate in activities such as the targeted capture of Procambarus clarkii, while protecting medaka, a species of fish native to the area.\n\nMonitoring Survey of the Recovering Gamo Tidal Flats\n\nSony Group Corporation\u2019s Sendai Technology Center (Sendai TEC) and Sony Storage Media Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Tagajo site are conducting a biological monitoring survey of the Gamo Tidal Flats (Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan), which is about 4 km from the manufacturing site. The Gamo Tidal Flats were damaged by the tsunami caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, devastating the surrounding pine forest and reed fields, leading to a critical situation for the area\u2019s flora and fauna. This rich natural area was originally inhabited by a variety of worms and gobies, is a breeding ground for little terns and Kentish plovers, and is also the wintering ground for the brant goose, a natural monument of Japan, and has been designated as a national wildlife sanctuary special protection area. Since 2014, Sendai TEC and the Tagajo Site have been tracking the recovery of the Gamo Tidal Flats in collaboration with the Gamo Conservation Society environmental NGO. A decade has passed since the earthquake, and the environment of the Gamo Tidal Flats continues to recover. A 2020 survey confirmed 12 species of benthic life including sand blubber crabs, 21 species of birds including the red-necked stint and other plovers and sandpipers, 11 species of plants including okahijiki and hamanigana, and 4 species of insects including earwigs. Three rare species, osprey and dunkin (birds) and herbaceous seepweed (salt-tolerant plant) were also observed.\n\nOsprey chicks found in the Gamo Tidal Flats\n\nOsprey chicks found in the Gamo Tidal Flats\n\nYamagata TEC employees catching invasive red swamp crayfish\n\nOwl chick born in the Sony Forest (2020)\nBiodiversity Conservation Activities in Austria\n\nThe Sony DADC Thalgau plant in Austria is actively promoting activities to conserve biodiversity in the nature-rich region of the Fuschlsee Nature Reserve, located 10 km away. In recent years, the habitat of the wild bee, which plays an important role in the ecosystem as a pollinator in this area, has been deteriorating due to climate change and housing development. Sony DADC Austria is implementing activities to protect the bee, such as installing beehives on the factory grounds, housing approximately 400,000 bees. In addition, to protect the ecosystem that lives in the grassland on the factory grounds and as a way of landscape management, employees let sheep of local farmers graze the land instead of using tractors that strain the soil.\n\nBiodiversity Conservation Activities in China\n\nSony Precision Devices (Huizhou) Co., Ltd. (SPDH) is located in a natural area close to a mangrove forest, and is actively promoting biodiversity conservation efforts in the region, including the targeted removal of alien species and Synecoculture. Mangrove Forest Park is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna that inhabit the intertidal zone and brackish water, including stores, black-faced spoonbills (nationally protected species in China) and other endangered species. SPDH has been pursuing efforts to remove water hyacinth, a non-native species to the area, since 2010, in cooperation with the Huizhou Aquatic Environmental Center. Since 2020, SPDH has been conducting biodiversity conservation and restoration activities on the premises of its sites through Synecoculture. Synecoculture takes maximum advantage of the material cycling that occurs naturally in ecosystems, aiming to create ecosystems with a diverse mix of plants that coexist together and grow lushly. Since Synecoculture was adopted at SPDH for the on-site fields, more than 40 kinds of organisms, including honeybees, mantis, grasshoppers, sparrows and magpies have been observed so far, and over 30 kinds of vegetables have been harvested. Harvested vegetables are served to employees in the cafeteria, and the importance of biodiversity is shared with employees through the philosophy behind Synecoculture.\n\nEfforts to Reduce Usage of Single-use Plastics Group-wide\n\nSony is promoting efforts to reduce the use of single-use plastics at group companies worldwide in order to prevent the marine pollution caused by plastic waste. All our manufacturing sites have reduced or ceased provision of plastic straws, cups, plastic bottles, shopping bags and other items made of single-use plastic in conference rooms, cafes, etc. We have also installed water servers at many of our sites to promote employee use of reusable water bottles.\n\nOther initiatives\n\n- Volunteering to Protect Nature Reserves in the UK\n- Old Growth Conservation Efforts in Kunisaki City, Oita Prefecture\n- Promoting Forest Management Activity at So-net Forest (in Japanese)\n- Protecting Spawning Grounds of the Endangered Loggerhead Turtle in Japan\n- Environmental Protection Activity in New York City\n- Coral Conservation Efforts in Nagasaki Prefecture\n- Participating in the Forest Conservation Project in Sumatra\n- Participating in Panama\u2019s Biodiversity Event Festi Harpia 2019\n\nA water server allows employees to refill their own bottles.\nEnvironmental Initiatives for Food\n\nSony has been working on environmental issues related to food in our Food for the Future project since 2021. We engage every employee in activities that encourage them to be aware of use of environmentally conscious food and take action in their daily lives through a variety of efforts, including distribution of a guidebook detailing environmentally conscious food that features Sony Pictures Entertainment\u2019s Peter Rabbit, and providing meals that use environmentally conscious food in our employee cafeterias worldwide. In 2021, October was designated Sony Group Food Month in Japan. During the month, cafeterias at each site provide information about environmentally conscious food, provide meals that use them, and hold seminars featuring keynote speakers from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to develop employee awareness.\n\nWorldwide Cleanup Activities Catered to Regional Characteristics\n\nSony continues to conduct cleanup activities at its manufacturing sites around the world that are catered to the specific characteristics of the region. Even in locations where it is difficult for people to gather due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are conducting cleanup activities after ensuring thorough infection control measures at many of our sites. For example, Sony Device Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (SDT) has been planting mangroves since 1999 and is also engaged in cleanup activities to conserve these forests. In fiscal year 2021 we cleaned up the Klong Cone Canal, which flows into the Gulf of Thailand, collecting about 202 kg of plastic waste and other rubbish.\n\nOther initiatives\n\nCleaning Up Marine Plastic Waste Across China\n\nWow! Wow! Biodiversity Project\n\nTogether with the Nature Conservation Society of Japan, Sony launched the Wow! Wow! Biodiversity Project in fiscal year 2015, as a platform for organizing nature appreciation events, holding photo contests for the general public and spreading awareness of biodiversity through social media. In fiscal year 2016, Sony China joined this project and is conducting similar awareness-raising activities in various cities across China. The annual photo contests have become popular in both Japan and China. Through the submission of photos, the splendor of nature and the importance of biodiversity are conveyed to more and more people. About 8,000 entries were submitted to the Chinese photo contests from 2016 to 2021, and they were shared through social media with approximately 420,000 people, including Sony Group employees in China and their friends. In addition to holding exhibitions of the winning photo entries in Japan and China, the project has been providing other opportunities for the public to think about the importance of biodiversity, through activities such as biodiversity lectures and photographing living organisms workshops using Sony cameras.\n\nEnvironmentally Preferable Paper Purchasing\n\nRecognizing that paper resources are finite, Sony strives to use paper in an environmentally responsible manner, and it has established a related purchasing policy for paper and printed materials. Accordingly, Sony makes a point of purchasing environmentally preferable paper, such as recycled paper and forest-certified paper. In fiscal year 2021, Sony used a total of approximately 362 tons of FSC-certified paper* for such items as corporation publications, including company brochures and notices of general meetings of shareholders, product catalogs, calendars, business cards, and envelopes.\n\n* FSC-certified paper is any paper product made from wood that has been certified by an international body called the Forest Stewardship Council, which aims to promote forest preservation.\n\nFocus on Paper Resources\nReducing the Environmental Impact of Logistics\n\nPromoting Modal Shift\n\nAs a part of its efforts to reduce environmental impact from the transport of finished goods, Sony promotes modal shift, switching the modes of transport it uses from air to sea and from truck to railroad.\n\nModal Shift for Tape Media\n\nFrom fiscal year 2020, Sony Storage Media Solutions Corporation switched from air to sea transport for storage tape media that is manufactured in Japan and destined for distribution centers in the US, Belgium, and Singapore. The modal shift led to a reduction of approximately 905 tons of CO2 emissions in fiscal year 2021 compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\nCO2 Emissions from Transport of Finished Products\n\nWith the target of reducing absolute CO2 emissions related to logistics between nations and within regions by 10% (compared with fiscal year 2018) by fiscal year 2025, Sony has worked to reduce transport weight by making products and packaging smaller and lighter, while optimizing transportation efficiency and switching to transportation methods that have a low impact on the environment. In fiscal year 2021, the total CO2 emissions from product transport (international and regional*) was approximately 191 thousand tons, an increase of 5% over fiscal year 2018. This was the result to restrictions on production and international transportation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n* Some countries and regions are excluded from \u201cintraregional transportation.\u201d\n\nCO2 Emissions from Product Transportation (International and Regional)\n\n| Year | Emissions (Thousand t-CO2) |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| 2018 | 183                       |\n| 2021 | 191                       |\n| 2025 | (Target) 164              |\n\nImproving Transport Efficiency with Milk Runs\n\nEfficient transport realized by maximizing loading volume per truck reduces environmental impact. Sony seeks to improve transport efficiency by utilizing milk runs.* In China, Sony has been improving transport efficiency, which helps to reduce CO2 emissions, using a combination of transport solutions such as milk runs and round trips.\n\n* In a milk run, a truck follows a route to collect parts from several suppliers, thereby improving transport efficiency compared with the routing method of separate runs to each supplier.\n\nPromoting the Use of Reusable Bands for Products and Parts Transport in Manufacturing Sites and Warehouses\n\nTo keep stacked cartons from collapsing during transport of products and parts in manufacturing sites and warehouses, Sony employs reusable bands as one of its materials. This has contributed to the reduction of use and disposal of packaging materials such as stretch films.\nSony\u2019s Product Recycling Policy\n\nSony subscribes to the principle of individual producer responsibility (IPR), that is, the idea that a producer bears responsibility for its products over their entire life cycle. Accordingly, Sony is focused on recycling-oriented product design, collection and recycling used products, and building global recycling systems that suit the needs of individual countries and regions. Sony recognizes its social responsibility as a manufacturer to deal with its used products and actively promotes product collection and recycling, and complies with recycling laws and regulations in countries and regions around the world.\n\nProduct Recycling Initiatives\n\nIn the treatment of used products, Sony complies with recycling laws and regulations in countries and regions around the world, including Japan\u2019s Home Appliance Recycling Law, the EU\u2019s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive), state recycling laws on waste electrical and electronic equipment in the US, China\u2019s Management Regulations for Recycling and Disposing of Consumer Electronics and Electronic Waste, and India\u2019s recycling law on electronic waste.\n\nSony\u2019s Recycling Targets and Record\n\nSony promotes the collection of end-of-life products worldwide with our goal to establish and maintain recycling schemes suitable for the needs of local communities. In fiscal year 2021, Sony\u2019s Take-back of End-of-Life Products Record was approximately 70 thousand tons of end-of-life products (as of July 2022).\n\nSony has also been working on advanced recycling since 2021 with the goal to improve collection efficiency 1.5 times over fiscal year 2020 in regards to the recycling of key mineral resources (tantalum). In Japan, Sony is coordinating efforts with recycling plants to build a process for recovering parts containing tantalum from end-of-life products and improve processes and facilities. In fiscal year 2021, Sony is carrying out technical verification to improve collection efficiency of installed equipment.\n\nTake-back of End-of-Life Products Record\n\n| Year | Japan/East Asia | North America | Europe | Pan Asia | Latin America |\n|------|-----------------|---------------|--------|---------|--------------|\n| 2018 | 80              | 76            | 64     | 70      | 70           |\n| 2019 | 80              | 76            | 64     | 70      | 70           |\n| 2020 | 80              | 76            | 64     | 70      | 70           |\n| 2021 | 80              | 76            | 64     | 70      | 70           |\n\nNotes: The figure for fiscal year 2021 is as of July 2022. The figure for fiscal year 2020 was corrected from that of previous year\u2019s report.\n\nImproving Product Recyclability\n\nWorking with the Sony Group\u2019s Specialized Recycling Company\n\nAs one of its strategies for resource efficiency, Sony works to increase the recyclability of its products. When examining various related measures, Sony receives feedback from Green Cycle Corporation, an affiliate of Sony specializing in the recycling business. Highly effective, practical measures incorporating these ideas and suggestions for easier disassembly and separation of materials obtained during the recycling process are then drawn up and submitted to design departments for each product category. Meanwhile, Sony supports the efforts of Green Cycle Corporation to improve its recycling technologies by sharing the latest information on product dismantling.\n\nThe amount of home electronics waste, including flat-screen TVs, has been rising in recent years, and boosting waste processing capacity has become an issue. In fiscal year 2020, Green Cycle Corporation built a second recycling building and introduced a new process for flat-screen TV processing based on Sony product information and other data. The new building has improved the efficiency of the disassembly process and significantly boosted processing capacity.\nRecycling Activities in Japan\n\nSony recycles televisions and personal computers in line with applicable recycling-related laws in Japan. Sony also bears the cost of recycling lithium-ion batteries and other small rechargeable batteries, as well as packaging materials, as required by law.\n\nRecycling of Television Sets\n\nJapan\u2019s Home Appliance Recycling Law, which came into effect in April 2001, initially covered four major home appliances: televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners. In April 2009, the law was revised to also cover LCD and plasma televisions and clothes dryers. Among applicable products, Sony manufactures televisions* (CRT, LCD and plasma models). The Home Appliance Recycling Law requires consumers to pay collection, transport and recycling fees when disposing of applicable home appliances, retailers to take back such appliances and return them to manufacturers, and manufacturers to recycle these appliances.\n\nSony has established a nationwide cooperative recycling network with four other manufacturers. As a consequence, Sony-manufactured televisions are now recycled at 15 recycling plants across Japan. At these recycling plants, TVs are manually disassembled, and the parts are crushed and sorted using various equipment. Materials such as iron, copper, aluminum, and plastic are then separated out and sold to businesses that produce raw materials, making them available for reuse. In addition, certain harmful substances such as lead and mercury found in some older products and parts are removed and disposed of properly in accordance with the law.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, Sony recycled approximately 125 thousand CRT televisions and 419 thousand flat-screen televisions. The Home Appliance Recycling Law obliges manufacturers to maintain recycling rates of at least 55% for CRT televisions and at least 74% for flat-screen televisions. Sony has consistently exceeded these rates since fiscal year 2001. In fiscal year 2021 the recycling rate for Sony-manufactured CRT televisions was 74%, while for Sony-manufactured flat-screen televisions it was 86%.\n\n* Sony-manufactured televisions include products bearing the Awa brand manufactured in and before 2001.\n\nCompliance with Japan\u2019s Home Appliance Recycling Law (in Japanese)\n\nSony\u2019s Recycling Record\n\nRecycling of Personal Computers\n\nAlthough Sony sold off its personal computer business in July 2014, it is collecting and recycling its PC products in Japan that are no longer used by households and businesses, including long-time corporate users, in accordance with Japan\u2019s Act on the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources. Items being recycled are desktop PC units, notebook PCs, CRT displays, and LCDs.\n\nSony is a member of the PC3R Promotion Association and collects and recycles used PC products under the industrywide collection and recycling scheme operated by the association. The results of the association\u2019s collection and recycling efforts are published on the association\u2019s website (link below).\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, Sony collected and recycled a total of approximately 24 thousand units, for a total weight of approximately 128.8 tons. From these items, about 95.4 tons of materials were reused, including metal, plastic, and glass parts.\n\nResult of Collection and recycling of used PCs by the PC3R Promotion Association (in Japanese)\n\nInformation on recycling used computers made by Sony (in Japanese)\n\nSony\u2019s Recycling Compliance Systems\n\nSony utilizes authorized collection schemes for the collection and recycling of WEEE, batteries and packaging across Europe. These conduct regular on-site audits of all contracted recyclers to ensure compliance and prevent illegal shipments outside the EU. Sony engages authorized partners that undertake recycling on behalf of manufacturers to ensure our products are recycled in a compliant manner, in accordance with European Directives and country specific regulations.\n\nIn 2021, Sony financed the costs of recycling approximately 41,253 tons* of end-of-life products and packaging in Europe. In collaboration with other manufacturers, Sony discloses relevant information on components that require special treatment for product categories placed on the market in Europe for recyclers to facilitate safe recycling.\n\n* End-of-life products and packaging in fiscal year 2021 does not include certain countries, such as France.\n\nRecycling Activities in Europe\n\nTake-back legislation in Europe\u2014in particular, the European Union (EU) Directives on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE),*1 Batteries*2 and Packaging*3\u2014requires manufacturers to organize and finance the collection and recycling of end-of-life products and packaging.\n\nSony takes full responsibility for its take-back obligations in all applicable European countries. With the aim of building a recycling market where the principle of competition works in Europe, Sony formed the European Recycling Platform (ERP) in cooperation with other companies in 2002, building efficient and cost-effective systems for the collection and recycling of end-of-life products that enable member companies to fulfill their obligations as manufacturers. Sony continuously strives to find the best recycling partners.\n\n*1 Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)\n\n*2 Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators\n\n*3 Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste\n\nSony\u2019s Recycling Compliance Systems\n\nSony utilizes authorized collection schemes for the collection and recycling of WEEE, batteries and packaging across Europe.

All recycling and support activities are committed to a responsible recycling process that support state and provincial legislation and voluntary initiatives.\n\nUnited States: Promoting of the Sony Take Back Recycling Program\n\nSony Electronics Inc. (SEL) continues to promote the Sony Take Back Recycling Program, which was put in place to increase recycling rates for used electronics in compliance with individual state laws and regulations. Through this program, SEL works with recycling companies across the United States to allow consumers to drop off Sony products at designated collection centers free of charge. In fiscal year 2021, these collection centers and through compliance channels collected approximately 5,961 tons (13.11 million pounds) of used consumer electronics. This equates to recycling 0.1 kg for every 1 kg of electronics sold.\n\nSEL also manages a website that provides consumers with information about the program and the importance of recycling. The website provides consumers with useful recycling information that helps bolster recycling rates for used electronics through a variety of features, such as a search function to find nearby recycling centers. As a member of the Call2Recycle Program,* SEL recycles rechargeable batteries free of charge in line with the program\u2019s recycling scheme. In honor of these socially responsible contributions related to recycling, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has given SEL a gold award in the Sustainable Materials Management Electronics Challenge for four consecutive years.\n\nCanada: Working with Provincial Governments to Set Up Electronics Equipment Recycling Programs\n\nSince the first provincial program was launched in 2004, Sony of Canada Ltd. (Sony Canada) has worked with provincial governments to set up recycling programs for end-of-life products. From 2008 through 2015, Sony Canada operated an expanded recycling program for small electronics equipment across Canada by enabling consumers to take such products to its retail partners across the country. More recently, compliance obligations with provincial programs matured to deliver appropriate collection opportunities for consumers through the Electronic Products Recycling Association (EPRA). Consumers and businesses can drop off their end-of-life electronics free of charge for responsible recycling at an EPRA-authorized drop-off location in nine provinces. In addition, Sony Canada is a founding and current active member of Electronics Product Stewardship Canada (EPSC). EPSC is comprised of leading electronics manufacturers who work to design, promote and implement sustainable solutions for end-of-life electronics.\n\nRecycling Responsibly\n\nIn addition to conducting its own independent audits of recyclers and the downstream processing firms to which they subcontract, SEL has set forth a recycling policy whereby all recyclers it does business with must obtain Responsible Recycling (R2) or e-Stewards certification. R2 and e-Stewards are certification systems for recyclers organized in part by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that evaluate such factors as environmental management performance and workplace environment. SEL participates in the EPA Sustainable Material Management Electronics Challenge program since its program inception.\n\n* Call2Recycle is a nonprofit public service organization that conducts and manages rechargeable battery recycling programs and provides related consulting services in the United States and Canada.\n\nSony Take Back Recycling Program\nCall2Recycle\n\nRecycling your Sony products\nElectronic Products Recycling Association\nRecycling Activities in Pan Asia\n\nThe operations of Sony in the Pan Asia region stretch from Middle East to New Zealand. Throughout the region, Sony offices and manufacturing locations continually work to ensure that the recycling needs of the local community are met. In terms of national electronic waste recycling legislation, Sony actively works with local partners to ensure that local requirements are met.\n\nIndia: Working with a Local Partner to Collect and Recycle E-Waste\n\nIn order to ensure compliance with E-Waste Management Rules, 2016 and amendments, Sony India has partnered with a leading third party company for channelization of e-waste which includes collection and recycling of e-waste. In fiscal year 2021, Sony India collected and recycled approximately 3,661 tons of e-waste internally and through the third party partner. Additionally, Sony India focused on raising awareness regarding environmentally safe disposal of e-waste and encouraged end-consumers to submit their end of life Sony Products to the broad network of e-waste collection points established by Sony India for their safe disposal. As of the end of March 2022, 33 collection points across the country have been established. Sony India continues to review results and formulate future plans accordingly.\n\nKorea: \u201cART\u201d (Action Really Together) Campaign\n\nIn Korea, the recycling law has been in place since 2003 and covers electronics, battery as well as packaging. Sony Korea has been working with related associations to collect the specific volume assigned by the government annually. In addition, to educate and encourage employees and local community to play their parts in e-waste recycling, Sony Korea has initiated the \u201cZero Waste Campaign\u201d in Korea since 2012. This initiative has since been extended to Sony Group companies, neighbors and friends of Sony employees as well as other organizations. Hence, the campaign was renamed \u201cAction Really Together (ART)\u201d in 2016 to emphasize the importance of taking actions together for a good cause, regardless of brands. Besides collecting end-of-life products for recycling, Sony Korea also collects unwanted used products in good working condition and donates them to a local NGO.\n\nSony Joint Project: Green Service Program\n\nSince 2010, Sony sales companies in Latin America\u2014including Sony Mexico, Sony Inter-American, Sony Peru, Sony Chile, Sony Argentina and Sony Bolivia\u2014gradually launched the Green Service Program. Under this initiative, using participating companies\u2019 service networks, products and components that are under warranty but discarded during repair are appropriately treated. Also the e-waste generated by Sony sales companies facilities in Latin America are appropriately treated under this program as well. This program marks a shift in focus from simple disposal to the proper management and repair of products, helping Sony fulfill its responsibility to reduce the environmental impact of its products after they are sold and respond to the expectations of customers. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 222 tons of e-waste were collected and processed appropriately. Going forward, the companies will continue to implement the Green Service Program.\n\nRecycling Programs in Latin America\n\nSony encourages the customers to recycle their products under each recycling program in countries existing the takeback and recycling regulations. In Mexico and Peru, Sony handles the individual take-back and recycling scheme through 12 collection points, and complies with the recycling regulation based on producer responsibility. In Colombia, Sony belongs to a collective scheme promoting take-back and recycling, and complies with the recycling regulation. Also, they are participating in the collective take back program called \u201cVision 30/30\u201d. This collective program seeks to continue the path to the recycling of containers and packaging within the framework of the existing regulation.\n\nRecycling Activities in China\n\nSony has offices in a number of Central and South American countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama and Peru. These offices operate recycling programs designed to meet the needs of their particular areas. Here we introduce a joint project operated throughout Latin America as well as representative examples of Sony commitment to recycling initiatives.\n\nRecycling Activities in Latin America\n\nCompliance with Regulations on Recovery Processing of Waste Electrical and Electronic Products (China WEEE)\n\nIn 2011, China enacted the Regulations on Recovery Processing Waste Electrical and Electronic Products. The regulation mandates the recycling of five types of products: televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and PCs, and obliges manufacturers and importers to contribute to a fund that is used to cover the cost of processing of waste electrical and electronic products. In compliance with the regulations, Sony (China) Limited makes regular contributions to the fund.\nWorldwide Environmental Communication\n\nThrough hosting special events and supplying special content, Sony is helping to raise the environmental awareness of society. Sony provides a wide variety of stakeholders with environmental information in an accurate, timely and continuous manner.\n\nTaking Advantage of Sony Events to Raise Environmental Awareness\n\nSony Expo 2021 was held in China to showcase the latest information on everything from products to entertainment. During the event, we held a Sustainability Session to introduce our environmental efforts. There were more than 20,000 spectators including online viewers, to whom we shared the Sony Group\u2019s environmental vision and the myriad environmental initiatives undertaken in China. Moreover, some of the participants at the venue were invited to experience Synecoculture\u2122 together with the artist of Sony Music Entertainment.\n\nEnvironmental Activities Leveraging Entertainment Business\n\nSony capitalizes on its influential entertainment business to promote environmental activities. Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) is engaging in environmental efforts supported by Playing for the Planet Alliance\u00ae through its action-adventure Horizon Forbidden West, created by Guerrilla. SIE, in cooperation with its partners worldwide, planted trees and invested in wildflower meadows and coastal ecosystems in selected regions tied to player participation, which helped to raise their awareness of climate change and biodiversity.\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) teamed up with the United Nations (UN), the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and the UN Foundation for a multi-media campaign where Peter Rabbit and his friends from Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway encouraged fans to be food heroes by taking actions like eating more healthy foods, buying local and seasonal food, reducing food waste and planting their own garden. On behalf of Sony Music Entertainment (UK), the Sony Music Group has joined the Music Climate Pact to share insights on combating climate change and promote decarbonization efforts across the music industry.\n\n* Playing for the Planet is an international initiative launched by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to rally the game industry to combat climate change.\n\nThe Horizon Forbidden West Project\nPeter Rabbit\u2019s global educational campaign\nThe Sony Music Group joins the Music Climate Pact\n\nSynecoculture\u2122\n\nSince 2015, Sony Electronics Inc. (SEL) in the United States has worked with partners to conduct the Sony Open in Hawaii, a PGA Tour event\u00ae with an environmental focus. In 2022, the tournament continued its Sustainability Initiative, reusing structural material, diverting waste through recycling, and reducing energy and water use. The event is supported by large number of volunteers. SEL provided reusable water bottle which contains recycled plastic to volunteers, and water dispensers were installed for volunteers to help reduce the plastic waste from the event. Additionally, BRAVIA\u2122, XR-65A95K was selected for the winner\u2019s prize, which uses Sony\u2019s Original Flame-Retardant Recycled Plastic SORPLAS\u2122 in its rear cover.\n\n*1 Synecoculture\u2122 is a trademark or registered trademark of Sakura Shizenjuku Global Nature Network.\n*2 PGA Tour is the US men\u2019s professional golf tour.\nManagement of Risks Related to Chemical Substances\n\nAs a company that uses chemical substances, Sony discloses information on emissions of such substances and exchanges views on safety and environmental issues with residents in the vicinity of its sites, as well as with local authorities, with the aim of reinforcing mutual understanding.\n\nFor instance, Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation actively participates in local community events and organizes its own interactive events at all of its plants. The company also holds tours of its manufacturing plants, during which it explains to visitors how wastewater is processed by environmental-related equipment.\n\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nSony is active in a wide range of fields, and its stakeholders have diverse expectations. In order to promote a healthy, spiritually abundant, sustainable society, Sony is deeply committed to stakeholder engagement, a process whereby it seeks to earn greater trust from stakeholders and cooperate with them to achieve common aims.\n\n\u2192 Partnership and Participation in Multi-Stakeholder Frameworks\n\nRaising the Environmental Awareness of Employees\n\nSony shares information on environmental issues with employees of the global Sony Group. All Group employees in Japan are required to take an environmental e-learning course, and the teaching materials from the course are being used to conduct environmental education at business sites outside of Japan. Sony is raising the environmental awareness of Group employees worldwide, using channels such as the corporate intranet to provide timely environmental information. Sony conducts events and educational activities for employees at its business sites around the world, to introduce environmental issues and Sony\u2019s environmental initiatives. For example, in 2021 Sony conducted online seminars on the issues of environmentally conscious food and ocean plastic for all employees in Japan.\nMateriality Rationale\nSince its establishment, Sony has sought to remain at the forefront of technological development, building continuously on its achievements to deliver new value for people everywhere. In these efforts, Sony recognizes the people who work at Sony to be its most important management resources. Employees are important stakeholders in Sony\u2019s diversified, global business and are the key to its efforts to achieve sustainable growth and generate social value. Sony is committed to increasing employee engagement by making the most of the individual strength, skills, abilities, and creativity of its diverse people. Sony seeks to sustainably elevate its talent and organizational capabilities in order to raise its overall business performance.\n\nBasic Approach\nSince its founding, Sony has viewed employees not as a group, but as individuals. Sony respects the independence of each individual and their enthusiasm for taking on challenges and cherishes a corporate culture that places the company and employees on equal terms, based on the partnership of choice between Sony and each individual employee, where each party is accountable for being responsive to the needs of the other. With the recent launch of Sony\u2019s new organizational structure, Sony\u2019s People Philosophy\u2014unchanged since the beginning\u2014is now described with the phrase, \u201cSpecial You, Diverse Sony.\u201d Accordingly, Sony\u2019s HR strategy framework is organized around the themes of \u201cAttract talented individuals,\u201d \u201cDevelop talented individuals,\u201d and \u201cEngage talented individuals.\u201d Sony seeks to maximize the value that each of its diversely talented employees can create, thereby driving the Sony Group\u2019s sustainable value creation.\n\nSystem\nMaterial issues related to employees are discussed and deliberated at group-level meetings and by HR committees for each business segment. The Sony Group Corporation officer in charge of human resources and HR managers from the six Sony business segments also hold regular meetings.\n\nLooking to the Future\nWith a focus on diversity, equity & inclusion, talent development, and engagement, Sony Group will continue to offer working conditions that contribute to the health and safety of employees as part of its efforts to achieve sustainable growth and generate social value. Sony will provide opportunities for employees to improve and make the most of their individual strength, skills, abilities, and creativity.\n\nMilestones\n1966: Internal job posting program started\n1973: Sony Technology Exchange Fair started\n1978: Sony Taiyo Corporation founded\n1988: Flex-time system introduced\n1990: Parenting leave and flex holiday programs introduced\n2000: Sony University program started\n2008: Flexible work (formerly called telework) policy introduced\n2011: Human Rights Committee changed name to Diversity Committee\n2015: Flexible career leave and free agent programs introduced\n2017: Work style reform project started at Sony Group companies in the electronics business in Japan\n2018: PORT, a venue for developing new talent, established at Headquarters\n2020: Redefined Sony\u2019s People Philosophy and human resources strategy.

SLBP was established by Sony Life as a special-purpose subsidiary in March 2019. Sony Life was expanding its regular workforce, and recognized the need to hire persons with disabilities and expand the fields in which they could confidently play an active role. In addition to clerical and cleaning work, it started to provide work that involved collecting used stationery to be recycled and reused. Sony Life aims to provide a place where persons with mental, developmental or intellectual disabilities can find independence and autonomy, and can contribute to society through high-quality work.\n\nDevelop Talented Individuals: Positive Influence (Music)\n\nPositive Influence is the first talent and inclusion program to be run at Sony Music Entertainment (SME). By opening up paths into the music industry, it has continued to really change things for young people from lower socio-economic communities. Employees receive specialized coaching from the Creative Mentor Network, a charity that has partnered with SME, so that they can have a positive impact on the communities concerned, on SME, and on the creative industry as a whole. The Positive Influence program enables employees to play an active role in those communities, share their knowledge of the music industry with young people from lower socio-economic communities, and facilitate opportunities for them. Simultaneously the program has added value to Sony\u2019s internal culture by helping to support the development of its employees and create a deeper understanding amongst its workforce of the systemic issues faced by young people trying to break into the industry, encouraging them to become advocates for change and actively champion diverse talent.\n\nEngage Talented Individuals: SIE Heroes 2021 (Game & Network Service)\n\nSIE Heroes 2021 is a peer-to-peer recognition program that celebrates and recognizes the efforts of SIE colleagues from across the globe. The program was started in 2020, which was a challenging year for SIE with the pandemic and the launch of a new console. It was the first significant employee engagement activity since SIE moved to a global model. In 2021, there were 6,000 nominations (an 82% increase from the previous year) in four categories, Work/Project, Emotional Support, Unsung Hero, or Something Else. The leadership team is invested in this project, sending personal notes to employees who received the highest number of nominations. Nominations are displayed on an in-house website with the prior approval of the parties concerned. This program surfaces thousands of organic stories of employees demonstrating positive cultural behaviors and has helped SIE to continue fostering a culture of recognition and support.\nSony\u2019s People Philosophy\n\nSpecial You, Diverse Sony\n\nThis has been redefined in line with the new organizational structure established in 2021. The phrase \u201cSpecial You\u201d describes an independent individual who shapes their own career with a spirit of freedom and open-mindedness and opens up the future. \u201cDiverse Sony\u201d represents Sony\u2019s culture, which values diversity and supports each employee\u2019s individual strength, thoughts, dreams, and the challenges they are excited about. \u201cSpecial You, Diverse Sony\u201d conveys the message that each unique individual and Sony itself, which embraces the individual, can grow together, aligned by our shared Purpose.\n\nSince its founding, Sony has respected the independence and aspirational spirit of individuals, always cherishing a corporate culture based on the partnership of choice between Sony and each individual employee, where each party is accountable for being responsive to the needs of the other. This is the essence of Sony\u2019s Founding Prospectus, written in 1946 by co-founder Masaru Ibuka, which reads, \u201cWe shall establish an ideal factory that stresses a spirit of freedom and open-mindedness, and where engineers with sincere motivation can exercise their technological skills to the highest level,\u201d and \u201cWe shall place emphasis on a person\u2019s ability, performance and character, so that each individual can fully exercise his or her abilities and skills.\u201d It is also reflected in the words that fellow co-founder, Akio Morita, spoke to newly hired Sony employees: \u201cIf you regret joining Sony, quit immediately. Once you\u2019ve decided to work for Sony, let us be responsible to each other. I\u2019d like every one of you to think at the end of your life that you have no regret spending time at Sony.\u201d A positive growth cycle by which the growth of diverse individuals propels Sony\u2019s growth is possible because the company and the employees stand together on equal terms, with an overarching expectancy to mutually deliver and scale up, as Sony continues to provide employees with a range of growth opportunities so they can willingly take on their best career options.\n\nThe group-wide HR strategy is based on Sony\u2019s People Philosophy and is organized around the themes of \u201cAttract talented individuals,\u201d \u201cDevelop talented individuals,\u201d and \u201cEngage talented individuals.\u201d Attract talented individuals: Sony approaches a broad range of talent via recruitment campaigns across the Group, attracting diverse people who identify with the Sony Purpose, embrace a challenging spirit and possess ambition to grow. Develop talented individuals: Sony provides employees with a diverse range of spaces and opportunities for autonomous learning and has systems in place that make various career challenges available to them. Engage talented individuals: Sony boosts employee engagement and creates relationships where organizations and employees help each other to develop and grow. Because each of the Sony Group\u2019s diverse businesses requires various management styles and talent with different skills and abilities to create value, each business plans and executes a HR strategy that best suits its needs, while operating in line with the shared People Philosophy. Rather than managing each individual business, Sony Group Corporation leads and supports the evolution of each Sony business, while focusing on common themes that will drive sustainable growth for the entire group.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nSony Group Diversity Statement\n\nSony, which develops diverse businesses globally, employs employees with diverse backgrounds. Sony leverages its diverse businesses and workforce as strengths in its business strategy. The Sony Group Diversity Statement was established in 2013 to serve as a global policy to further highlight the importance of diversity in the workplace. Sony\u2019s People Philosophy establishes that Sony is a \u201cplace\u201d that supports and realizes the growth of independent \u201cindividuals\u201d and will grow together to fulfill the Sony Purpose & Values. Accordingly, Sony values the perspective of equity and strives to ensure true inclusion. Sony regards diversity, equity and inclusion as a key management concern and will continue to maximize its performance in this area.\n\nSony Group Diversity Statement\n\nIt is in Sony\u2019s DNA \u2014 and a source of our innovation \u2014 to value different perspectives and backgrounds as we conduct our business activities globally and rise to new challenges. Sony promotes diversity across the Sony Group as a key management strategy by ensuring an inclusive work environment and by recruiting, hiring, training and promoting employees from diverse backgrounds.\n\nBusiness and Geographies\n\nCross-Business Collaboration\n\nSony is engaged in a broad range of businesses, and its diverse employees collaborate across them to take on new challenges in the development of products, services and content, and marketing. In fiscal year 2021, a total of 3,400 Sony Group employees were transferred to other companies within the Group to enable them to branch out in their careers and build cross-business connections, and this is creating new opportunities for collaboration across the Group.\n\nEmployees Activities Across Regions\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, approximately 960 employees were transferred overseas as part of Sony\u2019s global deployment of personnel, to transfer technology and knowledge, and launch new businesses. This includes some 80 employees dispatched from group companies outside of Japan, working in various business fields, approx. 50% of whom are in management positions. The Sony Group operates job transfer policies to efficiently facilitate international transfers. In fiscal year 2021, the global COVID-19 pandemic continued to be a major impediment to personnel transfers. In response to this, Sony took a flexible approach while carefully assessing the situation in line with restrictions and regulations on international entry. To better support employees of all nationalities and languages, the Sony Group in Japan follows up on employees after hiring and assists employees in their networking and career development. To facilitate English communication among employees from around the world, intranet content and systems for personnel and accounting are offered in both English and Japanese. Sony also shares government information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as about border controls and vaccinations, and provides comprehensive support with the practicalities of daily life.\n\nFurthermore, in collaboration with the project members of DIVI@Sony* (Diversity Initiative for Value Innovation at Sony), Sony Group companies in Japan have conducted surveys and interviews with non-Japanese employees, their managers and colleagues. Using these results, those companies have identified issues they face and are working on devising and implementing necessary measures. Specifically, Sony provides opportunities for non-Japanese employees to explore their own career development and gain insights, and implements ongoing initiatives to foster a culture that respects diversity. These initiatives include Sony Happy Hour, a regular networking event for non-Japanese employees, interviews with non-Japanese management personnel who serve as role models, cross-cultural communication events, and talks on diversity by globally known outside speakers.\n\n* DIVI@Sony stands for Diversity Initiative for Value Innovation at Sony\n\nTalent Acquisition\n\nSony is developing, designing, selling and marketing products, services and content in many different countries and regions around the world, and promotes the localization of these operations by securing local talent that can meet national, regional and local needs with R&D bases globally. Sony ensures diversity, equity and inclusion in hiring and works with external organizations to promote hiring of minorities. In Japan, Sony is strengthening the recruitment of international talent of diverse nationalities for R&D departments and Sony AI Inc. in order to drive progress on advanced technologies and businesses, while also increasing the hiring of talented university graduates and mid-career professionals from around the world.\n\nUnder its Global Internship Program, Sony welcomes talented university students from a variety of countries/regions, including Japan and other Asian countries, Europe, and North America, to offices in its major business fields. (The entry wage at Sony Group Corporation is established at an equal level for both men and women and is set adequately higher in comparison to the legal minimum wage in each part of the country.)\n\nGender, Sexual Orientation, Disabilities\n\nPromoting Greater Opportunities for Women\n\nSony embraces diversity and the working contributions of women, who accounted for 35% of the workforce and held 30.1% of management positions as of the end of fiscal year 2021. Sony Group Corporation has set a target for women to hold over 20% of management positions by fiscal year 2025, and another target for 100% of employees with newborns to take child care leave (legal childcare leave of absence and/or Sony\u2019s paid child care leave), with the men among them taking an average of more than 10 days of child care leave. Group companies in Japan set their own targets and are actively implementing initiatives to achieve those targets. Sony carries out \u201cdisclosure of information\u201d and \u201cdisclosure of action plans\u201d in accordance with the provisions of Japan\u2019s Act on Promotion of Women\u2019s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace, using the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare\u2019s \u201cDatabase of Corporate Performance in the Area of Women\u2019s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace.\u201d\n\nBoth in and outside Japan, Sony operates a leadership program to\ndevelop leadership skills and mindsets among women and support their networking, by providing opportunities for career development and assisting the professional growth of women. In March 2022, Sony invited an expert to give a lecture in celebration of International Women\u2019s Day. The event was intended to provide a deeper understanding of global trends and to encourage the audience to take action aimed at gender equality.\n\nSony Group Corporation\u2019s Action Plan for the Act on Promotion of Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation\n\nSony Group Corporation\u2019s Action Plan for the Women Empowerment Law\n\nSony Group Corporation Awarded \u201cEruboshi\u201d Certification by Japan\u2019s Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare for Its Outstanding Performance in Promoting Women\u2019s Participation in the Workplace (in Japanese)\n\nShift in Ratio of Women in Management Positions in Sony Group Companies in Japan\n\n| Company                        | Targets for the Ratio of Women in Management Positions by End of Fiscal Year 2025 |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sony Group Corporation         | 20%                                                                              |\n| Sony Corporation               | 7%                                                                               |\n| Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation | 4.7%**                                                                          |\n| Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. | 15%*                                                                            |\n| Sony Music Entertainment Inc.  | 28%                                                                              |\n| Sony Financial Group           | 15%*                                                                            |\n\n*1 Percentage calculated from the numerical target for women in management positions by the end of fiscal year 2025, prescribed according to the number at the end of fiscal year 2022\n\n*2 Numerical target of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. in Japan\n\n*3 Sum of the percentage of women in management positions calculated from numerical targets in action plans based on the Act on Promotion of Female Participation and Career Advancement in the Workplace, as stipulated for Sony Financial Group companies\n\nManagement Roles Pay Ratio of Women to Men* (Sony Group Corporation)\n\n| Item                          | Men | Women |\n|-------------------------------|-----|-------|\n| Men-Women Ratio: Basic Salary | 102 | 100   |\n| Men-Women Ratio: Total Remuneration | 102 | 100   |\n\n* Comparison of average compensation for managers excluding executives. The same pay scale is applied to men and women. Gaps are due to differences in factors such as grade distribution.\n\nPromoting Greater Opportunities for Individuals with Disabilities\n\nSony employs and supports individuals with disabilities in compliance with the laws, regulations, and rules of the countries and regions in which it operates, while endeavoring to create inclusive working environments that enable employees to build successful careers regardless of any disabilities they may have.\n\nSony co-founder Masaru Ibuka once recalled the day when an initiative was launched, saying, \u201cWe had a spirit of autonomy and a belief in creating workplaces that do not offer charity, but rather create an environment that makes it possible for individuals with disabilities to manufacture products that exceed those manufactured by individuals without disabilities.\u201d* Sony\u2019s senior management has been seeking to build an environment in which individuals do not feel held back by their disability and disabilities do not create barriers, enabling everyone to thrive.\n\nSony Taiyo Corporation, which was established in 1978 prior to the legal institution in Japan of special-purpose subsidiaries, has begun to share throughout the Sony Group the know-how and experience it has amassed on the employment of persons with disabilities. Sony\nhas created an inclusive environment at its three special-purpose subsidiaries: Sony Tayo Corporation, Sony Kibou/Hikari Corporation which specializes in providing employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual and mental disabilities, and Sony Life Business Partners Co., Ltd. which was established in 2019 to carry out clerical work and other tasks for Sony Life. Sony is now expanding initiatives to create an inclusive environment throughout the group. Sony Group special-purpose subsidiaries are independent business establishments that seek to provide job satisfaction via carefully thought out employment, such as duties carried out jointly with other business sites or individual companies. These initiatives are leveraged in the employment of persons with disabilities at each group company. Guidance is provided to prepare suitable work environments and raise employee awareness so that everyone can flourish at work wherever they are, and to increase workplace knowledge about disability employment and expand job opportunities in individual companies. Amongst other steps, Sony prepared group-wide guidelines on reasonable workplace accommodations, prior to legislative changes introduced in Japan in 2016. These guidelines ensure that sufficient discussions take place with individual employees who have a disability prior to making such accommodations.\n\nGroup companies outside Japan also employ persons with disabilities in partnership with national and local government agencies or as allowed by local circumstances, and in some cases have received external recognition for employment of persons with disabilities or have been cited as examples for other companies to follow. Sony provides opportunities for learning about special-purpose subsidiaries in Japan and approaches to employing persons with disabilities, as well as avenues for companies to share expertise. By employing persons with disabilities in a way that only Sony can, Sony is practicing thought out employment, such as duties carried out jointly with other establishments that seek to provide job satisfaction via carefully thought out employment, such as duties carried out jointly with other business sites or individual companies. These initiatives are leveraged in the employment of persons with disabilities at each group company. Guidance is provided to prepare suitable work environments and raise employee awareness so that everyone can flourish at work wherever they are, and to increase workplace knowledge about disability employment and expand job opportunities in individual companies. Amongst other steps, Sony prepared group-wide guidelines on reasonable workplace accommodations, prior to legislative changes introduced in Japan in 2016. These guidelines ensure that sufficient discussions take place with individual employees who have a disability prior to making such accommodations.\n\nEmployees with disabilities accounted for 2.87% of Sony Group Corporation\u2019s workforce as of March 31, 2022, while the average for the Sony Group in Japan (companies with over 101 employees, consolidated basis) was 2.50% as of March 31, 2022, both above the 2.3% mandated by Japanese law for companies over a certain size.\n\n1) Based on the approach of Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka that, although there are persons without disabilities, no one is healthy all the time.\n\n2) The Valuable 500 Media Hub: An initiative to build a creative content resource with interviews and footage featuring persons with disabilities in the community.\n\nKey Activities to Promote Career Development of Individuals with Disabilities at the Sony Group around the World\n\nGlobal\n\nSony was selected as one of the Iconic Companies in The Valuable 500, an international initiative to promote participation by individuals with disabilities so that they can demonstrate their latent potential to bring value to business, society, and the economy. The Iconic Companies are a driving force in their respective countries, regions, and industries. Sony is providing support for The Valuable 500 Media Hub Project.\n\nJapan\n\nThe Sony Group in Japan is creating inclusive workplace environments where a disability is no impediment to building a career, and is working with employees with disabilities to check building accessibility and make improvements where necessary. Ten Sony Group companies participated in the annual job fair, which was held online with company information sessions and individual interviews taking place on the same day, and was an opportunity for job seekers with disabilities to engage with Sony Group companies. As the only company in Japan selected by The Valuable 500 as one of its Iconic Companies, Sony is discussing initiatives with affiliated companies in Japan and The Nippon Foundation Library to create a society where people with disabilities can flourish.\n\nUnited States\n\nSony Corporation of America works with partners such as Disability:IN, a global organization devoted to inclusion and equity for persons with disabilities in business, to provide training and educational opportunities to support employees with disabilities.\n\nChina\n\nSony China goes beyond simply providing employment opportunities for people with disabilities; it endeavors to promote the hiring of people with disabilities via a diversity and inclusion program that supports practical courses which help university students with disabilities adapt to their future life as a working adult.\n\nLGBTQ+ Inclusivity\n\nSony globally strives to provide LGBTQ+ employees with working environments in which they can feel comfortable being themselves, striving to be a leader whilst acknowledging various national and regional considerations and circumstances.\n\nIn Japan, Sony has expanded certain personnel programs*1 to encompass same-sex partners and implements an e-learning course for all employees that covers LGBTQ+ issues, while also offering LGBTQ+ workshops.\n\nSony also supports the diversity of employees in other ways, such as enabling employees to use their preferred names at work, providing multipurpose restrooms, using gender-neutral uniforms, making it optional for job applicants to indicate their gender on applications, and providing private toilet and shower facilities in each room at corporate dormitories.\n\nIn addition, Sony organizes internal and external events designed to raise awareness on working environments that are comfortable for everyone.\n\nIn recent years, Sony has also been focusing on the impact that the presence of allies who understand LGBTQ+ issues and offer active support has on the psychological safety and willingness to work of LGBTQ+ employees. It is making efforts to increase the numbers and visibility of such allies in its workforce, and held joint events with companies in other businesses to explore this topic in fiscal year 2021.\n\n*1 LGBTQ+ is an acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and others. The expression is broadly used to refer to persons who do not identify as straight (heterosexual) or cisgender (identifying with the gender assigned at birth).\n\n*2 Personnel programs that have been extended to same-sex partners include monetary gifts and leave for bereavement, rent subsidies, and participation in employee family events.\nLGBTQ+ Initiatives by the Sony Group around the World\n\nJapan\nSony organizes talks on LGBTQ+ issues for employees and the public online, making them easier to attend for employees from other business sites and staff in charge of diversity at other companies. In addition to expanding opportunities for employees of the Sony Group in Japan to learn about LGBTQ+ issues, this has made the Sony Group\u2019s stance known to the wider public. Sony has also co-hosted events with other companies to increase the number of employees who are LGBTQ+ allies. Sony sponsored and was involved in Diversity Career Forum, an event organized by the NPO ReBit. Through the forum, Sony was able to broadly highlight its LGBTQ+ and diversity initiatives to the public. Sony received the highest Gold rating in the PRIDE Index from the volunteer organization work with Pride (wwP), in recognition of its internal and external efforts to promote understanding of LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., Sony Corporation of America, Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. and Sony Electronics all achieved the maximum score of 100% based on assessments in the Corporate Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, recognizing them as companies that create ideal working environments for LGBTQ+ employees. These scores reflect the level of fairness achieved within the organization toward LGBTQ+ employees, which is underpinned by rules designed to support these employees. Sony holds training on LGBTQ+ inclusion in partnership with the LGBTQ+ media advocacy organization GLAAD, and is also an official sponsor of the 33rd Annual GLAAD Media Awards, which honor media for fair, accurate, and inclusive representations of LGBTQ+ people and issues.\nTalent Development\n\nGrowth via the Interaction of Highly Original Employees and the Sony Culture of Supporting a Spirit of Challenge\n\nSony aims to be a place where each unique employee can grow and be challenged to the utmost, and where their growth leads to the growth of the company. Sony strives to further enhance motivation and encourage personal growth for its employees through on-the-job learning, as well as through access to a variety of programs designed to enhance individual abilities and skills and tailored to local needs. As a company that does business in a variety of countries and regions, Sony recognizes the importance of cultivating future business leaders with a global perspective. Accordingly, Sony is implementing initiatives aimed at fostering such employees and creating even more opportunities to bring their capabilities into full play.\n\nLearning and Career\n\nLearning and Development\n\nSony has defined the global behaviors it wants to see among employees: \u201cInspire and Be Inspired,\u201d \u201cStay on Point,\u201d and \u201cBreak Through Barriers.\u201d Sony is strengthening its systematic training to give employees the skills they need in various formats including group training and e-learning.\n\nManagement is considered to play an important role in the growth of the company and its employees. Management teams and HR in the overseas group companies via the platform. Overseas group companies also run their own initiatives, and have provided personalized learning content based on the situation of each employee. In addition, programs to acquire the skills needed to produce high-quality output in a changing work environment have been provided in Japan and overseas. For example, Sony Corporation of America runs sessions where experts talk about working successfully in a hybrid environment, and provides tools and resources to support employees in transitioning to a hybrid environment.\n\nInformation on training sessions conducted in fiscal year 2021 is shown below.\n\n| Item                        | Japan | Outside Japan | Total |\n|-----------------------------|-------|---------------|-------|\n| Number of programs          | 2,910 | 18,496        | 21,406|\n| Number of times offered     | 11,159| 35,686        | 46,845|\n| Cumulative total participants| 179,043| 203,067       | 382,110|\n| Cumulative total training hours| 568,662| 904,312       | 1,472,974|\n\nCareer Development\n\nSony has always encouraged its employees to take on new challenges, fostering this mindset both to further the growth of its employees and its growth as a company. Back in 1966, Sony became the first Japanese company to launch an internal job posting program, which has now been in place for 56 years. The program provides an avenue for employees to explore career opportunities while serving to optimize the assignment of personnel and strengthen key parts of Sony\u2019s business. To date, more than 7,900 employees have moved to new positions via the program, which has become essential to Sony\u2019s personnel strategy of developing employees who are eager to take on new challenges. In fiscal year 2015, Sony introduced Career Plus, a program that enables employees to remain in their current positions while also being involved in other jobs and projects posted by the company by holding concurrent or secondary positions. The program enables personnel to broadly leverage their expertise and knowledge while also building up their networks within Sony.\n\nMoreover, in order to ensure that career development is focused on the individual, Sony has greatly expanded its existing open recruitment system, adding new programs to it. These include a free agent program that gives talented employees the ability to declare their availability to Sony Group companies, which provides them with greater opportunities to branch out and pursue job opportunities in new fields, and Sony CAREER LINK, a program in which employees who register a profile can be contacted by a specific workplace or human resources department when a position matching their skills and experience becomes available.\n\nEvery autumn, Sony offers employees opportunities to network and explore new avenues in its Career Month, when it holds lectures and workshops to encourage employees to be more proactive about their career and provides career counseling. Employees also meet directly with their supervisors to discuss development plans regarding their careers and growth, and to review their skills. They receive support in autonomously shaping their career path in a way that is appropriate to their current career stage. Sony seeks to support employees\u2019 growth through work experience, and the New Performance Management Program used at Sony Group companies was revised in fiscal year 2016 to better reflect individual observations and foster growth. The program not only enables employees to set individual goals and track their progress, but also encourages year-round communication with their superiors by incorporating feedback on such aspects as their everyday conduct and impact on their workplace. Sony is pursuing its purpose of \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology\u201d by encouraging its employees to take on new challenges and supporting their career development by giving them professional experience within the Sony Group.\nPORT\u2014An Ideal Venue to Develop New Talent\n\nSony recognizes the importance of fostering a culture and nurturing an environment in which the group\u2019s diverse businesses and the diverse employees who drive those businesses can learn from each other and continue to grow. PORT is a place where ambitious employees who hold diverse values\u2014people from various specialized fields and backgrounds\u2014can organically interact across business and geographic boundaries. It embodies this concept by providing a venue for employees of the Sony Group to gather, connect, and create synergies in order to grow as individuals and nurture human resources who can navigate Sony into the future. PORT holds a large number of spontaneous employee-led lectures, study sessions, workshops, and brainstorming sessions. In fiscal year 2021, more than 1,000 events, mainly online, were held, bringing in more than 54,000 participants over the year. There is a wide range of content, including lectures by employees to explore Sony\u2019s diverse businesses in depth, roundtable discussions where employees share their work-related experiences and thoughts on their job, lectures to get people to think about their career, groups to discuss work styles in remote environments, AI-related workshops, lectures on career development, and discussions of topical books.\n\nSony provides active support so that employees can keep these activities going. PORT supports the creation of learning communities, facilitates lateral connections amongst employees actively engaged in initiatives, and provides a venue where know-how can be shared. It directly supports more than 20 communities, and regular study group meetings are held more than 700 times a year.\n\nPORT Shinagawa and PORT Minato Mirai provide environments geared to online PORT activities. With the support of dedicated staff and access to Sony cameras and equipment, employees can record and stream training sessions and learning activities and create their own content. These efforts enable employees of the Sony Group working in different countries and regions to stay connected despite geographical limitations and continue to create voluntary learning opportunities.\n\nCareer support for Senior Employees\n\nIn today\u2019s era of extended longevity, work and life planning are not uniform, and each individual has different needs and values. Sony has deployed the Career Canvas Program for veteran and senior employees to encourage them to think about, design and implement their own life plans while working actively within Sony. In line with Sony\u2019s founding philosophy of \u201cbuilding one\u2019s own career,\u201d we offer a variety of programs, including workshops on career development and financial assistance, to help employees relearn how to keep developing themselves.\n\nEngineering Talent\n\nTo pursue its purpose of \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology,\u201d Sony must engage in innovation to win new customers. Technology vitally underpins the value creation which drives all Sony Group businesses, so Sony constantly seeks to get even closer to people, to understand their motivations, and to pursue \u201ctechnology that inspires emotion.\u201d\n\nUsing Field-Specific Technology Strategy Committees to Achieve Inter-Organizational Collaboration\n\nSony aims to create long-term social value, in addition to generating sustainable, strong revenues. In order to create sustainable value and continue growing, Sony must leverage the diversity of its businesses and employees to further evolve. Lively interaction among employees from different backgrounds who hold diverse values leads to their own continual growth and ultimately drives the growth of Sony. Technology strategy committees are given the role of sharing knowledge from various fields across organizations, systematically advancing the technologies, and promoting the growth of human resources. The committees are highly significant in Sony\u2019s efforts to create sustainable value and secure ongoing growth. Sony formed field-specific technology strategy committees in fiscal year 2015, and they involve approximately 1,300 employees.\n\nField-Specific Technology Strategy Committees\n\nA technology strategy committee is established for each field. Each one consists of specialists who are selected from across Sony Group companies. These committees work to achieve technical innovation and roll out organization-specific technologies across the group. Technology is developed by people, so technology strategy committees implement related human resource measures. Sony offers talent development programs such as a key technology training course as well as personnel recruitment; this approach accounts for the special features of different technologies, and transcends the boundaries between different Sony Group companies.\nTechnology Training Courses\n\nAt the Sony Group in Japan, approximately 300 Sony engineers with frontline expertise in key technological fields serve as instructors, developing curricula and textbooks for use in core technology training courses and contributing to the enhancement of engineer expertise. These courses, which serve as the foundation for gaining further technical skills, have been in continuous development since the 1980s. Employees with a high level of expertise in a specific technical field serve as leaders who plan courses with selected themes that are in demand based on the latest conditions in specific fields and Sony goals. The courses are used by employees to expand their knowledge of specialized subjects, brush up on their knowledge for application in other areas, or re-learn subjects.\n\nSony develops the basic skills of its new recruits by offering them general technological training designed by its leading engineering experts, as well as specialized training programs developed by each of Sony\u2019s business units, which are designed to familiarize the trainees with technologies specific to each business. In fiscal year 2021, 90% of all training was held online and the AI and cloud-related educational content was enhanced. As a result of these efforts, a total of 26,100 employees took part in these courses, which are the cornerstone of the Sony Group\u2019s training for engineers, and will continue to be provided as opportunities for professional development.\n\nSony Outstanding Engineer Award\n\nCreated to further inspire engineers to take on new challenges, the Sony Outstanding Engineer Award is the highest form of individual recognition for engineers of the Sony Group. In order to develop products and services that appeal to customers\u2019 sensibilities, there is a wide range of technologies that Sony will have to work on. In addition to elemental technologies, there is also a need to integrate creative new technologies, and to optimize complex systems. Intended to increase the motivation of engineers, such awards have encouraged employees to be proactive in addressing challenges and have also promoted a corporate culture that emphasizes value creation.\n\nCorporate Distinguished Engineer Program\n\nBased on Sony\u2019s Purpose, the Corporate Distinguished Engineer program is designed to accelerate formulation and implementation of technology strategies that support sustainable growth and the development of talent. The term Distinguished Engineer (DE) designates those engineers group-wide who possess outstanding expertise and technical knowledge in key technological fields and are capable of carrying out the DE mission, shown below. The program highlights the important role that the DEs play as \u201cthe faces of Sony technology\u201d who take the lead in formulating technology strategies and supporting talent development. Publishing this program within the company and in society at large demonstrates this awareness and legacy at a group-wide level.\n\nThe Distinguished Engineer\u2019s Mission\n\nThe DE is to formulate and execute technology strategies while identifying signals of change, and support the development of talent in order to ensure Sony\u2019s sustainable growth. The DE:\n\n- Formulates the technological strategies that underpin our Sony\u2019s corporate strategy beyond the existing frameworks\n- Supports the execution of corporate strategies through technology by building global network and identifying signs of change\n- Discovers engineers with high potential and supports their development\n\nSony Technology Exchange Fair\n\nThe annual Sony Technology Exchange Fair (STEF) provides an opportunity for engineers of the Sony Group to present their R&D work to colleagues and create new value by sharing information and ideas among more employees. In addition to providing a space to present technologies of the Sony Group\u2019s businesses, STEF also seeks to enhance expertise and knowledge, featuring lectures and seminars by invited speakers from inside and outside the group, panel sessions chaired by a DE, and the Open Innovation Showcase featuring exhibits by companies receiving investment from the Sony Innovation Fund. The event has served as a launchpad for numerous business applications since it was first organized in 1973. With \u201cKando-Creating Technology\u201d as its theme, STEF was held as a hybrid format with a mix of online and on-site venues in fiscal year 2021. More than 15,000 Sony Group employees worldwide participated in the event. COVID-19 measures were in place at the on-site venue, and the mood of the engineers was buoyant as the exhibitors and visitors interacted in person for the first time in two years. There was a live stream from the on-site venue in Tokyo for employees around the world who could not make it in person, creating a sense of unity between all the venues. 48 online seminars were also held featuring guests and DEs who play a prominent role in their field. Sony is a creative entertainment company with a solid foundation of technology, and STEF is a key corporate event that brings employees together and creates the potential for collaborations throughout the Sony Group. STEF is intended to generate technologies that will underpin the Sony of the future.\n\nIncentive Remuneration for Inventions\n\nSony rewards engineers for their inventions by ensuring that they receive fair and suitable incentive remuneration as stipulated under the Patent Act. The remuneration serves as an incentive to realize inventions and increase patent quality to strengthen Sony\u2019s business.\n\nTechnology Training Courses\n\n- Of more than 300 courses over the year, including core technology training and new hire training, 90% has been shifted online.

Sony University was established in 2000 with the mission to \u201ccultivate talent who can create and lead management visions and strategies,\u201d to \u201cpass on the Sony Spirit,\u201d and to \u201ccreate a human network for group management.\u201d Under this mission, Sony University programs are designed to foster top management candidates and global leaders who will play key roles in driving the business forward.\n\nThe courses offered include a program for leading managers from different Sony organizations around the world to foster innovative thinking and polish their leadership skills. Managers from Sony group companies who show promise as potential business leaders are selected to participate in a half-year program focusing on management literacy and interpersonal skills. Lively interactions with people from different business units and organizations, and opportunities to learn from each other, give Sony University an atmosphere of friendly rivalry. The course for global general managers was extended and made more widely available in fiscal year 2021. Participants drawn from Sony Group companies worldwide engaged in group discussions and collaborative relationships between leaders across the company. The Coaching for Results program gives managers coaching techniques they can use on a daily basis to nurture and guide their team. In the Executive Coaching program, qualified coaches assist senior leaders to improve their skills and tackle individual challenges. There is an on-demand portal that supports leaders to continue their professional growth, and effective team building tools are also provided.\n\nMain Initiatives to Train Human Resources and Develop Skills Worldwide in Sony Group Companies\n\n| Music | Sony Music Entertainment has established the Amplify program to combine talent development and business innovation. This program focuses on getting the most out of an engaged and skilled workforce by inspiring them to be real innovators and on investing in the early career pipeline as a real differentiator, covering the various elements over a period of seven months. This program has achieved real business results through experimentation. |\n| Movie | To support the development of top talent, Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. facilitates four programs intended to build leadership and industry acumen at key stages in an employee\u2019s career. The Business of Entertainment 101 program provides an overview of the entertainment business to emerging leaders to develop their business acumen. The Business of Entertainment 201 program provides a deep-dive into industry trends and research, to stimulate new ideas and deepen collaborative relationships between leaders across the company.

These opportunities include practical work in solving future organizational challenges from the perspective of a manager, and sessions on business imagination and leadership development, whose aim is for software engineers to create and drive new business. Some departments already run management training for section leaders that is based on dialog with the employees working under them, and are running a program on sustainable management methodology that brings out the initiative and creativity of diverse employees working from home. The results of employee engagement surveys and stress checks are utilized to gain an understanding of concerns and challenges so that reforms can be accelerated. |\n| Imaging & Sensing Solutions | As part of its strategies to nurture the next-generation of leaders, Sony Semiconductor Solutions runs a Core Personnel Training Mini MBA for management. The one-year program provides an overview of \u201cmanagement\u201d and \u201cbusiness,\u201d and the aim is for the participants to comprehensively examine the organization, update the role that they as leaders should play within it, and expand their horizons. After completing the course, they draft a medium-term plan that converts challenges in their own organization which came up in group discussions into solutions for the SSS Group. They present their medium-term plan to top management, which ensures that they do not simply acquire information but are also motivated to modify their behavior. In addition, to help them develop specific strategies to assist middle management, they carry out surveys of all SSS section managers (around 500 people) to gain an understanding of the true state of management affairs and identify challenges. |\nEmployee Engagement\n\nSony implements diverse structural, environmental, and cultural initiatives, so that employees can constantly challenge themselves to create value.\n\nWork-Life Balance and Well-Being\n\nSony believes that strong revenues are sustained by providing a worker-friendly environment where all employees can perform to their full potential. Under this vision, Sony considers employee health and work-life balance as essential to creating innovation and sustaining strong revenues as a company. Sony offers flexible working provisions and work conditions for employees to realize this work-life balance, while adhering to the customs and laws in countries and regions where it does business.\n\nEach employee of the Sony Group plays a part in the sustainable growth of the company. As part of its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, Sony has an important responsibility to create inclusive workplaces with attractive working conditions, and to encourage ways of working that enable employees to make the most of their talents while balancing their work responsibilities with events in their personal lives, including parenting, nursing care, and medical treatment. Sony recognizes the need to accommodate diverse ways of working to secure the health and motivation of employees.\n\nSony\u2019s workstyle reform project was launched at group companies in Japan in 2017. It endeavors to further raise awareness of existing initiatives such as a day for leaving work at the prescribed time and ensuring employees take advantage of such schemes, as well as encouraging employees to take their annual paid leave.\n\nIn Japan, Sony has introduced a flex-time system, a discretionary working system, and an advanced professional system which enable employees to have versatile work options. Last year, Sony Group Corporation employees used an average 14.8 days of paid leave, and employees of the Sony Group in Japan used an average 13.2 days, which is higher than the general average.\n\nMain Work-Life Balance Initiatives at Sony Group Companies around the World\n\n| Game & Network Services (Global) | Sony offers online therapy, fitness classes, and free vaccination services. The promotion of work-life balance also includes the Reset Friday initiative to allow all employees to concentrate on their work every Friday afternoon without being interrupted by meetings. |\n| Music (Europe) | Efforts have included a talk by a psychologist on work-life balance and by a psychiatrist on the effects of exercise on the brain and stress levels. |\n| Movie (United States) | Sony has introduced a leave system to accommodate changes throughout the various stages of life, including leave to deal with medical treatments for employees and their families.

Other childcare support activities include creating communities where parents can share information on education and other child-related topics. |\n\nFlexible Work Options for Diverse Lifestyles\n\nThe Sony Group in Japan offers human resources programs that enable employees to make the most of their talents within their preferred lifestyles.\n\nSony Group Corporation has a flexible career leave program, which has been in place since 2015 and is designed to open up a wider range of career paths. It enables employees to take up to five years off to pursue studies or work on upgrading their language or communication skills, or when accompanying a spouse who has been assigned abroad or embarks on international studies, or to take up to two years off to pursue studies at their own expense to further develop their expertise.\n\nThe company has a flexible work policy, which broadened the scope of its former telework policy in 2018 by making all employees eligible and expanding the number of telecommuting days available to employees. As a special measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the maximum limit on full telecommuting days that employees can take under the flexible work policy has been eliminated, and since June 2020 the core hours that were part of the flextime policy have been abolished. These changes were made to prioritize the health and safety of employees by mitigating the risk of COVID-19 transmission and creating an environment that allows for more flexible and efficient work styles. Even under these circumstances, Sony\u2019s efforts are unchanged to expand programs to provide employees with flexible and efficient work options, with the aims of enhancing the business efficiency of its organizations, fostering an organizational culture that generates ideas, and increasing the productivity and output of each employee.\nSupporting Employees Balancing Work with Child Care, Nursing Care, and/or Medical Treatment\n\nThe Sony Group in Japan promotes the Symphony Plan, a system to support the work-life balance of employees that is focused on the three areas of child care, nursing care, and medical treatment. The plan is designed to help Sony employees achieve work-life balance by creating an environment in which they can make the most of their skills at all stages of their career and throughout the various events in their lives.\n\nUnder the Symphony Plan, the Sony Group in Japan has various support programs including childcare paid leave (up to 20 days), which can be used in conjunction with childcare leave, a childcare and nursing care leave grant, which enables employees to take leave without having to worry about finances, and \u201clife vacations\u201d and \u201caccumulated leave\u201d, which can be used for the purposes of childcare, fertility treatment, nursing care, and medical treatment (cancer). These programs are widely used by employees.\n\nFor employees who have childcare or nursing care responsibilities and fertility or cancer treatment, Sony provides support by offering the option of reduced working hours and allowing use of paid annual leave on an hourly basis for childcare or nursing care.\n\nSince fiscal year 2017, the Career Plus Leave program has been supporting career development while employees take parenting or nursing leave by enabling employees to keep doing some work from home and also by subsidizing development programs such as language courses. The program provides greater flexibility for employees to continue their career development. The program provides greater flexibility for employees to continue their career development.\n\nWork-Life Balance Policies at Sony Group Corporation\n\n| General (childcare, care, treatment) | Childcare | Care | Treatment |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|------|-----------|\n| All employees eligible to work from home, a satellite office or elsewhere remotely | Childcare leave (Up until April 15 of the year following the date on which the child reaches 1 year of age) | Care leave (For one year, to care for a specific family member) | Infertility treatment scheme (Up to one year\u2019s leave, reduced working hours, flexitime, funding) |\n| Use of paid annual leave | Childcare leave grant (50,000 yen/month during the period of childcare leave) | Care leave grant (50% of standard monthly remuneration, up to 200,000 yen per month, during the period of care leave) | Scheme for designated medical treatment (cancer treatment) (Reduced working hours, flexitime) |\n| Life vacations (Leave covering the time required for hospital appointments) | Reduced working hours for childcare (Until the end of March of sixth grade of elementary school) | Reduced working hours to provide care (For a specific family member and specific reason, until that reason no longer exists) | |\n| Accumulated leave | Parental leave (Provides for 20 days\u2019 paid leave) | Flex-time work system during childcare (Until the end of March of sixth grade of elementary school) | Flextime to provide care (For a specific family member until there is no longer a reason to do so) |\n| Support for continued career development by employees during childcare leave, nursing care leave or flexible career leave to accompany a spouse (Subsidies for education expenses while on leave) | Flex-time work system during childcare (Until the end of March of sixth grade of elementary school) | Babysitter/childcare subsidy (Until end of March of third grade of elementary school) | |\n\nOrganizational Culture and Communication\n\nCommunication\n\nSony values employee communication. Embracing a corporate culture that promotes the spirit of freedom and open-mindedness passed down since its founding, Sony fosters diverse forms of communication both within workplaces and across organizational boundaries in order to create value.\n\nCommunication between Top Management and Employees\n\nSony treats communication between top management, including the CEO, and employees as a priority. Through the corporate intranet, information is provided on progress made in the Group\u2019s businesses, and communications are exchanged via e-mail and other media. Sony also works to create many other opportunities for direct dialogue between top management and employees. For example, Sony management holds regular informal gatherings and town hall meetings with employees which cover a wide variety of themes, from technology to management. By sharing opinions from both perspectives, not only do employees gain a closer affinity with\nmanagement, but the views of employees can also be used to enhance the quality of management.\n\n**Employee Engagement Survey**\n\nSony implements a single employee engagement survey across all of its businesses worldwide to collect information that is used to increase the engagement of each employee and energize the organizations. The survey gathers and analyzes information on key factors for continuously improving employee engagement such as employees\u2019 trust in the company and attitudes about value creation, work efficiency and effectiveness, work environment, career, growth and, as of 2021, employee wellbeing indices. The survey results are used to identify areas for further improvement and effective action. Even though the survey was carried out during the prolonged global COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people who felt they had a chance of building a career in the Sony Group increased, and the engagement index remained favorable for the second year running. The survey results were used as the basis for detailed analyses of each business segment and senior management discussions on effective action. The improvement initiatives were shared with employees via the corporate intranet and general meetings, with periodic review of results to monitor progress. The survey results were disclosed to managers on the day of the survey to facilitate discussions with employees on improvements that can be made with regard to issues for each organization based on the results and comments from staff who provided them. Sony makes the most of these employee surveys to shed light on employee engagement and promptly incorporates results into ongoing discussion and action across its organizations.\n\n**Results of Employee Engagement Survey**\n\n|                      | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Survey Response Rate | 88%  | 91%  | 91%  |\n| Employee Engagement Index* | 85%  | 88%  | 89%  |\n\n* Percentage of employees who did not give an unfavorable response to four questions regarding employee engagement\n\n**Communication among Employees**\n\nSony is exploring new avenues for fostering even more active communication. Sony Group companies in the picture business and the entertainment, technology & services business operating in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region have adopted a system that allows employees to recognize and give accolades to peers for their contributions. Sony employees are voluntarily creating various communities across business and organizational boundaries, which serve as platforms for information exchange, learning, and idea creation. Sony Corporation is utilizing We Project, a bottom-up initiative designed to ferment corporate culture, to hold opinion polls about corporate culture and build communities on the in-house SNS. Sony actively supports these communities by providing venues and platforms, providing endorsement from the management team, and asking management to be involved in planning various activities.\n\n**Labor Unions**\n\nSony maintains excellent labor-management relations. Approximately 9% of the overall workforce (at consolidated sites) is unionized.\nWorkplace\n\nSony creates appealing workplaces that foster Sony\u2019s corporate culture and make it possible for people to have diverse work styles, while encouraging employees to take on new challenges and pursuing greater employee engagement.\n\nFostering Sony\u2019s Corporate Culture\n\nSony strives to create appealing workplaces which foster a corporate culture that will lead the company into the future. At its Sony City headquarters, Sony\u2019s corporate culture is enhanced via a range of \u201cSony experiences\u201d such as employee collaborations and a variety of events. Sony has created a history wall outlining its corporate history with quotes from the founders and a lounge in the ground floor entrance hall of the headquarters building to communicate Sony\u2019s principles and corporate culture.\n\nSony Group companies are also creating workplaces with their own unique identities.\n\nEncouraging Employees to Take on New Challenges\n\nSony endeavors to create spaces that encourage employees to take on new challenges, guided by its vision of creativity and spirit of taking on challenges. The Creative Lounge at the Sony City headquarters building, BRIDGE TERMINAL at Sony City Osaki, and Comi-chika at the Atsugi Technology Center serve as creative collaboration spaces for open communication and idea generation, supporting employees as they take on new challenges. Sony operates the Sony Startup Acceleration Program to accelerate the development of new business applications based on ideas generated from these creative spaces.\n\nActivity-Based Working\n\nSony\u2019s offices utilize open floor plans that encourage collaboration and foster the creativity and productivity of employees. Sony embraces the concept of activity-based working to create functional workplaces that flexibly adapt to different styles of working and environments according to the work objectives and situation, enabling its diverse workforce to achieve a good work-life balance.\n\nEnabling Diverse Work Styles\n\nWherever possible, Sony has adopted measures to boost the flexibility of its work styles and provided working environments where employees can enjoy work-life balance. As part of these measures, it has created the STATIONS satellite offices at Sony City Minato Mirai. These can be used by employees from all segments of the Sony Group and provide an additional option to working from home or commuting to their usual work location.\nSony Group Global OHS Medium-Term Plan\n\nTo achieve its Vision Zero objectives, Sony is working to meet its OHS Medium-Term Plan, which is a globally shared plan. It is currently working to meet the targets for the period from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2023.\n\nSony Group Global OHS Medium-Term Plan (Fiscal Years 2021 to 2023)\n\n| Focal Points | Targets | Subjected Sites |\n|--------------|---------|-----------------|\n| ISO45001     | Complete external certification acquisition and maintain the certification | Subjected Sites for ISO 45001 certification |\n|              | Evolve the OHS Management System based on ISO 45001 | All sites |\n|              | Reduce accidents caused by slips, trips, falls and collisions | All sites |\n|              | Strengthen management of chemical substances (including the 9 RBA-listed process chemical substances) | Manufacturing logistics and R&D sites |\n|              | Reduce accidents caused by machinery | Manufacturing logistics and R&D sites |\n|              | Strengthen the evaluation of effectiveness of corrective actions toward incidents that have occurred and their horizontal deployment across the company | All sites |\n|              | Implement health risk measures based on changes in Working Styles and Working Environment | All sites |\n|              | Strengthen \u201cManagement of Change\u201d | All sites |\n\nFurther Improvement of OHS Management System Based on ISO 45001\n\nSince fiscal year 2019, Sony has operated an OHS management system based on the ISO 45001 international standard for people working in the Sony Group worldwide. In addition, since fiscal year 2020, Sony has been working steadily to obtain ISO 45001 external certification, beginning with manufacturing, logistics and R&D sites around the world and then proceeding on to other sites. Of the 50 relevant sites, 30 have already obtained ISO 45001 external certification. (The HQ OHS Office, 12 sites in Japan/East Asia, 11 sites in China, 5 sites in Pan Asia, and 1 site in Europe.) Of them, 23 sites have acquired comprehensive certification (as of June 2022).\n\nReduction of Accidents Caused by Unsafe Behavior\n\nThe global occurrence of OHS incidents has been trending downward each year in terms of both numbers of incidents and lost work days, but Sony is still working to further reduce risks. An analysis of OHS incidents in all regions has prompted Sony to identify collisions, slips, trips and falls due to unsafe behavior as a global priority due to the especially high number of such incidents. Accordingly, action to further reduce the number of slips, trips, falls and collisions is being promoted globally in the OHS Medium-Term Plan for fiscal years 2021 to 2023.\n\nMeasures to Reduce Health Risks\n\nThe global spread of COVID-19 transformed work styles and workplace environments. In response, Sony is carrying out periodical reassessments of harmful workplace risk factors that also cover mental health issues. Sony then implements measures to reduce health risks and initiatives to promote good health with the aim of enabling employees to maintain their vitality and enthusiasm for their work and professional growth. Sony is implementing measures that are consistent with the actual situation and characteristics of each business site; these include enhancing mental health initiatives in response to the increase in remote work, and promoting ergonomics in response to the increase in working from home.\n\nImproving Management of Chemical Substances / Reducing Accidents Caused by Machinery\n\nSony\u2019s R&D facilities and manufacturing sites use a wide variety of chemical substances and machinery, and reducing the risks associated with that use is an important determinant of the level of safety and health. Sony is establishing a risk assessment system that will not just identify hazards relating to chemical substances, machinery, and work modes, but will also check that legal requirements are met. This system will be deployed globally. Sony also carries out internal site audits and corporate audits by Headquarters and Regional Safety Offices to ascertain the state of chemical substance management at its manufacturing sites. Management of the hazardous process chemicals* flagged by the Responsible Business Alliance\u2019s Industry Focus List in 2021 has also been included in Sony\u2019s medium-term occupational health and safety plan in order to promote thorough risk assessment.\n\n* Subjected 9 Process Chemicals (CAS No.)\n1-bromopropane (106-94-5), Benzene (71-43-2), Dichloromethane (75-09-2), Methanol (67-56-1), N-hexane (110-54-3), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) (872-50-4), Tetrachloroethylene (127-18-4), Toluene (108-88-3), Trichloroethylene (79-01-6)\nGlobal OHS Organization\n\nTo ensure that all group companies operate under a single management structure, Sony has established a global OHS system led by top management and comprised of eight Safety Offices (in Japan/East Asia, China, Pan Asia, Latin America, North America, Europe, and in the Music and Pictures segments), and appointed Regional Safety Officers who are responsible for implementing cross-regional programs. To staff the management of this system, Sony established an HQ OHS Office at Sony Group Corporation headquarters to serve as the OHS headquarters at the Sony Group. This office does the practical work to ensure compliance with laws and regulations related to health and safety, as well as to set Sony Group OHS targets and ensure that they are met.\n\n<Top Management>\n- Establish Sony Group basic OHS policies and targets\n- Establish and supervise an organization for promoting the OHS management system\n- Appoint, remove and direct Sony Group Safety Officers and Regional Safety Officers\n- HQ OHS Office\n- Sony Group\u2019s OHS-related headquarters functions (governance functions)\n- Ensure compliance with OHS laws and regulations, and set and seek to accomplish the corporate target\n\n<Regional Safety Officers>\n- Set and implement regional targets and plans\n- Establish and direct Regional Safety Offices\n- Direct compliance with OHS-related legislation and Group regulations, and instruct corrective action when violations occur\n\n<Regional Safety Offices>\n- Staff of Regional Safety Officers\n- Ensure that the Sony Group complies with OHS laws and regulations and accomplishes the corporate targets in their regions.\n\nActivities of the Sony HQ OHS Office\n\nMonitoring\nTo achieve the Vision Zero goals, the HQ OHS Office regularly collects information on the occurrence of occupational accidents and illnesses at Sony Group companies and sites, and information on the OHS activities carried out there. To collect information, Sony holds regular meetings with regional safety officers to share examples of good practices and events in the region, and this information is used in problem solving. Regional conferences are hosted by safety officers and attended by representatives from sites in the region to gather opinions from individual workplaces and share about any issues. In addition to regularly including information on good practices collected by the HQ OHS Office in in-house newsletters, each time a significant incident occurs or information on an accident comes to light, the office also instructs that actions be taken to prevent a recurrence.\n\nGlobal Audit System\nAt Sony\u2019s sites, internal audits, corporate audits and external audits are employed to examine the effectiveness of OHS management systems. Internal audits are conducted for sites to examine the effectiveness of their own OHS management system in order to continuously improve the system and ensure that occupational accidents are prevented. The HQ OHS Office and Regional Safety Offices carry out corporate audits to examine compliance with corporate rules. External audits are conducted to provide confirmation of the effectiveness of the OHS management system by a third-party certification body. These three types of audits combine to determine the effectiveness of the OHS management system as a whole. In addition, the HQ OHS Office holds training sessions for internal auditors to improve the skills of auditors in each region. In Japan/East Asia, the Japan/East Asia Regional Safety Office provides group training to ensure that OHS managers and employees of business sites have the required skills.\n\nFiscal Year 2021 OHS Training\n\n| Region          | Training program                  | Target group                        | No. of trainees |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| HQ              | Global Auditors Training          | Regional safety officers and managers | 30             |\n| Japan/East Asia | OHS Managers Basic Training       | Newly appointed site OHS managers   | 36             |\n|                 | Laser Safety Management Training  | Site employees responsible for handling equipment | 84             |\n|                 | Handling Chemical Substances, and Risk Assessment Training | Site chemical substance managers | 40             |\n|                 | Handling Machinery/Equipment, and Risk Assessment Training | Site employees responsible for handling equipment | 48             |\n| North America   | Internal Auditors Training        | Site OHS managers                   | 17             |\n| China           | Internal Auditors ISO 45001 Training | Site OHS managers                   | 18             |\n|                 | OHSMS Basic Training              | Non-manufacturing site OHS managers and supervisors | 10             |\n|                 | Risk Assessment Training          | Manufacturing site OHS managers and supervisors | 35             |\n\n*1 Japan, South Korea and Taiwan Region\n*2 Mainland China and Hong Kong Region\n*3 Mongolia, Asian countries other than the above, the Middle East, Oceania, Africa, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan\n*4 Europe, Turkey, Israel, Russia, and former Soviet Union countries (except for Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan)\n*5 Sites affiliated with Sony Music Entertainment\n*6 Sites affiliated with Sony Pictures Entertainment\n\nManagement Review\nThe HQ OHS Office facilitates annual management reviews conducted by the officer in charge of human resources and general led by top management based on each region\u2019s reports to evaluate OHS activities; the occurrence of occupational accidents and illnesses in each region; and the level of achievement of activity goals. Management comments set out in management reviews are reflected in the OHS Medium-Term Plan, and are fed back to each Regional Safety Office and to sites within each region.\n\nOHS Education\nSony provides regional education tailored to its businesses in each region. In addition, the HQ OHS Office holds training sessions for internal auditors to improve the skills of auditors in each region. In Japan/East Asia, the Japan/East Asia Regional Safety Office provides group training to ensure that OHS managers and employees of business sites have the required skills.\nOccupational Health and Safety Initiatives in Region/Business\n\nOccupational Health and Safety Initiatives in Japan/East Asia\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, 7 out of the 11 accidents caused by unsafe behavior that led to absence from work were due to slips and falls, and there is a tendency for the length of absences from work to increase. Although the number of accidents causing absence from work among external contractors\u2019 employees working at Sony sites decreased, such accidents continue to occur. Sony will further reduce industrial accidents through efforts such as raising awareness of accidents caused by slips and falls, measures to prevent recurrence, and the lateral sharing of examples of good practices, and by requesting that external contractors cooperate in ongoing safety activities. As initiatives to reduce employee health risks, Sony carries out risk assessments in response to changes in work styles and workplace environments, with a particular focus on working from home, and is boosting mental health awareness. In addition, Sony has achieved its goal of \u201cbanning indoor smoking\u201d and keeping workplaces free of second-hand smoke at its main business sites in Japan, and continues to educate smokers on the risks and provide support for kicking the habit. In fiscal year 2021, Sony continued to regard the COVID-19 pandemic as a new health risk and has been implementing measures to prevent its spread at all of its sites, including disinfection and temperature checks when entering premises.\n\nOccupational Health and Safety Initiatives in North America\n\nSony operations in North America consist of a diverse group of companies across many fields.

Cuts and grazes: 11 accidents (5 more than the previous year)\n\nThese were the top three categories of unsafe behavior causing accidents in fiscal year 2021, accounting for roughly 70% of all accidents causing absence from work. Sony has set a medium-term target of reducing accidents caused by slips, trips, falls and collisions, and is making global efforts aimed at improvement.\n\nSony Global Trends in Lost Workdays\n\n| Year | Japan/East Asia | Pan Asia | China | Europe | North America |\n|------|----------------|---------|-------|--------|--------------|\n| 2017 | 1,612          | 2,009   | 1,526 | 1,211  | 1,209        |\n| 2018 | 1,526          | 1,211   | 1,209 | 1,162  | 1,152        |\n| 2019 | 1,211          | 1,209   | 1,162 | 1,152  | 1,142        |\n| 2020 | 1,209          | 1,162   | 1,152 | 1,142  | 1,132        |\n| 2021 | 1,162          | 1,152   | 1,142 | 1,132  | 1,122        |\n\nSony Global Trends in the Number of Injuries\n\n| Year | Japan/East Asia | Pan Asia | China | Europe | North America |\n|------|----------------|---------|-------|--------|--------------|\n| 2017 | 113            | 105     | 74    | 71     | 75           |\n| 2018 | 105            | 97      | 71    | 75     | 75           |\n| 2019 | 74             | 71      | 75    | 75     | 75           |\n| 2020 | 71             | 75      | 75    | 75     | 75           |\n| 2021 | 75             | 75      | 75    | 75     | 75           |\n\nScope of data for fiscal year 2021: 182 sites (manufacturing and logistics sites, non-manufacturing sites including sales & marketing companies) (Definition)\n\nFrequency rate: Number of accidents causing one or more lost workdays \u00f7 total number of man-hours worked \u00d7 1,000,000\nSeverity rate: Number of lost workdays \u00f7 total number of man-hours worked \u00d7 1,000\n\nSony Group Global OHS Performance\n\n| Year | Number of lost-work injuries (external contractors) | Number of lost workdays (external contractors) | Frequency Rate | Severity Rate |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| 2017 | 113                                                 | 1,612                                         | 0.55           | 0.0064        |\n| 2018 | 105                                                 | 2,009                                         | 0.45           | 0.0070        |\n| 2019 | 74                                                  | 1,526                                         | 0.34           | 0.0058        |\n| 2020 | 71                                                  | 1,211                                         | 0.32           | 0.0044        |\n| 2021 | 75                                                  | 1,209                                         | 0.39           | 0.0052        |\n\nSony Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd., Chonburi\n\nZero Accident Award 2021 (Gold Award)\n\nSony Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd., Bangkadi\n\nZero Accident Award 2021 (Silver Award)\n\nExternal Recognition for OHS Initiatives (Fiscal Year 2021)\n\nSony Group Global OHS Performance*3\n\nSony Global Trends in the Number of Injuries\n\n| Site | Name of Award |\n|------|---------------|\n| Shanghai Suoguang Visual Products Co., Ltd. | Rated A for improved OHS functions by the city of Shanghai |\n| Sony Device Technology (Thailand) | 1.

Sony focuses on enhancing organizational and personal well-being (health and happiness) by fostering a corporate culture that values both body and mind in order to help ensure sustained growth for both the company and employees. Using data from health checkups and stress checks, Sony is addressing employee\u2019s health issues involving mental health, balancing medical treatment and work, and lifestyle diseases and taking various steps to resolve these issues. Sony is focused on the prevention and early detection of health problems, improving the workplace environment, and the health literacy of employees, through attentive and individualized support, education and training for line managers, and providing information and activities to raise awareness via a variety of channels.\n\nPromoting Mental Health\n\nSony implements comprehensive mental health support measures with the aim of helping employees to display their full potential. These efforts are focused particularly on preventing health problems and motivating employees and organizations. Employees with fewer stress responses such as fatigue and anxiety tend to display higher levels of engagement. To bolster the ability of the individual to manage stress, which is a key to a vibrant organization, Sony holds mindfulness workshops for employees. It also holds online sessions for communication between employees and medical professionals, and is facilitating such dialogues in an endeavor to boost the health literacy of its employees with regard to managing their health with new work styles. Support for individual employees is also important. Sony has established health-counseling services, offering access to counseling with clinical psychologists, industrial physicians and occupational health nurses via in-person or online sessions. Sony also works with outside professional organizations to implement a program under which employees returning to work after taking mental health leave receive help readjusting to the workplace via Sony\u2019s employee assistance program (EAP). Sony has a mental health support program in place to provide employees with psychological care in the event of natural disasters and other incidents, as well.\n\nHelping Employees Receive Treatment while Working\n\nSony actively seeks to provide support that will enable employees to strike a proper balance between treatment and work, and to feel fulfilled and motivated in their work. In fiscal year 2020, Sony introduced the Symphony Plan, a program to help employees attain this particular balance. Sony has increased the involvement of medical professionals and incorporated expert perspectives to support the provision of working conditions tailored for individual treatment plans. For employees who receive treatment for cancer or other diseases while continuing to work, Sony offers medical consultation with occupational physicians and occupational health nurses, who reduce such employees\u2019 health risks by devising job arrangements tailored to each individual situation. To ensure that employees are able to choose from a diverse array of flexible work styles, their workplace works with the Human Resources Department and Occupational Health Department to provide the most appropriate job support. As part of its efforts to support cancer prevention and early detection, Sony provides cancer education (e-learning) for employees and cervical cancer testing for younger employees. It launched a program in fiscal year 2021 to encourage employees to undergo secondary cancer screenings.\n\nHealth Management for Employees Who Work Long Hours\n\nWorking long hours for an excessive period of time not only causes physical and mental health issues, but also reduces the job satisfaction of employees and risks the health of the organization as a whole. Sony actively works to create a better working environment in both respects. Line managers, the Human Resources Department, and the Occupational Health Department work together to improve working environments, with workplace structures that do not concentrate an excessive burden on certain employees and a focus on workplace culture in which employees feel comfortable consulting with their superiors. Sony provides education and training for line managers on the impact of working long hours to help them understand the health issues involved and enhance their skills of managing the work hours and health of the employees in their team. As part of the comprehensive efforts to help employees stay healthy and prevent health problems, Sony employees who work long hours are seen by industrial physicians and occupational health nurses.\n\nWomen\u2019s Health\n\nTo establish dynamic working environments where women can display their abilities, it is important to address health issues that affect women. Sony is working to increase literacy about women\u2019s health so that women can improve their own physical and mental health and reach their full potential. Sony seeks to educate and inform employees of all genders about health issues that affect women at different stages of their lives through various initiatives including online seminars led by experts. Additionally, Sony operates a support hotline for women\u2019s health issues that lends a sympathetic ear and individualized advice about health issues that affect women.\n\nPreventing Lifestyle-related Diseases\n\nPreventing lifestyle diseases caused by lack of exercise and/or sleep, irregular eating habits, and other aspects of an imbalanced lifestyle is a major challenge for corporate employees. Sony makes sure that employees undergo comprehensive medical checkups and examinations and then receive personal health advice from industrial physicians and occupational health nurses, as well as support for follow-up examinations at medical institutions if needed. Sony also focuses on counseling and advice dealing specifically with managing metabolic syndrome. Additionally, Sony implements various\ninitiatives to set employees up for better lifestyle habits and increase health literacy. These initiatives take into account analysis of data on employee health issues compiled by organization, based on data from employee medical checkups. The initiatives include disseminating lifestyle information and holding various seminars for employees.\n\nHelping Employees Quit Smoking and Preventing Passive Smoking\n\nSony actively encourages employees to quit smoking and works to prevent second-hand smoke from affecting non-smokers. In order to eliminate unwanted second-hand smoke, Sony is moving forward with steps to eliminate cigarettes and smoking areas from working environments such as moving smoking areas outdoors. Industrial physicians and occupational health nurses work closely with employees who are smokers to provide one-on-one counseling and support to ensure that they correctly understand the health risks to themselves and, through second-hand smoke, to those around them, and to motivate them to quit smoking. Other support measures include providing financial assistance for employees to participate in stop-smoking support programs, support for outpatient stop-smoking medical consultations, and information and awareness-raising. These efforts are gradually reducing the percentage of smokers in the Sony workforce.\n\nCOVID-19 Measures and Accommodating New Work Styles\n\nSony is committed to maintaining a safe working environment that ensures sufficient physical distance between employees at business sites. In consideration of governmental guidance in each country and the specific work style of each of its diverse businesses, Sony limits the number of employees allowed to report for in-person work based on attendance plans at each company and unit. With many employees working from home, Sony recognizes the importance of mental health care. Sony provides tips for self-care and employee care, and is enhancing autonomy and activating employee health issues compiled by organization, based on data from employee medical checkups. The initiatives include disseminating lifestyle information and holding various seminars for employees.\n\nMain Initiatives in Japan\n\n(Primarily for areas under restrictions during a state of emergency or quasi-state of emergency)\n\n- Prohibited international and domestic business travel\n- Expanded the provisions for working from home\n- Eliminated care hours in the monthly flextime system\n- Added special leave due to temporary school closure and special measures for the COVID-19 vaccine\n- Relaxed restrictions on commuting to include private cars and bicycles\n- Paid allowances for working from home and to support COVID-19 infection prevention\n- Ordered employees to refrain from business meals\n- Opened satellite offices to support diverse work styles\n- Implemented corporate COVID-19 vaccination drive\n- Added special leave for the COVID-19 vaccination\n- Conducted harassment prevention training related to vaccination\n\nHealth Management for Employees Transferred Overseas\n\nAt present, employees of the Sony Group and their family members from Japan are stationed in 40 countries worldwide. This is why Sony has established a health management system that ensures that staff stationed overseas and their families can live and work in safety and good health. Before departing for an overseas post, in addition to receiving healthcare information, medical checkups, and vaccinations, employees are provided with information on the medical, health, hygiene conditions and medical facilities in the country where they will be stationed. Employees also receive online health guidance and counseling and regular healthcare information during their period of stay. During the pandemic, Sony is providing extensive information to employees on topics such as COVID-19 vaccines, adjusting to working from home and dealing with stress. It is also constructing a system that enables employees to receive a medical examination in the country where they are stationed if they are temporarily unable to return to Japan. Sony offers employees who stationed overseas with the same stress checks that employees in Japan receive, working to improve work environment and support mental health at the place of assignment. In addition, Sony works to prevent disease and mitigate risk, with industrial physicians tracking the situation at sites and medical facilities overseas to provide the support that employees working overseas need in order to feel secure.\n\nInfectious Disease Measures\n\nIn addition to protecting employees who are active globally from the threat of infectious diseases by arranging for employees to receive necessary vaccinations if they work in or travel on business to countries at risk, Sony also provides information on safety and infectious diseases in specific countries, issues alerts, and implements such safety measures as restrictions on business travel under certain circumstances. Timely information on such infectious diseases as malaria, hepatitis, and HIV is also provided to employees. In Japan, if there is an outbreak of a new strain of influenza, tuberculosis, rubella, measles, or other illness, Sony cooperates with the government and other entities as necessary in order to respond flexibly while staying ready to implement business continuity plans. Sony provides male employees from age groups that were not vaccinated through public rubella vaccination programs with access to rubella antibody tests when they receive their regular health checkups.\nManagement Approach\n\nMateriality Rationale\nSony recognizes the potential impact its global business operations may have on human rights. It respects the human rights of all stakeholders involved in its business operations, including its employees and its suppliers\u2019 workers, and understands its responsibility to help ensure appropriate labor practices to prevent and mitigate human rights abuses.\n\nBasic Approach\nSony strives to respect human rights in all of its business operations in accordance with the Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights issued by the United Nations Human Rights Council. Sony\u2019s policy requiring respect for human rights is set forth in the Sony Group Code of Conduct. Sony expects all Group companies to pursue responsible business conduct by respecting all human rights in compliance with its Code as well as all relevant laws and regulations.\n\nStructure\nThe Sustainability Section at Sony Group Corporation is supervised by the Senior Executive in charge of Sustainability. It assesses human rights impact throughout Sony Group\u2019s business activities and value chains. In 2021, the Sustainability and the Legal & Compliance sections at Headquarters launched a working group to implement human rights due diligence measures for the entire Sony Group\u2019s business activities and its value chain, based on Sony\u2019s human rights impact evaluation results and regulatory trends. The working group strives to prevent and/or mitigate any potential negative impact on human rights in collaboration with personnel at Sony businesses, including personnel in the human resources and procurement departments.\n\nSony also established the Diversity Promotion Council, chaired by the senior executive in charge of human resources and general affairs, with members drawn from related departments at Headquarters. The Council provides support for group-wide initiatives to raise awareness of human rights and promote diversity. The Board of Directors receives regular reports on sustainability initiatives encompassing Sony\u2019s human rights initiatives.\n\nLooking to the Future\nSony will continue to carry out human rights due diligence, and will further enhance initiatives to prevent or mitigate potential negative impact on human rights.\n\nMilestones\n1987: Human Rights Office established\n1991: Human rights lectures for employees launched\n1995: Sony Group Human Rights Committee established\n1998: Counseling services on human rights and equal opportunities for employees initiated\n2000: Philosophy and basic approach to human rights established\n2003: Sony Group Code of Conduct established\n2011: Human Rights Committee changed name to Diversity Committee\n2012: Human rights impact assessment conducted\n2018: Sony Group Code of Conduct revised\n2019: Sony Group AI Ethics Committee established\n2020: Human rights impact assessment updated\n2021: Working group to implement human rights due diligence established\n\nRespect for Human Rights\n\nSet priority areas and promoted initiatives\n1. Responsible supply chain\n2. Respect for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n3. Responsible development and use of technologies\nDialogue with Stakeholders on DE&I and Social Justice\n\nThe ESG Briefing in September 2021 included explanations about \u201cProtecting the Earth: Sony\u2019s \u2018Responsibility\u2019 and \u2018Contribution\u2019\u201d and \u201cEvolution of Sustainability Management.\u201d As stated in its Purpose, Sony\u2019s goal is to create value for the society in which we live, through an array of businesses centered on people. Sony is fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) throughout the entire Group, where differences in background, gender, and ability are viewed as strengths. It also promoting initiatives aimed at fostering diversity and social justice in its engagement with greater society, and referred to the initiatives as examples of this.\n\nOne example is the utilization of technology to enhance the accessibility of Sony\u2019s products and services. Sony conducts interviews with employees and users with disabilities during the product planning and development process. With the feedback we receive from this user research and usability testing, we improve our products and services, thereby incorporating the needs of diverse customers. Sony is also devoted to creating an inclusive work environment where employees can pursue their careers regardless of any disabilities they may have.\n\nTreating all people with respect and dignity is one of Sony\u2019s most important principles. We have built a corporate culture which finds strength in the diversity of our businesses and employees. In 2020, Sony established the 100 million USD Global Social Justice Fund. Through this fund, Sony Group companies will support initiatives that promote social justice and anti-racist initiatives to foster DE&I around the world.\n\nAs our society grows ever more unstable against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming increasingly important to offer a physically and mentally healthy environment in which creators can immerse themselves in their work. For example, the Sony Music Group outside of Japan is working with NPOs and other organizations to provide support to artists in the US, the UK and other countries via the Artists & Songwriters Forward initiative. In Japan, Sony Music has launched B-Side, a project to support both the mental and physical health of artists and creators signed with Sony Music, as well as the staff who support them. Sony will continue to provide various support so that diverse and talented individuals can maximize their creative potential.\nHuman Rights Initiatives\n\nHuman Rights Due Diligence\n\nSony is committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in its business activities and value chains, and engages in initiatives to prevent or mitigate any potential negative impact in line with the United Nations Human Rights Council-published The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). The UNGPs outline preemptive steps companies should take to prevent or mitigate any negative impact on human rights in their business activities and supply chains.\n\nHuman Rights Impact Assessments\n\nSony has undertaken group-wide human rights impact assessments since 2012 in partnership with BSR, an independent, global, non-profit organization devoted to building a just and sustainable world to identify relevant risks and to work to mitigate them. Sony draws up a list of human rights issues from international standards such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO International Labour Standards, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We also reference source materials from human rights experts, advocates, academics, governments, NGOs and other experts to identify potential human rights risks. This information is compared to Sony\u2019s areas of business to identify risks most relevant to Sony\u2019s business activities.\n\nPrevention or Mitigation of Potential Negative Impact on Human Rights\n\nThe human rights impact assessment carried out in 2020 identified the following as potential human rights risk areas:\n\n- Human rights risks related to workers in the electronics industry supply chain, including the procurement of raw materials\n- Potential human rights risks in new technologies such as AI\n- Potential risks that customers with whom Sony has direct or indirect business relationships may engage in human rights abuse\n\nKey Human Rights Initiatives in Diverse Business Operations\n\n1. Responsible Supply Chain\n\nSony believes that it bears responsibility for its entire product supply chain. This includes areas such as human rights, labor conditions and environmental protection, not only at its own production sites but also at those of its suppliers and subcontractors. Sony is a founding member of the RBA and has played an active role on the RBA Board of Directors since 2020. The RBA Code of Conduct represents industry best practices; Sony was not only involved in its formulation but also adopted it as the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Sony electronics manufacturing sites and suppliers are requested to comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. They are also requested to carry out risk assessments, be subjected to regular monitoring regarding compliance with the Supply Chain Code of Conduct, and implement any necessary improvements based on the results of the monitoring.\n\n2. Respect for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nSony is committed to creating a workplace that respects human rights and provides equal employment opportunities that allow all individuals to make the most of their capabilities. Sony also helps to ensure that workers\u2019 rights are safeguarded by adhering to worker protection laws, regulations, and standards in all regions where it operates. The Sony Group Code of Conduct, which sets forth Sony\u2019s global policy on respect for human rights, also includes Sony\u2019s policy on equal opportunity in employment and nondiscrimination. The Sony Group Code of Conduct expressly states: \u201cSony strives to promote diversity and seeks to create a culture that allows all Sony personnel to contribute their unique talents and skills so as to provide the best products and services to our customers, and Sony is committed to recruiting, hiring, training, promoting and otherwise treating applicants and employees without discrimination based on factors that are unrelated to Sony\u2019s legitimate business interests.\u201d\n\nBoosting Awareness of Human Rights is a Cornerstone of Diversity\n\nHuman rights issues that corporations face today are increasingly complex and wide-ranging. Sony considers it essential to boost awareness of human rights, an awareness that underpins respect for diversity. The importance of this concept is emphasized in training courses and other actions taken by Sony to enhance employees\u2019 understanding of human rights and diversity.\n\nGlobal Social Justice Fund\n\nSony is committed to respecting human rights, advancing social justice, and promoting DE&I. One of Sony\u2019s core principles is to treat all people with respect and dignity. Sony has built a corporate culture that finds strengths in diversity. To further these efforts, in 2020, Sony Group established a US$100 million Global Social Justice Fund (\u201cFund\u201d). Through this Fund, we support initiatives that promote social justice and anti-racist initiatives to foster DE&I around the world.\n\n\u21d2 Sony\u2019s Two Global Funds\n\nAccessibility\n\nSony Group strives to fulfill our Purpose to \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.\u201d For a future where everyone shares the moment, Sony gives careful attention when designing and planning our products and services to help ensure accessibility. To ensure that its products and services can be used by as many people\nas possible, including people with disabilities, Sony conducts interviews and usability tests with people with disabilities during the planning and development process, and reflects the results of these tests in its products and services. Sony has been participating in the CSLU Assistive Technology Conference. Many people with disabilities attend this conference. It provides people with diverse needs the opportunity to experience our products and services and engage in dialogue with us.\n\n\u2192 Accessibility\n\nAdvertising Creativity and Content Services\nAs a company that conducts business in various regions and countries across the globe, Sony recognizes that conduct which is socially and professionally acceptable in one culture or region may be viewed differently in another culture. As such, Sony takes those differences into account in its decision making. Advertising personnel from Sony Group companies in Japan regularly meet to exchange information on and study human rights issues with respect to advertising. Sony Interactive Entertainment (SE) applies Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO), Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), and Pan European Game Information (PEGI) ratings to its PlayStation game titles, adhering to the age-based recommendations of ratings organizations in Japan, the United States, and Europe, respectively. Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) also implements various DE&I initiatives that impact every area of its business, including its content. For example, SPE collaborates with the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, a non-profit organization, to identify ways to increase positive and diverse gender images onscreen.\n\n3. Responsible Development and Use of Technologies\n\nResponsible AI Initiatives\nSony aims to use AI technology in its products and services in a manner that will enrich people\u2019s lives and contribute to the advancement of society. In 2018, Sony was one of the first companies to establish AI Ethics Guidelines to ensure that AI development and usage would be aligned with our values, including fairness, transparency, privacy, and stakeholder engagement. The Sony Group AI Ethics Committee, established in 2019, examines AI use cases to ensure compliance with these guidelines. In 2021, Sony added AI ethics assessments to the quality management system for electronic products and services. Sony has been participating in the CSLU Assistive Technology Conference. Many people with disabilities attend this conference. It provides people with diverse needs the opportunity to experience our products and services and engage in dialogue with us.\n\n\u2192 Responsible AI\n\nHotlines\nSony has established the following hotlines for employees and stakeholders to report and seek advice concerning any potential violation of laws, regulations, the Sony Group Code of Conduct, the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct or other internal rules. These hotlines equip Sony to respond quickly and appropriately, while giving full consideration to personal privacy. Sony strictly enforces confidentiality and ensures that reporters are not subject to reprisal for reporting or using these services.\n\nSony Ethics & Compliance Hotline\nSony established the Sony Ethics & Compliance Hotline as a mechanism for all Sony Group employees to raise concerns and to seek guidance about possible violations of laws or internal policies, including violations of the Sony Group Code of Conduct.\n\n\u2192 Sony\u2019s Ethics and Compliance Program\n\nEEO (Equal Employee Opportunity) Hotlines\nSony Group companies in Japan have established a hotline for equal opportunity. The hotline is available for all Sony Group employees in Japan to discuss a wide range of equal opportunity-related issues, such as harassment and support for work-life balance. In addition, Sony Group companies in Japan have also established a hotline specializing in cases to provide employee counseling by third parties with expertise on issues that employees are reluctant to raise within the company.\n\nSupplier Hotline\nSony has established a Supplier Hotline as a mechanism for suppliers to report misconduct by a Sony Group company executive or employee that violates laws, regulations, the Sony Group Code of Conduct, the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct or the company\u2019s agreements with suppliers.\n\n\u2192 Supplier Hotline (in Japanese)\n\nHotline Regarding the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals\nSony has established a hotline for stakeholders to report misconduct that violates the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals.\n\n\u2192 Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals Hotline\n\nEducation and Training\n\nEmployee Training\nAll employees receive training on respecting human rights and preventing harassment in the workplace as part of the Sony Group Code of Conduct training upon hire and refresher training at least every four years thereafter. In Japan, we regularly implement various programs, such as focusing on domestic issues for all employees and using more practical content for newly appointed managers. In addition, an e-learning course focusing on the protection of human rights is provided to all employees of Sony Group Corporation as well as many Sony Group companies. In fiscal year 2021, 94% of eligible employees took the e-learning course.\n\nRaising Employee Awareness of Human Rights\nSony Group companies in Japan have formed their diversity promotion committees, which conduct workshops on human rights, diversity, and related matters. Based on the information obtained from those initiatives, they collaborate laterally via a Diversity Liaison to share best practices and study the latest information. Serious cases of harassment and communication issues related to human rights are discussed within the overall system and appropriate responses considered. Additionally, Sony works with the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo to compile information on various aspects of the subject and improve human rights literacy in Japan. Each December, in support of Human Rights Week, an awards ceremony is held in Japan for all Sony Group companies to recognize departments that have been successful in their efforts to protect human rights and promote diversity. Sony Group companies outside of Japan have similar programs in place to ensure respect for human rights in the workplace.\nResponsible Supply Chain\n\nManagement Approach\n\nMateriality Rationale\nIn recent years, stakeholders have grown increasingly aware of how crucial it is that companies fulfill their overall responsibilities throughout their supply chains, including procurement and production. Sony takes these stakeholder concerns seriously and is working closely with its suppliers on initiatives in fields such as human rights, labor conditions, health and safety, and environmental protection. These initiatives cover not only Sony\u2019s own sites, but sites throughout the supply chain \u2014 from parts and material suppliers, to mineral mining operations, to production sites operated both by Sony and by subcontractors.\n\nBasic Approach\nEach and every Sony director, executive, and employee complies with the Sony Group Code of Conduct and conducts ethical business practices. Based on this approach, Sony focuses on supply chain management and responsible procurement of minerals and works with suppliers and subcontractors to establish a responsible supply chain that ensures compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct and the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals. These efforts are undertaken in collaboration with relevant industry organizations and other stakeholders.\n\nStructure\nUnder the Senior Executive in charge of Sustainability, the sustainability section and compliance department at the head office play central roles in promoting actions aimed toward creating a more responsible supply chain, cooperating with procurement and other related departments in our businesses, as well as management departments at manufacturing sites.\n\nLooking to the Future\nIn order to further strengthen efforts to establish a responsible supply chain, Sony will expand assessments of its own sites and its suppliers, for example by having primary suppliers request secondary suppliers and other subcontractors to comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Sony remains committed to ongoing efforts to raise awareness, educate, and provide training not only to employees, but also across the supply chain, communicating with suppliers to raise awareness and the capacity to respond effectively to responsible supply chain issues. Sony will also continue to strengthen its countermeasures of high-risk minerals in its procurement.\n\nMilestones\n- 2004: Sony joins the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC, now the Responsible Business Alliance) as a founding member\n- 2005: Sony Supplier Code of Conduct established\n- 2006: EICC self-assessment started at electronics manufacturing sites\n- 2012: Sony Supplier Code of Conduct revised to create second edition\n- 2014: Sony Group Conflict Minerals Policy established and a survey on use of conflict minerals started\n- 2016: Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct established and cobalt supply chain assessment started\n- 2017: Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals established\n- 2021: Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct revised to create 3.1 edition\n\nSupplier plants conducting CSR assessment: 796\nNumber of suppliers who were requested to procure from smelters that are compliant with the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP)*: 58\n\n* Responsible Minerals Assurance Process: A program in which a third party certifies that the minerals handled by the smelter are from sources that do not fund armed conflict or engage in human rights violations.\nHighlight\n\nCommunicating with Suppliers\n\nDistributing Videos to Suppliers\n\nIn 2021, we distributed a video about sustainability to all our suppliers through a distribution system specifically for them in order to improve awareness of Sony\u2019s sustainability activities overall, including conduct for a responsible supply chain. Available in Japanese, English and Chinese, the video explains what is required according to the Sony Group Code of Conduct and Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, and requests the establishment of management systems for compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct upstream of the supply chain. The video was also shared with internal procurement personnel, to aid in communication with suppliers.\n\nVisualizing Supplier Sustainability Efforts\n\nWe check for supplier compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, which includes their efforts for human rights, ethics, environmental and health and safety initiatives, and this oversight is vital to our supplier selection process. In consideration of the fact that supplier sustainability activities will continue to grow more important, in fiscal year 2021, we built a system to visually identify and centrally manage supplier sustainability achievement (including compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, reducing the effect on the environment) and are preparing to more appropriately select suppliers in consideration of their results in the future. We communicate the meaning and social significance of these efforts, providing direct feedback to our suppliers to motivate them toward sustainable endeavors and maintain their compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct.\n\nTraining and Raising Awareness in Internal Procurement Personnel\n\nWe implement training for internal personnel who are involved in parts procurement for socially responsible procurement and the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Continuing from the previous year, in fiscal year 2021, this training was provided to new employees and midcareer hires. The training covers the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, as well as laws and regulations in different countries, responsible mineral procurement, environmental conservation, and management of chemical substance contained in product. These sessions educate employees on the importance of responsible procurement and how it relates to their work while also assessing their general knowledge.\nSupply Chain Management\n\nWe are engaged in supply chain management that includes the production sites of our suppliers and subcontractors in addition to our own electronics manufacturing sites.\n\nSony Supply Chain\n\nSony develops, designs, manufactures and sells a wide range of electronics and other devices, utilizing a supply chain that stretches across the entire globe. As of June 2022, we have 12 electronics manufacturing sites in Japan, China, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and the UK. Further, we procure materials and parts for Sony electronics from suppliers worldwide.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the value of transactions with parts suppliers and OEM/ODM suppliers by geographic area was as follows: Mainland China and Hong Kong Region (46.6%), Japan (18.9%), Asia-Pacific (16%), Europe (8.1%), and other areas (10.4%).\n\nParts and OEM/ODM supplier ratio by geographic area (transaction value basis in FY2021)\n\n- Mainland China and Hong Kong Region: 46.6%\n- Japan: 18.9%\n- Asia-Pacific: 16.0%\n- Europe: 8.1%\n- Others areas: 10.4%\n\nNote: Major countries and regions that belong to each category:\n- Europe: UK, France, Germany, Russia, Spain, Sweden\n- Asia Pacific: India, South Korea, Oceania\n- Other areas: United States, Middle East, Brazil, Mexico, Canada\n\nThe amount is calculated based on the location of the company registration of supplier.\nEstablishing and Promoting the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct\n\nSony recognizes the increasing importance of global companies\u2019 responsibility to manage their supply chains responsibly as diligent members of society. This extends beyond our manufacturing sites, including those of parts suppliers and subcontractors. Sony works with its suppliers to address issues such as human rights, labor conditions, health and safety, and environmental protection throughout its supply chain in order to ensure a responsible supply chain.\n\nSony Supply Chain Code of Conduct\n\nSony was involved in establishing the RBA Code of Conduct, which indicates industry best practice, and adopted that code to establish the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Sony actively implements efforts to comply with the code for our manufacturing sites and suppliers. The RBA Code of Conduct has been translated into 26 languages including English, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Malay. Compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is included in contracts signed when Sony begins doing business. As a part of the customer requirements under this Code of Conduct, parts suppliers must comply with the Green Partner Environmental Quality Approval Program and the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals. Suppliers are also requested to distribute and comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct within their own supply chain.\n\nIn addition, as a founding member of the RBA, Sony also works to strengthen its supplier assessments, ongoing monitoring, and other initiatives worldwide.\n\nBasic Structure of the Supply Chain\n\nSony Supply Chain Code of Conduct Items\n\n| A.

Under the supervision of the Senior Executive in charge of Sustainability, the Sustainability Section at the head office assesses external trends and communicates with stakeholders, drawing on both to formulate basic company-wide supply chain management policy. The Senior Executive in charge of Sustainability appoints the management responsible in each relevant business unit. They are then responsible for overall operational compliance for the area in their charge, including compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, as well as risk assessment, regular monitoring and remedial measures. Administrative offices are responsible for overall implementation for suppliers.\n\nIn cases where assessments or external sources indicate any possibility of violations of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct or a material legal violation, or in cases where the supplier does not provide adequate cooperation with assessments and audits, the managers responsible for implementing the rules work together with the Sustainability Section and compliance groups at the head office to determine the facts and take action deemed necessary, and the situation is reported to the Senior Executive in charge of Sustainability.\n\nInitiatives at Sony Electronics Manufacturing Sites\n\nConducting Regular Assessments\n\nAs part of its efforts to ascertain Sony manufacturing sites\u2019 compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, Sony uses standard tools provided by the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) to check compliance, assess improvements, and implement other monitoring activities. Specifically, Sony utilizes the RBA questionnaire as an annual self-assessment survey at all of its electronics manufacturing sites in and outside of Japan to evaluate compliance designated by the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct in terms of labor, health and safety, ethics, environment, and management systems. At manufacturing sites where self-assessment surveys indicate issues with compliance and further evaluation and improvement in these areas are deemed necessary, appropriate measures to improve compliance are developed and implemented.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, 12 manufacturing sites in Japan, China, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and the UK, completed self-assessment surveys. The results showed that risk of noncompliance was low at all manufacturing sites.\n\nEmployment and Working Conditions of Foreign Workers\n\nIn recent years, forced labor among foreign and immigrant workers at factories manufacturing electronic products and components has become an issue both in Japan and around the world. Since fiscal year 2017, Sony has been conducting surveys of actual work conditions and risk assessments to monitor the employment status and labor conditions of foreign workers at Sony manufacturing sites in Japan. The assessments check whether the site has any foreign workers or not (in either direct or indirect employment) and confirm the hiring processes and labor conditions. The surveys of actual conditions are conducted for selected manufacturing sites. In fiscal year 2021, Sony continued to conduct document assessments of on-site subcontractors at a number of manufacturing sites to verify their hiring processes for technical intern trainees in Japan and the countries in which they were hired, as well as the labor conditions of trainees. The results showed that steps are continuously being taken to ensure compliance with the labor standards set out in the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct.\nSony\u2019s Approach to Supplier Relations\n\nRequesting Compliance and Monitoring Compliance Status with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct\n\nRequesting Compliance\n\nCompliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is included in contracts signed when Sony begins doing business with suppliers. All suppliers are provided this Code of Conduct upon signing a new contract, and are kept informed of changes through updated documents. Further, Sony regularly reminds suppliers of their responsibilities and obtains a compliant consent from them. Upon the revision of The Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct in 2021, the code was distributed again with a further reminder, and a compliant consent was obtained.\n\nWhen starting new business dealings with suppliers, Sony requests compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct not only from the primary supplier, but also from plants supplying materials and parts. Furthermore, if a primary supplier is a trading company, Sony acquires a compliant consent from the parts manufacturer and manufacturing sites through the trading company and confirms that compliance is implemented.\n\nSony also distributes the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct to our own supply chain, requesting through primary suppliers that it is observed by secondary and further suppliers.\n\nSupplier Assessment\n\nTo ascertain supplier compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, Sony conducts assessments based on the supplier\u2019s risk level for all suppliers and their manufacturing facilities. If Sony does not deal directly with the manufacturing facility, the assessments are conducted through the trading company or manufacturer that is the primary supplier.\n\nIf a manufacturer is suspected to be in violation of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, instructions for improvement are issued, an on-site assessment is conducted and employees and managers are interviewed in person to verify the actual management situation, based on the identified potential risk. If issues are found, guidance for improvement is provided, and we continue to verify and evaluate subsequent actions taken. Sony\u2019s policy is to review its business relationship with a supplier if a serious violation (such as forced labor, child labor, inhumane working conditions, unlawful discrimination, lack of an emergency and disaster action plan, presence of risks that cause a serious life-threatening accident to a worker, significant environmental pollution issues) of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is confirmed or if the supplier fails to cooperate fully in an investigation or audit.\n\nNew Suppliers\n\nSony conducts assessments based on the supplier\u2019s risk level for all new suppliers and their manufacturing facilities. All direct suppliers and their plants are requested to comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Suppliers and their plants are categorized by risk level, based on such factors as the country and region in which they are located, size of business, industry, and type of business. Suppliers and their plants conduct an assessment using questionnaires from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA).\n\nIn assessment, questionnaires evaluate compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct specifically in items related to forced labor among foreign, migrant and immigrant workers, which has become a serious issue worldwide. Questionnaires returned by suppliers are analyzed to identify potential risks for individual manufacturing plants.\n\nExisting Suppliers\n\nMajor OEM and ODM suppliers that do sizable business with Sony continue to conduct annual assessments using questionnaires from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). If an assessment indicates a high risk, the OEM or ODM supplier is subject to an on-site audit, which may include an audit by a third-party. Furthermore, with growing stakeholder interest in the issue of forced labor in the electronics industry supply chain overall, Sony has been strengthening activities related to periodic assessment of existing suppliers for compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct since 2020. Just as for new suppliers, existing suppliers and their plants are categorized by risk level, based on such factors as the country and region in which they are located, size of business, industry, and type of business to determine if they fit criteria for assessment. Assessment using labor issues-specific questionnaire is conducted for applicable existing suppliers, and supplier response is analyzed to identify potential risks for individual manufacturing plants.\nAssessment Results for Fiscal Year 2021\n\nSony requested that all new and existing suppliers comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct.\n\nNew Suppliers\nAn assessment using questionnaire was conducted for 64 plants. We provided written instructions for improvement to 13 supplier plants deemed to be in minor violation. We conducted on-site assessments at 6 supplier plants suspected to be in violation, pointing out issues and issuing instructions for improvement. In either case, suppliers are asked to make a plan for improvement, manage progress and show evidence-based results.\n\nExisting Suppliers\nAn assessment using questionnaire was conducted for 732 plants. We provided written instructions for improvement to 81 supplier plants deemed to be in minor violation. We conducted remote or on-site assessments at 13 supplier plants suspected to be in violation, pointing out issues and issuing instructions for improvement. In either case, suppliers are asked to make a plan for improvement, manage progress and show evidence-based results.\n\nIn addition, remote or on-site assessments and interviews were conducted regarding labor, health and safety, environment and ethics were also conducted at 20 supplier plants in Japan. Through interviews, we checked the working and living environments for plants employing technical intern trainees. While no issues were indicated, we were able to confirm instances of workers paying brokerage fees to agencies in their home countries, and we are working with suppliers to proceed with improvements.\n\nAssessment Results for New and Existing Suppliers\n\n|                      | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|\n| Assessment using questionnaire | 92   | 472  | 796  |\n| Written improvement instructions | 5    | 86   | 94   |\n| Remote assessment / on-site assessment | 8    | 6    | 39   |\n\nExamples of Instructions for Improvement Based on Observations from On-Site Assessments\n\n- **Working hours**\n  Observation: Overtime hours at a supplier (over 60 hours/week)\n  Improvement instructions: Requested a plan for improvement of working hours, continuously monitored until improvements are completed\n\n- **Employment of foreign workers**\n  Observation: Passports belonging to foreign workers were being confiscated\n  Improvement instructions: Requested that workers be allowed to opt out of passport storage or given access to storage, and checked for improvement completion\n\n- **Recruitment fees**\n  Observation: Recruitment-related fees paid by foreign workers\n  Improvement instructions: Requested to stop making workers pay fees and checked for improvement completion\n\nAssessment Flow at Start of New Transactions with Suppliers\n\n1.

If this determination confirms the reported violations at our electronics manufacturing sites, Sony ensures that corrective action is immediately taken, including an RBA audit conducted by a third-party auditor. At supplier plants, we promptly request to make an improvement plan. We request progress reports for implementation of these plans and check further by conducting follow-up audits as needed. In cases where any possibility of violations is reported at a secondary supplier, Sony works with the primary supplier to ensure that remedial action is carried out. Sony\u2019s policy is to review its business relationship with a supplier if a serious violation of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is confirmed or if the supplier fails to cooperate fully in an investigation or audit.\n\nCommunicating with Suppliers\n\nSony is deeply committed to communicating with suppliers and is involved in a variety of measures to this effect. See the Highlights page for further information on these efforts in 2021.\n\nSupplier Hotline\n\nSony has established a Supplier Hotline which suppliers may use to report conduct by a Sony Group company executive or employee that violates laws, regulations, the Sony Group Code of Conduct, or the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, as well as conduct that violates the company\u2019s agreements with suppliers as a framework to facilitate sharing of concrete information.\n\nParticipation in the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)\n\nSupply chains overlap considerably in the electronics industry, with multiple manufacturers of finished products sharing the same subcontractors and parts suppliers. Accordingly, there are fears that the introduction of independent, company specific standards for socially responsible management will cause confusion and constitute a significant burden on companies in the supply chain. With the aim of improving processes in the electronics industry supply chain, in 2004 Sony and other companies established the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC, currently the RBA). The alliance then developed the RBA Code of Conduct (formerly the EICC Code of Conduct) incorporating best industry practices. The RBA is working with its member companies to develop tools that help to establish and manage codes of conduct, Web-based systems, and skills development programs for suppliers. As of June 2022, the RBA consisted of more than 200 participating companies from Europe, the Americas and Asia, and members included manufacturers and OEM companies. The RBA has membership categories for different levels of engagement and has granted Full Member status to Sony, its highest membership category. Sony was granted representation on the RBA Board of Directors in 2020. The RBA promotes corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supply chains through the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which addresses issues with minerals procurement, the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI), which addresses human rights issues such as forced labor, and other programs.\n\nSupplier Code of Conduct in Entertainment Business\n\nSony is committed to enhancing Sony Group\u2019s responsible supply chain activities in the entertainment industry. In March 2021, Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (SPE) established the SPE Supplier Code of Conduct, which is based on principles similar to those of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, in order to strengthen its supplier programs related to standards for human rights, ethical business practices, safety and environment. SPE promotes awareness of the Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nCode of Conduct for Suppliers to Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc\nResponsible Sourcing of Minerals\n\nIn recent years, stakeholders have become increasingly concerned about violations of the human rights of workers and environmental issues in the sourcing of mineral resources essential for the manufacture of electronic products. Sony is working with its suppliers to address issues related to human rights, labor conditions, health and safety, and environmental protection at production sites, as well as in its procurement of minerals.\n\nEstablishing the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals\n\nSome minerals that are used in Sony products carry human rights and environmental risks in the extraction process. In the Sony Group Code of Conduct, Sony set forth basic policies including prohibition of using any form of forced labor, specifically, child labor. Sony has established the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct to be complied with throughout the electronics product supply chain. In addition, in October 2017, Sony established the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals, replacing the Sony Group Conflict Minerals Policy that was established in 2014.\n\nBasic Policy\n\nIn the policy, Sony pledges that, in order to avoid contributing to conflicts or serious human rights abuses through its sourcing practices, Sony identifies certain minerals that are sourced in conflict-affected and high-risk areas and that are high-risk for Sony from the perspective of corporate social responsibility (\"High-Risk Minerals\"). Sony\u2019s policy is to refrain from knowingly purchasing any products, components or materials that contain High-Risk Minerals that contribute to conflicts or serious human rights abuses in the chain of custody.\n\nHigh-Risk Minerals\n\nTantalum, Tin, Gold, Tungsten and Cobalt\n\nExpectations for Suppliers\n\nSony requires its suppliers to source High-Risk Minerals from smelters determined to be compliant with the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (the \"RMAP\") or protocols established by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (the \"RMI\"), or other smelters that have been determined not to be contributing to conflicts or serious human rights abuses under other trusted traceability projects.\n\nOECD Due Diligence Guidance Initiatives\n\nSony exercises due diligence on the source and chain of custody of High-Risk Minerals in our supply chain to determine supplier compliance with our policy. We follow the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the \"OECD\") Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (the \"OECD Guidance\") or other internationally recognized framework when conducting such due diligence.\n\nOECD Due Diligence Guidance Initiatives\n\nSony exercises due diligence on the source and chain of custody of High-Risk Minerals in our supply chain to determine supplier compliance with our policy. We follow the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the \"OECD\") Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (the \"OECD Guidance\") or other internationally recognized framework when conducting such due diligence.\n\nAddressing the Issue of Conflict Minerals\n\nAddressing US Law on Conflict Minerals\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjacent countries have been mired in conflict with armed groups perpetuating human rights abuses in that region. These armed groups have been trading in certain minerals commonly found in that region to finance their activities. These minerals, tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten (\"the four minerals\") are commonly found in many products, ranging from jewelry to electronics to airplane components. Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the United States, which first became effective in January 2013, defines the four minerals as \"conflict minerals.\" This law seeks to ensure transparency and reporting related to conflict minerals and requires companies whose stock is listed on a US stock exchange, as Sony\u2019s is, to conduct an inquiry into the origin of the four minerals in their supply chains. On May 26, 2022, Sony submitted its ninth report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) based on its review of its supply chain activities for the 2021 calendar year.\n\nSurvey and Results on Use of the Four Minerals\n\nThe four minerals enter global supply chains from numerous countries. Determining the mine of origin for these minerals requires the cooperation of many levels of suppliers and intermediaries in the supply chain. Sony is committed to working with suppliers to continuously improve supply chain transparency and reduce risk. Investigation on the origin of the four minerals used by the Sony Group overall is conducted as follows.\n\n1. Every survey year, Sony checks each business group to see if there is any possibility for the four minerals being used in its products.\n2. Sony further looks for the presence of the four minerals in the products of the identified business group that are manufactured or outsourced for manufacturing by Sony in the survey year and identifies target products.\n3. The survey is conducted using the RMI Conflict Minerals Response Template (CMRT), the industry standard, and target suppliers are asked to participate by filling out a survey response for each product concerned. In order to identify the smelters or countries of origin for the procured minerals concerned.\n4. The smelters indicated in the survey responses are then carefully compared to the RMI smelters list.\n\nIn 2022, while the results of Sony\u2019s due diligence for the 2021 report to the SEC was not able to confirm the country of origin for all of the tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold in Sony\u2019s electronics products, the country of origin of these minerals was not identified as being from the DRC or adjacent countries. In the 2021 survey, Sony identified a total of 339 smelters and refiners as potential sources of the four minerals and, of those, 255 smelters and refiners were compliant with RMAP or were certified by London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)1. 153 of these smelters and refiners2 in the supply chain were reported to procure materials from the DRC and its adjacent countries.\n\n1 Includes smelters under RMAP assessment\n2 Please refer to the smelter list in the aforementioned Sony report to the SEC, which includes smelters confirmed as conflict-free through Sony\u2019s traceability program.\nExpectations for Sony Suppliers of the Four Minerals\n\nIf it is determined that any of the four minerals are used in the manufacture of products, Sony requires relevant suppliers to comply with the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals and to fully cooperate with its due diligence efforts regarding sourcing the four minerals in accordance with the terms of this policy. In addition, to ensure that products, components or materials delivered to Sony do not contain any conflict minerals, Sony expects suppliers to have in place pertinent policies, a due diligence framework and a management system consistent with the OECD guidance.\n\nApproach to Mitigating Risks in the Supply Chain\n\nIn the event that Sony confirms that any of its products, components or materials may contain conflict minerals, Sony, in collaboration with relevant suppliers, shall take actions reasonably necessary to eliminate such minerals from such products, components or materials and shall request that the suppliers makes necessary improvement to its sourcing practices. This includes adoption of a conflict-free sourcing policy, increased responsiveness and accuracy of the supplier survey, and increased use of the four minerals sourced from smelters or refiners participating in the RMAP program. Further, in the event that Sony confirms that a supplier has failed to cooperate sufficiently with a due-diligence investigation, fails to follow Sony\u2019s requests for remediation or has otherwise violated this policy, Sony shall take necessary actions, including without limitation, termination of business with such supplier by stopping new orders. As part of its efforts to promote RMAP-conformance among smelters, Sony identifies non-conformant smelters and works with them to gain certification. In 2021, 58 suppliers specified in their CMRT that they source from smelters that were not listed as conformant or that were unwilling to undergo an RMAP assessment. As a result of an improvement request by Sony, 36 suppliers conducted investigations and responded that the non-compliant smelters were not in fact in their supply chains, while we continue to request improvement from the remaining 22 suppliers.\n\nSony has also established a hotline to allow any interested party to voice concerns regarding the circumstances of mineral extraction, trade, handling and/or export in conflict (JEITA) and other high-risk areas. In addition to its internal risk assessments, the hotline enables Sony to be alerted to risks in its supply chain.\n\nManaging the Cobalt Supply Chain\n\nCobalt is an important mineral used in lithium-ion batteries for a wide range of products including electric vehicles and smart phones. There have been concerns about child labor and working conditions at sites where it is extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country known to have the largest reserves of cobalt in the world. In 2016, a supplier reported that some lithium-ion battery parts procured by Sony contained cobalt produced in the DRC. In response, Sony established the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals in October 2017. This policy is a revision of the Sony Group Conflict Minerals Policy, which targeted the four minerals. In addition to the four minerals, Sony has recognized cobalt as another High Risk mineral and launched efforts to build a responsible cobalt supply chain.\n\nSince then, Sony has continued to manage its cobalt supply chain using industry standard tools, such as the Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) developed by RMI, and by carrying out further third-party RMAP audits of cobalt refineries. In fiscal year 2020, we conducted a CRT-based survey of lithium-ion battery suppliers and identified cobalt refineries in the supply chain. As we identified the refineries not compliant with RMAP, we requested that such refineries conduct third-party RMAP audits and that suppliers with such refineries in their battery supply chain also encourage such refineries to conduct third-party audits. In fiscal year 2021, Sony conducted CRT based surveys of 8 lithium-ion battery suppliers. Within these, we identified 23 cobalt refineries in the supply chain, and confirmed that all were either RMAP-compliant or currently conducting third-party RMAP-based audits (as of March, 2022).\n\nMulti-Stakeholder Cooperation\n\nSony recognizes that multi-stakeholder cooperation is the key to identifying and mitigating the adverse human rights impact that can be associated with mineral extraction in high-risk areas. Specifically, Sony, continuously collaborates with various multi-stakeholder efforts such as RMI in order to participate in the development of the due diligence process and mitigate human rights risks in the supply chain.\n\nParticipating in Industry Groups and the Public-Private Alliance\n\nFor High-Risk Minerals, Sony actively participates in and supports industry groups and alliances that identify the negative effects of mineral mining in high-risk areas, and works to mitigate or prevent these effects.\n\nRMI\n\nIn 2011, RBA launched the industry-leading Conflict Free Sourcing Program (CFSF, currently RMAP), then, with the aim of promoting collaboration with other industries and multiple stakeholders outside electronics, established RMI (formerly CFSI) in 2013. Sony utilizes the frameworks developed by these industry groups and alliances as part of its efforts to ensure responsible sourcing of raw materials.

Product safety, security, and accessibility are very important in this respect. Sony is expected to provide products and customer services that are high in quality from its customers\u2019 viewpoints.\n\nBasic Approach\nTrue to its philosophy and policy for product quality and customer service, Sony is wholeheartedly committed to improving product and service quality from its customers\u2019 viewpoints in order to maintain and enhance satisfaction, confidence, and trust. In particular, Sony is working to ensure product quality and improve usability and accessibility, in the conviction that its most important goal is to remain a highly trusted partner to all customers.\n\nPhilosophy and Policy\nSince the start of its operations, Sony has been firmly committed across all of its businesses to providing customer-oriented, high-quality products and services. This philosophy is set forth in the Founding Prospectus drafted in 1946 by Sony\u2019s co-founder, Masaru Ibuka. The Sony Group Code of Conduct mandates that Sony continuously strive to comply with or exceed legally mandated standards in all business activities to ensure the safety of its products and services. Sony has established the Sony Pledge of Quality, which lays out its basic policy on product and customer service quality. This is aimed at reinforcing awareness of Sony\u2019s commitment to ensuring that the quality of its products and customer services exceeds the expectations of its customers around the world.\n\nLooking to the Future\nSony remains committed to a fundamental policy of ensuring product safety, security, and accessibility, taking its customers\u2019 viewpoints into consideration in order to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed expectations. It will continue leveraging its worldwide network to collect and analyze information which can then be reflected in the next releases of products and customer services.\n\nMilestones\n- 2001: Sony CS Charter established\n- 2004: Corporate quality standards established from the customer\u2019s perspective\n- 2006: Corporate executive in charge of product quality and safety appointed, and rules enhanced for rapid reporting of product incidents to management\n- 2007: Sony Pledge of Quality established (revised in 2012), and quality officers established for each electronics affiliate and region\n- 2009: Product security system enhanced, and Quality and Reliability Lab opened\n- 2014: Secure@Sony program established, allowing anyone to report security issues relating to Sony products, network services, or websites\n- 2017: Sony Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) launched and external initiatives enhanced\n- 2019: Systematic operation of teams responsible for promoting accessibility\n- 2020: Boosted the hiring and training of employees with human-centered design (HCD) skills\n- 2021: Launched a certification system for HCD experts\n\nFiscal Year 2021 Results\n- Strengthened systems to improve accessibility\n  - Implemented inclusive design and reflected it in products and services\n  - Exhibited at CSUN, the world\u2019s largest international showcase for accessibility\nThe Sony Group exhibited at the 37th CSUN Assistive Technology Conference (CSUN)* in Anaheim California from March 14 to 18, 2022. By exhibiting at CSUN, Sony is promoting efforts to improve accessibility by making more customers aware of accessibility-friendly products and services, and listening to the voices of various customers.\n\nThe 2022 CSUN was an in-person event and the Sony Group booth had measures in place against COVID-19. BRAVIA\u2122, PlayStation\u00ae5, SRS-NS7, LinkBuds and the Alpha 7 IV were among the products on display. People of all ages with diverse needs and backgrounds visited the Sony Group booth and provided a lot of new perspectives and valuable feedback. Sony will continue to provide opportunities for customers to experience products and services for themselves, and to reflect the feedback it receives in its initiatives to improve products and services.\n\n* The world\u2019s largest international conference focused on \u201cAccessibility,\u201d which introduces the latest products, services and initiatives in this field.\n\nIn order to enhance security quality, since 2017 each business unit has been conducting annual inspections to ensure these security quality measures are being properly implemented for all products and services. Such inspections enable Sony to swiftly identify new challenges, such as the need to respond to vulnerabilities in the supply chain, and to formulate, add and implement improvement strategies in order to maintain and improve security quality.\n\nSony has included requirements for conformance to the IoT security regulations in the Sony Security Development Life Cycle, and is establishing operations that observe the relevant laws in individual countries/regions.\nProduct Quality and Quality Management\n\nThe Sony Pledge of Quality declares that \u201cSony employees will always respect our customers\u2019 viewpoints in striving to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed their expectations.\u201d To this end, Sony makes continuous, decisive efforts to enhance product quality and to reinforce its quality management system.\n\nSony\u2019s Quality Management System Framework\n\nSony has configured its quality management system by defining quality management mechanisms across all processes, from product planning, development, design and manufacturing to sales and customer service. This has included defining the roles, responsibilities and authority of those responsible for product and customer service, and establishing guidelines.\n\nBased on this quality management system, Sony is implementing measures on an ongoing basis to improve the quality of its products and services. Examples of such measures are given below.\n\nFramework of Sony\u2019s Quality Management System\n\n- **Senior Executive in charge of Quality Management**\n- **Senior Vice President in charge of Quality Management**\n- **Head of product quality department at headquarters**\n- **Head of Quality officer**\n- **Head of CS officer**\n- **Manufacturing Sites**\n- **Sales Company**\n- **Business Unit**\n- **Regional HQ**\n\n**Senior Vice President in charge of Quality Management**\n\n- The Senior Vice President in charge of Quality Management is appointed with the task of coordinating efforts to improve product and customer service quality and ensuring timely responses to problems.\n- Rules worldwide have been strengthened to ensure prompt reporting to the Senior Vice President in charge of Quality Management when Sony receives information about an incident involving a Sony product that affects customer safety or has the potential to do so. Based on the reports received, the corporate executive in charge of product quality provides the necessary follow-up and instructs the relevant divisions to investigate the incidents and respond appropriately to the customer. Under a similar system, Sony has been addressing software security issues found in products and managing potential security issues.\n\n**Quality Officers and CS Officers**\n\n- Sony has appointed quality officers within each business unit and tasked them with promoting activities to improve product quality and spearheading initiatives to enhance the quality of products and services in specific business areas under the direction and supervision of the Senior Vice President in charge of Quality Management and the head of the relevant business unit.\n- Regular meetings of quality officers from business units are held to evaluate the progress of quality-oriented business plans, promote initiatives aimed at achieving targets, and debate specific activities and responses to quality-related issues and common challenges.\n- Sony has appointed CS officers responsible for improving the quality of customer service in markets around the world where Sony products are sold and has tasked them with spearheading a network of global-level initiatives under the supervision of the Senior Vice President in charge of Quality Management and the individual in charge of the relevant regional headquarters.\n- Meetings of business unit quality officers and regional CS officers are held to evaluate the progress of quality and customer service business plans and promote initiatives aimed at achieving targets, and to share information on customer service and product quality activities and common challenges, thereby contributing to global efforts to improve product quality and customer service.\n- Sony has created a framework for promoting business unit- and region-specific initiatives to ensure its products comply with pertinent laws and regulations.\n\n**Quality Management**\n\n- Sony has obtained certification under ISO 9001 for all sites manufacturing electronics products.\n- It has formulated mid-term plan and fiscal year targets for Sony product quality and customer service initiatives, as well as key quality-related indicators for business plans, with the aim of fulfilling the Sony Pledge of Quality. Business units and regional headquarters subsequently devise their own quality and customer service targets and business plans for the fiscal year, in line with which they continue to promote quality improvement initiatives.\n- Sony holds meetings of top managers of the electronics business to deliberate and decide on key strategies related to product quality and customer service.\n- It formulates and administers quality standards applicable to Sony\u2019s electronics products and related customer service, which focus on such criteria as product safety and performance, labeling, customer service, usability and accessibility. These standards are updated continuously to reflect technological advances, changes in applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and social changes, with the aim of ensuring Sony\u2019s ability to deliver quality and services that exceed the expectations of customers.\nResponding to the Customer\n\nSony makes active use of customer feedback to improve its products and customer service. Sony customer information centers promptly and accurately evaluate customer opinions, reports of malfunctions after purchase, questions regarding use, and other feedback. These feedbacks are aggregated in the database for the planning, design and product quality groups to work together to improve product quality and strengthen product performance, reporting progress to top management on an as-needed basis.\n\nIn recent years, the communication tools used by customers have become more diverse. In order to meet broader customer expectations, Sony has started to analyze customer feedback on social media as well.\n\nQuality Hotline\n\nIt is vital to detect product quality-related problems at the earliest stage possible. To that end, Sony has established the Quality Hotline to gather product quality-related information, including reports of problems, as well as opinions from Sony Group employees. Group employees can use the Quality Hotline, an in-house website, to send messages regarding matters that are too difficult to handle at their workplace, such as certain product quality issues. They can also share findings identified during customer use of products and any problems with the quality of product-related customer service as perceived by customers who have made use of those services. Upon investigating a problem to ascertain the veracity of the information received, the Quality Hotline office proposes and introduces measures to prevent previous problems from recurring and precluding potential new problems.\n\nMarket Quality Improvements\n\nSony has established dedicated quality management organizations in each of its business areas that are responsible for improving the quality of pertinent products in each market. At Sony headquarters, information related to quality issues arising in the marketplace is gathered in a timely manner from a broad range of sources in Japan and overseas and reported weekly to headquarters quality management and technical specialists. Based on the reported information, Sony ascertains whether or not issues in the marketplace have been addressed appropriately. In addition to ensuring that such issues are thoroughly addressed, Sony is accelerating its quality improvement performance by promoting measures to prevent recurrence and proactive measures in relation to quality issues.\n\nResponses to Quality Issues\n\nSony recognizes that ensuring its customers\u2019 satisfaction, confidence and trust is one of its most important management tasks and strives to prevent quality-related problems through the systems and efforts described above.\n\nSony responds swiftly in the event of a quality-related issue, with the relevant departments working together to investigate facts and take appropriate action on a global scale. When such an issue arises, Sony decides upon the need for public announcements and market action for customers, and implements any needed steps after undertaking various studies of the issue, following a process common to all Sony products.\n\nThis process starts with the gathering of information from customer service centers worldwide and collaboration with concerned local parties to ensure an accurate grasp of the issue. Based on information collected, Sony then works to determine the correct response by identifying the cause of the issue, implementing countermeasures and promptly verifying the effectiveness thereof, and reviewing the issue from the customer\u2019s perspective. Sony also cooperates with CS officers at sites in each region to ensure the same level of service is provided to customers the world over.\n\nWith regard to methods and media for issuing public announcements of product quality-related issues, Sony examines the effectiveness of the various means at its disposal, including the Internet, e-mail, notification via app, or other media.\nImproving the Quality, Safety and Long-Term Reliability of Products\n\nImproving the Quality of Products\n\nSony strives to maximize product quality by improving design, manufacturing, and parts.\n\nDesign-Related Quality Initiatives\n\nIn the initial stages of the design process, the individual in charge of a particular business unit verifies new technologies and new parts and, from the user\u2019s perspective, determines how a product is to be used. At the conclusion of the design process, the individual in charge confirms the degree to which the intended levels of product quality and reliability have been realized. In addition, to ensure that customers are provided with products of a quality worthy of the Sony brand, Sony requires relevant departments including original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and original design manufacturer (ODM) companies to comply with group-wide quality standards. Compliance with these standards is also tested at the end of the design process. Such approaches prevent the occurrence of problems pertaining to new technologies and new product parts, while also ensuring that product designs incorporate consideration of user convenience.\n\nProduction-Related Quality Initiatives\n\nIn the effort to ensure that Sony does not receive, manufacture or ship anything with quality-related problems, Sony adheres to a policy of workmanship at all of its manufacturing sites that ensure customers can use Sony products with confidence. Initiatives include setting important targets at each manufacturing site and implementing PDCA processes, thereby facilitating the achievement of such targets and the continuous improvement of product quality. Sony has also established standard product quality rules to ensure Sony products manufactured by OEM/ODM companies are of the same high quality as those manufactured at Sony production sites.\n\nParts-Related Quality Initiatives\n\nRecognizing the importance of parts and determined to manufacture products built for long-term use, Sony carefully selects key parts independently for each of its major product categories and is pursuing focused efforts aimed at increasing the reliability of the parts it uses through cooperation among relevant departments.\n\nImproving Product Safety\n\nProviding reliable products that customers can use safely is a top priority for Sony. Accordingly, at every stage of its business activities, including product planning, development, design, manufacturing, marketing, and after-sales service for all products and services, Sony takes steps to comply with safety standards based on laws and regulations while constantly striving to surpass those standards in order to maintain the safety of its products. As part of these efforts, Sony has established a team in charge of product safety assessment from a medical perspective. When developing products employing new technologies and using new technologies at events, Sony also seeks advice on product safety from a medical perspective from outside experts in order to ensure products do not affect customer health, and this advice is then incorporated into technology assessment, product development, design and engineering. When deemed necessary, Sony also conducts evaluation tests to assess safety with the assistance of a specialized organization. If a safety-related problem involving a Sony product is reported, Sony immediately collects information and examines the facts, and then takes the steps necessary to rectify the problem.\n\nImproving the Long-Term Reliability of Products\n\nSony has established a Quality Reliability Lab supporting Sony\u2019s commitment to deliver safe, durable and reliable products to customers. The Quality Reliability Lab has assigned specialists to work full time on improving technologies essential to product reliability and continues working to ensure the long-term reliability of products by developing elemental technologies for preventing age-related deterioration and corrosion of materials and parts, as well as technologies necessary to ensure the reliability of new technologies and functions required for new products and to analyze and evaluate such technologies and functions. These technologies and the information obtained through these activities are utilized to improve design and parts selection processes and increased reliability of products. Sony also presents some of its own knowledge of evaluation technologies at academic meetings and industry conferences and gatherings, seeking to go beyond its own walls and contribute to the industry.\n\nEfforts to Improve Quality of Product Security\n\nWith more products connecting to networks, there is a heightened danger of personal information leaks, falsification or destruction of data, product hacking and other such security issues. As a consequence, it is very important to improve the quality of the security of products and network services. Sony has a function for collecting security risk-related information from outside experts, researchers and other individuals. Sony assigns managers responsible for the software security of products and has a dedicated department for it. The department coordinates with business units to address issues with the security of products. Based on the information received, the department assesses the impact of risk on customers from a software security perspective and implements appropriate measures. To deliver products that customers can use with confidence, Sony has security design and response systems that ensure the security of products over their entire life cycle \u2014 from planning and shipment to disposal \u2014 such as conducting security risk assessments, using product security vulnerability detection tools, and security inspections prior to product shipment. Sony has also established internal guidelines pertaining to the security of products and continues to implement employee training programs to strengthen product security. Due to growing concern over security issues with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, regulators in countries/regions are developing new laws and regulations concerning IoT security. Sony is establishing internal frameworks for gathering and responding to regulatory information in order to secure regulatory compliance.\n\nResponsible AI\n\nIn accordance with the Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines, Sony established an internal document stipulating requirements to be complied with in the commercialization process of electronics products and services, and in July 2021 started to include AI ethics assessments in the product development life cycle.\n\nSustainability Report 2022\nCustomer Service\n\nIn addition to continuously improving product quality, Sony is taking various steps to improve its responsiveness and its customer service capabilities, in line with its commitment, set forth in the Sony Pledge of Quality: \u201cSony employees will always respect our customers\u2019 viewpoints in striving to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed their expectations.\u201d In customer service, this includes responding to changing customer needs, and in repair services, building organizations designed to ensure the best possible repair service quality.\n\nSystem\n\nSony has assigned CS officers responsible for improving the quality of customer service in markets around the world where Sony products are sold. Under the guidance and supervision of the Senior Vice President in charge of Quality Management and of regional headquarters, Sony has also introduced a set of key performance indicators to enhance customer service quality on a global level. Sony has also established a network of bases through which it provides services tailored to the needs of customers in each region.\n\nTraining for Customer Support Staff\n\nCommitted to providing high-quality services to customers around the world, Sony provides ongoing training for employees and the staff of service partners. In addition to focusing on the acquisition of new service technologies and the sharing of solutions to ensure issues are swiftly and effectively addressed, staff are trained to help customers get the greatest possible enjoyment from their Sony products.\n\nCustomer Information Centers and Customer Service Improvements\n\nSony established its first customer information center in 1963 in Japan to respond to customer inquiries. Today, Sony has customer information centers worldwide, enabling it to provide prompt responses to customer needs that reflect customers\u2019 perspectives, thereby helping Sony to improve the quality of its customer service. In addition to support via telephone and e-mail, in several regions Sony provides customer support via such means as live Internet chat sessions, support using social media and messaging apps, and online community forums where customers can share information to help each other find solutions. In these ways, Sony tailors its support to meet the increasingly diverse needs of its customers in every region of the world.\n\nIn addition, Sony conducts surveys to determine customer satisfaction at various touchpoints, and makes improvements based on the survey results in its efforts to continually improve customer satisfaction.\n\nMore Convenient, Eco-Friendly Instruction Manuals\n\nTo provide better explanations on how to use its products, Sony is bolstering its online support and providing online instruction manuals for improved searchability and greater convenience so that users are able to quickly find what they are looking for. The Sony website has a support section that offers not only information on the products themselves but also additional support information on software upgrades and network service updates. This is designed to help users better understand Sony products, software, and services, as well as to enable them, when needed, to troubleshoot as quickly as possible. To accommodate a variety of user environments, Sony also provides support information compatible with mobile devices for greater customer convenience. When it comes to printed product manuals, Sony provides brief \u201cstartup guides\u201d that focus on the information needed to begin using a product, such as how to connect and set up, and how to use the basic functions. For some products sold globally, Sony has developed instruction manuals with minimal text and more extensive visuals, making it possible to include multiple languages in a single manual, which is expected to contribute to environmental protection by reducing paper consumption.\n\nRepair and Service Network\n\nCurrently, there are 3,458 Sony repair service locations worldwide. To enhance customer satisfaction, Sony is working to meet customer needs by performing immediate problem diagnosis at the repair reception desk, improving repair quality and reducing the number of days required for repairs, among other efforts. In addition, Sony is continuously enhancing its service network to ensure that it can respond appropriately to repair requests in each region for each product. By strengthening the feedback mechanism for product quality based on repair information, Sony also aims to keep enhancing quality.\n\nConsumer AV Product Service Locations (Fiscal Year 2021)\n\n| Region                        | Repair Service Locations |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Japan                         | 454                      |\n| United States/Canada          | 636                      |\n| Europe                        | 803                      |\n| Mainland China and Hong Kong Region | 553                  |\n| Asia Pacific*1                | 533                      |\n| Other Areas*2                 | 479                      |\n\n*1 Southeast Asia, Oceania, India, South Korea and Taiwan Region\n*2 Middle East, Latin America and Africa\n\nSony\u2019s Purpose & Values\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct\nApproach to Sustainability\nEditorial Policy\nBusiness Overview\nSony\u2019s Sustainability\nAddressing Social and Environmental Issues\nEnvironment\nEmployees\nRespect for Human Rights\nResponsible Supply Chain\nQuality and Customer Service\nManagement Approach\nHighlight\nProduct Quality and Quality Management\nImproving the Quality, Safety and Long-Term Reliability of Products\nCustomer Service\nImproving the User Experience\nAccessibility\nCommunity Engagement\nEthics and Compliance\nCorporate Governance\nData Section\nGRI Standards Content Index\n\nSustainability Report 2022\nImproving the User Experience\n\nUser experience is an essential aspect of quality at Sony. In order to gain an accurate understanding of the increasingly diverse needs of customers and to deliver a superior user experience, Sony has adopted Human-Centered Design (HCD) processes and ensures that its design efforts always take the customer\u2019s perspective.\n\nSystem\n\nSony is promoting HCD via collaboration between relevant departments and business groups. The initiative is driven by a team that promotes activities across the Group and is overseen by the corporate executive officer in charge of product quality. Products and services are becoming more multi-functional all the time, and their user interfaces also tend to be more complex with the advance of technology. Sony employs intradepartmental cooperation on development to deliver products and services that people can use with ease and comfort.\n\nUsing Human-Centered Design in Product and Service Development\n\nSony is working to improve product usability and create experiences that meet the core needs of customers. It conducts worldwide user research including home visits and user interviews. These efforts are part of a continuing cycle of issue identification and product improvement, which includes prototyping and usability testing in the upstream stage of design. Employees also conduct long-term usage surveys, including interviews with customers, both before and after product release. In addition, Sony analyzes how customers feel and behave when they use a service, and then works to improve the user experience by sharing customer feedback with relevant personnel.\n\nSystems for User Research and Testing\n\nSony has built an environment and established systems that ensure user research and testing can be carried out quickly and efficiently via group-wide collaboration spanning sites in Japan, North America, Europe, India, and China. Via steps such as the introduction of online systems, it ensures that the necessary user research and testing can be carried out in spite of the physical constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also an internal monitor program through which employees and their families participate in questionnaire surveys, interviews, and usability tests. These systems and programs enable Sony to deliver a superior user experience and keep creating products that are easy to use.\n\nFormulating Internal Standards and Applying Acquired Expertise\n\nProduct and service designers from across the Sony Group meet to formulate standards for interactions, use of words and icons on devices and screens, and so on. The knowledge gained through user research and testing, the expertise of the product development departments, and case studies of the application of UX (user experience) design are shared across the Group as well. These standards and expertise are posted on Sony\u2019s internal portal site to ensure that everyone at the Sony Group has access to them. This information is used in product and service development as Sony continues to work to enhance usability for customers.\n\nHuman Resource Development and Awareness-raising Activities on HCD\n\nIn order to continue delivering a superior user experience, Sony launched a system in 2021 to certify employees with a high level of expertise and experience as HCD experts. These experts will play a leading role in the workplace. Eight HCD experts were certified in the first phase, and Sony is working to ensure that HCD becomes further entrenched in development departments. Sony provides internal training so that not only experts but also development site personnel and leaders can acquire the needed skills to help deliver experiences that better meet the needs of customers. People with HCD skills are also being actively hired in order to increase the number of employees with a high degree of expertise who are ready to lead customer-focused initiatives. In order to further deepen employee understanding of HCD, Sony also holds timely lectures and events open to all employees featuring internal and external experts. Through these activities, employees involved in various aspects of product and service creation are working to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to master HCD.\nAccessibility\n\nWith the purpose of \u201cfilling the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology,\u201d Sony continues to pursue accessibility initiatives in order to contribute to a future where everyone can equally share \u201cKando\u201d (emotion).\n\nSystem\n\nUnder the Senior Vice President in charge of Quality Management, a team that promotes accessibility and inclusive design* across the group stands at the core of efforts involving cooperation with the people responsible for promoting accessibility in the business units. Having established a globally consistent set of standards and systems, we are using them as the basis for continuous improvements. We provide comprehensive support for the Sony Group\u2019s accessibility-related activities, including employee training, company-wide lectures, surveys and evaluation tools designed to improve accessibility, and the introduction of inclusive design.\n\nEnsuring That as Many People as Possible Can Enjoy Sony Products and Services\n\nIn December 2019, Sony joined The Valuable 500, an international initiative to help promote participation by individuals with disabilities, to enjoy Sony products and services. For information on accessible products and services, please visit the Accessibility page of the Sony Group Portal website.\n\nEmployee Education\n\nSony Group holds forums and seminars led by experts to increase employee understanding of accessibility. E-learning training is offered at the principal Sony Group companies to foster a general understanding of accessibility, and around 28,500*1 employees took the course in 2021. Every year on Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)*2, Sony Group companies hold lectures and events to enhance employee understanding of accessibility. For example, Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) held a lecture for its employees to coincide with GAAD. In addition, SPE held \u201cfamily-friendly sensory screenings\u201d with adjusted lighting and sound setting for persons with hypersensitivity, such as autism, which were offered at offices in the US. The aim was to boost employee awareness and understanding of hyperesthesia while enjoying a movie with employees and their family members and those who have this condition.\n\nInclusive Design Initiatives\n\nTo enhance accessibility and enable more people, including people with disabilities, to enjoy its products and services, Sony employs inclusive design. Sony incorporates feedback gained through the participation of employees with disabilities in the planning and development process, interviews with people with disabilities, and usability tests. For example, in developing televisions, Sony asks users with visual impairments to try the products for a designated period of time, and those who have this condition.\n\nCollaborative Initiatives\n\nSony is also accelerating collaborations with other companies to enhance accessibility and inclusion. Its truly wireless headphones LinkBuds, released in February 2022, were a collaborative project with Microsoft Soundscape to empower richer experiences for everyone to explore their surroundings using 3D spatial audio. Sony also participates in the \u201cWith My Eyes\u201d project to bring \u201cdifficult to see\u201d into \u201cclearer sight\u201d for people with low vision, QD Laser, Inc.\u2019s laser retina projection device can be attached to Sony cameras, allowing people with low vision to shoot video and still images with their own eyes.\n\nMovie Initiatives\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is developing a process for creating audio descriptions and captions* for use when movies are screened in cinemas or released on DVD or Blu-ray. The audio description system uses audio to convey information, such as people\u2019s movements, movie scenes, captions, and on-screen messages, primarily for people with visual impairments. Captions are primarily for people with hearing disabilities. They show the names of the people speaking and their lines as well as meaningful onscreen information on the audio, such as music, sound effects, and ambient noises. Audio description and captions enable more people to enjoy movies and videos.\n\nIndependent Employee Initiatives\n\nGroups of employees (Employee Resource Groups) at Sony are taking the lead in improving accessibility. At Sony North of America and Sony Interactive Entertainment, employee networks are leading the way in supporting employees with disabilities and regularly disseminating information to raise awareness of accessibility within the company. For example, the diverse range of perspectives brought by Sony Interactive Entertainment\u2019s employee resource group in Europe and America played a central role in the development of the ABLE@PlayStation Inclusive Language Guide. This guide helps to resolve mutual misunderstandings, improve communication, and boost awareness. It has also been made available for external use to support inclusivity for all outside of Sony.\nMaking the Most of Diverse Customer Feedback\n\nSony exhibits at accessibility-related events in order to gather consumer feedback and use it to improve products and services. It has been exhibiting at the CSUN Assistive Technology Conference (CSUN), the world\u2019s largest international showcase for accessibility, since 2018. In March 2022, Sony\u2019s accessible products such as BRAVIA\u2122, PlayStation\u00ae, a wireless neckband speaker and the Alpha 7 IV were on display at CSUN. At the TechShare Pro conference gathering for accessibility experts held in November 2021, Sony once again participated as a Silver Sponsor and featured its products online. Moreover, Sony sites in Europe and the United States also provide opportunities for regular dialogue with organizations of people with disabilities as part of efforts to make Sony\u2019s products and services even easier to use.\n\nStandardization for Accessibility Improvements\n\nSony has established its own evaluation standards for accessibility, based on industry standards and designed to improve the quality of accessibility in its products and services. These standards are implemented company-wide. Periodic product assessments are carried out using the standards, with a particular focus on electronics products such as BRAVIA\u2122 and Xperia\u2122. The results of those assessments are then leveraged in ongoing efforts to improve products such as BRAVIA\u2122 and Xperia\u2122. The results of those assessments are then leveraged in ongoing efforts to improve products and services. Sony is also proactively involved in standardization* activities aimed at driving improvements in accessibility throughout the industry.\n\nWorking to Enhance Sony Website Accessibility\n\nSony has established the Sony Group Web Accessibility Policy which sets forth the accessibility standards and compliance requirements for all Sony Group Companies\u2019 websites. Sony Group\u2019s web accessibility requirements are aligned with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n\nWith the use of websites and other digital platforms continuing to rise, the Sony Group Web Accessibility Policy seeks to ensure that Sony Group companies\u2019 websites are designed and developed in a way that is accessible to all, including members of the disabled community and the elderly.\n\nSony has been actively promoting the established web accessibility policy, as well as working with companies within the Sony Group in implementing the policy and conducting checks to ensure compliance. Sony has regularly conducted a range of web accessibility trainings targeting different roles in the organization and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nCreating an Environment for Carefree Internet Use\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) will continue to make games as popular as music, movies and broadcasting, and has been developing the PlayStation\u00ae business for users in all age groups. Console game industry organizations have responded to the proliferation of new game genres by introducing rating systems for customers in Japan, the United States and Europe (CERO, ESRB and PEGI, respectively), based on games\u2019 target age groups. Sony has applied the U.S. system for more than 20 years, offering parents and guardians suggested age categories and descriptions that detail the contents of a game. PEGI is endorsed by the European Commission as a paradigm of self-regulation in the entertainment industry. In Japan, measures are being promoted to make the system more effective, including, with the cooperation of retailers, the voluntary refusal to sell software rated by CERO for ages 18 and above to underage customers.\n\nSIE has enhanced its parental controls features on its game consoles, including PlayStation\u00ae. This enables parents to navigate the play experience of their family in a way that works best for their needs. For example, the family manager can control the setting so their children can only use the console to enjoy games that are suitable for their age group, offering added safety and peace of mind. The feature also allows a parent to limit screen time and block the ability to chat with other remote users.\n\nSony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and Sony Assurance Inc. provide sign language and written communication services to facilitate inquiries from customers with hearing or speech disabilities. Operators use their sign language interpretation skills for sign language or written conversations with customers.\nCommunity Engagement\n\nManagement Approach\n\nMateriality Rationale\nSony can only create sustainable social value based on its Purpose when society itself is healthy. It is Sony\u2019s responsibility as a global company to recognize various social issues and contribute to the creation of a sustainable society via community engagement activities. Doing so helps Sony to build relationships of trust with communities.\n\nBasic Approach\nUnder the slogan \u201cFor the Next Generation\u201d and based on its policy of community engagement, Sony develops initiatives in collaboration with various stakeholders in order to contribute to the resolution of a wide range of global issues by making the most of Sony products, content, and technologies.\n\nVision of Sony\u2019s Founder\nIn Sony\u2019s Founding Prospectus, Masaru Ibuka, one of the founders, set \u201cthe promotion of education in science among the general public\u201d as a primary goal. He was convinced that enhancing scientific literacy would be critical for the recovery of postwar Japan and that science education for children was the key. In 1959, 13 years after Sony\u2019s establishment, he set up the Sony Fund for the Promotion of Science Education in Elementary Schools in the pursuit of science education excellence. His vision lives on in Sony\u2019s community engagement activities.\n\nLooking to the Future\nSony strives to make the most of its products, content, technologies, strengths of employees, and stakeholder partnerships to help address global issues, including those targeted by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to meet various needs in local communities.\n\nMilestones\n1959: Founded Sony Fund for the Promotion of Science Education in Elementary Schools\n1972: Established Sony Foundation for Education (now Sony Education Foundation)\n1984: Established Sony Music Foundation\n2006: Became a corporate sponsor of the UNHCR Refugee Film Festival in partnership with Japan for UNHCR\n2009: Launched Sony Science Program\n2010: Started a partnership with Save the Children Japan for disaster assistance\n2012: Launched a project for forest conservation in Sumatra in cooperation with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)\n2018: Launched KANDO Experience Program\n2020: Established the Sony Global Relief Fund for COVID-19\n\nSocial contribution initiative\nHistory of Sony\u2019s social contribution activities\n\nFiscal Year 2021 Results\n\nTotal contributions by the two global funds\nApprox. 11.3 billion yen\n\nEducational programs offered workshops to approx.\n290,000 children\nSony\u2019s Two Global Funds\n\nSony provides various kinds of ongoing support via the two $100 million global funds it established in 2020: the Sony Global Relief Fund for COVID-19 and the Global Social Justice Fund.

The fund pools a certain amount of funds at all times, which enables a rapid response to crises around the world by making monetary disbursements to Save the Children\u2019s emergency response. The funds are used to deploy everyday goods and hygiene kits, to establish Child Friendly Spaces, which are safe and secure settings for children to play and spend time in, and to provide training in Psychological First Aid for Children, an approach used to reduce the initial distress of children exposed to crisis situations. As of March 31 2022, the Emergency Disaster and Recovery Fund for Children has disbursed around 110 million yen which is to be used for Save the Children\u2019s relief activities in response to disasters around the world. Recognizing the importance of frameworks that not only provide for conventional emergency response and reconstruction support but also improve preparedness for disasters before they occur, Save the Children and Sony announced in March 2021 that they will jointly promote the development of resilient communities against disasters. As part of this new partnership, Sony provides support for the Safe Schools program. This program, carried out by Save the Children in over 40 countries, is an all-inclusive, all hazards approach to keep children safe in and around schools. As part of the Safe Schools program, since June 2021 disaster preparedness educational programs are being provided at elementary and junior high schools in India to help students and teachers enhance their disaster responsiveness and also establish task forces to strengthen the safety management mechanisms at schools and create safe learning environments for students. Partnerships and collaboration with the government and local communities are also being strengthened. Save the Children and Sony will provide insights gained through the school safety program in India to further strengthen and expand its initiatives globally, aiming to replicate them in other countries. Sony will donate a total of 45 million yen to Save the Children over the period up to 2023 in order to fund these initiatives, and will also consider dispatching employees to assist on-site as part of an effort to make the most of Sony technology and personnel to help resolve social issues.\nVolunteer Systems for Employees\n\nEmployee engagement in Social Contribution Initiatives\n\nSony uses a three-step approach to provide its employees with opportunities to participate in social contribution initiatives: raise awareness of social issues, volunteer, and leverage job skills. There are programs for each approach. E-learning, sustainability forums and in-house newsletters are provided to raise awareness of social issues. Opportunities to participate in volunteer work and donations (funds, goods, books) include donations for emergency humanitarian assistance, volunteer work in areas affected by natural disasters, and participation in community cleanups and greening programs. For those who wish to leverage their job skills, opportunities are provided to serve as educational program lecturers or staff, or as career-oriented class instructors.\n\nLeave for Volunteering Purposes\n\nTo support employee participation in volunteering activities, Sony Group Corporation has an employee volunteer support system, making it easier for employees to participate in these activities by allowing them to use accumulated holidays for initiatives requiring extended leaves of absence. Employees participate as volunteers in educational support activities and disaster relief activities.\n\nEmployee Initiatives Addressing Social Issues\n\nThere are various initiatives where Sony employees address social issues. Sony Pictures Entertainment launched Sony Pictures Giving Portal, an online platform providing information for employees who wish to participate in social contribution activities or its matching gift program. Sony Interactive Entertainment drives community partnerships, financial or in-kind donations, and employee volunteerism focused on social issues via PlayStation Cares, its corporate giving platform available to employees in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil.\n\nMany of the activities utilizing the Sony Global Relief Fund for COVID-19 were born from ideas submitted by employees, and roughly 50 Sony Group organizations are involved in them. This helps to boost employee engagement, as well as facilitating Sony\u2019s contributions to society through its businesses.\n\nCharitable Donation Systems for Employees\n\nSony has been introducing matching gift programs where the company matches donations made by employees to support aid organizations in times of disasters and emergency humanitarian crises. In fiscal year 2021, Sony Group companies around the world took part in the employee donation drive to support humanitarian relief for Ukraine Emergency. The employee donation together with the amount matched by the company reached a total of approximately 1.69 million U.S. dollars.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, as one of its fund-raising methods, Sony introduced an employee ID card donation initiative. Some Sony Group employee ID cards have a function that allows electronic money payments. When employee ID cards need to be reissued for organizational changes, employees have a choice to donate the amount that is left in the old ID card when returning them to the company. Throughout this initiative, in fiscal year 2021, approximately 1.9 million yen was donated to the Emergency Disaster and Recovery Fund for Children which is jointly operated by Save the Children and Sony.\n\nOrganizational Structure\nEthics and Compliance\n\nMateriality Rationale\nIntegrity and Sincerity is part of Sony\u2019s key Values to enhance its Purpose.

These standards are also embodied in the Code.\n\nCode Implementation\n\nThe Code was approved by the Sony Group Corporation Board of Directors and adopted by the decision-making bodies of every Sony Group company (\u201cSony Group\u201d or \u201cSony Group companies\u201d) as their respective code of conduct. Sony Group managers, at all levels are responsible for promoting the Code as part of their ongoing commitment to creating a culture of integrity and ensuring ethical and responsible business conduct.\n\nThe Code, which is available on Sony\u2019s website and on each Sony Group company\u2019s intranet, has been translated into 23 languages to help ensure that it is clearly understood by the employees and relevant third parties working for Sony. Sony provides additional translations as necessitated by changing workforce demographics.\n\nAll Sony Group employees and selected third party staff are required to complete comprehensive Code of Conduct training. Training must be completed within 90 days of commencement service. Refresher Code of Conduct training must also be completed at least every four years. In addition, Sony provides in-depth training on key risk areas at least once per year.

Their commitment is supported by a robust ethics and compliance program aligned with business processes, including policies and procedures, training and messaging, ongoing risk assessments, program assessment and surveys, third party management, reporting mechanism, and monitoring and audits. Sony continuously improves its program in accordance with regulatory guidance and other leading practices that organizations with mature ethics and compliance programs have found to be effective.\n\nPolicies and Procedures\n\nSony\u2019s global policies provide necessary rules and procedures to help ensure ethical and responsible business conduct and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

For example, all Sony personnel and relevant third parties working for Sony are required to complete the Code of Conduct and Proper Workplace Conduct training within 90 days of first providing services to Sony. Additional compliance training is mandated based upon risk assessments and employee and third party roles and responsibilities.\n\nKey Compliance Training (assigned based upon risk assessments and roles and responsibilities) includes:\n\n- Anti-Bribery\n- Economic Sanctions Compliance\n- Customer Due Diligence\n- Antitrust and Fair Competition\n- Import / Export Trade Compliance\n- Information Security and Privacy\n- Manager Training\n\nRisk Assessment Areas under Ethics and Compliance Program\n\nSony conducts ongoing risk assessments to help assure that Sony\u2019s ethics and compliance program activities effectively mitigates and manages top risks. Key legal and compliance risk areas assessed include:\n\n- Antitrust\n- Bribery\n- Conflict of Interest\n- Economic Sanctions Laws\n- Environmental Laws\n- Financial Laws\n- Fraud\n- Information Security Laws\n- Infringement of Intellectual Property\n- Insider Trading\n- Labor and Employment Laws\n- Money Laundering\n- Privacy / Personal Information Protection Laws\n- Product Safety / Product Compliance\n- Securities Laws\n- Supply Chain Laws\n- Trade Compliance\n- Other Laws\n\nThird Party Management\n\nSony performs risk-based due diligence procedures on its business partners to help ensure that Sony is only doing business with reputable business partners. This due diligence protects Sony Group companies from being involved in transactions involving the proceeds of criminal conduct and/or with entities or individuals who are designated on an economic sanctions list and/or trade control list.\n\n- Responsible Business Conduct\n\nThe Sony Group Corporation Board of Director\u2019s Audit Committee provides oversight of Sony\u2019s program and receives monthly reports and periodic in-person updates concerning ethics and compliance program activities. Reports to the Board\u2019s Audit Committee provide program performance results, compliance hotline metrics, employee training data, and new program and communications initiatives, and updates on global regulatory developments. In addition, the Sony Group Corporation Board of Directors also receives annual updates on compliance related risks and Sony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program.\n\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct\n\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct is the foundation of Sony\u2019s Ethics and Compliance Program. It is a statement of Sony\u2019s commitment to ethical and responsible business conduct and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Code of Conduct outlines Sony\u2019s core ethical values and provides guidance on how to make ethical decisions in business situations. It is a living document that is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in laws, regulations, and business practices.\n\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct includes:\n\n- Sony\u2019s Purpose & Values\n- The Sony Group Code of Conduct\n- Approach to Sustainability\n- Editorial Policy\n- Business Overview\n- Sony\u2019s Sustainability\n- Addressing Social and Environmental Issues\n- Environment\n- Employees\n- Respect for Human Rights\n- Responsible Supply Chain\n- Quality and Customer Service\n- Community Engagement\n- Ethics and Compliance\n- Management Approach\n- The Sony Group Code of Conduct\n- Sony\u2019s Ethics and Compliance Program\n- Organizational Structure\n- Responsible Business Conduct\n- Privacy and Personal Information Management\n- Responsible AI\n- Corporate Governance\n- Data Section\n- GRI Standards Content Index\n\nSustainability Report 2022\nSony provides many different types of resources to employees to enable them to raise concerns to ensure the effectiveness of Sony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program. Please refer to \u201cSony Ethics & Compliance Hotline\u201d for more details.\n\nSony has a Compliance Monitoring function, which measures the effectiveness and maturity of Sony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program. This is done by conducting periodic assessments of program implementation on a global basis. It also conducts risk-based compliance audits and validations of controls.\n\nSony Ethics & Compliance Hotline\n\nSony believes that a \u201cspeak up / listen up\u201d culture \u2014 where employees are encouraged to raise concerns and feel confident that they can do so without fear of retaliation \u2014 is a key to early detection and prevention of ethical and regulatory problems.\n\nMultiple Reporting Channels\n\nSony provides many different types of resources to employees to enable them to raise concerns, including the Sony Group Ethics & Compliance Hotline (\u201cHotline\u201d).\n\nThe Hotline is available online (in 27 different languages) or by phone, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The phone lines are staffed by specially trained third party representatives, with translators in up to 52 different languages. All information provided to the Hotline is handled confidentially. Calls to the Hotline are not recorded or traced, and reporters may remain anonymous to the extent permitted by law.\n\nHow Sony Operates the Hotline / How Sony Investigates Reported Matters\n\nAll concerns raised through the Hotline are investigated independently of ordinary internal reporting structures. Third party representatives, following the receipt of concerns, check possible conflicts of interest before providing necessary information to the appropriate Regional Compliance Office (\u201cOffice\u201d). The Office reviews the information and determines what initial actions are appropriate. The Office investigates the allegation (or ask appropriate department to investigate the allegation) under the oversight of the Regional Compliance Officer, collect more information, or take other actions as appropriate. The Office also works with legal and/or other subject matter experts to determine how best to investigate and resolve the allegations. Management will take corrective action to improve business operating systems or take disciplinary action against employees who have violated the law or company policy, when the facts warrant doing so.\n\nEach Regional Compliance Officer reviews all reports and responses in his or her region, as an added check to help assure matters are fully and fairly addressed. The status of raised concerns is also reported on a monthly basis to the Sony Group Corporation Compliance & Privacy Department, which provides a report to the Sony Group Corporation Audit Committee.\n\nIn FY2021, the Hotline received 407 concerns. The pie chart below shows the total number of concerns received in FY2021 by category. 76% of raised concerns was related to employees, diversity and workplace. 15% was related to business integrity. The remaining concerns comprised: environment, occupational health & safety; misuse, misappropriation of corporate assets; and accounting, auditing, and financial reporting.\n\nFY2021 Reported Concerns by category\n\n- Environment, Occupational Health & Safety: 26% (63 concerns)\n- Business Integrity: 15% (63 concerns)\n- Accounting, Auditing and Financial Reporting: 11% (30 concerns)\n- HR, Diversity and Workplace Respect: 7% (26 concerns)\n- Misuse, Misappropriation of Corporate Assets: 6% (15 concerns)\n- Accounting, Auditing and Financial Reporting: 3% (1 concern)\n\nNotes: The figures in percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number wherefore the total does not sum up to one hundred percent. Among the Environment, Occupational Health & Safety related concerns, the concerns were primarily related to COVID-19, such as pressure to return to the office and, inadequate COVID-19 measures at work. Others were related to occupational health and safety.\n\nIn FY2021, 112 concerns were substantiated and remediated as appropriate, and 166 cases were unsubstantiated. The remainder includes cases under investigation, among others.\nThe table below are examples of issues raised through our Hotline, including information about how these issues were addressed.\n\n| FY2021 Hotline Cases | Guidance | Action(s) Taken |\n|----------------------|----------|-----------------|\n| A manager engaged in harassing behavior (ranting at subordinates and kicking things) when the manager is frustrated. | Sony will not tolerate any form of discrimination, or harassment including, bullying or other behaviors that create a hostile work environment under the Sony Group Code of Conduct. | The allegation was substantiated. The manager had caused similar problems in the past. The manager was disciplined. |\n| An employee downloaded a third party\u2019s intellectual property without the third party\u2019s consent. | Sony Group Code of Conduct prohibits this behavior. Employees must protect the intellectual property of others and shall not knowingly misuse intellectual property. | The allegation was substantiated. The downloaded third-party content was removed. The employee was disciplined and specifically instructed not to use unauthorized third-party content. |\n| An employee was selling customer promotional giveaways to a third party. | Sony\u2019s assets may only be used for legitimate business purposes. The Sony Group Code of Conduct prohibits employees from using Sony\u2019s assets for their personal benefit. | The allegation was substantiated. The employee admitted the theft, paid the sales proceeds from the stolen giveaways to the company, and resigned. |\n\nHow Sony Promotes Speak-Up Resources\n\nSony continuously promotes both the need to raise concerns and promotes the various resources available for employees to raise their concerns. The Code clearly states that every employee is responsible for speaking up to protect their colleagues and Sony. Code of Conduct training and ongoing messages also promote the importance of reporting concerns and advise employees that their concerns can be directed to either their manager, human resources personnel, legal and compliance personnel, or the Sony Ethics & Compliance Hotline. Since Sony understands that employees may prefer to raise concerns with their manager in the first instance, training is also provided to all managers on how to create an environment where employees feel comfortable speaking up when they observe unethical behavior. This training instructs managers on how to handle concerns and prevent any appearance of retaliation.\n\nNo Retaliation\n\nSony does not tolerate retaliation against anyone who cooperates in an investigation or raises a concern in good faith. The Code and other internal rules explicitly provide that Sony does not tolerate any form of retaliation against anyone for making a good faith report or for cooperating in an investigation of a report. Sony keeps information provided to the Hotline confidential to the extent possible. Sony promotes its retaliation policy against retaliation in trainings and communications to employees and imposes appropriate consequences in the event any employee is found to have engaged in retaliatory behavior.\nGlobal Ethics & Compliance Network\n\nOverview:\n\nSony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program is designed to support ethical and responsible business conduct. It is a shared endeavor and is successful through a team effort of directors, management, and employees at all levels, with each person taking ownership and responsibility for ethical business conduct and compliance with the law and in every interaction.\n\nSony established a group-wide ethics and compliance network of experienced compliance personnel (the \u201cGlobal Network\u201d) to strengthen effective implementation of the ethics and compliance program throughout Sony Group. The Global Network (i) establishes a centralized risk management framework in line with best practices; (ii) provides necessary support and guidance to compliance personnel embedded in the business; and (iii) monitors compliance with the risk management framework to provide effective oversight, address gaps, and drive consistency and continuous program improvement across all Sony Group companies.\n\nRoles:\n\n- The Senior Executives in charge of Compliance: Provide top-level leadership for the Global Network and oversee Sony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program.\n- The Sony Group Corporation Compliance & Privacy Department: Designs and oversees the Global Network and Sony\u2019s group-wide ethics and compliance program with support of the Compliance Leadership Team. It also works with the Compliance Leadership Team members, local business unit leaders and compliance members to conduct comprehensive risk assessments and implement compliance policies, procedures, and internal controls to prevent and detect unethical behavior. It provides oversight of investigations related to potential legal or policy violations.\n- The Compliance Leadership Team: Assists in identifying, developing, and implementing best practices in compliance strategies and compliance-related measures. The team is comprised of the Senior Executive in charge of Compliance, all of the Regional Compliance Officers, the Head of Compliance Monitoring, and subject matter experts.\n- The Compliance Monitoring Team: Helps to measure the effectiveness and maturity of Sony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program by conducting periodic and global-based assessments on program implementation and by undertaking risk-based compliance audits and validations of controls.\n- Each Regional Compliance Officer: Is appointed by the Senior Executive in charge of Compliance and is responsible for implementing and overseeing the ethics and compliance program at all Sony Group companies in his or her region to promote ethical and responsible business conduct and prevent and detect violations of laws, regulations and company policies. Each Regional Compliance Officer must also ensure that each Sony Group company in his or her region has designated appropriate personnel and resources to ensure effective implementation of Sony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program.\nResponsible Business Conduct\n\nThird Party Management\n\nSony is firmly committed to ethical and responsible business conduct in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. As part of Sony\u2019s commitment to ethical and responsible conduct, Sony only does business with reputable third parties. Sony established internal rules and procedures to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to potential third party risks, which include: anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, economic sanctions, trade controls, tax laws and restrictions on other financial crimes. Sony identifies transactions that may pose higher risks. Sony performs pre-transaction due diligence, and ongoing monitoring, for these higher risk transactions to protect Sony Group companies from being involved in transactions concerning the proceeds of criminal conduct and/or with entities or individuals who are designated on an economic sanctions list and/or trade control list. Depending on the risk profile of the transaction, additional protections, such as contractual warranties may also be required. Sony provides periodic training to ensure its employees are well aware of policy requirements as well as relevant \u201cred flags\u201d identifying potential transaction risks. Any concerns are promptly investigated via the Global Network and relevant \u201cred flags\u201d identifying potential transaction risks. Sony closely monitors global anti-corruption law enactment and enforcement trends to ensure that Sony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program and internal controls properly address these evolving risks.\n\nSony\u2019s Anti-Bribery and Corruption Program\n\n- Code of Conduct & Anti-Bribery Policy\n- Risk assessment & Updating the policy\n- Communication through training\n- Robust procedures & internal controls\n\nPolicies\n\n- Sony Group Code of Conduct prohibits improper payments in every transaction, whether with a government official or with a private party.\n- The Sony Group Anti-Bribery Policy was established and most recently revised in 2022 under the policy above. It identifies types of transactions that are considered to pose higher risks based on regulatory landscape and Sony\u2019s business and provides conditions and procedures that all Sony Group personnel must adhere to when interacting with officials of various governments around the world. This includes strict limitation on the type of expenditures that are permitted, due diligence and pre-approval requirements.\n\nCommunication through Training\n\n- Sony provides extensive training and support to assist local management with policy compliance. Tailored training is provided to management and employees depending on their respective roles as explained below.\n  - All Sony employees receive training on anti-bribery and corruption expectations as part of the Code of Conduct training upon hire. Refresher training is also provided at least every four years thereafter.\n  - Employees who are at a higher risk for interactions with government officials (i.e., senior management, finance, legal, marketing, sales, real estate, corporate development, tax, audit, anyone involved in procurement and any other employees identified as dealing with government officials) receive more focused anti-corruption training, which includes training on Sony\u2019s specific policy pre-approval and due diligence requirement. This training is provided to those employees, in addition to the Code of Conduct training upon hire and at least once every two years thereafter, as well as more frequently based on risk assessments.\n  - Personnel in Sony\u2019s control functions, legal, finance, other control personnel receive live training in addition to the above, as necessary.\n\nAnti-Bribery and Corruption\n\nSony believes that corruption negatively impacts the communities and economies where we do business and that it must be eliminated to realize a sustainable, inclusive and transparent society. One of the core principles set forth in Sony Group Code of Conduct is the need to give due consideration to the impact of our business activities on the interest of our stakeholders. Sony Group Code of Conduct prohibits all types of corrupt practices. Sony has also adopted a global anti-bribery policy that contains rules and procedures designed to prevent corruption involving government officials (\"Sony Group Anti-Bribery Policy\"). All Sony Group personnel are required to read, understand and follow the Sony Group Anti-Bribery Policy and the Sony Group Code of Conduct.\nRobust Procedures & Internal Controls\n\n- Sony has implemented robust internal controls and accounting processes designed to detect and prevent violations of company policies relating to improper payment risks and to ensure accurate books and records.\n- Third parties (including intermediaries such as distributors and sub-agents) who interact with government officials on Sony\u2019s behalf, joint venture partners, parties to acquisition targets and certain investments are subject to due diligence. In accordance with the due diligence procedures specified based on risk levels including but not limited to whether the transaction involves any red flags or high risk territories that Sony specifically identifies in its policies, types of transactions and whether the transaction involves any intermediaries such as distributors and sub-agents, employees handling the transaction and professional functions such as financial department or the legal department in each company perform due diligence together as appropriate. Due diligence is performed periodically thereafter if the transaction is continuous in its nature, namely the sale of goods. Any transacting parties (including intermediaries such as distributors and sub-agents) who pose high risks must also agree to abide by applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations and Sony\u2019s anti-bribery policy.\n- Concerns are promptly investigated via the Global Network and legal department of each subsidiary. Appropriate action for the case such as disciplinary, remedial and/or corrective action is considered and implemented. Such remediation activities are monitored until completed.\n\nRisk Assessment & Updating Policy\n\n- Sony conducts periodic anti-corruption assessments and audits of its business to raise overall awareness, detect potential misconduct, and monitor compliance with anti-corruption laws and policy. Sony continues to leverage opportunities to share both knowledges and best practices across its system.*\n\nAntitrust and Competition Law Compliance\n\nSony wants to outperform the competition based on the merits of Sony\u2019s products and services, not because of unfair business practices. Sony complies with antitrust and competition laws and does its part to promote a fair and competitive marketplace. Sony has implemented the Sony Group Policy on Antitrust / Competition Law Compliance, which explains the purposes of competition laws and guides employees on compliance with such laws. Sony has also developed robust, customized training courses to raise awareness regarding competition laws and to reinforce the policy requirements. Additionally, Sony legal personnel monitor changes and developments in competition laws and maintain up-to-date controls, policies, and procedures for compliance with these laws.*\n\nEconomic Sanctions, Trade Controls, Anti-Money Laundering and Other Business Partner Due Diligence\n\nSony maintains up-to-date group-wide policies governing compliance with economic sanctions, trade controls, and anti-money laundering and other business partner due diligence laws such as the Sony Group Economic Sanctions Compliance Policy, group-wide policies on trade controls and the Sony Group Customer Due Diligence Policy. These policies identify transactions that may pose higher risks based on the regulatory landscape and Sony\u2019s business, provide necessary due diligence and pre-approval requirements, and specify training requirements in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In accordance with the due diligence procedures specified based on risk levels including but not limited to whether the transaction involves any red flags or high risk territories that Sony specifically identifies in its policies, types of transactions and whether the transaction involves any intermediaries such as distributors, employees handling the transaction and professional functions such as financial department or legal department in each company perform due diligence together as appropriate. The results of due diligence determine whether the transaction can proceed or whether it can only proceed subject to additional safeguards. Due diligence is performed periodically after the commencement of the transaction. Personnel in Sony\u2019s transaction, finance, accounting, trade controls and legal functions are required to receive training on these policies so that such personnel can perform proper due diligence of business partners.\n\nElimination of Anti-Social Forces\n\nSony strongly opposes anti-social forces that threaten to disrupt the order and safety of the community. Sony will not entertain relationships with members of anti-social forces. Furthermore, Sony will not give economic benefits to, or accept illegal demands from, any anti-social force. Sony ensures that it does not do business with members of organized crime and other anti-social forces by performing due diligence procedures on its business partners. Sony also ensures this by delivering related training to its employees.\n\nCustomer-first Business Operations\n\nSony Financial Group is in charge of Sony\u2019s financial services business and pursues business operations from a customer-oriented perspective throughout. As a financial holding company, Sony Financial Group Inc. has clarified this initiative as its customer-first business operation policy and, as subsidiaries, Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Sony Assurance Inc. and Sony Bank Inc. each go further to establish business operation policies fine-tuned to their respective activities. These policies are reviewed periodically to respond to factors such as changes in the business environment, and the progress of their initiatives is reported regularly to the respective companies\u2019 boards of directors or relevant senior managements and disclosed on their websites.\n\n\u201cCustomer-first Business Operation Policy\u201d and Relevant Initiatives\n\n- Sony Financial Group Inc.\n- Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (in Japanese)\n- Sony Assurance Inc. (in Japanese)\n- Sony Bank Inc.\n- [Customer-first Business Operation Policy] Performance of Fiscal 2021 Initiatives (in Japanese)\nPrivacy and Personal Information Management\n\nSony believes it is important to protect the personal information of Sony\u2019s customers, employees and other stakeholders and thus ensure trust.\n\nSony has entered a new digital age, where the global privacy landscape and advancements in information and communication technology are changing at a faster pace than ever before. New global privacy laws continue to emerge, raising the bar for privacy compliance across the world. Rapidly evolving cloud-based solutions and social media platforms, smartphones and other mobile devices, Big Data and transformative technologies such as AI, means Sony faces new privacy challenges and risks every day.\n\nTo be able to respond to these changes and to ensure Sony continues to earn stakeholders\u2019 trust, Sony maintains a robust global privacy program. Sony\u2019s approach to privacy continues to be grounded in a group-wide governance structure that enables the effective management of potential risks and incorporates privacy controls into business processes, systems and products to safeguard the personal information of Sony customers, employees and other stakeholders.\n\nPrivacy Governance\n\nLed by Sony Corporation\u2019s Executive Vice President responsible for Privacy, Sony has a governance structure of privacy and personal information management that covers the entire Sony Group. Sony\u2019s privacy management is governed by a set of global policies and standards, which are based on applicable laws, principles and best practices. These policies set forth Sony\u2019s group-wide commitment to privacy and define practices and procedures to be followed by Sony executives and employees to ensure appropriate handling and protection of the personal information that Sony collects, stores and/or processes. Sony routinely reviews and revises these policies and standards to address changes in the risk landscape, and the regulatory environment. Sony Corporation\u2019s Executive Vice President responsible for Privacy monitors the global implementation of and compliance with those policies.\n\nUnder the direction of Sony Corporation\u2019s Executive Vice President responsible for Privacy, Privacy Officers and legal departments responsible for privacy and personal information management at Sony Group companies work together and ensure effective implementation of policies and standards.\n\nStrong executive support for, and governance of privacy are essential. Accordingly, executives at Sony headquarter and each Sony Group company take responsibility for playing an active role in managing privacy risks within their organizations and instilling a culture that respects privacy and builds trust.\n\nSafeguarding Privacy and Personal Information\n\nSony continues to enhance protection of personal information by evaluating and addressing privacy risks through the use of a global privacy management framework that promotes the integration of privacy principles and requirements into Sony\u2019s data processing activities.\n\nTo maintain the stakeholders\u2019 trust, Sony continuously looks for ways to improve practices, implement stronger controls, and provide more robust security to protect personal information and other information entrusted to its care.\n\nEmployee Training\n\nSony believes every employee has a role to play in safeguarding privacy. To increase the education and awareness of our workforce, Sony requires all employees to receive information security and privacy training. In addition, Sony provides privacy specialist personnel with bi-annual training and awareness on new privacy requirements and hot topics, as well as occasional training and awareness through privacy working groups and group-wide projects.\nResponsible AI\n\nFramework for AI Ethics Initiatives\n\nThrough the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI), Sony aims to contribute to the development of a peaceful and sustainable society while delivering kando\u2014a sense of excitement, wonder or emotion\u2014to the world. At the same time, Sony understands that the influence of AI on society is multi-faceted and can have unintentional consequences. Sony established the Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines in September 2018 to guide all Sony officers and employees to utilize AI and/or conduct AI-related R&D in a manner that conforms with our values and emerging social norms. The guidelines were subsequently revised to align with Sony\u2019s Purpose established in January 2019 to \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.\u201d In December 2019, Sony established the Sony Group AI Ethics Committee and since that time has been strengthening its initiatives and framework for AI ethics. In 2021, the AI Ethics Office was established to provide subject matter expertise on AI ethics to all Sony business units. In addition, Sony has established a notification system for AI utilization in products, services, and internal operations in Sony Group\u2019s business units, to share information on AI ethics risks. In March 2019, Sony is currently a member of the Conference toward AI and Sociotechnical Algorithmic Systems.\n\nStakeholder Dialogue and External Collaboration\n\nSony actively pursues dialogue with relevant companies, organizations, and the academic community on ethical issues surrounding AI utilization, while considering the interests of diverse stakeholders, including customers and creators. In May 2017, Sony became the first Japanese company to join the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society (PAI), a non-profit organization created to contribute to solutions for some of humanity\u2019s challenging problems, including advancing the understanding of AI and addressing ethics surrounding AI technology. One of the most common issues in AI ethics is that of fairness, transparency, and accountability, abbreviated as \u201cFTA.\u201d Sony utilizes knowledge it has gained from its AI and robotics related research, development, and business ventures and contributes to a number of working groups addressing this issue. Sony chaired the Social and Societal Influences of AI Working Group, which focuses on the social impacts of AI, and currently serves as an expert advisor for PAI\u2019s strategic planning. Sony also serves on the steering committee for ABOUT ML*, an initiative to improve the transparency of machine learning. Sony also serves as an expert advisor to the Explainability Research Project and Diversity and Inclusion Research Project. Sony\u2019s Global Head of AI Ethics is also one of the General Chairs of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT), the premier conference on sociotechnical algorithmic systems. Sony is also involved with Japanese initiatives to establish principles and guidelines that promote the utilization of AI for social good. These initiatives include the AI Utilization Strategy published by Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) in February 2019 and the Social Principles of Human-centric AI published by Japan\u2019s Cabinet Office in March 2019. Sony is currently a member of the Conference toward AI Network Society, a group within the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications whose goal is the comprehensive study of the social, economic, ethical, and legal factors involved in the promotion of AI networks throughout society as a whole. Additionally, Sony is a participant in the Global Partnership on AI, an initiative launched in June 2020 to promote the development and utilization of AI based on human-centric principles, and serves as a member of the AI and Pandemic Response Subgroup, a working group that aids the development of responsible AI solutions for epidemics of infectious disease such as COVID-19.\n\n* ABOUT ML stands for \u201cAnnotation and Benchmarking on Understanding and Transparency of Machine Learning Lifestyles.\u201d\n\nTrusted R&D for AI\n\nSony pursues R&D for AI that is trusted and backed by solid technologies, and is engaged in technical initiatives related to AI ethics. As a solution for securing FTA, Sony equipped its AI development tool Neural Network Console with eXplainable AI (XAI) to make it easy to use. XAI is a technology that enables people to understand the logic behind AI decision-making, an area often called the \u201cblack box\u201d since it is not always immediately apparent. Sony has also released its machine learning fairness library and Responsible AI XAI source code as open source software. Additionally, Sony provided its Prediction One predictive analysis tool with the ability to visualize the predictive reasoning. In 2021, Sony also launched the AI ethics flagship within Sony AI with projects to conduct cutting-edge research on the challenges faced in the development of AI products and services, including ethical data collection and algorithmic fairness. Taking advantage of its position as a company that extends across a wide range of industries, Sony will put fair and transparent AI into practice, leveraging its global and diverse perspective.\n\nSony Group AI Ethics Guidelines [PDF: 60KB]\nSony Group\u2019s Initiatives for Responsible AI\nCorporate Governance\n\nManagement Approach\n\nMateriality Rationale\nHistorically, Sony Group Corporation has consistently focused on effective group management by evolving its governance while diversifying its businesses, the regions it serves and its capital procurement methods. Sony Group Corporation therefore sees corporate governance as the basis for management that improves corporate value over the mid- and long-term as highly important, not simply as a response to legal requirements or social trends. To realize Sony\u2019s Purpose and achieve sustainable corporate growth, Sony Group Corporation continuously strives to operate Sony effectively by maintaining objective, transparent and sound management and realizing timely and efficient decision-making.\n\nBasic Approach\nSony Group Corporation continuously strives to strengthen its corporate governance system based on the understanding that corporate governance is an essential basis to promote our management in order to fulfill the company\u2019s corporate social responsibility and increases corporate value over the mid- and long-term. To operate Sony effectively, Sony Group Corporation continues to approach its corporate governance through two basic precepts:\n\n(a) The Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), a majority of which is comprised of independent outside Directors, focuses on effective oversight of management\u2019s operation of the business and maintains a sound and transparent governance framework by utilizing the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committees; and\n\n(b) The Board determines Sony\u2019s fundamental management policies and other material matters and delegates to each of the Senior Executives that assume important roles for the management of Sony, including the Corporate Executive Officers, decision-making authority to conduct Sony\u2019s business operations broadly in line with their respective responsibilities, as defined with a view to promoting timely and efficient decision-making within Sony.\n\nStructure\nIn furtherance of these efforts, Sony Group Corporation has adopted a \u201cCompany with Three Committees\u201d corporate governance system under the Companies Act of Japan (Kaishaho) and related regulations (collectively the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d). Under such system, Sony Group Corporation has introduced its own requirements to help improve and maintain the soundness and transparency of its governance by strengthening the separation of the Directors\u2019 function from that of management, maintaining what the company believes is an appropriate Board size, which enables the members of the Board to actively contribute to discussion; and advancing the proper functioning of the statutory committees.\n\nMilestones\n1961: Issued American Depositary Receipts (ADRs); Started US-GAAP accounting\n1970: Listed on the New York Stock Exchange and disclosing quarterly earnings release\n1971: Started appointing independent directors\n1997: Introduced a new corporate executive officer system\n2003: Adopted a company with three committees system\n2005: Majority of the board became independent\n2015: Split out business units as subsidiaries\n2021: Launch of Sony Group Corporation\nCorporate Strategy, Business Strategy and Other Policies\n\nThe Board sets and determines the fundamental management policy, including the mid-term plan and annual business plan pursuant to the Charter of the Board by fully examining various the thinking of management led by the CEO, from multiple perspectives. Please refer to the pages below for Sony\u2019s Purpose & Values, the Mid-Term Corporate Strategy for Sony, the business strategy for each business segment, and the vision of Sony\u2019s founder:\n\n- About Sony\n- Corporate Strategy\n- Business Briefing\n- Vision of Founder and Approach to Sustainability\n- The Founding Prospectus\n\nFor details such as policies, approaches, plans and initiatives on sustainability, please refer to the pages below.\n\n- Approach to Sustainability\n- Environment\n- Respect for Human Rights\n- Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nGovernance Framework\n\nSony Group Corporation is governed by the Board, the members of which are elected at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders. Under the Companies Act, a \u201cCompany with Three Committees\u201d is required to have three committees: a Nominating Committee, an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee, each consisting of Directors appointed by the Board.

In determining whether to appoint or remove a member of the Compensation Committee, continuity of the Compensation Committee shall be duly taken into account. As of June 28, 2022, the Compensation Committee is comprised of three outside Directors.\n\nBasic policy regarding Director remuneration\n\nThe primary duty of Directors is to oversee management\u2019s operation of Sony, which is a global company, the following two elements have been established as the basic policy for the determination of remuneration of Directors in order to improve that oversight function. No Director remuneration is paid to those Directors who concurrently serve as Corporate Executive Officers.\n\n- Securing a talent pool of Directors possessing requisite abilities from a global perspective; and\n- Ensuring the effectiveness of the supervisory function of the Directors.\n\nBased on the above, Director remuneration shall consist of the following components. The amount of each component and its percentage of total remuneration shall be set at an appropriate level determined in accordance with the basic policy above and research conducted by a third party regarding remuneration of directors of both Japanese and non-Japanese companies.\n\n| Type of remuneration | Description |\n|----------------------|-------------|\n| Fixed remuneration   | Set at an appropriate level determined based on research conducted by a third party regarding remuneration of directors of both Japanese and non-Japanese companies with a view to the level of responsibility of the Director and maintaining competitiveness for securing talent. |\n| Remuneration linked to stock price (restricted stock) | Granted restricted stocks to further promote shared values between Directors and shareholders and incentivize Directors to develop and maintain a sound and transparent management system. Any Director to whom restricted stock is granted, in principle, may not sell or transfer the granted shares during his or her tenure. This restriction is removed on the date such Director resigns. |\n| Phantom restricted stock plan | Points determined by the Compensation Committee shall be granted to Directors every year during their term in office. Then, when they resign, the remuneration amount shall be calculated by multiplying the closing price of common stock by the individual\u2019s accumulated points. * Because Sony replaced the phantom restricted stock plan for Directors with restricted stock from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, Sony did not grant new points to Directors from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. |\n\nCompensation Committee\n\nMembers: 3 outside Directors (as of June 28, 2022)\n\n| Name          | Position                                      |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Wendy Becker  | Chair of the Compensation Committee (Outside Director) |\n| Sakie Akiyama | Compensation Committee Member (Outside Director) |\n| Yoshihiko Hatanaka | Compensation Committee Member (Outside Director) |\nBasic policy regarding Senior Executive remuneration\n\nSenior Executives are key members of management responsible for executing the operations of Sony as a whole, or of their respective businesses. In order to further improve the business results of Sony, the following two elements have been established as the basic policy for the determination of remuneration of Senior Executives:\n\n- Securing a talent pool possessing requisite abilities from a global perspective; and\n- Providing effective incentives to improve business results on a short-, medium- and long-term basis.\n\nBased on the above, Senior Executive remuneration shall primarily consist of the following components. The amount of each component and its percentage of total remuneration shall be at an appropriate level determined in accordance with the above basic policy and the individual\u2019s level of responsibility. The amount and percentage will also be based on research conducted by a third party regarding remuneration of management of both Japanese and non-Japanese companies, with an emphasis on linking Senior Executive remuneration to business results and shareholder value.\n\n| Type of remuneration | Description |\n|----------------------|-------------|\n| Fixed remuneration   | Set at an appropriate level determined based on research conducted by a third party regarding remuneration of management of both Japanese and non-Japanese companies with a view to the level of responsibility of the Senior Executive and maintaining competitiveness for securing talent. |\n| Remuneration linked to business results | Structured appropriately and based on appropriate metrics to ensure that such remuneration effectively incentivizes Senior Executives to achieve financial targets for the mid- and long-term and financial targets for the fiscal year for which compensation will be paid. Specifically, the amount to be paid to Senior Executives shall be determined based on the level of achievement of the two metrics below and can fluctuate, in principle, from 0% to 200% of the standard payment amount depending on the level of achievement. (1) Certain key performance indicators linked to the consolidated or individual business results of Sony during the fiscal year, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS (net income attributable to Sony Group Corporation\u2019s stockholders per share), which are selected based on the areas for which each Senior Executive is responsible. (2) Individual performance in the area(s) for which each Senior Executive is responsible. Efforts to accelerate value creation through collaborations among the businesses of Sony, sustainability initiatives related to social value creation and ESG (environment, social and governance) and engagement indicators based on employee surveys shall be included in the evaluation factors for individual performance. The standard payment amount shall be determined so that it is a percentage of the Senior Executive\u2019s total cash compensation (fixed remuneration plus remuneration linked to business results) that is appropriate to each individual\u2019s level of responsibility. |\n| Remuneration linked to stock price (Stock acquisition rights and restricted stock) | Stock acquisition rights and restricted stock are granted to incentivize Senior Executives to increase mid- to long-term shareholder value. In principle, one-third of the total number of exercisable stock acquisition rights will become exercisable each year after the allotment date. (All of the allocated stock acquisition rights will be exercisable after three years from the allotment date.) The Senior Executives to whom restricted stock is granted, in principle, may not sell or transfer the granted stock before the third anniversary date of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of the fiscal year when the restricted stock was granted. In principle, Senior Executives who have greater management responsibility and influence over Sony as a whole shall have a higher proportion of their remuneration linked to the stock price. (Please see below \u201cReference: Executive Compensation Package Design to Focus on Long-term Management (FY2021)\u201d). The amount of remuneration linked to the stock price shall be determined so that it is a percentage of the Senior Executive\u2019s total compensation (remuneration linked to the stock price plus total cash remuneration) that is appropriate to each individual\u2019s level of responsibility. |\n| Phantom restricted stock plan | Points determined by the Compensation Committee shall be granted to Directors every year during their term in office. Then, when they resign, the remuneration amount shall be calculated by multiplying the closing price of common stock by the individual\u2019s accumulated points. |\n\nWith respect to the remuneration linked to stock price, the Compensation Committee approved the introduction of the restricted stock units on June 30, 2022. By further utilizing the remuneration linked to stock price, including the restricted stock units, Sony aims to increase the willingness of executives/employees to contribute to the enhancement of Sony\u2019s corporate value, and thereby to increase business results of Sony. For details of the restricted stock units, please refer to the press release below.\n\n(Reference: Executive Compensation Package Design to Focus on Long-term Management (FY2021))\n\nThe bar chart below shows the components of remuneration for Corporate Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The standard payment amount is used to depict remuneration linked to business results and remuneration linked to stock price is calculated based on the fair value of stock acquisition rights and the issue price of restricted stock as of the date granted in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Accordingly, the proportion of each component based on the amount actually paid will differ from the chart below.\n\n| Type of remuneration | Description |\n|----------------------|-------------|\n| Base | Performance-linked compensation | Stock price linked compensation |\n| CEO | 13% | 13% | 74% |\n| CFO | 14% | 14% | 72% |\n| CTO | 18% | 18% | 71% |\n| Other Corporate executive officers | 27% | 16% | 57% |\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nManagement Approach\nCorporate Strategy, Business Strategy and Other Policies\nGovernance Framework\nInternal Control and Governance Framework\nRelationship with Shareholders and Other Stakeholders\nData Section\nGRI Standards Content Index\nProcedures to determine remuneration of Directors and Senior Executives\n\nThe Compensation Committee or bodies or individuals under the supervision of the Compensation Committee determine the amount and content of the compensation for each Director and Senior Executive based on the policy outlined above. In principle, each year at the meeting of the Compensation Committee held after the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders, the Compensation Committee determines the amount of basic remuneration and the content of each Director\u2019s and Corporate Executive Officer\u2019s compensation for the corresponding fiscal year. At the meeting of the Compensation Committee held after the corresponding fiscal year end, the Compensation Committee determines the final amount of compensation of each Director and Corporate Executive Officer. As for Senior Executives who are not Corporate Executive Officers, bodies or individuals under the supervision of the Compensation Committee make those determinations.\n\nFor remuneration linked to business results, the Compensation Committee determines the standard payment amount, the financial performance KPIs (including the proportion of each indicator) and the targets for individual performance for each Senior Executive. Thereafter, the Compensation Committee determines the amount of such remuneration based on the level of achievement of the financial performance KPIs and each executive\u2019s individual performance at the meeting of the Compensation Committee held after the corresponding fiscal year end for Corporate Executive Officers. Bodies or individuals under the supervision of the Compensation Committee make those determinations for Senior Executives who are not Corporate Executive Officers.\n\nThe Compensation Committee or bodies or individuals under the supervision of the Compensation Committee determined the amount of compensation of each Director and Senior Executive for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 according to the procedure described above.\n\nCorporate Executive Officer remuneration linked to business results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022\n\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, the standard payment amount for remuneration linked to business results for Corporate Executive Officers was determined to be between 60% and 100% of the amount of their fixed remuneration depending on their level of responsibility. The financial performance KPIs and the weighting of such financial performance KPIs primarily used for Corporate Executive Officers in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 were as follows:\n\n| KPI | Weight | Target to be achieved for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (Consolidated) | Result for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (Consolidated) |\n|-----|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA*1 | 50% | Amount determined in order to achieve the Adjusted EBITDA (defined below) target of 4.3 trillion yen for the three-year period from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 | 1,597.9 billion yen*3 |\n| Adjusted EPS*2 | 50% | 523.2 yen | 640.2 yen*3 |\n\n*1 Standard payment amount was determined to be between 60% to 100% of the amount of fixed remuneration of each Corporate Executive Officer.\n\n*2 Payment rate of remuneration linked to business results was determined, in principle, to be between 0% to 200% based on the achievement of (i) financial performance KPIs for the area(s) for which each Corporate Executive Officer is responsible and (ii) individual performance in the area(s) for which each Corporate Executive Officer is responsible.\n\nThe financial performance KPIs and the weighting of such financial performance KPIs primarily used for Corporate Executive Officers in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 were as follows:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is the most important financial performance KPI under the fourth mid-range plan, was selected as a Financial Performance KPI to enhance the growth potential of the entire Sony Group under the fourth mid-range plan. Adjusted EPS was selected to incentivize awareness of shareholder value and capital efficiency. The Compensation Committee determined a target for Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 that was meant to incentivize management to achieve the 4.3 trillion yen for the three-year period from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The target for Adjusted EPS for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 was 523.2 yen, which was obtained by dividing the forecast of net income attributable to Sony Group Corporation\u2019s stockholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, which was disclosed in April, 2021 (660 billion yen) by the number of diluted shares outstanding at the beginning of such fiscal year. The results for the Financial Performance KPIs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 were as follows: Adjusted EBITDA: 1,597.9 billion yen (while net income attributable to Sony Group Corporation\u2019s stockholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 was 882.2 billion yen*4, and Adjusted EPS: 640.2 yen*3, each exceeding the targeted amount.\n\nAs outlined above, including the formula, the remuneration linked to business results for Corporate Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 was determined based on the level of achievement of the financial performance KPIs and the individual performance for which those Corporate Executive Officers were responsible. Consequently, the range of potential payment was determined to be, in principle, between 0% and 200% of the standard payment amount. As a result, the ratio of remuneration linked to business results of Corporate Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 varied from 167.8% to 178.5% of the Business Results Linked Standard Payment Amount.\nSupport for Activities of Directors, the Board and the Committees\n\nSony Group Corporation engages in various activities to enhance the oversight function of the Board over management\u2019s operation of Sony\u2019s business as follows:\n\nOutside Director Initiatives\n\nThe Chairman of the Board is elected from among those Directors other than the Representative Corporate Executive Officer, and the Chairman leads the Board activities and secures the appropriate cooperation, communication and arrangement among outside Directors and Senior Executives.

The Board also conducted Directors\u2019 corporate strategic workshops with management and meetings of the Chairman and the CEO. All these activities were aimed at securing better understanding by outside Directors of Sony\u2019s business and management\u2019s initiatives and encouraging corporate strategic discussions among Directors.\n\nSecretariat Offices for the Board and each Committee\n\nThe company has established the secretariat offices of the Board and each Committee to support the activities of the members and encourage constructive and proactive discussion at the meetings of the Board and each Committee.

Also, each secretariat office verifies appropriately whether requested information is provided smoothly. In the event that the members consult with external specialists, participate in various seminars and so on to perform their duties, the costs and expenses in connection with such activities are borne by the company in accordance with applicable internal rules.\n\nThe Audit Committee Aide\nWith the approval of the Board and with the consent by the Audit Committee, the company has established the Audit Committee Aide to support the activities of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee Aide does not concurrently hold positions related to the business operations of Sony and, upon instruction by each Audit Committee member, conducts investigations into and analyses of auditing matters and engages in physical inspections or visiting audits either by him/herself or by cooperating with relevant departments in order to support the Audit Committee.\n\nPolicy for training Directors\nNewly appointed Directors receive briefings by Senior Executives and outside experts regarding their expected roles and responsibilities, including their legal duties, as a Director or a member of the Committees. In addition, newly appointed outside Directors receive briefings about the business, financial status, organization and governance structure of Sony. Also, throughout their tenure, each Director receives compliance-related training in accordance with internal protocols and briefings on matters relevant to each Director\u2019s fulfillment of his/her roles and responsibilities including the current status of Sony\u2019s business.\n\nEvaluation of the Board and the Committees\u2019 Effectiveness\nPolicy for Evaluation\nSony Group Corporation believes that it is important to endeavor to improve the effectiveness of the Board and each Committee in order to support Sony\u2019s business operations and enhance the corporate value of Sony. To achieve this goal, Sony Group Corporation conducts evaluations of the effectiveness of the Board and of each Committee (the \u201cEvaluation\u201d) at least annually.\n\nRecent Evaluation\nFrom February through May 2022, under the leadership of the Chairman of the Board, the Board conducted the Evaluation mainly in respect of Board and Committee activities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 after confirming that actions proposed in response to the results of the previous Evaluation were appropriately taken.

The Board confirmed the effectiveness of the Board and the Committees.\n\nSummary of the Results of the Recent Evaluation\nThe Outside Counsel reported that the Board is established and operated in a manner sufficient to be highly regarded, based on various points, including the self-evaluation results of the Directors and the comparison with benchmarked companies in Japan, the United States and Europe. Following discussion and analysis based on the Outside Counsel\u2019s report, the Board re-affirmed that the Board and each Committee were functioning effectively as of May 2022. The Outside Counsel also provided examples of potential options, based on other companies\u2019 practices, to help further improve effectiveness of the Board and the Committees. The examples include conducting mutual evaluation among Directors (peer review), enhancing the involvement by the Board in sustainability and risk management, and conducting deeper discussion regarding Board succession at Board meetings.\n\nActions in response to the Results of the Evaluation\nIn order to further increase corporate value of Sony, Sony Group Corporation will take appropriate actions to further enhance functions of the Board and the Committees in response to the results of the Evaluation, as well as various comments and opinions given by Directors and the Outside Counsel during the Evaluation process.

These determinations were required by and met the requirements of the Companies Act of Japan. For the content of the reaffirmation and the status of its implementation determined by the resolution of the Board dated as of May 10, 2012, please refer to the page below.\n\nBoard of Directors\u2019 Determination Regarding Internal Control and Governance Framework Pursuant to the Japanese Companies Act and Status for Implementing the Internal Control and Governance Framework\n\nAs for the summary of the principal frameworks of the internal control and governance framework based on the Board determination above, please refer to each page below.\n\nFinancial Reporting Framework\n\nSony\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with Internal Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Sony formed a cross-functional steering committee comprised of management in charge of the principal Sony headquarters functions to monitor the actions necessary to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, including documenting, testing and evaluating internal controls and overseeing and assessing the global evaluation. Based on the evaluation by Sony Group Corporation, CEO and CFO have concluded that Sony maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022.\n\nDisclosure Framework\n\nThe securities of Sony Group Corporation, the ultimate parent of all Sony companies, are listed for trading on exchanges in Japan and the U.S. As a result, Sony is obligated to make various disclosures to the public in accordance with applicable securities laws, regulations and rules in those countries and listing standards of the stock exchanges on which Sony Group Corporation\u2019s shares are listed. Sony is committed to full compliance with all requirements applicable to its public disclosures. Sony Group Corporation\u2019s policy on investor relations activities is to aim to disclose accurate information in a timely and fair manner, as well as to endeavor to promote constructive dialogue with shareholders and investors, with a view to maximizing Sony\u2019s corporate value by building a relationship of trust with shareholders and investors. Sony Group Corporation has established disclosure controls and procedures as an approach to implement this policy. All personnel responsible for the preparation of submissions to and filings with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory entities, or for other public communications made on behalf of Sony, or who provide information as part of that process, have a responsibility to ensure that such disclosures and information are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable, and in compliance with the established disclosure controls and procedures. Sony Group Corporation has established \u201cDisclosure Controls and Procedures,\u201d outlining the process through which potentially material information is reported from important business units, subsidiaries, affiliated companies and corporate divisions and is reviewed and considered for disclosure in light of its materiality to Sony. As a body to assist the CEO and the CFO of Sony Group Corporation, in designing, implementing and evaluating the Disclosure Controls and Procedures, Sony Group Corporation has established the \u201cDisclosure Committee,\u201d which is comprised of members of senior management of Sony who are in charge of a part of Sony\u2019s headquarters functions. In order to assure appropriate and timely disclosure, the Disclosure Committee shall evaluate events that are reported from the important business units, subsidiaries, affiliated companies and corporate divisions in accordance with Sony\u2019s internal rules in light of their materiality to Sony. Based on such evaluation, the Disclosure Committee shall review the necessity of disclosure in accordance with applicable securities laws, regulations and rules, as well as the listing standards of the relevant stock exchanges, and report to the CEO and the CFO for their determination.\n\nRisk Management System Framework\n\nEach business unit, subsidiary / affiliated company and corporate division of Sony periodically reviews and assesses risks for the area of which it is in charge and works on finding, reporting, assessing and responding to the risks. In addition, Senior Executives including Corporate Executive Officers, of Sony Group Corporation have established and maintain a system to identify and control risks that may cause losses to Sony Group regarding the areas of which they are in charge. The Corporate Executive Officer in charge of group risk control comprehensively promotes and manages the establishment and maintenance of the system stated above through the activities with related departments. Examples of risks that may significantly impact investor judgements include reduced market relevance and profitability due to intensifying competition from competitors; newly incurred costs to comply with laws and regulations in countries and regions where Sony operates; impact on global operations due to trade restrictions and economic sanctions imposed by certain countries and retaliatory measures to them; impairment of long-lived assets; and changes in consumption behavior caused by the increasing prevalence of new technologies and distribution platforms.\nCrisis Management System Framework\n\nOne aspect of risk management is the proper handling of crises if and when they arise, and the proper preparation for such crises. Sony Group\u2019s crisis management and business continuity activities predominately occur at the business and operational level closest to the events Sony Group may encounter. Since some events can have a significant impact on the entire Sony as a whole, Sony Group Corporation has established a group crisis management procedure to enable a swift and organized group-wide response to crises as needed.\n\nFramework on Business Continuity Planning\n\nSony has strengthened its business continuity planning (BCP) to enhance risk management throughout the supply chain. The group identifies, analyzes, and evaluates business risks in order to mitigate the risk of business disruptions due to emergencies such as earthquakes, natural disasters, and accidents. Sony\u2019s electronics business struggled to cope with the impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake and severe flooding in Thailand in 2011, and with the impact of the earthquakes in the Kumamoto region of Japan in 2016. Nevertheless, Sony\u2019s employees and top management rallied together, capitalizing on their experiences in implementing measures to ensure business continuity, and succeeded in minimizing the impact of production disruptions. Knowledge gained from recovery efforts after the Kumamoto earthquakes was shared with relevant companies and local firms through industry bodies, to enhance the competitiveness of Japanese industry and strengthen supply chains. Utilizing lessons learned to date, Sony pursues ongoing initiatives to reduce business disruption risks at its business sites, from the perspectives of disaster prevention, disaster mitigation, and business continuity.\n\nSony Group Corporation has established a group-wide crisis management and business continuity framework for reviewing crisis management and BCP at each of its businesses and preparing for incidents and business disruptions that would significantly impact the entire Sony Group. In order to boost the effectiveness of Sony\u2019s business continuity planning, top management and Headquarters organizations carry out exercises based on scenarios such as natural disasters posited by the Japanese government.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sony has established a group crisis management system, placing the highest priority on ensuring the safety of employees and others and preventing the spread of the virus, as well as taking swift action to minimize the impact on Sony businesses. For example, Sony has shipped and supplied more than 1.2 million face masks to Sony group companies in Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, and supplied Sony group companies in India with medical equipment. Sony is securing business continuity through global coordination while implementing measures in accordance with internal guidelines, and preparing emergency supplies. Additionally, Sony establishes and manages crisis management and business continuity plans to minimize the impacts of business interruptions. To increase the effectiveness of these efforts, Sony is strengthening its business continuity and enhancing rapid recovery through coordination between the relevant companies and organizations and by conducting realistic exercises. Sony recognizes the importance of BCP to its business strategy. Taking into account its experience with large-scale emergencies, Sony will continue to implement effective, practical measures, such as enhancing risk management across its group-wide supply chains.\n\nMain Initiatives for Reducing Business Disruption Risks for Building and Equipment\n\nCountermeasures against Earthquake\n\nUtilizing lessons learned from the Kumamoto earthquakes, Sony has established guidelines for seismic measures for Sony group companies in Japan. These measures, which are essential to the safety of employees, are established by determining the seismic wave activity at each business site and conducting simulations to assess risk. The seismic measures apply to building structures and utility facilities as well as non-structural materials such as ceiling materials, to enhance safety in an earthquake. Sony has completed the implementation of particularly high-priority safety measures.\n\nCountermeasures against Fire\n\nThe Sony Group has global guidelines to facilitate early fire detection and protection against the spread of fire in buildings and equipment. These guidelines are stricter than the regulatory requirements in Japan. Under the guidelines, Sony\u2019s manufacturing sites around the world implement annual self-checks and are regularly audited on-site by the HQ Facility Management Office to verify compliance with them. Manufacturing sites implement Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycles to address any uncovered issues and establish improvement plans to effectively reduce risks.\n\nCountermeasures against Flood-related Damage\n\nFlood-related damage is on the rise due to the impacts of climate change. Sony surveys the flood risk at its business sites, which in turn implement preventative measures to mitigate damages in the event of a flood and ensure operations can be rapidly restored.\n\nCase Example for Reducing Business Disruption Risks\n\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Site: Seismic Isolation Structure and Initiatives to Reduce Fire Risks\n\nThe Nagasaki Technology Center of Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation became the first manufacturing site of the Sony Group to adopt a seismic isolation structure. This is being incorporated in its expansion building, which will be completed in stages from 2021 onwards. The seismic isolation system employs a hybrid seismic isolation structure with multiple base isolation devices to mitigate earthquake motion, and micro-vibration control that is essential for a semiconductor plant. The expansion building is compliant with the Sony Group\u2019s global guidelines on building and equipment specifications, to reduce fire risk. For example, the building features an NFPA* compliant high-sensitivity smoke detection system and sprinklers, non-flammable exterior walls and exhaust ducts, and fire barrier walls between distribution transformers, for early fire detection and protection against the spread of fire.\n\n* The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) is a US-based organization that develops standards for fire prevention.\n\nHybrid seismic isolation structure\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Site: Deployment of Earthquake Motion Prediction System\n\nIn 2018, Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation completed the deployment of an earthquake motion detection system for its main business sites. The system detects initial P waves (primary waves) from earthquakes and uses the data to predict the magnitude of subsequent S waves (secondary waves). If necessary, critical semiconductor manufacturing equipment is shut down before S waves reach the site, protecting equipment and products. Since the system can also predict epicentral earthquakes, a network of Sony\u2019s business sites and its peripheral observation points is operated to improve response times and enhance prediction accuracy.\n\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Site: Initiatives against Flood Damage\n\nSony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation carries out disaster impact assessments for each of its manufacturing sites, based on simulations etc. of assumed risks of flood damage. It is gradually deploying measures such as the installation of water stops to mitigate damage at critical facilities.\n\nInformation Security\n\nLike many companies, Sony faces increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats, so the importance of information security continues to grow. In recent years, malicious actors seeking to compromise the information of global companies continue to grow in number, and their attack methods are becoming more advanced. To address this situation and ensure that Sony continues to earn customers\u2019 trust, Sony maintains and enhances a robust information security program. Led by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Sony\u2019s information security program is grounded in a company-wide governance structure. Sony manages potential risks effectively, incorporates security controls into systems and products to safeguard information, trains officers, employees and business partners to understand how their actions can introduce information security risk, and deploys 24/7 monitoring and response capabilities to swiftly address attacks.\n\nInformation Security Governance\n\nSony\u2019s information security program is governed by a set of global policies and standards based on internationally accepted industry best practices. These policies set forth Sony\u2019s commitment to information security and define practices and procedures to be followed by Sony executives and employees to help protect information resources and information systems from unauthorized access, leakage, falsification, loss, destruction, and other security risks. Sony routinely reviews and revises these policies and standards to address changes in the risk landscape, threats, and the regulatory environment. The CISO monitors the global implementation of and compliance with these policies. The CISO\u2019s office coordinates with the executive information security officers (EISOs) responsible for information security at Sony group companies to create a group-wide information security management system. These officers ensure effective implementation of policies and standards.\n\nStrong Board of Directors and executive support for, and governance of, information security is essential. The Board of Directors and Senior Executives of Sony Group Corporation are regularly informed of cybersecurity risk and information security program activities. The Directors of Sony Group Corporation in charge of information security review information security activities frequently, and the CISO briefs the full Board of Directors regularly on the activities. Senior Executives of Sony Group Corporation and senior managements of respective group companies also review security activities regularly and play an active role in managing risks within their respective organizations and work to instill a culture of security awareness in all employees. Sony group companies have set up information security management committees to fulfill this responsibility.\n\nEmployee Training as a Key Component of Information Security\n\nEvery employee has a critical role to play in protecting Sony\u2019s most sensitive information. To increase Sony employees\u2019 awareness of information security threats, Sony requires all personnel to receive annual information security training, where they learn how to report incidents and study the types of behaviors they must avoid in order to reduce risk. Sony employees also regularly receive phishing awareness training, which tests employees\u2019 knowledge of how to spot and avoid cyber-attacks delivered through fraudulent emails.\n\nMonitoring and Response Measures\n\nSony has a 24/7 global security operations center equipped with advanced technical capabilities to prevent and manage information security incidents. Sony\u2019s incident response team defends the company\u2019s information infrastructure by using threat intelligence and analysis, monitoring and detection of malicious activity, rapid response and containment, and sophisticated forensics capabilities.\n\nStrengthening Measures Against New Threats\n\nSony is committed to safeguarding the trust of customers, employees against threat regarding information security and business partners. Sony continuously looks for ways to improve practices, implement stronger controls, and provide more robust security against new threats, all in order to protect the personal data information entrusted to its care. To do this, Sony employs and invests in a workforce of information security professionals and subject matter experts.\nInternal audit structure and status\n\nSony Group Corporation established a department in charge of internal audit, the Risk & Control Department (which is composed of approximately thirty members), which coordinates closely with the internal audit departments of major subsidiaries around the world, and Sony Group Internal Audit Charter, and endeavors to maintain and enhance the internal audit structure of Sony in order to promote Sony\u2019s internal audit activities on a global basis. The Risk & Control Department and each internal audit department of major subsidiaries of Sony (\u201cInternal Audit Department\u201d) play an important function in maintaining Sony\u2019s governance in order to strengthen Sony\u2019s management structure, promote efficiency of management, and maintain and avoid any loss of material assets, including Sony\u2019s brand image, by evaluating the effectiveness of the internal control system and risk management structure of Sony through independent and objective audit.\n\nThe Risk & Control Department and each Internal Audit Department conduct the internal audit of each department or subsidiary that they supervise, in accordance with the annual audit plan that is established based on the risk assessments conducted in the beginning of each fiscal year and any matters proposed by Sony\u2019s management or the Audit Committee. Each internal audit is conducted under the planned audit procedure. Afterward, each Internal Audit Department follows up until the completion of any improvement plan developed based on the audit result.\n\nIn order to ensure its independence, fairness and objectiveness, the appointment and dismissal of the head of the Risk & Control Department is subject to the prior approval of the Audit Committee. The appointment and dismissal of the person in charge of each Internal Audit Department also require the prior approval of the head of the Risk & Control Department.\n\nThe Risk & Control Department makes periodic presentations on the result of internal audit to the Audit Committee, and the Corporate Executive Officer in charge of internal audit. The Risk & Control Department also make periodic reports to the independent auditor on the status of the internal audit activities and the result of the audit. The audit report issued by the independent auditor is used for the planning of the internal audit and conducting the internal audit.\n\nAccounting audit status\n\nSony\u2019s accounting audit has been conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata LLC under an agreement since 2007. The certified public accountants who conducted the accounting audit of Sony for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, are as follows: Hitoshi Kiuchi*, Takeaki Ishibashi*, Yuko Harada and Kenichi Shishido*. The team at PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata LLC that conducted Sony\u2019s accounting audit is composed of 98 certified public accountants, 87 assistant certified public accountants and 312 other staff members.\n\n* The number of years of continuous audit-related work is not stated because it is within 7 years.\nPolicy and Governance Framework on Tax Strategy\n\nTax Policy\nSony conducts its business, including managing its tax obligations, honestly, ethically and with integrity. Sony Group Code of Conduct defines that it is Sony\u2019s policy to comply with all applicable tax laws and regulations of each country and region where Sony conducts business as well as the common rules and guidance regarding international taxation. Sony understands and complies with both the spirit and letter of the laws and regulations that apply to their businesses.\n\nGovernance Structure\nBased on the above global tax policy, each Sony group company has the responsibility to understand and comply with tax laws and regulations applicable to its businesses, with support from Sony\u2019s Global Tax Office (the GTO), which is in charge of Sony\u2019s overall tax position. The global head of the GTO as Sony Group Corporation\u2019s Senior Vice President in charge of Global Tax reports directly to Sony Group Corporation\u2019s Chief Financial Officer based in Japan, who is a board member. Significant tax events are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nGTO Report Line\n\nChief Financial Officer, Sony Group Corporation\n\nGlobal Head of Global Tax Office, Senior Vice President in charge of Global Tax, Sony Group Corporation\n\nNew York / Los Angeles\nLondon\nSingapore\nTokyo\n\nThe GTO has implemented a series of processes and controls to identify, manage and report tax risk appropriately. These include regular updates with Finance teams; documented review processes; regular training for staff involved in tax return preparation and review; and regular updates with the global head of the GTO.\n\nTransactional taxes such as VAT and sales taxes, Customs Duty, Employment Taxes and others are the ultimate responsibility of the relevant divisional Finance Director for each business. The GTO has strong links with these divisional Finance Directors to ensure that in the event of material risks being identified or errors made, the GTO provides support including where necessary liaising with the relevant tax authority.\n\nApproach to Tax Planning\nSony operates diverse businesses within a complex global environment, in which tax is an important factor. Sony believes in taking a principled and responsible approach to managing its tax affairs, in line with business objectives and operations. Sony does not engage in transactions where the sole aim is to achieve tax avoidance or profit shifting which are against the spirit of tax laws. The tax function provides appropriate input as part of the approval process for business proposals to ensure the tax consequences are clearly understood. Sony is committed to fulfilling its obligation both to comply with applicable tax laws and to safeguard Sony\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe jurisdictions in which Sony does business may offer various tax incentives such as enhanced deductions, credits and exemptions for certain types of income and expense to meet local policy objectives such as encouraging inward investment. Sony Group Corporation believes it has a duty to its shareholders to take advantage of such incentives where they are generally available to all taxpayers who meet the relevant criteria and the requirements to claim the incentive do not conflict with broader business objectives.\n\nTax Risks\nSony employs diligent professional care and judgement in assessing tax risk, and may take advice from third-party specialists and where appropriate consult with or obtain rulings from relevant tax authorities to support the decision-making process. However, tax law is not always clear and unambiguous, and differences in interpretation can arise. Sony monitors its tax positions closely and will not record an accounting benefit unless it determines based on consideration of the facts and the law that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained.\n\nDeals with Tax Authorities\nSony seeks to maintain good professional relationships with tax authorities. When providing responses to Tax Authority questions, all responses are based on an honest and accurate representation of the facts as Sony understands them.\n\nTransparency\nSony Group Corporation prepares and files annually a country by country report in accordance with Japanese law and prepares and files a transfer pricing master file in accordance with the laws of the countries where Sony does businesses.\nRelationship with Shareholders and Other Stakeholders\n\nSony\u2019s core corporate responsibility to society is to strive to enhance its corporate value through innovation and sound business practice. Sony recognizes that its business activities have direct and indirect impact on the societies in which Sony operates, and therefore sound business practice requires that Sony\u2019s business decisions give due consideration to the interests of Sony\u2019s stakeholders including shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, business partners, local communities and other organizations. Sony Group\u2019s officers and employees must endeavor to conduct the business of Sony accordingly.\n\nPolicy for Constructive Dialogue with Shareholders\n\nSony Group Corporation\u2019s policy on investor relations is to make public disclosures which are timely and fair, accurate and easily understandable, and provide a comprehensive picture, with the goal of maximizing enterprise value of Sony Group Corporation by building a relationship of trust with shareholders and investors. Pursuant to this policy, the Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) appoints the CFO as the Corporate Executive Officer in charge of IR activities. Under the CFO\u2019s supervision, the department in charge of IR (\u201cIR Department\u201d) works to promote constructive dialogue with Sony Group Corporation\u2019s shareholders and investors. As a part of these efforts, the IR Department engages in various activities to enhance the manner and frequency of dialogue with shareholders and investors. These go beyond one-on-one meetings to include investor briefings, corporate strategy meetings and business unit briefings. The IR Department also coordinates internally to gather information to be disclosed in advance with other relevant departments, such as legal department, and outside experts, as appropriate.

If it is determined that investments do not meet these criteria, Sony Group Corporation and its subsidiaries will avoid or reduce exposure to such holdings.\n\nPolicy regarding shareholdings of listed companies\n\nShareholding policy\n\nSony Group Corporation and its subsidiaries decide whether to acquire or continue to hold shares of listed companies (excluding the acquisition and holding of shares by Sony Group Corporation\u2019s listed subsidiaries, and Sony Group Corporation\u2019s shareholding in its own listed subsidiaries) based on an appropriate examination of each investment, and choose to engage in such shareholding only if it is judged to meet Sony\u2019s business purposes and to have sufficient economic rationale. If it is determined that investments do not meet these criteria, Sony Group Corporation and its subsidiaries will avoid or reduce exposure to such holdings.\n\nAssessment of rationale for shareholding\n\nIn all cases where Sony Group Corporation and its subsidiaries hold shares in listed companies (excluding shares held by Sony Group Corporation\u2019s listed subsidiaries, and Sony Group Corporation\u2019s shareholdings in its own listed subsidiaries) for reasons other than for the sole purpose of investment, Sony Group Corporation carries out a timely review to assess the rationale for shareholding, the importance of Sony\u2019s business relationship with each company whose shares it holds (taking into account the progress of, and outlook for, any anticipated business collaboration between Sony and said company), and any anticipated positive impact of such shareholdings on Sony\u2019s business relationship with the company. In addition, Sony Group Corporation also assesses the appropriateness of these shareholdings by considering the potential of each investment to contribute to mid- and long-term value creation in Sony, via an assessment of expected return on investment and cost of capital. These evaluations are first carried out on the management side, after which the Board, which is responsible for overseeing business operation, carries out its own assessment based on the result of the evaluations by the management side.\n\nDetails of the assessment carried out by the Board of Directors\n\nBased on the above policy, at the Board meeting held on June 28, 2022, Sony Group Corporation carried out an assessment of the rationale for its and its subsidiaries\u2019 shareholdings in listed companies (excluding shares held by Sony Group Corporation\u2019s listed subsidiaries, and Sony\u2019s shareholdings in its own listed subsidiaries) as of March 31, 2022. As a result of the assessment, it was determined that Sony should consider reducing its exposure to certain holdings, which were concluded to be reduced in such review.\n\nPolicy for exercising voting rights\n\nSony Group Corporation believes in the importance of enhancing the corporate value of the listed companies whose shares it holds, and Sony Group Corporation\u2019s own corporate value in turn, through the exercise of its voting rights. Accordingly, Sony aims to exercise its voting rights with the intention of increasing each company\u2019s mid- to long-term corporate value, after a comprehensive consideration of both the significance and economic rationale of its shareholdings, and the details of proposals. For example, Sony Group Corporation has established internal rules determining what factors should be taken into account when considering proposals about matters such as the appropriation of retained earnings, the appointment of directors, statutory auditors and accounting auditors, as well as shareholder proposals. Through these rules, Sony Group Corporation makes appropriate decisions regarding the exercise of its voting rights.\n\nBusiness relations with companies who invest in Sony Group Corporation\n\nShould a company who holds shares of Sony Group Corporation\u2019s stock express the intention to sell such shares, Sony Group Corporation will not attempt to obstruct such sale by threatening to limit business transactions with said company, and will not engage in any transactions that would harm the common interests of the company or its shareholders.\n\nAnti-Hostile-Takeover Measures\n\nSony Group Corporation has not adopted any anti-hostile takeover measures.

Furthermore, Sony Group Corporation requires its Directors and officers to obtain approval of the Board in connection with transactions between Sony Group Corporation and the Director or officer in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the Board Charter and any other applicable internal rules. The Board is expected to approve any such related-party transactions only after appropriate examination of the size and nature of the transaction, the requirements of applicable laws and regulations, the Board Charter and any other applicable internal rules, and concluding that the interests of Sony Group Corporation and its shareholders are not adversely affected.\n\nPolicy for Shareholder Returns\n\nSony Group Corporation believes that continuously increasing corporate value and providing dividends are essential to rewarding shareholders. It is the policy of Sony Group Corporation to utilize retained earnings, after ensuring the perpetuation of stable dividends, to carry out various investments that contribute to an increase in corporate value, such as those that ensure future growth and strengthen competitiveness. Going forward, Sony Group Corporation will determine the amount of dividends based on an overall consideration of its consolidated operating results, financial condition and future business expectations.\n\nRoles of Corporate Pension Funds as Asset Owners\n\nSony Group Corporation owns, as a domestic corporate pension plan, a closed-end defined-benefit corporate pension (the \u201cPension Plan\u201d). The Pension Plan manages its assets in line with its Basic Pension Plan Management Policy (the \u201cBasic Management Policy\u201d) which was set to secure beneficiaries\u2019 right of benefit and to increase the benefit. In order to realize prudential and appropriate asset management structure in the Pension Plan, Sony Group Corporation appoints asset management director of the Pension Plan who should have proper knowledge and skills, based on the nomination by Senior General Manager of Sony Group Corporation\u2019s Finance Department, and external advisor to supplement their specialties in asset management.

Estimates have been used, however, at some sites where the impact on overall results is deemed to be extremely minor.\n\nScope of Data Collection\n\n- Site data\n  All ISO 14001-certified sites as of March 31, 2022. Among Sony Group consolidated sites, all manufacturing sites, distribution sites with 100 or more employees, and non-manufacturing sites with 1,000 or more employees are, in principle, expected to obtain ISO 14001 certification.\n\n- Product data\n  Data covers all products manufactured by the Sony Group and sold outside the Group. Accessories, semi-manufactured products and components are included. Weight data includes the weight of packaging materials.\n\nData Accuracy\n\n- Site data\n  Chemical substance data and environmental cost data collected from certain sites may be slightly less accurate than other data.\n\n- Product Data\n  Data for some semi-manufactured products, components, and some products produced and sold overseas may be slightly less accurate than other data.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Related Data Collection Methods and Rationale\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions from Sites\n\nCalculated based on energy-related emissions (power, heat, and fuel usage) and non energy-related emissions (used for manufacturing processes, facilities) from sites.\n\n- CO\u2082 emissions from energy consumption (energy-related)\n  CO\u2082 emissions from energy consumption are calculated by multiplying the quantity of electrical power, heat and fuel (including fuel for motor vehicles, etc.) used at sites by the CO\u2082 conversion rate. For energy consumption using renewable energy including certificates, the CO\u2082 conversion rate is zero.\n\n- Emissions of PFCs and other greenhouse gases (non energy-related)\n  Emissions of PFCs and other greenhouse gases are converted to CO\u2082 by multiplying greenhouse gas emissions from each site by global warming potentials. Global warming potentials are based on the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n- CO\u2082 conversion rates\n  [Electricity]\n  Japan: Latest rate published each year by contracted power companies. Outside Japan: Latest rate published each year by contracted power companies or that for the relevant country/region.\n\n  [Fuel and Heat]\n  Worldwide: Rates based on Japan\u2019s Law concerning the Promotion of the Measures to cope with Global Warming\n\nRenewable Electricity Rate\n\nRenewable energy includes using electrical power generated from renewable energy sources, purchasing electrical power produced from renewable energy sources, and purchasing renewable energy certificates and other carbon offset credits. Renewable electricity rates are calculated by the following equation.\n\nRenewable electricity rate = renewable electricity consumption \u00f7 total consumption of sites \u00d7 100\n\nTotal CO\u2082 Emissions from Product Use\n\nCO\u2082 emissions from product use are calculated by multiplying the quantity of estimated electrical power consumed throughout the lifetime of products sold in the current fiscal year by the CO\u2082 conversion rates. (In other words, it is not the actual quantity of CO\u2082 emitted in the current fiscal year.) CO\u2082 emissions from product use are calculated by the following equation.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total CO\u2082 Emissions from Product Use} = \\text{Sales} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Operating power consumption} \\times \\text{hours of operation per year}}{\\text{Years of use}} + \\frac{\\text{Power consumption during standby} \\times \\text{standby time per year}}{\\text{CO\u2082 conversion rates}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nIn theory, CO\u2082 emissions during product use in the current fiscal year should be calculated from the total quantity of electrical power consumed by previously sold Sony products that are still in use by consumers in the current fiscal year. However, given the difficulty of determining how many previously sold Sony products are still in use by consumers of the total number of Sony products sold to date, Sony uses the estimated total quantity of electrical power consumed while in use over the lifetime of Sony products sold in the current fiscal year to calculate CO\u2082 emissions during use.\n\nThe hours of operation per year, standby time per year, and years of product use are calculated based on data obtained by various surveys. In Japan, Sony uses the latest CO\u2082 conversion rate provided by the Electric Power Council for a Low Carbon Society. Outside of Japan, it uses country or region-specific CO\u2082 conversion rates provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nCO\u2082 Emissions from Logistics\n\nTotal CO\u2082 emissions from logistics include emissions arising from international logistics and logistics within regions such as Japan, the United States, Europe, and Asia associated with Sony Group\u2019s electronics products. For logistics within Japan, CO\u2082 emissions from parts logistics are partially included. CO\u2082 emissions from logistics are primarily calculated by multiplying ton-kilometers transported (weight of goods transported x distance traveled) by the CO\u2082 conversion rate. In certain instances, CO\u2082 emissions arising from transport by truck are calculated by multiplying the amount of fuel used (fuel consumption per kilometer x number of kilometers traveled) by the CO\u2082 conversion rate. For international transport by ship, the calculation uses the weight of goods transported including the weight of shipping containers. For international transport, the CO\u2082 conversion rate used to calculate CO\u2082 emissions is based on the emissions intensity supplied by the GHG Protocol. For regional transport, priority is given to using the rate supplied by the region or country. For Japanese domestic transport by truck, CO\u2082 emissions calculations multiply the weight of freight transported by two factors: the amount of fuel used per unit of freight transported, as defined in the Law concerning the Rational Use of Energy, and the emissions factor of fuel type used, as defined by the Law concerning the Promotion of Measures to Cope with Global Warming. For transport in the United States, Sony uses the emissions rate supplied by the SmartWay Transport Partnership, which is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nCO\u2082 Emissions from Employee Business Trips\n\nEmissions are calculated for business trips undertaken by employees in central departments, which account for the largest share of business trips taken by employees of Sony Group Corporation and Sony Group Electronics Business companies in Japan, Europe and North America and for business trips taken by employees from some electronics-related companies in Asia (In the case of Japan and North America, some music-related companies are included). CO\u2082 emissions are calculated by multiplying the distance traveled by the number of employees traveling using the basic unit of output by class type proposed by the GHG Protocol.\n\nCO\u2082 Emissions from Capital Goods\n\nThe total CO\u2082 emissions associated with the production of capital goods invested in by the Sony Group. This is calculated by multiplying the amount invested in facilities, etc., by emissions per price of capital goods supplied by the Ministry of the Environment (Japan).\n\nOverview of Calculation for Scope 3 Emissions\n\n| Category | Overview of Calculation |\n|----------|-------------------------|\n| Category 1 | Purchased goods and services |\n| Category 2 | Capital goods |\n| Category 3 | Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in scope 1 or scope 2) |\n| Category 4 | Upstream transportation and distribution |\n| Category 5 | Waste generated in operations |\n| Category 6 | Business travel |\n| Category 7 | Employee commuting |\n| Category 8 | Upstream leased assets |\n| Category 9 | Downstream transportation and distribution |\n| Category 10 | Processing of sold products |\n| Category 11 | Use of sold products |\n| Category 12 | End-of-life treatment of sold products |\n| Category 13 | Downstream leased assets |\n| Category 14 | Franchises |\n| Category 15 | Investments |\n\nEmissions associated with raw materials and parts for use in electronics products sold by and the goods purchased by the Sony Group, from the extraction of resources through to production, as well as emissions related to certain data center use.\n\nEmissions associated with the production of capital goods invested in by the Sony Group.\n\nEmissions associated with procurement of fuels and energy consumed by Sony Group sites.\n\nEmissions associated with the transportation and storage of electronics products sold by the Sony Group and purchased parts.\n\nEmissions associated with the treatment and disposal of waste generated by Sony Group sites.\n\nEmissions associated with travel (by air) for business purposes by Sony Group electronics group companies employees, mainly in Japan, Europe, and North America.\n\nEmissions associated with employees\u2019 commutes from their homes to their workplace.\n\nNot applicable (accounted for in other categories)\n\nEmissions associated with the distribution of electronics products sold by the Sony Group from retailers to consumers.\n\nEmissions associated with the assumed post-sale third-party processing of electronics products sold by the Sony Group.\n\nEmissions associated with the assumed post-sale third-party processing of electronics products sold by the Sony Group.\n\nEmissions associated with the assumed end-of-life recycling or disposal of electronics products sold by the Sony Group.\n\nNot applicable\n\nEmissions associated with the business activities of companies in which the Sony Group has invested.\nResource Related Data Collection Methods and Rationale\n\nVolume of Waste Generated at Sites\nTotal volume of industrial waste and non-industrial waste.\n\nAmount of Waste Landfilled\nTotal amount of landfilled waste generated at sites.\n\nVolume of Water Consumption/Intake/Discharged\n\n- Volume of Water Consumption\n  The total volume of water used at sites (municipal water, industrial water, well water); for municipal water and industrial water, purchase volume is substituted for the purpose of calculation.\n\n- Volume of Water Intake\n  The volume of water generated outside the company and rainwater, in addition to water consumed.\n\n- Volume of Water Discharged\n  The sum of discharged water to rivers and sewerage. For Sony sites where it is not possible to accurately grasp actual discharge volume, a calculation based on the volume of water used x average per-site rate for volume of water discharged is substituted.\n\nProduct Resource Input\nTotal volume of resources used in products, accessories, manuals and packaging materials. Total weight of products shipped is used as a substitute.\n\nVolume of Resource Recovery from End-of-Life Products\nVolume of products collected from recycling multiplied by the reused/recycled ratio. Volume of products collected from recycling is the weight of recycled products in Japan/East Asia, Europe, North America, Pan Asia, and Latin America. Some amounts calculated based on the recycling expenses are included. The reused/recycled ratio is the volume reused/recycled compared with the total volume collected. The amount of collected end-of-life products is substituted under the current situation.\n\nOther Data Collection Methods and Rationale\n\nVolume of Chemical Substances Handled/Emitted\nClass 3 and Class 4 chemical substances for which the amount handled annually is 100kg (Class3) /1,000kg (Class4) or more are subject to reporting.\n\n- Volume of Chemical Substances Handled\n  The volume of chemical substances used at sites; purchase volume is substituted when exact volume of usage cannot be determined.\n\n- Volume of Chemical Substances Emitted\n  Volume of chemical substances released from sites in relation to their operation; calculations are based on purchase volume x distribution coefficient.\n\nEmissions of Water Pollutants (BOD, COD)\nConcentrations in water emitted x volume of water emitted. Sites that are requested by law and/or by other demands such as contracts are subjected to this data collection.\n\nEmissions of Air Pollutants (NOx, SOx)\nVolume calculated by multiplying emission volume by emission concentration. Sites that are requested by law and/or by other demands such as contracts are subjected to this data collection.\nIndependent Assurance Statement\n\nPurpose and Scope of Assurance\n\nSony has obtained third-party verification since fiscal year 2001 to ensure the credibility of data reported and facilitate the ongoing improvement of its environmental management.
