The most sustainable companies showed the highest levels of flexibility and competitiveness, while maintaining a lower risk profile. It became clear that sustainable progress opens the way to more growth opportunities for companies and greater resilience in the face of sudden disruptions, with a lower risk profile for shareholders.\n\nWithin this context, at Enel we see innovation and sustainability as inseparable parts of the same motive force, while preserving the spirit of service and care for the society in which we operate as critical components of our DNA. We are part of the landscape and an essential element in the lives of people, businesses, and society at large. Our journey started out bringing light to homes and enabling development by making electricity available to businesses. We opened up to new technologies, new partnership models, new ways of using energy, thus fully engaging all our stakeholders to create a more sustainable future together.\n\nThis approach has allowed us to become the biggest private operator in the renewable energy sector as well as the largest private electricity distribution company with the most advanced level of network digitalization, and to manage the most extensive retail customer base, for energy and gas, of any private company in the world. We generate, distribute, and sell electricity in an ever more sustainable manner, ensuring no one gets left behind. We engage our stakeholders to keep them increasingly in touch with our business, making them an integral part of our sustainable business model.\n\nIn such a period of change, with all players involved moving at different speeds and many new variables to contend with, there must be a clear and far-reaching strategic vision as well as planning abilities in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. An enduringly sustainable company creates value because its actions and offering are in line with the future demands of the intrinsically sustainable stakeholders of tomorrow. For this reason we decided to release, for the first time, a 10-year plan clearly describing our long-term vision and the utility company we aim to become in the coming years.\n\nThe ongoing decarbonization process means that we will soon start using electricity even in all those sectors that currently rely heavily on fossil fuels, further cementing our commitment to digitalization and the search for innovative solutions to electrify end uses. At the same time, our physical infrastructure will become increasingly exposed to climate change related phenomena including flooding, drought, scorching heat and severe cold. We aim to take on these challenges by increasing the safety and resilience of our plants and networks so we can continue to guarantee high levels of service quality and reliability for our customers, who are more and more aware that electricity today is the simplest and most natural choice to make a direct personal contribution to a sustainable future.\n\nInnovation and circular economy are emphasized throughout all activities across our value chain, introducing the concept of sustainability starting from the design phase. We will reduce direct CO\u2082 emissions by 80% within 2030 versus 2017 levels, as certified by the Science Based Targets initiative, reaching carbon neutrality within 2050.\n\nThe primary actors in our strategy are people, with their innovative skills and digital mindset: they must be given a guarantee of sustainable growth and the adoption of circularity principles. Circularity means enhancing existing potential in new directions by way of reskilling and upskilling programs. A new modus operandi, enhancing relationships, trust, and respect for the talent of each individual, without relaxing our goal-centered focus.\n\nThe strategic partners in Enel\u2019s growth process include our suppliers, who have displayed quick reactions and an exceptional ability to reorganize in order to meet demands arising during the year-long pandemic. We view our suppliers as fellow travelers as we set out on a path characterized by increasing levels of research into innovation and sustainability in every aspect of our future collaboration.\n\nThe result is that today we are applying sustainability-based thinking to all areas of our business, also in the financial sphere. Our leadership in this area is recognized worldwide thanks also to the Group\u2019s presence in various prestigious ratings, indices, and sustainability rankings.\n\nThe key elements include sustainability measurement throughout the entire value chain using specific metrics, and the definition of ever more ambitious goals, not merely to document results achieved, but above all to anticipate decisions and develop a proactive stance. An account of sustainability that not only portrays past events but allows us to travel through time to glimpse the Enel of the future.\n\nBy making a joint commitment we can follow a sustainable path that will make our company and surrounding communities more prosperous, inclusive, sustainable, and resilient.\nENEL IS OPEN POWER\n\nVISION\n\nOpen Power to tackle some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nMISSION\n\nOpen power\n\nPURPOSE\n\nOpen power for a brighter future.\nWe empower sustainable progress.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF CONDUCT\n\n> Make decisions in daily activities and take responsibility for them.\n> Share information, being willing to collaborate and open to the contribution of others.\n> Follow through with commitments, pursuing activities with determination and passion.\n> Change priorities rapidly if the situation evolves.\n> Get results by aiming for excellence.\n> Adopt and promote safe behavior and move pro-actively to improve conditions for health, safety and well-being.\n> Work for the integration of all, recognizing and leveraging individual diversity (culture, gender, age, disabilities, personality etc.).\n> Work focusing on satisfying customers and/or co-workers, acting affectively and rapidly.\n> Propose new solution and do not give up when faced with obstacles or failure.\n> Recognize merit in co-workers and give feedback that can improve their contribution.\n\nVALUES\n\n> Trust\n> Proactivity\n> Responsibility\n> Innovation\n\n> Open access to electricity for more people.\n> Open the world of energy to new technology.\n> Open up to new uses of energy.\n> Open up to new ways of managing energy for people.\n> Open up to new partnerships.\nWe are a leading energy group with a sustainable business model that creates long-term value for all stakeholders.\n\nWe approach every aspect of our business, including finance, in a sustainable, innovative and circular way.\n\nWe set the priorities that underpin our strategy, commitment and reporting through a structured materiality analysis process and the continuous and direct involvement of our stakeholders.\n\nOur strategy makes sustainability the focus, with a view to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe are a leading group in the energy sector, with a presence in over 40 countries on five continents, vertically integrated along the entire value chain. Our strategy, which is centered on sustainability, has allowed us to confirm our leadership in the energy transition in 2020, creating value for all stakeholders and contributing to the achievement of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nBy exploiting synergies between the various business areas, taking actions by leveraging innovation, implementing Open Power behaviors, we promote solutions to reduce environmental impact and meet the requirements of customers and the local communities in which we operate, with a commitment to guaranteeing high safety standards for the people who work in the company and its contractors. We are therefore able to meet the new challenges of the energy transition process, not simply by reacting to risks, but by embracing all the opportunities leaving no one behind. This approach is conducive to detecting the faint signals that will turn into future trends.\n\nOpen Power \u2013 Openness is the key element of our strategy\n\n**PURPOSE**\n\nWe are a global leader in the energy sector\n\n**VISION**\n\nWe are integrated along the entire value chain\n\n**MISSION**\n\nWe create long-term value for all stakeholders\n\n**VALUES**\n\nSUSTAINABLE VALUE CREATION IN THE LONG TERM\n\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE ENTIRE VALUE CHAIN\n\n**PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNANCE**\n\n44% women on the Board of Directors | 151 reports concerning the Code of Ethics (of which 26 violations)\nMacrotrends, risks and opportunities define the context in which the organization operates. The purpose, mission, vision and values concern the entire organization and define the aim of the company in clear and concise terms. The governance principles are intended to create a solid guidance and supervision structure. The growth engine is our sustainable business model, which leverages the various input resources, divided into three macro categories (people, planet and prosperity) and converts them into outputs through the various company activities. We operate all along the value chain through specific Business Lines (Global Power Generation, Global Infrastructure and Networks, Enel X and Global Trading), assisted by Global Service Functions (Procurement and Digital Solutions) and Staff Functions (Administration, Finance and Control, Innovation and Sustainability, People and Organization, Communication, Legal and Corporate Affairs, Audit) with every country operating in its respective area of competence by applying the Business Lines matrix. The organization\u2019s activities and outputs allow it to create value in the short, medium and long term for the various stakeholders. An integrated thinking and decision-making process that combines economic, financial, environmental and social sustainability.\n\nThe 2020 results highlight our strong commitment to sustainable growth, as demonstrated by the more than 10 billion euros invested during the year. Our investments are directed towards achieving a sustainable and integrated business model based on renewables, distribution and advanced energy services, leveraging the primary role of digitalization and platforms. This approach is aimed at accelerating growth both through the \u2018Ownership\u2019 model, which is based on direct investments, and through the \u2018Stewardship\u2019 model, which involves third parties. In addition to promoting growth in the areas where we operate, this has allowed us to further accelerate the decarbonization of the Group\u2019s production mix.\n\nIn particular, production from renewable sources exceeded that from conventional sources, growing to 53%, and coal-fired generation fell drastically by 65%, with a consequent reduction in specific Scope 1 emissions to 214 gCO\u2082eq/kWh (1-28% compared to 2019). In terms of capacity, the Group also installed 3.1 GW of additional renewable power and reduced coal-fired capacity by 2.8 GW. Enel is aware of the great importance that digitalization plays in each activity of its value chain and therefore further increased the percentage of its generation plants integrated into the dedicated information system to more than 89% in terms of the number of plants and the 94% in terms of capacity.\n\nAs regards infrastructure and the respective digitalization, the Group achieved excellent results as for service quality improvement, with a 12% reduction compared to 2019 in the SAIDI indicator of the average duration of outages. 44.3 million out of Enel\u2019s 74.3 million end users are now equipped with an active smart meter, which equates to a 60% coverage. In order to increasingly promote consumption efficiency, the spread of new services and products continued, including charging points for electric mobility, of which there are now over 186,000.\n\nOne of the fundamental levers for achieving these important results is of course the 66,717 people who work at the Company, who benefit from many development and training programs. 60% of them focused on upskilling and reskilling, in order to better manage and support the energy transition. Women account for 21.5% of the Company\u2019s total workforce, and thanks to the specific attention paid to diversity, which aims to enhance resources even before their entry into the Company, in 2020 the percentage of female managers and middle managers grew to 29.4%. Thanks to the consistent attention paid to health and safety, the combined accident frequency index for Enel and contractor employees fell further compared to previous years (0.52 in 2020 vs 0.73 in 2019). As regards projects with local communities, the activity focused on providing access to energy (SDG 7), quality education (SDG 4) and socio-economic development (SDG 8), reaching over 15 million beneficiaries since 2015.\n\nImportant results were also achieved in terms of environmental sustainability through a reduction of all other pollutants, including NOx and SO2, and the spread of new services and products continued, including charging points for electric mobility, of which there are now over 186,000.\n\nProgress achieved in the responsible management of the supply chain and sound governance continue to provide strong foundations for the strategic model. Innovation and digitalization dominate every process in the value chain and are accelerating growth in the various areas.\n\nA leadership in sustainability that is therefore recognized internationally, particularly thanks to the Group\u2019s presence in several important sustainability ratings, indices and rankings, including the MSCI ESG Leaders Indices, the Dow Jones World and Europe sustainability indices, the CDP Climate \u2018A\u2019 List rating, the Vigeo-Eiris rating, in which the Group is now ranked first across all sectors and received confirmation of its Euronext Vigeo-Eiris 120 rating, the Refinitiv ESG rating and the FTSE4Good index, both of which have confirmed it as an industry leader. Furthermore, for the first time, Enel was included in the three main indices that monitor company performance on gender diversity (Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, Refinitiv Top 100 Diversity and Inclusion Index, Equileap Gender Equality Top 100 ranking).\n\nDespite the financial crisis, the financial results also show how the Group carried on growing by continuing to generate value. In particular, 2020 ended with an ordinary EBITDA of 178 billion euros, in line with the previous year\u2019s results. The ordinary net profit, on which the dividend is calculated, reached 5.2 billion euros, up 8% compared to the previous year. The dividend for 2020 amounts to around 36 euro cents per share, up 8% on 2019. The FFO to net debt ratio, a financial strength indicator, reached 25% by the end of the year. The net debt is 45.4 billion euros, lower than the forecasts previously issued to the market. The total tax contribution was around 16,100 million euros, a significant value that highlights the importance of the Group\u2019s tax contribution to the communities in which it operates as a support for their stability and resilience.\n\nOur solid economic and sustainability-related performance reinforce market confidence in us. This is demonstrated by the 17% increase in value that the Enel stock recorded during the year, outperforming both the sector index (Euro Stoxx Utilities: +10%) and the Italian one (FTSE MIB: -5%). In 2020 we were confirmed as the first European utility by market capitalization and the second in the world.\nCovid-19: our response\n\nIn order to deal with the emergency linked to Covid-19, Enel responded quickly and in a determined way to minimize the spread of the infection while at the same time guaranteeing the operation and provision of services in the countries where it operates. We have worked from the beginning to support the communities in which we operate, our customers, our people and all those who work with us, in order to contribute to the economic and social recovery and the creation of shared value with all our stakeholders.\n\nA global task force has been established to coordinate and direct initiatives in the countries where we operate. The task force works in synergy with the Global Business Lines and is responsible for providing official instructions so that, through dedicated task forces, each country is able to manage any type of emergency locally. Enel is constantly updated on information relating to Covid-19 and strives to take preventive measures and any initiative that may be necessary.\n\nEnel is committed to taking measures to support the main organizations involved in providing health and social care to help the territories and communities where it operates every day. Around 450 sustainability projects have been developed in two areas of intervention:\n\n- containment of the health emergency with initiatives to support hospitals and front line assistance to citizens;\n- support for the economic revitalization of communities, through programs to support food security, development of micro-entrepreneurship, services dedicated to vulnerable customers and distance vocational and educational training.\n\nIn Italy, through Enel Cuore, Enel has supported the organizations working on the front line to deal with the emergency, making a contribution of 23 million euros to the Civil Defense Department, health facilities, non-profit organizations, local administrations throughout the Country. A new free solution called \u201cCity Analytics Mobility Map\u201d was also launched that uses daily mobility statistics to support public administrations in verifying the effectiveness of mobility restriction policies to combat Covid-19 and in defining data driven strategies, for the new phase of normality.\n\nEnel faced 2020 with distinctive resilience by continuing on a path taken several years ago that is focused on adopting a cloud computing approach and which allowed the company to overcome the disruption by relying on a modern and flexible structure. Enel also carried out several simulations, tests, and checks on its infrastructure without encountering any problems in its normal operations. In view of the potential developments in the situation, incremental measures are planned for energy generation and distribution networks, aimed at ensuring the provision of services and the safety of national electricity systems.\n\nCommunication channels had to adapt to the new way of working from home, ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the relationship between Enel and its customers. Thanks to a globally coordinated effort, based on promoting digital channels, various measures were successfully taken to meet the growing needs of customers while complying with travel restrictions and social distancing requirements.\n\nAmong the various projects, Brazil launched #JuntosNaoMesmaEnergia, a package of initiatives including video lessons and seminars through the Enel Shares platform, including guidelines for responsible energy consumption and safety advice relating to the electricity grid during isolation.\n\nActivities that would require physical interaction between Enel and suppliers are now conducted remotely (e.g. site inspections at the company) and safety measures for contractors\u2019 staff have been strengthened.\n\nEnel has implemented continuous smart working until further notice in all countries and for all its employees whose work can be done from home, with the sole exception of activities that cannot be carried out remotely, especially those required to ensure the provision of services and the safety of national electricity systems. As of the end of February 2020, all international trips have been canceled, with the exception of transfers needed to ensure the provision of services. All international events and training courses are carried out using non-face-to-face attendance tools to ensure the Company\u2019s operations.\n\nA global insurance policy covering all employees in the event of hospitalization due to Covid-19 infection was taken out and renewed for 2021. This is the first insurance intervention in the world aimed at providing global support to cope with the pandemic.\n\nIn order to provide emotional support to people during the Covid-19 emergency, a free listening and psychological support service was activated from the very beginning in the Group\u2019s main countries. Furthermore, in order to promote well-being, the #IWorkWellFromHome manifesto was created and disseminated via a dedicated communication campaign, with suggestions on how to manage remote work times more easily, encourage inclusion and delegation, physical and relational well-being and work-life balance and counteract hyper-connection.\n\nThe pandemic has also led to a further increase in cyber-attacks all over the world. Apart from the constant adoption and application of the cyber security strategy, Enel has developed special measures, aware of the fact that the cyber risk is not merely a corporate problem but can become a risk of ecosystemic proportions within the broader context of the complex and highly interconnected electricity industry. A policy was drawn up that provides an articulated code of conduct addressed to all Enel people, to safeguard their digital identity, allow them to act safely in the world of social media and, when necessary, send notifications concerning potential incidents and request assistance.\n\nEnel\u2019s openinnovability crowdsourcing platform was also used to launch 17 challenges relevant to the health emergency linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, while the world has begun to define a new normality, Enel has launched the global \u2018Reshape\u2019 challenge, with the aim of identifying innovative solutions for the future of energy and to face emerging needs.\n\nFinally, the remuneration policy for 2020 establishes a new performance target for the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and executives with strategic responsibilities (ESR), as part of the short-term variable component (MBO), which measures the ability of the Group to manage company activities remotely, where possible, guaranteeing continuity of service and excellent standards of operational efficiency.\nSustainability governance and our involvement in the leading associations\n\nOur governance structure is inspired by international best practices and permeates the various business, decision-making and operational processes along the entire value chain, in order to create long-term sustainable value for the Company and for all our stakeholders.\n\nIntegrating ESG factors in the Company\u2019s operation\n\nThe integration of environmental, social and governance factors is guaranteed by means of structured processes across the whole Group that involve sustainability context analysis, identification of priorities for the Company and its stakeholders, sustainability planning, execution of specific actions to support sustainability objectives, reporting and management of ESG ratings and sustainability indices, as well as the management of the main national and international sustainability networks.\n\nA key element of the outlined approach is the adoption of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) sustainability indicators throughout the entire chain of value, not merely for the assessment of the results achieved, but above all to anticipate decisions and guide our actions. Enel has an ongoing commitment to the management and measurement of its performance in terms of all relevant aspects, addressing economic, business and ESG issues in reporting its operations and defining the objectives underpinning its strategy. This model is fully in line with the requirements of the United Nations\u2019 Global Compact, of which Enel has been an active member since 2004, which stress the importance of ever-increasing integration of sustainability throughout all corporate strategies. With the Enel Chief Executive Officer sitting on the Global Compact Board of Directors, absolute compliance with these requirements is further guaranteed.\n\nDuring 2020, Enel was a member of two working groups set up by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), one of them being the \u201cProject task force on climate-related reporting\u201d, which ended with the presentation of a report entitled \u201cHow to improve climate-related reporting\u201d in February 2020. The main aim was to analyze and identify good corporate reporting practices as regards both the financial impacts of climate risk on companies and the impact of the activities of companies on the environment (known as double materiality) taking into consideration the needs of users and those who prepare the reports. The collaboration with EFRAG continued through the Company\u2019s involvement in the work of the \u201cProject task force on preparatory work for the elaboration of possible EU non-financial reporting standards\u201d. The task force responded to an official request for technical advice from the European Commission for the development of potential non-financial reporting standards which could be part of a review of the European directive on non-financial information. Furthermore, also in 2020, Enel became a member of the Global Sustainability Standards Board, the independent body that has the exclusive responsibility of developing and issuing the GRI Standards.\n\nThe Enel governance model for sustainability\n\nThe organizational and corporate governance model defines specific tasks and responsibilities for which the Company\u2019s main governance bodies are responsible, guaranteeing that sustainability issues are appropriately taken into consideration during all important company decision-making processes.\n\n> The Board of Directors examines and approves the strategic, industrial, and financial plans, including the annual budget and the Group Business Plan, which incorporate the principal guidelines to promote a sustainable business model and lay the basis for long-term value creation. The Board is responsible for approving the Sustainability Report, which constitutes the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (NFS) pursuant to Legislative Decree 254/16, after consulting the Control and Risks Committee and the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee. With regard to sustainability, during 2020 it dealt with a number of issues related to the climate and to promoting diversity, with reference to both disability and gender. Finally, at each meeting held since the end of February 2020, it received updates on the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic in the countries where the Group operates.\n\n> Among other aspects, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee monitors and reports on the issues associated with the Company\u2019s activities and its interaction with stakeholders, examines the Sustainability Plan guidelines and how sustainability policy is implemented, monitors Enel\u2019s ranking in the main sustainability ratings, and examines the layout of the Sustainability Report and the structure of its contents, as well as the completeness and transparency of the disclosures supplied by the documents in question, examining the Company\u2019s main rules and procedures that are relevant to stakeholders.\n\n> The responsibilities of the Control and Risks Committee include examining the contents of the Sustainability Report that are relevant to the Internal Control and Risk Management System, and the main corporate rules and procedures linked to the Internal Control and Risk Management System that have a significant impact on stakeholders.\n\n> The Nomination and Compensation Committee is tasked with supporting \u2013 with adequate preliminary investigations \u2013 the Board of Directors\u2019 assessments and decision making on the size and composition of the Board itself, as well as on the remuneration of executive directors and key management personnel.\n\n> By coordinating the activities of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who currently also occupies the post of Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, performs a proactive role in the approval and supervision of the sustainability strategy.\n\n> The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is responsible for defining and implementing a sustainable business model, defining the guidelines for management of the energy transition, promoting a low carbon model and corporate practices that consider the needs of the various stakeholders. He represents Enel in various initiatives dealing with sustainability, holding relevant positions in institutions of international importance, such as the United Nations\u2019 Global Compact, as well as the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance launched by the United Nations in 2019.\n\n> The Innovability\u00ae (Innovation and Sustainability) Function, which reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, manages all activities related to sustainability and innovation. The Holding unit responsible for Enel SpA\u2019s operations, particularly the sustainability, circular economy, and community relations processes, play a guidance and coordination role for the Sustainability and Innovation units located in the various Countries and Business Lines. In particular, the Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights Holding unit responsible for managing the sustainability planning, monitoring and reporting processes, and for the management of ESG ratings, sustainability indices and the Human Rights Policy, also reports to the Group CFO in order to guarantee the ever greater integration of these issues in corporate strategies and reporting.\n\n> The Global Business Lines, Countries, Global Service Functions and Holding Functions integrate ESG factors into their decision-making and operating processes, to create sustainable value in the long term, thanks to the presence of dedicated Sustainability structures in all Countries, Business Lines and Global Service Functions. At the local level, the expectations of the various stakeholders are identified, and specific sustainability plans defined, in line with the Group strategy.\nENEL\u2019S PRESENCE IN THE MAIN ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY ASSOCIATIONS\n\n1 - United Nations Global Compact\nEnel has been a \u201cParticipant\u201d member of the UN Global Compact since 2004 and in 2020 it was confirmed as one of its LEAD companies, thanks to its commitment and adherence to the 10 founding principles on human rights, labor standards, environmental protection, and the fight against corruption.

A substantial number of investors already integrate ESG issues in their investment portfolio in order to minimize financial risk and ensure higher returns. At the same time, the change in Enel\u2019s business model towards sustainable business practices has contributed to creating value by driving the energy transition. These two elements have contributed to attracting the attention of sustainability-oriented institutional investors, who have bought increasing amounts of the company\u2019s shares over the past five years. At the end of 2020, ESG (active and passive) investment funds accounted for 14.6% of Enel\u2019s capital and 19.1% of floating capital, more than twice the levels in 2014. In absolute terms, there are 244 investors with investment funds who in addition to considering the Group\u2019s financial performance also look at the environmental, social and governance practices that Enel is integrating into its business strategy and in all activities along the entire value chain. Furthermore, again at the end of 2020, 47.8% of Enel\u2019s capital was held by investors who were signatories of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI).\n\nDevelopments in ESG investors\n\nBond market: sustainability-linked finance according to Enel\n\nMobilizing public and private capital to serve the sustainable strategy is of crucial importance for achieving the SDGs and for achieving the ambitious investment objectives set by the Strategic Plan that Enel communicated in November 2020. 2019 was a key year for Enel\u2019s sustainable finance strategy, with the launch of the first SDG-linked bonds in the world, with the interest rate dependent on the achievement of ambitious decarbonization objectives and on the strengthening of renewable generation, marking the start of the sustainability-linked bond market. To date, SDG-linked issues amount to 23 billion euros. Developing sustainable finance for Enel means pursuing a decrease in the cost of debt through transactions that link the Group\u2019s strategy to the interest rate charged on the debt contracted: an example of which is the bond issues that cost around 15 basis points less than conventional transactions.\n\nThis is why during 2020 Enel extended the sustainability-linked approach to all its debt instruments by publishing the \u201cSustainability-Linked Financing Framework\u201d, an all-encompassing document that governs the link between sustainability and loans, credit lines, commercial papers, and bond issues. Two Key Performance Indicators (\u201cKPIs\u201d) were selected for the framework: reduction of Scope 1 greenhouse gases and increase in generation from renewable sources in accordance with SDG 13 \u201cAction to combat climate change\u201d and 7 \u201cAffordable and clean energy\u201d. The associated targets are reviewed on an annual basis, in line with the Group\u2019s Strategic Plan.\n\nIn May 2020, Enel signed a 5 billion euro sustainability-linked credit line, followed by a 6 billion euro commercial paper program linked to SDG 7, the first of its kind in the world.\n\nIn October, the Group issued the world\u2019s first sustainability-linked sterling bond, simultaneously innovating the derivatives market, with the world\u2019s first bilateral sustainability-linked cross-currency swap, also subscribing to a further 1 billion euros.\n\nThe sustainability-linked financial strategy was welcomed by the market and three main results certify its success: in June 2020 the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) published the new \u201cSustainability-Linked Bond Principles\u201d (\u201cSLBPs\u201d), providing essential guidelines to the issuers of this instrument; sustainability-linked bonds multiplied during 2020, with issuers from different sectors and geographic areas; sustainability-linked bonds are now part of the European Central Bank\u2019s purchase programs. Enel was also rewarded by the International Financing Review (IFR), the world\u2019s leading provider of intelligence on the global capital market, as \u201cSustainable Issuer of the Year\u201d, as part of the 2020 IFR Awards. The award, which Enel won for the second consecutive year, recognized the Group\u2019s commitment to a sustainable strategy that has translated into innovation in the finance market through a new range of financing instruments connected to the corporate sustainability-linked approach.\n\nAs part of the 2020-2021 insurance renewals, Enel and Enel Insurance have placed a Property All Risk SDG-Linked insurance program, which is the first in the world to incorporate and integrate sustainability criteria such as the United Nations SDGs. The indicator taken into consideration is consistent with SDG 7 \u201cClean and affordable energy\u201d and the achievement of the result is certified by an independent third party.\n\nIn 2020, 33% of Enel\u2019s gross debt was sustainable. This figure is expected to reach almost 50% by 2023 and over 70% by 2030 through refinancing and the issue of new sustainable finance instruments.\n\n86 Source: Bloomberg Energy Finance BNEF. Extraction of 13.04.2021. The value includes 4.5 billion dollars relating to Enel issues.\nESG ratings and indices\n\nESG analysts and international rating agencies monitor Enel\u2019s sustainability performance constantly. Through the application of different methodologies, analysts assess Group performance in relation to environmental, social and governance topics that may be of significance for the financial community. ESG ratings are therefore deemed to be a strategic tool to support investors and identify risks and opportunities linked to the sustainability in their investment portfolio, aiding the development of active and passive sustainable investment strategies. In 2020, Enel maintained or improved its positioning in ESG ratings and indices, reaching leadership positions in most of them, as a result of the action plan defined to improve disclosure on ESG matters with the various business units and lines of business, including actions aimed at defining and making public specific targets to increase the presence of women in managerial positions and the publication of the company policy against harassment, and better performance in the main ESG criteria assessed.\n\nKey milestones 2020\n\nJanuary 2020\nInclusion in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the first time\n\nJune 2020\nInclusion in the MSCI ESG Leaders indices for the first time\n\nNovember 2020\nIndustry Leader in the FTSE ESG Rating\n\nNovember 2020\nSector leader in the DJSI World and in the DJSI Europe\n\nDecember 2020\nInclusion in the Climate \u201cA\u201d List for the second year in a row\n\nDecember 2020\nSector leader in the Refinitiv ESG Rating\n\nMain ESG ratings\n\n| Rating | Ranking | Sector average | Scale (low | high) |\n|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|\n| MSCI   | AAA     | Top 10 (n = 147) | BBB | CCC | AAA |\n| Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating | 23.6 medium risk | 24/215 electric utilities | 36.7 | 100 | 0 |\n| S&P ESG Scores | 89 | 2/101 electric utilities | 45 | 0 | 100 |\n| CDP | A (climate) | - | B | D | A |\n| Refinitiv ESG Rating | 89 | 1/232 electric utilities | - | 0 | 100 |\n| FTSE Russell ESG Rating | 5 | 1st electric utilities | - | 0 | 5 |\n| Vigeo Eiris ESG Rating | 76 | 1/+4,000 all sectors | 47 | 0 | 100 |\n| ISS ESG Score | B- | - | C- | D- | A+ |\n| RepRisk Rating | 31 | - | 44 | 100 | 0 |\n\nResults as at December 31, 2020\n\nMain ESG indices\n\nESG\n\nMSCI ESG Leaders indices\n\nPEOPLE\n\nRefinitiv Diversity & Inclusion Top 100\n\nCLIMATE\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nSustainability Report 2020\nThe European taxonomy\n\nThe European Commission has established a specific classification system intended to identify sustainable economic activities from an environmental perspective (known as a \u201ctaxonomy\u201d), as an important enabling factor for supporting sustainable investments and adopting the indications of the European Green Deal.\n\nAn economic activity is defined as sustainable from an environmental perspective if:\n\n- it makes a substantial contribution to achieving one or more of the six environmental goals defined by the taxonomy (mitigation of climate changes, adaptation to climate changes, sustainable use and protection of waters and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, prevention and reduction of pollution, protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems);\n- it does no significant harm (DNSH) to any of the environmental objectives;\n- it is carried out in compliance with the minimum safety guard guarantees.\n\nWith input from the technical expert group on sustainable finance, the taxonomy regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on June 22, 2020 and came into force on July 12 the same year. Starting from January 2022, companies required to publish their Consolidated Non-Financial Statement must disclose the share of their revenues, capital expenses (Capex) and operating expenses (Opex) that are qualified as sustainable from an environmental point of view.\n\nEnel therefore analyzed the applicability of the taxonomy along the entire value chain and in all countries where it operates, with reference exclusively to the mitigation and adaptation to climate change goals, which are the only two for which the European Commission has published the draft criteria. The main results of Enel\u2019s declaration regarding the alignment of economic activities with the taxonomy are reported in the \u201cEuropean Taxonomy\u201d chapter of this document.\n\nParticipation in international round tables to promote sustainable finance\n\nThe focus on sustainable finance is being amplified, strengthening the commitment to key global stakeholders, through the co-chairmanship of the UN Global Compact\u2019s CFO Taskforce for the SDGs and involvement in the UN\u2019s Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance.\n\nIn particular, the CFO Taskforce has launched the \u201cPrinciples on Integrated SDG Investments and Finance\u201d, a set of principles to support companies in the transition towards sustainable development and leverage corporate finance and investments to achieve the SDGs. Equally significant are the results of the work carried out during the first year of the GISD Alliance such as, for example, the definition of Sustainable Development Investing (SDI) and the launch of the Call to Action for Covid-19 bond issuance. On several occasions, the Alliance has also given its contribution to the European Commission for recommendations and reports on the new European strategy for sustainable finance.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the work carried out at European level, through the co-chairmanship of the UN Global Compact\u2019s CFO Taskforce for the SDGs, dedicated to sustainable finance. Also noteworthy is the work carried out at European level, through the co-chairmanship of the UN Global Compact\u2019s CFO Taskforce for the SDGs, dedicated to sustainable finance. On that occasion, Enel presented its sustainable Finance for the SDGs\u201d, dedicated to sustainable finance.\n\nFor further details and a description of the actions intended to mitigate their effects and ensure their correct management, please refer to the \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter of this document.\n\nOur priorities and stakeholder involvement\n\nSustainability context\n\nClimate change and environmental degradation, an increasingly \u201cdiverse\u201d society, demographic changes, urbanization, the evolution of cities, new technologies and inequalities are the megatrends influencing the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, redefining our future and changing the way where we live and work. Megatrends often influence each other and also act in combination, reinforcing their individual impacts. Climate change, for example, can strengthen rural-urban migration. Technological innovation and digitalization have in several cases exacerbated income inequalities. A scenario made more complex by the Covid-19 pandemic which, in addition to being a health emergency, has turned into the deepest global recession in recent history, measurable in terms of a contraction in world GDP of around 3.7% on a year-on-year basis in 2020. The pandemic has highlighted and reinforced the existing inequalities between and within countries, with a greater negative impact on nations and groups that are less able to protect themselves, and already at greater risk of being left behind. Addressing these challenges in some cases requires a global effort, in others national policies play a decisive role, but global coordination and joint efforts can contribute to more significant and positive changes, underlining the vital importance of multilateral consensus and collaboration.\n\nMain risk types\n\nDue to the nature of its business and its geographical distribution, the Enel Group is exposed to various types of ESG risk, identified within the reference framework relating to the risk categories adopted by Enel, which provides for six categories: strategic, financial, operational, governance & culture, digital technology, and compliance. In particular, the main ESG risks identified are listed below: further risks, mainly of a financial nature, are reported in the Integrated Annual Report.\nThe materiality analysis is the process which, with the continuous and direct involvement of stakeholders, allows the priority issues for stakeholders to be identified and assessed, weighted based on their relevance, comparing them with the Group\u2019s priorities and industrial strategy, considering the impacts suffered and generated on the economy, the environment, and on people, including the impacts on human rights.\n\nThe result of this analysis is presented in the Group\u2019s priorities\u2019 matrix (or materiality matrix), which gives a comprehensive view of all the Company\u2019s stakeholders, providing a complete sustainability disclosure, as well as an integrated representation of the Company\u2019s contribution to sustainable development. Furthermore, applying the so-called \u201cprimary users\u201d filter \u2013 corresponding to the \u201cfinancial community\u201d \u2013 it is possible to highlight the issues that have a greater direct impact on the value of the company.\n\nThe result of the analysis therefore helps to identify and define the objectives to be included in the Strategic Plan and the Sustainability Plan \u2013 to the achievement of which the Group\u2019s various Functions and Business Lines contribute \u2013 and the topics to be covered in the Sustainability Report.\n\nThe issues are classified into categories of business and governance matters, social matters, and environmental topics and represented by the priorities assigned by stakeholders (horizontal axis of the matrix) and the Company (vertical axis of the matrix). The overall Group matrix considers the contributions of the main companies involved in the process, weighted according to their significance with respect to the type of business in which they operate.\n\nIn 2020, the analysis covered 18 countries, 52 companies and 28 assets and considered 432 initiatives involving relevant stakeholders for the Group, namely business community, customers, financial community, national and international institutions, civil society and local communities, media, employees, suppliers and contractors. During last year there has also been a significant decrease in the use of \u201cself-assessment\u201d, which now stands at 2% (in 2015 it was 64%) of the total of the various types of involvement envisaged, making the analysis increasingly objective and detailed.\n\nThe process allows the priorities for the Group as a whole and for each country, down to the individual Business Line/Corporate Function and individual assets (understood as a potential or effective operating site), to be identified.\n\nThe method used was developed taking into account the guidelines of several international standards, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the International Integrated Reporting Framework (IR), the AA1000AP Accountability standard (2018) and the SDG Compass, which supports companies in adapting their strategies to comply with the UN SDGs. In particular, the issues analyzed covered all 17 SDGs.\n\nIn accordance with the most recent publications by the aforementioned reference standards, the materiality analysis is conducted with:\n\n- a dynamic approach (\u2018dynamic materiality\u2019) by continuous monitoring of stakeholders\u2019 expectations, particularly in order to determine whether non-material issues might become material issues for the business over time;\n- a dual vision (\u2018double materiality\u2019), which allows us to assess whether the Company has an impact on society and the surrounding environment, or identify how ESG issues affect the creation of long-term value.\n\nThe materiality analysis is brought to the attention of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee at the time of the Sustainability Plan guidelines review. Moreover, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Control and Risks Committee issue preventive opinions concerning the Sustainability Report, which includes the materiality analysis, and submit them to the Board of Directors in its meeting convened to approve the Report.\n\n2020 results\n\nGiven the particular nature of the reference context due to the global pandemic, the materiality analysis also took into consideration the effects of Covid-19. In particular, the issues most affected by the pandemic recording an increase in the level of priority assigned were: occupational health and safety, particularly the safety of contractors and employees; ecosystems and platforms, in relation to the growing need for services for the home, for citizens and for industries; innovation and digital transformation, given the acceleration in digitalization required by the pandemic crisis; and engaging local communities, given the importance of the Company\u2019s role in ensuring adequate management of any critical issues in the territories where it operates.\n\n(7) It includes: financial institutions and respective governing bodies; investors; rating agencies and financial analysts.\nSome of the main priority issues identified in 2020 are listed below, highlighting the reasons and stating how they are managed by the Group.\n\n- **Occupational health and safety** \u2013 Enel considers the health, safety and psychological and physical well-being of people to be one of the Group\u2019s main priorities. Optimal management of this issue helps to generate trust and boost the commitment of people in relation to the work they perform, also helping to improve performance and raise productivity and efficiency. As a confirmation of Enel\u2019s constant commitment to safety in 2020, the total combined injury Frequency Rate (FR) for internal and vendor personnel, was down by 29% compared to 2019.\n\n- **Ecosystems and platforms** \u2013 Digitalization and the spread of new technology are accelerating the transformation of a large number of sectors. This context offers new opportunities based on the development of energy solutions that promote sustainability and make it possible to diversify the offering of the products and services the Group proposes to its customers, both influencing the traditional business and promoting the creation of new models. Innovation of products, services or processes is a strategic priority that guarantees the Company\u2019s long-term success against the background of an increasingly competitive and demanding market. In this context, the Group has included clear and precise objectives in its 2021-2023 Sustainability Plan, aimed at defining and developing new products and services, promoting the application of new technologies in the sphere of energy efficiency, electric mobility, storage, and other sustainable energy solutions. In particular, as of 2020, Enel has installed 186,000 charging points and aims to install over 780,000 by 2023 and more than 4 million by 2030.\n\n- **Sound governance and fair corporate conduct** \u2013 Enel has established a system of rules, models and control mechanisms inspired by the highest standards of transparency and fairness in management of the business, both internally and externally. This model generates trust among stakeholders, an aspect that is also reflected in the economic results and in the excellent positioning achieved in 2020 in the principal ESG ratings and sustainability indices. Among the most significant results achieved, the Company gained the highest ranking ever achieved in its 17 years of presence in the Dow Jones sustainability indices.\n\n- **Energy distribution** \u2013 Enel works constantly to develop and improve the efficiency of the distribution network, carrying out maintenance and modernization work on the existing infrastructure in all countries. This network management and development activity allows it to reduce the number and duration of service interruptions, guaranteeing its customers an adequate and constantly reliable service. Considering the key role of smart infrastructure in the energy transition, the Group has included in its 2021-2023 Sustainability Plan the installation of active smart meters for 49 million users by 2023 and more than 90 million by 2030.\n\n- **Decarbonization of the energy mix** \u2013 The fight against climate change has become one of the key challenges facing companies. In the utilities sector in particular, this has led to the development of regulations and public policies aimed at promoting a global zero emissions economy, in which electrification of the energy demand plays a key role. Institutional investors are devoting ever greater attention to the management and results of companies in relation to climate change. In this context, Enel has defined specific objectives to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), focusing on growth of renewable capacity and gradual closure of coal-fired power plants.\n\nFor further details about the 2021-2023 Sustainability Plan, please refer to the dedicated paragraph in this chapter.\n\n---\n\n8 Public and private charging points installed. Includes interoperability points, net of which there are 205 thousand charging points installed at the end of 2020.\nThe engagement of our stakeholders\n\nBased on the results of the engagement initiatives gathered during the year, the priorities attributed to the analyzed issues by the various categories of stakeholders, i.e. business community, customers, financial community, national and international institutions, civil society and local communities, media, employees, suppliers and contractors, were identified. The following tables show the categories of stakeholders with their respective degree of relevance (see the Methodological Note for further details), which highlight the respective communication channels used to engage stakeholders, the priority issues for each stakeholder and the answers provided by the Company in order to respond to the expectations of stakeholders and to continuously improve its performance.\n\n### Business community\n\n| Communication and involvement channels | Average rate of involvement per channel/type | Main high/very high priority issues for stakeholders |

remotely (meetings via Teams, Skype, etc.).\nOur sustainability strategy and contribution to sustainable development goals\n\nThe sustainable strategy developed in recent years and the integrated business model have allowed the Group to create value for all stakeholders, benefiting from the opportunities deriving from the energy transition while at the same time limiting the related risks. The Group has therefore renewed its commitment to achieving the SDGs, placing SDG 13 \u201cAction to combat climate change\u201d at the center. As a leader in the energy transition, Enel wants to drive generation in the future towards an ever-increasing development of renewable energy (SDG 7 \u201cClean and affordable energy\u201d) and the gradual phase out of coal-fired plants. Furthermore, in accordance with SDG 9 \u201cIndustry, innovation and infrastructure\u201d and SDG 11 \u201cSustainable cities and communities\u201d, the Group intends to promote the electrification of consumption and the development of new services for end customers, focusing on enabling infrastructures and the development of platform models, making the most of technological and digital evolution. The aim is to accelerate the decarbonization and electrification processes to allow the global warming containment objectives to be achieved in accordance with the Paris Agreement.\n\nTaking into account the results of the materiality analysis and in synergy with the Strategic Plan, the Group therefore defines its Sustainability Plan divided into specific objectives over a three-year period. Every year, these objectives are updated and new targets are set to ensure continuous alignment with the business strategies and the results achieved, in order to increasingly integrate sustainability along the entire value chain.\n\nLooking ahead by anticipating global trends, ensuring its strategic positioning and identifying new key stakeholders in the sustainable development ecosystem, Enel aims to identify and take advantage of opportunities. Through a sustainable business model based on clear and challenging objectives, the Group confirms its leading role in promoting and accelerating the energy transition, with an inclusive approach and leaving no one behind, creating long-term value for all stakeholders.\nEnergy transition\n\nThe future of generation\n\nWith a view to achieving complete decarbonization by 2050, Enel has further increased its ambition in the fight against climate change, raising its Scope 1 greenhouse gas reduction target to 80% by 2030 compared to 2017, equivalent to 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh, in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C scenario, as certified by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). In order to achieve this target, additional renewable capacity of around 96 GW is planned for 2030 compared to 2020, reduction in conventional capacity from the current 44% to less than 20% of the total managed capacity.\n\nElectrification, digital and platforms\n\nIn order to promote usage electrification, the Group aims to increase its range of products and services and continuously improve customer satisfaction. The main objectives include the installation of 780,000 public and private charging points for electric vehicles by the end of 2023, but also rural electrification with 230,000 connections in the three-year period. Furthermore, considering the important enabling role of infrastructure, particularly for decarbonization purposes, the Plan aims to make the network increasingly flexible and resilient, through investments in digitalization, service quality and efficiency, and to increasingly adopt platform models. The main goals set for 2023 include a reduction in the average frequency and duration of interruptions (SAIFI) and (SAIDI) of around 12% compared to 2020 and the achievement of around 49 million end users with active smart meters.\n\nPeople centricity\n\nOur people\n\nA high level of attention is devoted to the people who work for the Company, who are deemed to be key factors in the Group\u2019s sustainable strategy. In its role as an energy transition leader, Enel strongly promotes the development of upskilling and reskilling programs intended to develop existing professional skills and create new occupational profiles. As regards diversity and inclusion, Enel is strengthening its commitment to all stages of involvement, starting from selection processes, with the aim of ensuring the 50% involvement of women, up to the highest positions, establishing the specific objective of increasing the number of women managers and middle managers in the Company.\n\nLocal and global communities\n\nEnel continues to promote the economic and social growth of the local communities in which it operates with the aim of creating shared value, confirming and strengthening its specific commitment to the following SDGs in the period 2015-2030:\n\n- 5 million beneficiaries of quality education (SDG 4);\n- 20 million beneficiaries of affordable and clean energy (SDG 7.1);\n- 8 million beneficiaries of decent work and sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth (SDG 8).\n\nESG backbones\n\nWith regard to ESG backbones, the established goals are linked to the increasing attention paid to occupational health and safety, the promotion of a sustainable supply chain, an increasingly integrated governance structure and environmental management based on reducing emissions and consumption, while also promoting and preserving biodiversity.\n\nGrowth accelerators\n\nThe growth accelerators that support and speed up the achievement of the other goals set out in the 2020-2023 Sustainability Plan are innovation, with specific Proof of Concept targets and innovative projects adopted by the business; cyber security, with further attention paid to training and the dissemination of an IT security culture; digital supports, which are even more important in the current emergency; circular economy, which aims to reduce the impacts and use of resources along the entire value chain, and sustainable finance, which aims to significantly increase the use of financing instruments linked to the Group\u2019s sustainable strategy.\n\nAn overall view of all the targets established for each topic is reported at the beginning of the respective chapters, in the so-called \u201cdashboards\u201d, an example of which is shown below, indicating the target relating to the 2020-2022 Sustainability Plan, the result achieved in 2020 and the redefined or added target for the new 2021-2023 Plan.\nWe have stepped up our efforts to fight climate change and are focusing on electrification, digital and platforms.\n\nWe pay close attention to the people who work for the Company and strive to advance the economic and social growth of the local communities where we operate.\n\nInnovation, Circular Economy, Digital Media and Cyber Security are our growth accelerators.\n\nOur sustainable business model is based on the sustainable supply chain, occupational health and safety, environmental concerns and sound governance.\nAt a Glance\n\n**Trend Topic**\n\n**Appendix**\n\n**NET-ZERO AMBITION**\n\n1.

The target included in the 2020-2022 Plan and certified by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in September 2019 only referred to CO\u2082 emissions from thermal generation, which account for around 98% of Scope 1 emissions, under the new target included in the 2021-2023 Plan. In 2020, the value for all Scope 1 emissions was 234 gCO\u2082eq/kWh, down 48% compared to 2017.\n2. The 2030 Scope 1 emissions reduction target was redrafted and certified by SBTi in October 2020. Following this redrafting, Scope 1 specific emissions in 2023 will be 141 gCO\u2082eq/kWh.\n3. Includes managed capacity. The value of the additional consolidated capacity is 2.9 GW in 2020.\n4. Includes nuclear.\n5. The 2030 target is >70%.\n6. Third-party project initiatives could be developed where in-house redevelopment is not feasible.\n7. Includes sites already decommissioned, to be decommissioned, in operation and with hybridisation currently ongoing with other technologies.\n8. The perimeter of the sustainable site model also includes sites undergoing renovation and repowering (fuel replacement, gas upgrading, etc.).\n9. The rate of adoption of sustainable construction practices is the ratio between the practices adopted and the catalogue priority practices according to the site\u2019s technical characteristics.\n10. Eligible plants are the sites achieving a positive result in the annual assessment on all sites. Not included are plants with zero planned generation, small plants (<1 MW) with low local impact, plants for sale or being phased out, BSO plants with restrictions due to optimal partnerships and plants with hard-covers in the second half of 2020.\n11. The adoption rate of sustainable planting practices is the ratio of adopted practices to catalogue planned practices. Planned practices are determined following an assessment of the specific aspects of individual plants.\n12. The KPI only considers practices from the 2020 Sustainable Plant Catalogue as mapped out in the 2020 Feasibility Map.\nEnel is committed to developing a business model in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement (COP 21) to limit the average increase in global temperature to less than 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) and to continue to limit this increase to 1.5 \u00b0C. For this reason, Enel has set itself the objective of reaching the decarbonization of its energy mix by 2050, as announced publicly in 2015 when the United Nations launched its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with particular reference to SDG 13 \u201cClimate action\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, Enel, as a signatory to the Business Ambition for 1.5 \u00b0C campaign promoted by the United Nations and other institutions, is committed to fixing a long-term objective for reaching net zero emissions along the value chain by 2050, together with intermediate targets in all the pertinent areas and in line with the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). As a result, in October 2020 Enel announced a new objective of reducing its direct emissions of greenhouse gases per kWh by 80% by 2030. In comparison to the year of reference 2017, certified by SBTi and consistent with the purpose of limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C. This new commitment requires that by 2030, the Group\u2019s direct emissions are equal to 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh compared to 125 gCO\u2082eq/kWh corresponding to the previous objective of a 70% reduction that was announced in 2019.\n\nParticular attention is placed on the climate change adaptation policies in order to increase the resilience of the assets along the entire value chain, thereby limiting potentially negative impacts and guaranteeing a safe and sustainable energy service in all the countries in which the Group operates. In order to guarantee increased transparency in its communications and relationships with its stakeholders, Enel periodically reports on its related activities in line with the international standards of the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and is publicly committed to adopting the recommendations of the Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board which in June 2017 published specific recommendations for the voluntary reporting of the financial impact of climate risks. The Group has also integrated the \u201cGuidelines on reporting climate-related information\u201d published by the European Commission in June 2019.\n\nA fair and inclusive transition\n\nEnergy transition will represent an important growth and modernization accelerator for the industry thanks to the potential it offers in terms of economical development. The progressive replacement of fossil fuels with renewables will permit a greater use of electricity in the energy system, with positive repercussions in economic, environmental and social terms. To fully benefit from these opportunities, forward-looking policies are required to ensure a fair and inclusive transition that does not leave anyone behind and that considers in particular the needs of the social categories most exposed to the change, such as communities that base their economy on coal mining. If in fact energy transition will lead, in some generation sectors, to a reduction in the number of jobs, it is necessary to be ready to create new jobs and requalification opportunities.\n\nIn this context, Enel, as a signatory to the commitment promoted by the United Nations on a fair transition, is committed to accelerating the energy transition, guaranteeing that the new jobs created will be fair, decent and inclusive. In particular, it is committed to:\n\n> promoting social dialog with workers and union representatives, in compliance with the workers\u2019 rights established by the International Labour Organization (ILO), encouraging social protection (including pensions and healthcare) and salary guarantees, also in line with ILO directives;\n> collaborating with suppliers who respect these standards, at the same time contributing toward the social-economic development of the local communities most exposed to the passage from fossil fuels to renewables.\n\nEnel follows the approach of \u201cthink globally, act locally\u201d, based on which the Futur-e initiative has been developed, which promotes an inclusive transition in the areas surrounding the power plants that are undergoing this energy transition. Futur-e is the first example in the world of requalification on a large scale of an industrial area that uses an approach based on the circular economy; a vast and unique program designed to find new uses for obsolete power plants. New, innovative and sustainable uses an approach based on the circular economy; a vast and unique program designed to find new uses for obsolete power plants. New, innovative and sustainable uses\n\nWhy is it important for our stakeholders?\n\nTo accelerate the energy transition means rethinking the way in which we live and progress for both our and future generations benefit.\n\nWhy is it important for Enel?\n\nProgress towards a net-zero model opens up new markets of unimaginable size. Having anticipated this trend in time, Enel can now be the undisputed leader of this transition.\nand any loss of know-how, also involving trade unions to make sure that the various expectations of employees are satisfied;\n> promote requalification projects to write new stories of energy conversion, sustainable growth and development of innovative ideas that improve creative thought and promote business initiatives;\n> collaborate with local communities through a multi-stakeholder approach for favoring the creation of shared value along the entire project, from the preliminary interviews with the stakeholders, up to the decision regarding which requalification projects to follow;\n> guarantee the protection of the environment, soil re-mediation must be carried out according to the highest standards possible;\n> maximize the reuse of diverted structures, such as roads, infrastructures, connections to the high-voltage network, buildings, etc. in line with the principles of the circular economy;\n> contribute to the objectives of the Enel Group collaborating with the other Business Lines for the completion of projects such as BESS (Battery Energy Storage System), electric mobility, digitalization or stability of the electricity grid.\n\nThe Futur-e initiative was started in 2015 in Italy, with the purpose of giving new life to the power plants being closed (for a total of 13 GW). The approach, which proved to be successful, was therefore extended to the entire Group and will concern a portfolio of more than 40 sites on a global level.\n\nGiven the new energy-industry context, Enel\u2019s decarbonization strategy is in line with the national, European and global strategies that orient energy development toward sustainable technologies. The Group has expanded the requalification opportunities thanks to the possibility of replacing the thermal energy generation sites mainly with new renewable or hybrid power plants, integrating new business projects with complementary sustainable investments that satisfy the needs of the communities where the structures are located. These projects are located, in particular:\n> in Italy, with energy requalification in line with the transition objectives and the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (INECP), and in the non-energy area by promoting fair energy transition;\n> on the Iberian Peninsula with the progressive transition of coal-fired plants located on the peninsula (for example, Andorra in Teruel (closed in June 2020), Compostilla in Le\u00f3n (closed in June 2020), As Pontes in La Coru\u00f1a, and Carboneras in Almer\u00eda);\n> in South America, for example, with the power plants of Tarapac\u00e1 and Bocamina in Chile, where Enel is integrating the approach of fair transition, proceeding with the progressive closure of coal-fired generation (Tarapac\u00e1 and Bocamina I already closed, Bocamina II with closure planned in 2023).\n\nDuring 2020, Enel also started a collaboration with CSR Europe in order to promote a high-level dialogue for a fair and inclusive transition, which has involved a wide range of key players, such as: the European Commission, environmental organizations and labor institutions, European think tanks, private sector and youth associations. The initiative is targeted toward exploring the challenges related to the transition toward a low-carbon economy, also in light of the impacts deriving from the Covid-19 pandemic, in order to create a roadmap of concrete actions that can be actually used by companies with regard to work and employment, consumption and life style, as well as finance and investments.\n\nInvolvement of the stakeholders in the fight against climate change\n\nEnel promotes the involvement of its main external and internal stakeholders in order to increase their awareness and develop a constructive dialogue that can provide a valuable contribution toward the creation of solutions that mitigate climate change and create value for the Group. The most relevant actions carried out in 2020 include:\n> materiality analysis: climate change, in terms of priority for stakeholders and Company performance in the various countries in which it operates, was one of the topics covered when identifying the main priorities for the stakeholders for sustainability planning;\n> Enel Focus On: over the last year, two virtual meetings were held with the main players and influencers to start an open dialogue with Group management on the main challenges of energy transition. Various climate related topics were addressed, such as renewable energies and the green technologies to guide the recovery from the economic crisis related to Covid-19 and the role of the circular economy in the sustainable development of cities;\n> social media: Enel has continued using social media to raise public awareness about topics related to climate change, including decarbonization, renewable energies, electrification, electric mobility and responsible energy consumption;\n> Twenergy: a digital ecosystem launched by Endesa, Group subsidiary operating in Spain, with the objective of encouraging responsible energy consumption by collecting the opinions of experts on energy efficiency through articles, digital meetings and by supporting various sector initiatives;\n> raising the awareness of local communities: with the Creating Shared Value (CSV) model, Enel is involving local communities, making them aware of topics con-\nEnel\u2019s advocacy activities for the climate\n\nWithin its advocacy on climate change the Enel Group is firmly committed to:\n\n> ambitious climate and decarbonization targets consistent with the goals set forth by the Paris Agreement, for instance through initiatives like the \u201cCampaign on Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C\u201d promoted by the UN Global Compact and the global campaign Race To Zero, launched in 2020 from UNFCCC and High Level Champion for Climate Ambition, as a clear sign from the international community to the governments for reaching the Paris Agreement goals in view of the COP 26, in which they will be called to review the agreement conditions.\n\n> effective and efficient implementation policy mechanisms able to harness market dynamics and in doing so it fully supports putting a price on carbon;\n\n> wide stakeholder engagement on climate issues by actively contributing to multi-stakeholder coalitions such as the UN Global Compact and the World Bank\u2019s Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition;\n\n> private sector leadership on decarbonization through its continued participation in private sector initiatives such as WEF CEO Climate Leaders Alliance, IETA (International Emissions Trading Association), WBCSD (World Business Council on Sustainable Development), regional and national trade associations.\n\nEnel\u2019s policy advocacy aims to promote the decarbonization strategy of the Group and pursue the Paris Agreement goals, engaging institutional stakeholders, trade associations, non-governmental organizations and academia in order to promote our view on climate and low-carbon policies. The engagement activity with stakeholders contributes to the evolution of the regulatory frameworks towards ambitious climate goals and promotes an economy where the EU ETS drives long term investment. To do so Enel interacts directly with policy makers, contributes to the positioning of trade association, interacts with a wider set of stakeholder to create consensus and support on specific policy proposals.\n\nAccording to this policy, the Group has signed the \u201cUniting Business and Governments to Recover Better\u201d statement in 2020, a call that gathers the signatories from SBTi and Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C to encourage governments to prioritize the climate emergency despite of the economic and health crisis. As a strong supporter of carbon pricing, Enel advocates for its integration in policy making throughout the countries in which it operates. In doing so it emphasizes the importance of well-functioning carbon tax and emission trading mechanisms able to deliver short to medium term predictability supporting market efficiency as well as strong long term price signals to support long term investments and innovation.\n\nGlobal coordination of Enel\u2019s global public policy positioning on climate is ensured through the Energy and Low-Carbon Policy Unit. Such unit has the responsibility of developing global outlooks and position papers on climate policies. The latter serve as guidance for Enel\u2019s national and local advocacy as well as engagement with institutions and the wider range of stakeholders active within the climate debate in which Enel is also committed at working to ensure continued and full alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement of any association of which it is a member.\n\nAt the national level, Enel\u2019s commitment on public advocacy is pursued through specific advocacy activities as well as wider stakeholder engagement on the themes of decarbonization and the energy transition. The approach is similar to the one adopted at the global level. Advocacy goals include the promotion of greater climate ambition, carbon pricing, the accelerated penetration of RES technologies, infrastructure development and upgrade through smart grid technologies to support the energy transition, electrification as a mean of decarbonizing final energy uses. Furthermore, through its \u201cEnergy Transition Roadmap\u201d engagement platforms Enel engages with a wide range of stakeholders on the actions needed at the national level to pursue the goals of the Paris Agreement. Such platforms assume as a starting point decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement by 2050, they then proceed in identifying the technological mix necessary to achieve such long term target in 2050 as well as the medium term one of 2030, to then proceed in developing specific policy recommendations aimed at achieving such transformation. All of such activities are supported by a continuous engagement with a wide set of stakeholders.\n\nEnel\u2019s positioning on the main climate related policies and frameworks\n\nSeveral regulatory and legislative events occurred in 2020 are relevant for Enel\u2019s business and advocacy actions. In light of the increased streamlining of the climate challenge within wider global, national, regional and local policy and regulation, the number of dossiers within which Enel focuses its climate advocacy has been increasing every year. Enel\u2019s positioning on such main dossiers is presented below.\n\n> The Enel Group strongly promotes throughout the countries in which it operates an increased climate ambition in line with the Paris Agreement. Having adopted as a company SBTi targets aligned with the Paris Agreement, Enel supports public policies aimed at upscaling climate action and implementing decarbonization policies within a just transition framework. Enel\u2019s advocacy in such area is implemented through ad hoc engagement on specific legislative proposals (e.g. the EU Climate Law), but also through a wider stakeholder engagement at the national level through Enel\u2019s \u2018Energy Transition Roadmap\u2019 platform (see above). Through such platforms, Enel advocates for NDCs fully reflecting the highest possible climate ambition and fully in line with the requirements of the Paris Agreement.\n\n> Within the Paris Agreement\u2019s debate on international cooperation, Enel strongly supports a swift finalization of Article 6 implementing provisions. Such position is in line with the fact that Enel supports carbon pricing mechanisms implementation worldwide. The adoption of carbon pricing should involve Cap and Trade system in industrialized economies and in sectors where the economic barriers are relevant and price signals are valued by economic agents. Carbon pricing should take the form of environmental taxation in countries with weaker institutional and sectors characterized by distributed emission sources and where non-economic barriers are relevant. The Enel Group strongly supports carbon pricing as a means to efficiently and effectively decarbonize economic systems around the globe. Enel views on the implementation of carbon pricing have been conveyed directly and through the participation in the activities of IETA, ORLC, Eurelectric and WBCSD (World Business Council on Sustainable Development). In 2020 specific streams of activities have been devoted to analysis and advocacy on carbon pricing, at global, regional (EU and Latin America), and national levels (EU Member States, Chile, Colombia, and Peru).\n\n> Within the EU, the European Green Deal is a unique opportunity to accelerate the EU journey towards a fully decarbonized and sustainable economy especially if aligned with the mobilization of significant resources to ensure a swift recovery from the ongoing pandemic. Achieving EU\u2019s climate and environmental goals requires a new industrial strategy for reaching climate neutrality and a circular economy action plan, pursuing the decarbonization of each sector. The power sector shall aim to be completely decarbonize and ensure the decarbonization of the other sectors of the economy through direct and indirect electrification. The study \u201cSustainable paths for EU increased climate and energy ambition\u201d supported by the Enel Foundation and other sources point out the fact that electrification of end uses is necessary to achieve the EU\u2019s climate and energy targets.\n\n> The EU Climate Law should enshrine the climate and other environmental-related challenges at the core of EU vision and its inclusive and sustainable growth strategy. It should establish the long-term target of carbon neutrality at 2050 as well as the mid-term target of at least 55% reduction of GHG as the guiding objective for all other EU policies. The Law should also set a guiding vision and a governance to ensure that all EU policies, actions and strategies are aligned with the climate objective, including education, financing, R&D, innovation, fiscal policies, labor and social policies. In doing so the Law should set a principle foreseeing that all policies are designed and assessed based on a careful evaluation of their full impact. Such assessment should include the full range of multiple benefits arising including the ones on air quality, circular economy, energy efficiency. Overall, it is critical for EU\u2019s sustainable decarbonization, that the Law incorporates in a systematic way the full range of \u2018just transition\u2019 principles, establishing that EU national\nEnel welcomes the Commission\u2019s initiative to revise the EU ETS and supports the reform of the EU ETS that needs to be strengthened to pursue the increased EU climate ambition and supported by a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The Linear reduction factor should be increased to deliver the additional emission reductions required to EU ETS sectors and to provide a clear price signal to the market. The Market Stabilization Reserve should be adjusted to increase price stability balancing the market surplus. Introducing road transport and buildings sectors in the ETS should be approached with caution as it may undermine the reliability of the short to medium term carbon price signal with significant negative impacts on the just transition. The price uncertainty and volatility may have repercussions on final consumer energy bills, EU industrial competitiveness as well as long term price signals. It may also undermine the effectiveness of existing EU regulation in those sectors such as the Energy Performance of Building Directive and the CO2 standard in transport regulation. Finally, Enel supports the adoption of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to provide higher climate ambition while reducing carbon leakage risks. The implementation of the mechanisms should go side by side with intensified discussions over increased climate ambition with EU\u2019s main global trading partners.\n\nEnel supports a revision of the Effort Sharing Regulation to exploit the decarbonization potential of final uses of energy in the increased EU climate ambition. The revision should consider updating upwards the ESR targets by Member State in line with the 2030 increased ambition. Ambition needs to be aligned with 2050 climate neutrality, to avoid lock-in in emitting infrastructure, but price impacts needs to be smoothed. Multiple benefits enable a deviation from cost-efficiency criteria as decarbonization of transport and buildings brings about environmental benefits not accounted in GHG costs. The overall burden sharing should balance cost efficiency and at the same time favor a fair allocation of efforts.\n\nEnel welcomes the Commission\u2019s initiative to revise the Renewable Energy Directive. Enel believes the key contributions to decarbonize in a cost efficient way the energy sector, as well as buildings, heating and cooling, transport and industry will come from the further electrification of final uses (direct electrification and indirect electrification for hard-to-abate sectors via renewable hydrogen). Within such context, low-carbon fuels should be excluded from the scope of this Directive. Enel believes that the EU regulatory framework needs to provide long-term predictability to investors as well as streamlined and harmonized permitting procedures. Finally, Enel supports a technology neutral approach, while creating the conditions for fully sustainable technologies to compete on a level playing field in efficiently delivering the overarching targets of decarbonization, penetration of renewable resources and energy efficiency.\n\nWithin the EC hydrogen strategy, the Enel Group is actively promoting the renewable hydrogen (i.e. produced via electrolysis fed by 100% RES power). Enel believes this to be the only truly sustainable production pathway for hydrogen, at zero greenhouse gas emissions and fed by renewable sources. Hydrogen is best used as a complement to electrification, and not as competitor. It has an efficient role to decarbonize those parts of the economy that cannot be easily or economically electrified, i.e. the hard-to-abate sectors, such as heavy industry, aviation, shipping.\n\nWithin the smart and sustainable mobility strategy the Enel Group is actively promoting the Electrification of transport sector it is crucial the rapid and full deployment of electromobility at EU level. Enel fully supports the EU Renovation Strategy and is actively engaging in the discussions preparing the revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and other EU legislation relating to buildings. The building sector is one of the sectors most lagging behind in decarbonization. Critical issues exist in terms of value chain, building efficiency, building smartness, choice of energy source. Enel believes it can contribute substantially to the decarbonization of the building sector with efficient electric technologies such as heat pumps, by improving the building\u2019s efficiency through digitalization, by making buildings dynamic elements of energy system providing storage, demand side response, EV charging.\n\nEnel\u2019s engaged different stakeholders on The EU Commission\u2019s New Circular Economy Action Plan, emphasizing the importance of ensuring the circularity of key supply chains especially in the areas of EVs, batteries and renewable energy technologies. Furthermore, Enel\u2019s advocacy highlighted the methodological need to develop appropriate circular economy metrics on one hand, while on the other focus on the high potential urban environment through the implementation of clear smart city circular visions.\n\nWithin the Zero Pollution dossier and other environmental dossiers the Enel Group is actively promoting maximizing the synergies between decarbonization policies and other environmental policies. Within such context the synergies between climate and air quality policies is maybe the most critical one and electric technologies can play a key role in fighting climate change, improving local air quality and increasing the circularity of the EU economic system. Land and soil management is vital to a circular economy and therefore the new soil strategy should consider the re-purposing of decommissioned industrial sites and reuse of brown fields to avoid further land take and soil pollution.\n\nIn addition to the position outlined above on specific issues, the Enel Group actively contributes within the debate of how to best upscale action to address the climate change challenge. Such activities included the following:\n\nEnel has had an active role during several preparatory events toward the next COP 26 of Glasgow dealing with different climate change policy issues, such as the climate ambition/net-zero challenge, carbon pricing schemes and international carbon markets.\n\nEnel\u2019s GSEP\u2019s 2019-20 Presidency focused on exploring electrification partnerships along and across industrial value chains. The Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership (GSEP) is a unique CEO-led alliance of leading global electricity companies promoting\nEnel\u2019s participation in associations and organizations\n\nThe Group plays an active role in various sector associations and organizations with the objective of promoting topics regarding energy transition and climate commitment on a national and global level.\n\nEnel commits to ensure that the various industrial associations and think tanks to which it is a member operate in compliance with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Therefore, Enel systematically checks the consistency of the associations\u2019 positions with the climate policies shared at Group level. This process is guaranteed at two stages: (i) before joining the Association, though an in-depth analysis of the entity\u2019s statute; (ii) after joining the Association, either by taking positions of responsibility within the Association or by influencing the associations\u2019 positioning within the working groups.\n\nWhere the association external positioning is not aligned with Enel\u2019s own view, the company assesses whether the misalignment might be harmful for the effectiveness of Enel\u2019s own advocacy and positioning and might eventually decide to step out of the Association. As an example, in the last years, we have withdrawn our participation in some associations whose view on climate policies and on how to deliver the energy transition was persistently different from our own.\n\nFor what specifically concerns the European framework, in 2020 Enel engaged in various energy relevant associations (foremost Eurelectric, Wind Europe, Solar Power Europe, EASE, EDSO, SmartEn) and prestigious think tanks (Bruegel, Friends of Europe) as well as in some sustainability policy oriented initiatives, holding also relevant positions in their governance systems. In particular, the most relevant developments over the course of 2020 are:\n\n- appointment of Enel representative as Chair in the Electricity & Sustainability Committee in Eurelectric and of Enel representative as Chair in the working group on social sustainability;\n- appointment of Enel executive as EASE Chairman;\n- appointment of Enel executive as Chairman within the Executive Committee of ETIP SNET (technology pillar of the EU\u2019s energy and climate policy);\n- appointment of Enel Board member in the Battery European Partnership Association (BEPA);\n- appointment of Enel President in Solar Power Europe (solar PV leading association in Europe).\n\nEnel influences the associations\u2019 activities on the decarbonization policies thanks to the participation of Enel representative in the working groups and through studies and policy papers. As the EU and national governments set out to implement a range of climate policies, Eurelectric and the Enel Foundation launched the flagship study, \u201cE-quality\u201d. The study provided an analysis of how some types of policies affect households with different incomes, what can be done to address any disproportionate effects and what will be the impact of Covid-19 crisis in this process. In October 2020, as EU was preparing to launch the Recovery package that aimed to speed up the climate transition to climate neutrality by 2050 while at the same time reigniting the EU economy, Eurelectric advocated for this package to support the digital and climate transition.\n\nSome of the international associations with which Enel collaborated actively in 2020 are listed below.\n### Main Climate Policy Positions\n\n| Industry association | Description | Level of alignment to End Climate position | Main actions | Enel\u2019s main role in the association | Main actions developed in 2020 |\n|----------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Eurelectric          | The Union of the Electricity Industry - Eurelectric is the sector association which represents the common interests of the electricity industry at pan-European level, plus its affiliates and associates on several other continents.

Each area is responsible for managing the risks and opportunities related to climate change for their own area of competence.\n\nThe Holding Functions are responsible for consolidating the scenario analysis and managing the strategic and financial planning process aimed toward promoting a sustainable business model by putting the fight against climate change at the center of its strategy.\n\nThe Global Business Lines are responsible for the development of activities related to promoting renewable generation, the optimization of heat capacity, the digitalization of the electricity grid and the development of business solutions that enable energy transition and the fight against climate change.\n\nThe Global Service Functions are responsible for adopting sustainable criteria, including climate change, in supply chain management and developing digital solutions that develop the development of technologies enabling energy transition and the fight against climate change.\n\nOn a local level, the Regions and Countries have the task of promoting decarbonization and guiding the energy transition toward a low-carbon business model, within their areas of responsibility. Furthermore, the Europe Function is responsible for defining the Group\u2019s position on climate change, low-carbon policies and the regulation of the international carbon market on a European level.\n\nAdditionally, the Group Investments Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, grants approval for the expenses for investments related to business development. This committee also has the task of guaranteeing that all investments are fully in line with the Group\u2019s commitment to promoting a low-carbon business model and reaching decarbonization by 2050.\n\nIncentives system concerning climate change\n\nThe Company\u2019s remuneration policy includes different mechanisms in order to progress toward energy transition, in particular:\n> a variable short-term remuneration (MBO) that can include objectives relative to the specific company function of each manager. For example, they can include objectives related to the development of renewable energies for the managers in the Global Power Business Line or related to energy transition solutions in the Enel X Global Business Line;\n> a long-term variable remuneration that, starting in 2018, includes a quantitative climatic objective, that is, the reduction of Enel Group CO\u2082 emissions per kWh\u209c\u2090\u209a.\nThe Enel governance model to tackle climate change\n\nEnel\u2019s impact on climate change\n\nElectric energy is essential to guarantee the sustainable progress of modern societies and represents a key factor in reaching the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, in particular SDG 7, to guarantee everyone accessible, reliable, sustainable and modern energy, and SDG 13, regarding climate action.\n\nThe generation of electricity has always played a key role in climate change, as the use of fossil fuels is a considerable source of greenhouse gas emissions. Technological development, in particular in the area of renewable energies, has however completely transformed this scenario by making electricity one of the main solutions for reducing the carbon footprint world-wide. Enel is aware of these impacts and implements specific actions to minimize them, promoting the decarbonization of the energy system and the electrification of the energy demand. As a result this reduces the greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain.\n\nEnel\u2019s generation from fossil fuels (mainly coal and gas) has traditionally represented the main source of greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, in 2020 the direct emissions (Scope 1) related to generation from fossil fuels were equal to about 44.8 million tonnes of CO\u2082, whereas indirect emissions (Scope 3) related to the extraction and transport of fuels were equal to 1.2 million tonnes of CO\u2082 (also considering those related to the transport of raw materials). Enel is reducing this impact by accelerating the decommissioning of coal-fired plants, with a reduction of capacity in 2020 equal to 2.8 GW compared to 2019. In parallel, the Group is increasing the development of renewable capacity that, together with the contribution of nuclear generation, has avoided 74.8 million tonnes of CO\u2082 emissions. Furthermore, Enel is actively committed to the development of electricity storage systems that support the integration of renewable capacity, with a total installed capacity of 123 MW in 2020. The decarbonization of the energy mix also has a positive impact on the reduction of indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2) associated with the acquisition of electricity to cover the requirements of business activities.\n\nThe management of the electricity grid involves the generation of indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2) associated with technical energy losses on the grid, equal to 3.6 million tonnes of CO\u2082 in 2020 (according to the \u201clocation based\u201d calculation methodology). Enel is actively investing in the digitalization and automation of the electricity grid to reduce these losses and increase reliability, while promoting the diffusion of renewables in the energy system.\n\nWith regard to the end customer, even if Enel does not have a direct impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions in the retail market, the use of products sold by its own customers generates greenhouse gas emissions that are accounted for as indirect emissions (Scope 3). In particular, the emissions connected to the use of electricity sold to customers equaled approximately 25.0 million tonnes of CO\u2082, whereas those related to gas sold equaled 21.5 million tonnes of CO\u2082. Enel regularly monitors these emissions and adopts measures aimed at minimizing them. Furthermore, Enel offers its customers technical solutions to reduce carbon emissions related to their energy consumption in a wide range of sectors, including transport, property management as well as industrial processes and services. For example, with Enel X the Group is promoting the deployment of charging infrastructures for electrical vehicles (186 thousand charging points installed in 2020), the development of energy efficiency solutions, distributed generation, consultancy services, smart public lighting and circular cities.\nClimatic scenarios\n\nThe Group develops short-, medium- and long-term scenarios for the energy industry and for macroeconomic and financial conditions in order to support its strategic and industrial planning, the evaluation of investments and extraordinary corporate transactions. The role of climate change in these scenarios is increasingly important and produces analyzable effects in terms of:\n\n- acute phenomena (heat waves, flooding, hurricanes, etc.) and their potential impact on industrial assets;\n- chronic phenomena related to structural changes in the climate, such as the rising trend in temperatures, rising sea levels, etc., which can cause, for example, changes in the output of generation plants and in electricity consumption profiles in the residential and the commercial sector;\n- transition of the various industrial and business sectors toward a green economy characterized by ever lower emissions of climate-altering gases.\n\nThe issues connected with future trends in climate variables (in terms of acute and chronic phenomena) define the so-called \"physical scenario\", while the issues associated with the industrial and economic transition toward solutions to reduce atmospheric concentrations of CO\u2082 are the characteristic elements of the \"transition scenario\". The scenarios are created within the scope of a complex framework that ensures coherence between climate projections and the transition assumptions, within which to evaluate the phenomena identified in a short, medium and long-term period.\n\nThe adoption of these scenarios and their integration into corporate processes takes account of the guidelines of the TCFD and enables the assessment of the risks and opportunities connected with climate change. For this reason, the Group has created a channel of constant dialog and collaboration with experts on climate change, for example the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) of Trieste. Furthermore, it is structured for managing high-resolution post downscaling climatic scenarios and has started projects for developing the skills needed to translate the complexity of climate models into information that is useful for understanding the effects, at a local level, on business and support strategic decisions.\n\nThe acquisition and processing of the large amount of data underlying the scenarios, and the identification of the methodologies and metrics needed for interpreting complex very-high-resolution phenomena require a continuous dialog with both external as well as internal references. For this purpose, the Group is using a platform approach, using tools that guarantee solid and accessible information. The process that translates the scenario phenomena into information that is useful for industrial and strategic decisions can be summarized in five steps:\n\n1. identification of phenomena relevant for business (for example, the impact on electric demand, heat waves);\n2. development of linking functions between climatic/transition scenarios and operational variables;\n3. identification of event trends based on scenario data (for example, intensity and frequency);\n4. impact calculation (for example, variation in margins, damage, Capex);\n5. strategic actions: definition and implementation (for example, resilience plans, capital allocation).\n\nThe physical climate scenario\n\nThe Group has selected three of the climatic projections developed by the \"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\" (IPCC) on a global scale, characterized by specific emissions level connected to the so-called \"Representative Concentration Pathway\" (RCP) as shown in the following table.\n\nIn the RCP 8.5 climate projections, the geographical areas of the Mediterranean and Central/South American will suffer an impact in terms of temperature increase and rainfall\n\n| SCENARIO | AVERAGE TEMPERATURE INCREASE IN COMPARISON TO PRE-INDUSTRIAL LEVELS (1850-1900) |\n|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| RCP 2.6  | +1.8 \u00b0C by 2100 (the IPCC estimates a 78% probability of staying below +2 \u00b0C). The Group uses this scenario for the assessment of physical phenomena and for the analysis that consider an energy transition coherent with ambitious objects in terms of mitigation |\n| RCP 4.5  | +2.4 \u00b0C by 2100. Enel has identified this scenario as the one that is best suited for representing the current global climatic and political context and is coherent with the overall estimates of temperature increase that current policies consider and as announced on a global level |\n| RCP 8.5  | +4.3 \u00b0C by 2100. Compatible with a worst case scenario where no particular measures are taken to combat climate change |\n\n(1) IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Working Group 1, \u2018Long-term Climate Change: Projections, Commitments and Inversibility\u2019.\n(2) Climate Action Tracker thermometer, global warming estimates for 2100 considering the current \u2018Pledge/Target\u2019 (updated as of December 2020).\nreduction. These effects will become more pronounced in the second half of the century and the impact increasing up to 2100. In the RCP 2.6 scenario, the effects will be similar but less intense, with the trend slowing in the second half of the century, thereby producing a substantial differential between the two scenarios in 2100.\n\nThe climate scenarios are global in nature. Accordingly, in order to determine the effects in the areas of relevance for the Group, as previously described, a collaborative initiative has been started with the Earth Sciences department of the ICTP of Trieste. As part of this collaboration, the ICTP provides projections for the main climate variables with a grid resolution that varies from approximately 12 km to approximately 100 km and a forecast horizon of 2030-2050. The main variables are temperature, rainfall and snowfall and solar radiation. With respect to the analysis carried out in 2019, the current study is no longer based on the use of only one regional climate model (the one from ICTP) but is based on the combination of three models that are selected as representatives of the ensemble of the climate models currently found in literature. This technique is usually used in the scientific community to obtain a more robust analysis that is free of bias, mediated by the various assumptions that could characterize the single model.\n\nIn this phase of the study conducted in 2020, the future projections were analyzed for Italy, Spain and Brazil obtaining, also due to the use of the ensemble of models, a more definite representation of the physical scenario. The analyses performed on the physical scenarios considered both chronic and acute phenomena. Some of these phenomena require an additional level of complexity, as they do not only depend on climatic trends but also on the specific characteristics of the territory, and require an additional modelling activity for their high-resolution representation. For this reason, in addition to the climate scenarios provided by ICTP, the Group also uses the Natural Hazard map. This tool provides, with high spatial resolution, the return times for a series of events, such as, for example, storms, hurricanes and floods. The use of this tool, as described in the section \u201cRisks and strategic opportunities related to climate change\u201d, is widely consolidated in the Group, which already uses this data based on a historical perspective to optimize the insurance strategies. Furthermore, work is under way in order to be able to use this information also when processed in compliance with the projections of the climate scenarios.\n\nItaly\n\nAcute phenomena: the heat waves were defined in collaboration with the ICTP and Infrastructure and Networks to obtain a description of the climate phenomenon most suitable for characterizing the critical event for business. The identified conditions (at least five straight days of high temperatures without precipitation) were searched for in the 2030-2050 projections supplied by ICTP, finding an increase in this phenomena both in terms of frequency and geographic distribution in all the analyzed scenarios. In particular, a considerable worsening of the RCP 8.5 scenario was found, especially on the islands and in the southern areas of the country.\n\nIn these scenarios, the intensity of extreme rain and snowfall events increases, but their frequency declines compared with historic trends. Also the risk of fire can be conditioned by climate change. The Group performed an analysis using the Fire Weather Index (FWI), which takes factors such as relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed and temperature into account. The days at extreme risk were selected during the 2030-2050 period and compared with those during 1990-2010. In all the analyzed scenarios, there was an increase in days at extreme risk compared to historical values, with different intensities on a geographical level. In some regions, the RCP 2.6 scenario shows a slightly higher number of days at extreme risk compared to other scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), due to factors such as less humidity, which contribute toward the assessment of the fire risk.\n\nChronic phenomena: the average annual temperature is expected to increase over the 2030-2050 period with increases in all the analyzed scenarios. In particular, for the 2030-2050 period, an average temperature increase in comparison to the pre-industrial period, of approximately 1.4 \u00b0C is expected and within an interval between 1.1 and 2.0 \u00b0C for the RCP 8.5 scenario. In the RCP 4.5 scenario, instead, an increase is expected between 1.0 and 1.7 \u00b0C with an average value of approximately 1.3 \u00b0C. Whereas for the RCP 2.6 scenario, the interval is 0.9-1.5 \u00b0C with an average value of approximately 1.2 \u00b0C. The differential between the RCP 2.6 scenario and the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios will increase significantly during the second half of the century. Chronic changes in temperature can be analyzed to obtain information on the potential effects on cooling and heating demand in local energy systems. As indicators for the measuring of the heating requirements, Heating Degree Days (HDD) were used, which is the sum, extended to all days of the year with T_{\\text{mean}} < 18 \u00b0C, of the differences between the indoor temperature (T_{\\text{indoor}} assumed as 18 \u00b0C) and the average temperature, and the Cooling Degree Days (CDD), which is the sum, extended to all days of the year with T_{\\text{mean}} > 24 \u00b0C, of the differences between the T_{\\text{mean}} and T_{\\text{indoor}} (assumed as 21 \u00b0C), respectively for heating and cooling requirements. During the 2030-2050 period, there is a 17% reduction in the need for heating compared to 1990-2017 which remains constant in all the scenarios, whereas the CDD always remains higher with respect to historical data, with a growing trend passing from the RCP 2.6 scenario (+55%) to RCP 8.5 (+91%).\n\nIt should be pointed out that, with respect to the analysis performed in 2019, the RCP 4.5 scenario was introduced, and the ensemble of multiple models was used as the database, as previously described. Furthermore, to give more importance to the more populated areas, the HDD and CDD were calculated as an average by country, weighing every geographical node by its population through the use of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) associated with each scenario.\nAcute phenomena: over the 2030-2050 period, heat waves are expected to increase appreciably in frequency, with their geographical spread expected to expand, especially in the southern area of the country. Extreme rainfall will increase in intensity but its frequency will decline. At the same time, extreme snowfalls will largely remain located in the current geographical areas but their frequency and intensity could decline sharply. As regards the fire risk, the number of days at extreme risk is higher in the RCP 8.5 scenario compared to the RCP 2.6 scenario, and always with an increase in comparison to the historical average.\n\nChronic phenomena: the average annual temperature during 2030-2050 is expected to increase with respect to pre-industrial levels in every scenario. In particular, for the 2030-2050 period, an average temperature increase, in comparison with the 1850-1900, of approximately 1.6 \u00b0C is expected (min +1.2, max +2.1 \u00b0C) for the RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 4.5 scenario instead foresees an average increase of approximately 1.3 \u00b0C (min +1.0, max +1.7 \u00b0C), whereas the RCP 2.6 scenario foresees finally an average increase of approximately 1.1 \u00b0C with an interval between 0.8 and 1.4 \u00b0C. In terms of HDD and CDD, during 2030-2050, in comparison to 1990-2017 there is a reduction in HDD (-7%) and an increase in CDD (+13%) in the RCP 2.6 scenario, passing to HDD and CDD values that arrive respectively to -27% and +31% in the RCP 8.5 scenario.\n\nBraz\u00edl\n\nAcute phenomena: the trend of acute phenomena in countries very large such as Brazil, can show significantly different trends in the various areas. Our analyses focus on the areas of interest for the Group. For example, the first studies carried out for the State of S\u00e3o Paulo show an increase in heat waves. In Brazil, the climate projections estimate a larger average reduction in precipitations in the north, with extreme phenomena to be analyzed on a local scale. From the first analyses, the number of days with an extreme fire risk seems to be projected with an increase both in the RCP 8.5 scenario and with respect to the RCP 2.6 scenario in comparison to the historical average, with greater criticality in the central-west and north-east areas of the country. As for precipitation, also the fire risk will be analyzed in more depth on a local scale based on the needs of the Group. Keep in mind that these considerations are the result of analyses performed based only on one climate model and not on an ensemble of multiple models, as was done for Italy and Spain.\n\nChronic phenomena: the average annual temperature during 2030-2050 is expected to increase with respect to pre-industrial levels in every scenario. In particular, for the 2030-2050 period, an average temperature increase, in comparison with the 1850-1900, of approximately 1.6 \u00b0C is expected (min +1.2, max +2.1 \u00b0C) for the RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 4.5 scenario instead foresees an average increase of approximately 1.3 \u00b0C (min +1.0, max +1.7 \u00b0C), whereas the RCP 2.6 scenario foresees finally an average increase of approximately 1.1 \u00b0C with an interval between 0.8 and 1.4 \u00b0C. In terms of HDD and CDD, during 2030-2050, in comparison to 1990-2017 there is a reduction in HDD (-7%) and an increase in CDD (+13%) in the RCP 2.6 scenario, passing to HDD and CDD values that arrive respectively to -27% and +31% in the RCP 8.5 scenario.\n\nThe transition scenario\n\nThe transition scenario refers to the description of how the generation and consumption of energy evolves in various sectors in an economic, social and regulatory context consistent with different trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, therefore, correlated with the RCP climate scenarios. The scenarios used by the Group on a global level are the result of a benchmark analysis of external scenarios and currently known policy objectives. For the main countries where the Group is present, it processes coherent transition scenarios, using energy system models; if internal models are not available, risks and opportunities are evaluated by analyzing scenarios produced by third parties, as described previously.\n\nThe main assumptions considered when defining the transition scenarios concern:\n\n- the local policies and regulatory measures to fight climate change, such as measures for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, increasing energy efficiency, the decarbonization of the electricity sector and the reduction in oil consumption;\n- the global macroeconomic and energy context (for example, in terms of gross domestic product, population and commodity prices), considering international benchmarks such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), and others. As regards IIASA, for example, consideration was given to the fundamentals driving the commodity demand underlying the \u201cShared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)\u201d, in which different scenarios are projected that describe socioeconomic and policy evolution in line with the climate scenarios. The information deriving from the \u201cSSPs\u201d is used, together with internal models, to support the long-term forecasts, such as, for example, those for commodity prices and electric demand;\n- the evolution of technologies for generation, conversion and energy consumption, in terms of both technical operating parameters and costs.\n\nBased on the described context, the transition scenario framework the Group used as a basis for the impact analysis regarding the risks and opportunities inherent to climate change considers two scenarios: one \u201cInertial\u201d (Reference), established mainly based on current or announced policies as well as specific internal assumptions regarding the evolution of individual variables of interest, and a more ambitious one \u201cBrighter Future\u201d, in line with reaching the Paris goals, which presupposes stricter objectives in terms of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and increases in energy efficiency, as well as the possible acceleration in the reduction in cost of some technologies. This second case involves an incremental growth in electric generation from renewable sources and a greater demand in electricity due to the increased electrification of final consumption, guided mainly by more ambitious objectives in terms of energy efficiency and decarbonization.\n\nIf the countries with greatest emissions do not adopt effective decarbonization policies, instead pursuing policies...\nthat produce no change or actually worsen conditions, any particularly ambitious transition trajectories defined on a local level could co-exist with worsening climate change scenarios with respect to the Paris goals. In fact, the ambitions of individual countries regarding mitigation actions are not sufficient on their own to determine long-term trajectories of emissions and the resulting RCP pathways. To process the transition scenarios related to the countries included in the analysis, the Group has equipped itself with quantitative tools that incorporate assumptions regarding the evolution of policies, technologies and other context variables to produce corresponding projections for energy demand, electricity demand, electricity generation, the penetration of renewables and electric vehicles, etc. In short, all the variables that characterize a national energy system relevant to the Group\u2019s activities.\n\nOnce the medium-long term transition scenarios have been determined, the adopted scenario framework will make it possible to analyze the longer-term chronic physical effects determined on a local level by the considered climatic pathways. An example is the analysis of the impact of the change in temperature on electric demand. For this purpose, the two scenarios Reference and Brighter Future for Italy and Spain, as previously described, were integrated with the HDD and CDD of RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6 respectively. This made it possible to quantify the effect that temperature change has on energy demand (total, not just electric) for cooling and heating in residential and commercial sectors. The time period on which the analysis concentrates refers to the period from 2030 to 2050, during which the current European Union policy regarding the goal of carbon neutrality, in both scenarios Reference and Brighter Future, converge in 2050 toward decarbonized and electrified energy systems.\n\nThrough the use of integrated energy system models, it is possible to quantify the individual service demands for a country. This level of detail makes it possible to distinguish the specific effects that temperature change can have on energy requirements. Considering the entire time period that was analyzed, the scenario of reaching carbon neutrality faster provided by Brighter Future is more efficient and electrified in comparison to Reference. This difference in the speed of transition involves an average increase in electric demand than the increase in temperature resulting from climate change.\n\nWith the purpose of further analyzing what effect temperature has on the transition scenarios, and at the same time expand the range of assumptions concerning climate change, a sensitivity analysis was performed associating the Reference scenario with RCP 8.5, as well as RCP 4.5. Assuming such an additional increase in temperature, with the same energy transition, leads to an increase of less than 1% in demand in the Reference RCP 8.5 with respect to the one with RCP 4.5. If on the one hand the trends regarding day degrees are similar, the substantial difference between Italy and Spain concerns the energy system at 2030. For the latter, in fact, the Reference scenario is very similar to Brighter Future, in line with the national energy plan that already appears very challenging. As a result, the effect of the temperature between RCP 2.6 and 4.5 remains, as for Italy, less than 1% and in the same direction, and the effect relative to transition remains negligible.\n\nIf for Italy and Spain the role of temperature is contained, Brazil, which is another country of particular interest for the Group, could have a more considerable increase in demand due to the increase in temperature, equal to a few percentage points of total demand. This is caused by the greater demand for cooling expected in the country. These estimates are in any case subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty, given the significant volatility of Brazil\u2019s economic growth.\n\nThe sustainable strategy developed in recent years and the integrated business model have allowed the Group to create value for all stakeholders, benefiting from the opportunities that emerge from the energy transition and from climate action. Capital employment is in fact centered on decarbonization, through the development of generation assets from renewable sources, in enabling infrastructure linked to the development of networks, and on the adoption of platform models, fully exploiting technological and digital evolution, which will favor consumption electrification and the development of new services for end customers. The aim is to accelerate the decarbonization and electrification processes to allow the global warming containment goals to be achieved in accordance with the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn this context, it becomes fundamentally important to extend the strategic vision to the medium-long term. Guided by this need, in November 2020 Enel presented the new Strategic Plan with a vision that arrives up to 2030, with its strategy focusing on the acceleration of the energy transition together with sustainable and remunerative growth to create a significant share value for customers, society and the environment, in addition to an interesting profit for shareholders over time. Thanks to platform-based models, during this decade utilities will reinforce their guiding role at the vertex of increasingly complex systems, which will include a growing number of distributed generation assets, with an increasingly active role of end customers. A digital platform-based and multi-layer model that connects data and solutions will be of fundamental importance for going through and successfully completing this transformation phase.\n\nAs a \u201cplatform-based\u201d operator, the Group will be able to take advantage of new opportunities to create value using two complementary business models:\n\n- the Ownership business model, in which the platforms are promoters of business to support the profitability of direct investments in renewables, grids and customers and that supports sustainable long-term growth, in which the operative platform-based models also perform an important enabling role;\n- the Stewardship business model, in which the Group offers services with high added value, products or know-how, by means of platforms that mobilize investments by third parties to maximize the creation of value. In this way, the Group intends to mobilize 190 billion euros in investments during 2021-2030, promoting decarbonization, the electrification of consumption and the development of platforms for creating shared and sustainable value for all stakeholders and medium- and long-term profitability. The Group intends to directly invest approximately 160 billion euros, of which more than 150 billion euros by means of the Ownership business model and approximately 10 billion euros through the Stewardship model, mobilizing at the same time an additional 30 billion euros from third parties.\n\n2030 vision\n\nWithin the scope of energy generation, the increase in renewable capacity with the simultaneous reduction in thermal capacity, which includes the early closure of the coal-fired plants in the Brighter Future scenario, is a two-fold strategy that the Group intends to use to reach the decarbonization of its generation mix.\n\nThe investments planned for the energy generation activity in the Ownership business model for 2021-2030 include a\nDuring 2021-2023, Enel plans to directly invest approximately 40 billion euros, of which 38 billion euros through the Ownership business model, mainly in the growth of grids and renewables, and approximately 2 billion euros in the Stewardship model, while mobilizing at the same time 8 billion euros from third parties.\n\nWith reference to the business of renewable energies, both business models will allow Enel to construct approximately 19.5 GW of new renewable capacity during the three years of the plan:\n\n- within the framework of the Ownership business model, Enel plans to invest a total of 16.6 billion euros, of which 15.7 billion euros for the development of more than 15.4 GW of new capacity, mainly in countries with an integrated presence;\n- within the framework of the Stewardship business model, Enel plans to mobilize a total of 3.8 billion euros, of which 500 million euros in direct investments and 3.3 billion euros from third parties. This investment will lead to 4.1 GW of new capacity.\n\nOrdinary EBITDA connected to energy generation is expected to reach approximately 77 billion euros in 2023, an increase of 11.6% compared to 70 billion euros in 2020. This growth will be driven by the business of renewables, whose ordinary EBITDA is expected around 6.5 billion euros in 2023 (+1.8 billion euros compared to approximately 4.7 billion euros in 2020), but with a drop in ordinary EBITDA for thermal generation to approximately 1.2 billion euros in 2023, from approximately 2.2 billion euros in 2020.\n\nIn the Infrastructure and Networks business, Enel expects to invest 16.2 billion euros in the three-year period, increasing the average annual investment to approximately 5.4 billion euros. 65% of this amount will be used for improving service quality and grid resilience, approximately 23% for new connections and approximately 12% for digitalization. The ordinary EBITDA of Infrastructure and Networks is expected to be approximately 9.5 billion euros at the end of 2023, with an increase of 23.4% as compared to approximately 77 billion euros in 2020.\n\nThe remaining amount is associated with the Customer business, where the value of residential customers (B2C) is expected to increase approximately 30% in comparison to an increase of approximately 45% for business customers (B2B) as a result of the expansion in the free market customer portfolio and the electrification trends of energy consumption that promote demand for \u201cbeyond commodity\u201d services. Finally, in the B2G segment, the Group expects to continue supporting the progress cities are making toward climate change.\n\nMain risks and opportunities connected with climate change\n\nThe process of defining the Group\u2019s strategy is accompanied by a careful analysis of the risks and opportunities connected to it, also including the aspects related to climate change. Every year, before the Board of Directors ex-\namines the Strategic Plan, the Control and Risk Committee is presented with a quantitative analysis of the risks and opportunities related to the Group\u2019s strategic positioning, which includes aspects related to the climate, such as regulatory factors and weather-climatic events. In order to identify the main types of risk and opportunity and their impact on the business associated with them in a structured manner consistent with the TCFD, we have adopted a specific framework that explicitly represents the main relationships between scenario variables and types of risk and opportunity, specifying the strategic and operational approaches to managing them, comprising mitigation and adaptation measures. Two main macro-categories of risks/opportunities are identified:\n\n- those connected with developments in physical variables;\n- those connected to the evolution of the transition scenarios.\n\nThe framework makes it possible to analyze and evaluate the impact of the physical and transition phenomena according to solid, alternative scenarios that were created using a quantitative and model-based approach in combination with continuous dialog both with internal stakeholders and with authoritative external references. The framework also highlights the relationships that link the physical and transition scenarios with the potential impact on the Group\u2019s business. These effects can be assessed from the perspective of three time horizons: short-medium term (1-3 years), in which sensitivity analyses based on the Strategic Plan presented to investors in 2020 can be performed; medium term (until 2029), in which it is possible to assess the effects of the energy transition; and long term (2030-2050), in which chronic structural changes in the climate can potentially begin to emerge.\n\n### FRAMEWORK OF MAIN RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n| Scenario phenomena | Time horizon | Risk & opportunity category | Description | Impact | Management approach |\n|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|\n| Acute physical     | Starting with short term (1-3 years) | Extreme events | Risk: especially extreme weather/climate events. Extreme events can damage assets and interrupt operations. | The Group adopts best practices to manage the restoration of service as quickly as possible. We also work to implement investments in resilience (Italy case). With regard to risk assessment in insurance, the Group has a loss prevention program for property risk that also assesses the main exposures to natural events. Looking forward, the assessments will also include the potential impacts of long-term trends in the most significant climate variables. | |\n| Chronic physical   | Starting with long term (2030-2050) | Market | Risk/opportunity: increase or decrease in electricity demand increase or decrease in output. Electricity demand is also affected by temperature, whose fluctuation can impact our business. | The Group\u2019s geographical and technological diversification means that the impact of changes (positive and negative) in a single variable is mitigated at the global level. In order to ensure that operations always take account of weather and climate phenomena, the Group adopts a range of practices such as, for example, weather forecasting, real-time monitoring of plants and long-term climate scenarios. | |\n| Transition         | Starting with medium term (2024-2029) | Policy & Regulation | Risk/opportunity: policies on CO2 prices and emissions, energy transition incentives, greater scope for investment in renewables and resilience regulation. Policies concerning the energy transition and resilience can impact the volume of and returns on investments. | The Group is minimizing its exposure to risks through the progressive decarbonization of its generation fleet. The Group\u2019s strategic actions, which are focused on investment in renewables, networks and customers, enable us to mitigate potential threats and exploit the opportunities connected with the energy transition. The Group is also actively contributing to the formation of public policies through its advocacy efforts. These activities are conducted with platforms for dialogue with stakeholders called \u201cEnergy Transition Roadmaps\u201d that explore national decarbonization scenarios in the various countries in which Enel operates in environmental, economic and social terms. | |\n\n### Identification, assessment, and management of risks and opportunities related to physical phenomena\n\n#### Chronic physical risks\n\nThe main impacts of chronic physical changes can produce similar effects on the following variables:\n\n- **electricity demand**: variation in the average temperature level with a potential increase or reduction in electricity demand;\n- **thermal generation**: variation in the level and average temperatures of the oceans and rivers, with effects on thermal generation;\n- **hydroelectric generation**: variation in the average level of rainfall and snowfall and temperatures with a potential increase and/or reduction in hydro generation;\n- **solar generation**: variation in the average level of solar radiation, temperature and rainfall with a potential increase and/or reduction in solar generation;\n- **wind generation**: variation in the average wind level with a potential increase and/or reduction in wind generation.\n\nAs regards the effects of chronic physical changes, the Group will work to estimate the relationships between changes in physical variables and the change in the potential output of individual plants in the different categories of generation technology. Scenario analysis has shown that chronic structural changes in the trends of physical variables will begin to occur in a considerable manner starting from 2030. How-\never, in order to obtain an indicative estimate of the potential impacts, it is possible to test sensitivity of the Industrial Plan to the factors potentially influenced by the physical scenario, regardless of any direct relationship with climate variables. Of course, such stress testing has an extremely low probability of occurrence based on historical events and geographical diversification. The variables examined are: electricity demand (+/-1% per year), whose variations can potentially impact the generation and retail businesses. It was stress tested for all countries in which the Group operates. The output potential of renewables plants was also stressed (+/-10% over a single year). Variations in this variable can potentially impact the generation business. It was stressed separately at the individual technology level around the globe. The data reported show the effect on a single year for a single generation technology and include both the volume and price effects.\n\n### Acute physical risks\n\nWith regard to acute physical phenomena (extreme events), their intensity and frequency can cause significant and unexpected physical damage to assets and generate negative externalities associated with the interruption of service. Within the scope of scenarios regarding climate change, the acute physical component continues playing an extremely important role when defining the risks to which the Group is exposed, both due to the wide geographical diversification of its asset portfolio and due to the primary importance of the renewable natural resources for the generation of electricity.\n\nIn the various cases, the acute physical phenomena such as wind storms, floods, heat waves, severe cold, etc. demonstrate a high level of intensity yet do not have a very high occurrence frequency in the short term, but, considering the medium and long-term climatic scenarios, this will increase considerably in the future.\n\nFor the reasons described above, the Group is currently managing the risk from extreme events in the short term. At the same time, it is extending its methodology also to longer time periods (until 2050) according to the identified climate change scenarios (RCP 8.5, 4.5 and 2.6).\n\n### Methodology for evaluating the risk of extreme events\n\nIn order to quantify the risk deriving from extreme events, the Group refers to a consolidated methodology for analyzing the catastrophic risk used in the insurance sector and in IPCC reports. Through its own insurance business units and the captive insurance company Enel Insurance NV, the Group is managing the various phases connected to risks deriving from natural catastrophes: from the assessment and quantification to the corresponding coverages to minimize the impacts. The methodology applies to all extreme events that can be analyzed, such as wind storms, heat waves, tropical cyclones, floods, etc. In all of these types of natural catastrophes, however, three independent factors can be identified that are summarized below:\n\n- **The probability of the event (hazard):** that is its theoretical frequency over a specific period of time, the so-called \u201creturn time\u201d. A catastrophic event that has a return time of 250 years, for example, implies that it can be associated with a probability of 0.4% that it will occur in a year. This information, which is necessary for assessing the frequency of the event, is then associated with its geographical distribution with respect to the various areas where portfolio assets are located. For this purpose, the Group uses hazard maps, which associate, for the various types of natural catastrophes, each geographical point on the global map with the corresponding estimate of the frequency associated with the extreme event. This information, which is organized in geo-referenced databases, can be provided by global reinsurance companies, meteorological consultancy companies or academic institutions.\n\n- **The vulnerability:** that, in percentage terms, indicates how much value is lost and/or damaged upon occurrence of the catastrophic event. In more specific terms, therefore, it is possible to refer to the damage to the material assets the impact on the continuity of generation and/or distribution of electricity, and also the provision of the electric services offered to the end customer.\n\nThe Group creates and promotes specific vulnerability analyses, especially in the case of damage to its assets, related to every technology in its portfolio: solar, wind, hydroelectric power plants, transmission and distribution grids, primary and secondary substations, etc. These analyses are then, of course, focused on the extreme events that have greater impact on the various types of technology: as a result, this defines a matrix that associates the individual natural catastrophic events with the corresponding type of asset that is impacted in a considerable manner.\n\n- **The exposure:** which represents the set of economic values in the Group portfolio that can be considerably impacted by the occurrence of natural catastrophic events. Also in this case, the scopes of the analyses are specific to the various generation technologies, for the generation assets and for the services to the end customer.\n\nThe combination of the three factors described above \u2013 hazard vulnerability and exposure \u2013 provides the fundamental element for assessing the risk deriving from extreme events. From this point of view, the Group differentiates the risk analysis with respect to the climate change scenarios, depending on the specific nature of the various associated time periods. In the case of the vulnerability of assets in the portfolio, the priorities of the impact of the various extreme events have on the various technologies have been defined.\nManaging the risk of extreme events\nOver the short term (1-3 years) the Group, in addition to what was illustrated above in terms of risk assessment and qualification, will implement actions targeted toward reducing the impacts on business due to extreme catastrophic events. It is possible to distinguish two main types of actions: defining an effective insurance coverage and the various activities related to preventing damage that could result from extreme events.\n\nThe main components of these actions are described below and, in the case of activities related to preventing and mitigating the damage, specific reference is made to the Group\u2019s Generation and Infrastructure and Networks Global Business Lines.\n\nEnel Group insurance\nEvery year, the Group defines global insurance programs for its business in the various countries where it operates. The two main programs, in terms of scope of coverage and volumes, are as follows:\n\n- **Property Program**, for material damage that can be caused to the assets and the resulting interruption in business. Therefore, in addition to the cost for the new reconstruction of the asset (or its parts), also the economic losses due to their shutdown in terms of generation and/or distribution of electricity are also remunerated according to the limits and conditions defined in the policies;\n- **Liability Program**, this covers third party damage following the impacts that extreme events can have on the assets and on the Group\u2019s business. Starting from an effective assessment of the risk, suitable limits and insurance conditions can be defined in the insurance policies and this also applies in the case of natural extreme events related to climate change. In fact, in this latter case, the impacts on business can be considerable but, as shown in cases that occurred in the past and in various areas around the world, the Group has shown absolute resilience thanks to the wide insurance coverage limits, which are also the result of a solid reinsurance structure, as regards the Group\u2019s captive company Enel Insurance NV.\n\nManagement of acute physical risks regarding the generation of electricity\nThe Group performs various control activities to manage the impact of weather events on electricity generation, including:\n\n- **weather forecasting** both to monitor renewable resource availability and detect extreme events, with warning systems to ensure the protection of people and assets;\n- **hydrological simulations**, territory surveys (also using drones), monitoring of possible vulnerabilities using digital GIS systems (Geographic Information System) and satellite measurements;\n- advanced monitoring of more than 100 thousand parameters (with more than 160 million historical measurements) detected on dams and hydroelectric civil works;\n- real-time remote monitoring power plants.\n\n- **safe rooms in areas exposed to tornadoes and hurricanes**;\n- **adoption of specific guidelines for carrying out hydrological and hydraulic studies that are targeted, from the first development phases, toward assessing risks inside the plant and toward areas external of the plant, with the application of the principle of hydraulic invariance during the design of the draining and mitigation works**;\n- **check of potential climatic trends for the main project parameters in order to keep the dimensioning of the systems into account for relevant projects (for example, assessments of the temperature of a cold source to guarantee greater flexibility for cooling the new CCGT)**;\n- **estimate of extreme wind speed using updated databases containing the registers and historical trajectories of hurricanes and tropical storms, with the resulting selection of the wind turbine technology that is best suited to the conditions that were found**.\n\nFurthermore, the Group has performed work for improving the physical resilience of its electric generation plants, including:\n\n- **improving cooling water management systems for certain plants in order to counter the problems caused by the decline in water levels in rivers, such as the Po in Italy**;\n- **installing fogging systems to improve the flow of inlet air and offset the reduction in power output caused by the increase in ambient temperature in CCGTs**;\n- **installing drainage pumps, raising embankments, periodic cleaning of canals and interventions to consolidate land adjacent to plants to prevent landslides in order to mitigate flood risks**;\n- **periodic site-specific reassessment for the hydroelectric plants for flood scenarios using numeric simulations**. The processed scenarios are managed with mitigation actions and through interventions on the civil works, dams and intake systems.\n\nManagement of acute physical risks regarding infrastructures and the electricity grid\nThe Group has prepared specific policies and actions targeted toward facing the various aspects and various risks inherent to climate change within the scope of the infrastructures and the electricity grid. In particular:\n\n- **policy for preparation and recovery during emergencies**: indicates the guidelines and measures targeted toward improving the preparation strategies, mitigating the impact of total interruptions and, finally, restoring service to the largest number of customers possible as quickly as possible;\n- **Guidelines for the Resilience Plan of the electrici-\nThe 4R approach for improving the resilience of the electricity grid\n\nOver recent years, in order to deal with extreme climatic events, the Enel Group has adopted an approach called 4R, which uses a specific policy to define the measures to adopt, both when preparing for an emergency on the grid, and to quickly restore service ex post, that is when the climatic events cause damage to the assets and/or disconnections. The 4R strategy is divided into four phases:\n\n1) **Risk Prevention**: includes actions that make it possible to reduce the probability of losing grid elements due to an event and/or to minimize its effects, such as interventions able to increase the robustness of the infrastructure and maintenance operations. The first, in particular, do not aim to improve the service quality, rather to reduce the risk of prolonged and extended interruptions in the care of rare critical events with a large impact, according to a probabilistic approach.\n\n2) **Readiness**: includes all measures that aim to improve the timeliness with which potentially critical events are identified, ensuring coordination with the Civil Protection Department and local officials, as well as to prepare the necessary resources once a grid disconnection has occurred.\n\n3) **Response**: represents the phase for assessing the operating capacity for facing an emergency when an extreme event occurs, which is directly correlated to the ability to mobilize operating resources in the field and the possibility to perform remote controlled operations to restore service via resilient backup connections.\n\n4) **Recovery**: is the last phase which has the goal of reconnecting the grid as soon as possible with ordinary operating conditions, in the cases in which an extreme weather event cause interruptions in service in spite of the previously adopted measures for increasing resilience.\n\nIdentification, assessment and management of risks and opportunities related to transition phenomena\n\nAs regards the risks and opportunities associated with transition variables, we consider the different reference scenarios in combination with the elements that make up the risk identification process (e.g. competitive context, long-term vision of the industry, materiality analysis, technological evolution, etc.) to identify the drivers of potential risks and opportunities, with priority on events with greater relevancy. The main identified risks and opportunities are illustrated below.\n\n**Policy and regulation**\n\n- **Limits on emissions and carbon pricing**: the enactment of laws and regulations that introduce more stringent emissions limits by government action (non-market driven) and market-based mechanisms, such as a carbon tax in non-ETS (Emissions Trading System) sectors or an expansion of the ETS in other sectors.\n- **Opportunities**: command & control regulations and market-based mechanisms strengthening CO2 price signals to foster investment in carbon-free technologies.\n- **Risks**: lack of a coordinated approach among the various actors and policy-makers involved and limited effectiveness of the policy instruments deployed, with an impact on the speed of the trend toward electrification and decarbonization in the various sectors, compared with a decisive group strategy focused on the energy transition.\n\n**Incentives for the energy transition**: development incentives and opportunities with a view to the energy transition, consequently guiding the energy system toward the use of low-emission energy resources as the mainstream approach in the energy mixes of countries, greater electrification of energy consumption, energy efficiency, flexibility of the electrical system and upgrading of infrastructure, with a positive impact on the return on investment and new business opportunities.\n\n- **Opportunities**: additional volumes and greater margins due to additional investment in the electricity industry, in line with the electrification strategy, de-carbonization and the upgrading/digitalization of enabling infrastructure.\n- **Risks**: obstacles to achieving energy transition targets due to regulatory systems that do not effectively support the energy transition, delays in permitting processes, no upgrading of the electricity grid, etc.\n\n**Resilience regulation**: improvement of standards or introduction of ad hoc mechanisms to regulate investments in resilience in the context of the evolution of climate change.\n\n- **Opportunities**: benefits from investments that reduce service quality and continuity risks for the community.\n- **Risks**: in the case of especially severe extreme events with a greater-than-expected impact, there is a risk that recovery could be slower than planned, with an associated reputational risk.\n\n**Financial measures for energy transition**: incentives for the energy transition through appropriate policy measures and financial instruments, which should be capable of supporting an investment framework and a long-term, credible and stable positioning of policy-makers. Introduction of rules and/or public and private financial instruments (e.g. funds, mechanisms, taxonomies, benchmarks) aimed at integrating sustainability into financial markets and public finance instruments.\n\n- **Opportunities**: the creation of new markets and sustainable finance products consistent with the investment framework, activating greater public resources for decarbonization and access to financial resources in line with energy transition objectives and the related impact on costs and on finance charges; introduction of subsidized support tools (funds and calls) for the transition.\n- **Risks**: actions and instruments not sufficient to provide incentives consistent with an overall positioning tailored to the energy transition, uncertainty or slowdown in the introduction of new instruments and rules due to the deterioration in the public finances or differences in application in the geographic areas in which the Group operates.\n\n**Market**\n\n- **Market dynamics**: the market dynamics, such as those connected with the variability of commodity prices, the increase in electricity consumption due to the energy transition and the penetration of renewables, have an impact on business drivers, with effects on margins and on generation and sales volumes.\n- **Opportunities**: positive effects associated with the growth in electricity demand and the greater room for renewables and all sources of flexibility.\n- **Risks**: exposure of \u201cmerchant\u201d technologies to the volatility of market prices.\n\n**Technology**\n\n- **Penetration of new technologies**: gradual penetration of new technologies such as storage, demand response and green hydrogen; digital lever for transforming operating models and \u201cplatform\u201d business models.\n- **Opportunities**: investments in developing technology solutions.\n\n**Products and services**\n\n- **Electrification of residential consumption**: with the gradual electrification of end uses, the penetration of products with lower costs and a smaller impact in terms of residential emissions will expand (for example, the use of heat pumps for heating and cooling).\n- **Opportunities**: increase in electrical consumption in the context of reducing energy consumption, thanks to the improved efficiency of the electric carrier.\n- **Risks**: additional competition in this market segment.\n\n- **Electric mobility and electrification of industrial consumption**: use of more efficient and effective modes of transportation from the point of view of climate change, with a special focus on the development of electric mobility and charging infrastructure; electrification of large-scale industrial consumers.\n- **Opportunities**: positive effects of the increase in electricity demand and greater margins connected with the penetration of electric transportation and the relative beyond commodity services.\n\nUnlike chronic climate impacts, developments in the transition scenario could have impacts in the short and medium-long term (by 2030) as well. To instead quantify the risks and opportunities deriving from the energy transition in the long term, two transition scenarios described in the \u201cTransition scenario\u201d paragraph have been considered for Italy and Spain. The effects on the variables most relevant for business have been identified, in particular in the Brighter Future scenarios, that is the electricity demand (driven by increased electrification of consumption) and the generation energy mix. These considerations offer a basis for determining the Group\u2019s strategic positioning in terms of resource allocation. A greater ambition in terms of decarbonization and energy efficiency involves the dynamics related to energy transition that can provide greater opportunities for the Group. In particular, in the retail electricity market, the progressive electrification of final consumption \u2013 especially for trans-\nport and the residential sector \u2013 will lead to a considerable increase in electrical consumption to the detriment of other energy vectors. In reference to the economic impacts that may result from the change in the transition scenarios, the Group has performed some analyses regarding impacts in terms of EBITDA that the Brighter Future scenario would have on 2030 results compared to the Reference scenario. Considering the level of ambition defined in the national plan, the two scenarios in Iberia do not foresee substantial increases in the penetration of renewable energies, and therefore no considerable impacts are estimated resulting from variations in the price of energy. In Italy, on the other hand, the Brighter Future scenario enables greater penetration of renewable energies, with additional effects on installed capacity, which is partially balanced by a possible reduction in energy prices. Similar effects are highly probably in other Countries and Regions, such as in North America. In reference to the electrification of consumption, instead, the Brighter Future scenario shows higher penetration rates for the most efficient electrical technologies. In particular, the considerable increase in electrical vehicles and heating/cooling systems that use heat pumps will cause a 5% increase in demand as compared to the Reference scenario, which is estimated to determine positive impacts both on the retail business and on the services offered by Enel X. The greater penetration of heat pumps could also generate a reduction in the sales of gas in the retail area, due to the gradual transition toward the electric carrier: the overall effect is however estimated as being positive from the point of view of EBITDA results, together with a reduction in CO\u2082 emissions connected to the Scope 3 SBTi goals. The Brighter Future scenario, as previously seen, will involve a considerable increase in complexities that must be managed by the grids in various countries and regions. A significant increase is expected in fact in distributed generation and in other resources, such as storage systems, greater penetration of electric mobility with the relative charging infrastructures, as well as the increasing rate of electrification of consumption and the introduction of new actors with new methods of consumption. This context will involve a decentralization of the extraction/feed-in points, an increase in electric demand and the average requested power, a considerable variation in energy flows, which will require dynamic and flexible grid management. The Group therefore expects that in this scenario incremental investments will be necessary to guarantee the connections and suitable levels of quality and resilience, by promoting the adoption of innovative operating models. These investments must be accompanied by coherent policy and regulation scenarios to guarantee suitable economic returns for the Infrastructure and Networks Business Line.\n\n### Enel\u2019s performance in the fight against climate change\n\nIn 2020, Enel\u2019s carbon footprint was equal to 98.0 MtCO\u2082eq (26% lower than 2019), mainly due to the reduced generation of electricity from fossil fuels, divided as follows:\n\n- **Scope 1**: 45.3 MtCO\u2082eq (35.3% decrease compared to 2019) which represents 48% of total GHG emissions. 99% of these emissions is produced by thermal power. Furthermore, the percentage of emissions related to EU ETS is equal to 53% of the total Scope 1 (compared to 49.5% in 2019).\n- **Scope 2**: 5.0 MtCO\u2082eq (7% decrease compared to 2019) which represents 5% of total GHG emissions. Furthermore, 71% of the Scope 2 emissions are related to the technical grid losses in the distribution grid.\n- **Scope 3**: 47.7 MtCO\u2082eq (56% decrease compared to 2019) which represents 49% of total GHG emissions. The use of sold assets (electricity and gas retail market) represented 98% of the footprint of these emissions. The GHG inventory statements were audited by DNV GL, one of the main certification bodies world-wide, with a reasonable level of certainty for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, as limited to the sale of natural gas, and with a limited level of certainty for the other Scope 3 emissions included within the scope of application of the inventory. The audit was conducted according to Standard ISO 14064-3 for the compliance of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories with the WBCSD/WRI Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol).\n\nFor more details concerning Enel\u2019s carbon footprint, refer to the 2020 GHG inventory (accessible in the web site in the Sustainability section).\nOur carbon footprint\n\n| VALUE CHAIN | Electricity generation | Electricity distribution | End customer | Other |\n|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------|\n| GLOBAL BUSINESS LINE | | | | |\n| GHO SCOPE 1 direct emissions (MTCO\u2082eq) | | | | |\n| 1 | Thermal generation | Other | SF\u2086 losses | Auxiliary motors | Including in source \u201c5\u201d |\n| 2 | | | | | |\n| 3 | | | | | |\n| 4 | | | | | |\n| 5 | Sites and offices | Company fleet |\n| 6 | | | | |\n| GHO SCOPE 2 indirect emissions (MTCO\u2082eq) location based | | | | |\n| 7 | Electricity purchase | | | |\n| 8 | Technical losses from the grid | Electricity purchase | Including in source \u201c10\u201d |\n| 9 | | | | |\n| 10 | | | | |\n| GHO SCOPE 3 indirect emissions (MTCO\u2082eq) | | | | |\n| 11 | Coal (upstream) | Diesel & fuel oil (upstream) | | |\n| 12 | | | | |\n| 13 | Transportation of other raw materials and waste (upstream) | | | |\n| 14 | Sale of electricity | | | |\n| 15 | | | | |\n| TOTAL DIRECT EMISSIONS GHG SCOPE 1 (MTCO\u2082eq) | | | | |\n| TOTAL INDIRECT EMISSIONS GHG SCOPE 2 (MTCO\u2082eq) location based | | | | |\n| TOTAL INDIRECT EMISSIONS GHG SCOPE 3 (MTCO\u2082eq) | | | | |\n| TOTAL EMISSIONS GHG (MTCO\u2082eq) | | | | |\n\nOur ESG performance\n\n| Source | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| Generation from thermal sources | Combustion of fossil fuels in generation activities (CCOT, oil & gas and coal thermal plants).

New goals in line with the Paris Agreement have been defined, in particular the percentage of reduction in Scope 1 emissions at 2030 was increased from 70% to 80% compared to 2017. This target is in line with a 1.5 \u00b0C pathway, as certified by SBTi.\n\nThe Net-Zero commitment\n\nFurthermore, Enel, as a signatory to the Business Ambition for 1.5 \u00b0C campaign promoted by the United Nations and other institutions, is committed to fixing a long-term objective for reaching net-zero emissions along the value chain by 2050, including both direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2 and 3), together with scientific goals in all pertinent areas and in line with the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\n| GHG goal | Area | Climatic scenario | Main drivers and actions for reaching the goal |\n|----------|------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Short term (2023) | 148 gCO\u2082eq/kWh | 100% of Scope 1 GHG emissions | - Gradual phase-out of 90% of coal-fired capacity during 2021-2023 (percentage weight of coal-fired capacity on consolidated capacity from 2016% in 2020 to approximately 1% in 2023). |\n| Medium-long term (2030) | 82 gCO\u2082eq/kWh | 100% of Scope 1 GHG emissions | - Acceleration of the abandonment of coal from 2030 until 2027 (gradual elimination of 16 GW of coal-fired capacity during the period 2027-2027). |\n| | 21.2 gCO\u2082eq/kWh | 100% of Scope 3 emissions related to the sale of natural gas in the end-user market (Scope 3 category \u2018use of sold products\u2019) | - Investments equal to 65 billion euros to accelerate the development of renewable energy by installing 75 GW of renewable capacity during 2021-2030 to reach 120 GW of consolidated renewable capacity by 2030 (3 times the installed renewable capacity in baseline year 2017). |\n| Long term (2050) | 0 gCO\u2082eq/kWh | 100% of Scope 1 GHG emissions | - Goal of gradually eliminating thermal capacity and of reaching a 100% renewable energy mix. |\n\n(1) Even if Enel constantly monitors Scope 2 emissions and is actively committed to their reduction, the Company has not set a specific reduction target, as they represent less than 4% of total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2017 (baseline year of the target certified by SBTi). Therefore, they are considered marginal and fall within the criteria of exclusion according to the SBTi methodology, which fees a margin of 5% of total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n\n(2) The target could not be officially validated by SBTi because \u201cthe targets must cover at least 5 years and maximum 15 years from the date in which the target is presented to SBTi for official validation\u201d. However, they satisfy the 1.5 \u00b0C pathway defined by SBTi for the electric services sector (Sector Decarbonization Approach, SDA).\n\n(3) With respect to the Group\u2019s net-zero commitment, which includes both direct and indirect emissions, precise targets will be defined for Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions that are in line with the \u201cNet Zero Standard\u201d being developed by SBTi.\n\nDecarbonization roadmap in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C pathway, SBTi certified\n\nSCOPE 1\n\n| Year | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2023 | 2030 | 2050 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| gCO\u2082eq/kWh | 414 | 372 | 298 | 214 | 148 | 82 | -80% |\n\nSCOPE 3 GAS RETAIL\n\n| Year | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2023 | 2030 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| gCO\u2082eq/kWh | 25.3 | 25.4 | 23.9 | 21.5 | 21.2 | -16% |\n\n(1) Includes all direct emissions (GHG Scope 1), 99% of which are due solely to energy generation, in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C pathway of the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\n(2) Includes all indirect emissions (GHG Scope 3 - Use of Sold Products) relating to gas sales in the retail market by 2030, in line with the 2 \u00b0C pathway of the Science Based Targets initiative.\nFinancial, operational and environmental metrics\n\nThe main metrics and financial goals regarding the risks and opportunities connected to climate change, as well as the operational metrics along the entire value chain and the environmental ones, are reported below.\n\nFinancial metrics\n\n| Financial metric | UM 2020 | 2019 | 2020-2019 % |\n|------------------|---------|------|-------------|\n| Ordinary EBITDA for low-carbon products, services and technologies (1) | bil euros | 15.6 | 16.2 | -0.6 | -3.8 |\n| % of tot EBITDA | 87 | 91 | -4 | - |\n| Capex for low-carbon products, services and technologies (2) | bil euros | 9.8 | 9.1 | -0.5 | -4.9 |\n| % of tot Capex | 94 | 92 | 2 | - |\n| Revenues from coal plants | bil euros | 1.6 | 2.8 | -1.2 | -42.0 |\n| % of tot Revenues | 25 | 35 | -10 | - |\n| Revenues from thermal generation | bil euros | 75 | 103 | -28 | -271 |\n| % of tot Revenues | 11.6 | 12.8 | -1.2 | - |\n| Revenues from nuclear plants | bil euros | 1.4 | 1.3 | 0.1 | 4.9 |\n| % of tot Revenues | 2.1 | 1.6 | 0.5 | - |\n| Debt ratio with sustainability criteria (3) | % | 33 | 22 | 11 | - |\n| CO2 reference price | euros | 24.7 | 24.8 | -0.1 | -0.3 |\n\n(1) The \u201clow-carbon products, services and technologies\u201d category considers the Global Power Generation (excluding conventional generation), Infrastructure and Networks, Enel X and Market Business Lines (excluding the sale of gas).\n(2) The 2018 value was redefined to account for the fact that in Latin America and North America (Mexico), the values concerning large customers managed by the generation companies were reallocated to the Market Business Line.\n(3) The value was calculated considering the impact of the financial/instruments, which include sustainability criteria for the entire gross debt.\n\nIn 2020, Enel\u2019s ordinary EBITDA associated with low-carbon emission technologies, services and solutions equals 15.6 billion euros, with a 3.9% reduction compared to 2019, mainly due to the impact of the Covid-19 emergency on the sale of energy to end users, which was partially compensated by greater generation of renewables. The Capex dedicated to low-carbon emission technologies, services and solutions has increased as compared to 2019, reaching 9.5 billion euros, equal to 94% of total Capex.\n\nRevenues from coal plants, following the Company\u2019s strategic decisions that have inspired a sustainable business model that pursues, among others, the objectives of fighting climate change and decarbonization, are continuing to decrease. In particular, in 2020 revenues related to coal plants amounted to 1.6 billion euros (a 42.0% decrease as compared to 2019), equal to 2.5% of the Group\u2019s total revenues. Furthermore, total revenues from thermal generation (coal, oil & gas and CCOT) represent 11.6% of total revenues, equaling 75 billion euros (a 271% increase as compared to 2019).\n\nEnel\u2019s strategy of promoting a sustainable financial model has contributed to reaching 33% of the debt related to the sustainability objectives.\n\nThe generation of electricity in 2020 has a decrease of 22 TWh (-9.6%) compared to the value recorded in 2019. In particular, this decrease results from the reduced generation from thermal power (-275 TWh), mainly due to reduced coal-fired generation (-24.4 TWh), which was partially compensated by greater generation from renewable sources (+6.0 TWh).\n\nThe energy Enel produced in 2020 from zero emissions sources amounts to more than 63% of total consolidated generation (a significant increase in comparison to 2019, equal to 55%), whereas it is equal to 65% including the generation of capacity managed according to the Stewardship model (equal to 9.9 TWh in 2020).\nIn order to contribute toward the decarbonization of its energy mix, in 2020 Enel increased its renewable installed capacity by 2.9 GW, while reducing its coal-fired capacity by 2.8 GW. As a result, consolidated installed capacity from zero emissions sources is approximately 58% (56% considering only renewable sources) when including capacity managed according to the Stewardship model (equal to 3.6 GW in 2020).\n\nIn 2020, Enel played a fundamental role in developing new solutions for accelerating the process of energy transition through the development of 13 MW of storage capacity, corresponding to a growth of 12% in comparison to 2019, and maintaining the approximate 6 GW of demand response basically unvaried compared to 2019.\n\nThe digitalization of the electricity grid, which has been identified as a key enabler able to positively influence climate change through levers such as the integration of more renewable energy or an increase in energy efficiency, continued being a priority for Enel also in 2020. In particular, in 2020 the total number of end users with active smart meters grew 1.1% as compared to the previous year, reaching 44.3 million in 2020. Enel has also continued defining solutions for promoting the decarbonization of other sectors, such as transport. The Company is in fact committed to developing electric mobility initiatives and promoting sustainable transport, reaching more than 105 thousand installed charging points at the end of 2020, a 32.3% increase in comparison to 2019.\n\nEnvironmental metrics\n\nThe following table presents the environmental metrics related to climate change, in addition to the greenhouse gas emissions previously described in the dedicated paragraph of this chapter.\n\n| Environmental metric | UM | 2020 | 2019 | 2020-2019 | % |\n|----------------------|----|------|------|-----------|---|\n| Specific water withdrawal for total generation (1) | kWh | 0.20 | 0.33 | -0.13 | -39.4 |\n| Water withdrawal in water stressed areas (2) | % | 23 | 25 | 2 | - |\n| Generation with water withdrawal in water stressed areas (2) | % | 11 | 8 | 3 | - |\n\n(1) Based on the classification provided by the WRI \u201cAqueduct Water Risk Atlas\u201d, the water stressed areas are those where the ratio between the total annual withdrawal of surface water or groundwater for different uses (civil, industrial, agricultural and livestock) and the total annual renewable water supply available (\u201cbase water stress\u201d, understood, therefore, as the level of competition between all users) is high (40-80%) or extremely high (>80%). By way of greater environmental protection, we have also considered as placed in water stressed areas those plants falling in areas classified by the WRI as \u201carid\u201d.\n\n(2) Even if the indicator shows an increased percentage of withdrawals and consumption in water stressed areas, the absolute values show a decrease compared to the previous year, due to reduced generation of the relative plants.\nTargets\n\nThe following table shows the main operational goals included in the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan and in the 2030 vision that reflect Enel\u2019s role in the fight against climate change along the entire electricity value chain, in addition to the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions as described in the previous section.\n\n| Segment of the electricity value chain | Target description | UM | 2023 | 2030 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------|----|------|------|\n| GENERATION                            | Net installed maximum capacity (1) | GW | >90  | >170 |\n|                                        | - of which renewables | %  | 65   | >80  |\n|                                        | - of which thermoelectric | %  | 31   | -    |\n|                                        | - of which nuclear | %  | 4    | -    |\n|                                        | Net generation (2) | TWh | 245  | ~400 |\n|                                        | - of which renewables | %  | 65   | >80  |\n|                                        | - of which thermoelectric | %  | 24   | -    |\n|                                        | - of which nuclear | %  | 11   | -    |\n|                                        | New services | | | |\n|                                        | Generation with storage system (BESS) | TWh | -    | 20   |\n|                                        | New hybrid renewable plants with storage (BESS) | %  | -    | 30   |\n|                                        | Generation of green hydrogen | t  | 0.000 | 5    | >90  |\n|                                        | Installed green hydrogen capacity | GW | 0.12 | >2   |\n|                                        | New hybrid renewable plants with hydrogen | %  | -    | 8    |\n| DISTRIBUTION                          | Digitalization | | | |\n|                                        | Smart meter | mil | 49   | >90  |\n|                                        | Smart meters (coverage) | %  | 64   | 100  |\n| MARKET                                | Electrification, energy efficiency and digitalization | | | |\n|                                        | Charging points for electric mobility | mil | 0.78 | >4   |\n|                                        | Electric buses | mil | 5.5  | >10  |\n|                                        | Smart public lighting | mil | 3.4  | >4   |\n|                                        | New services | | | |\n|                                        | Demand response capacity | GW | 10.6 | 20   |\n|                                        | Storage capacity | MW | 527  | -    |\n\nFurthermore, the following assumptions were defined:\n> EBITDA incidence for low-carbon products, services and technologies equal to 91% in 2023;\n> Capex incidence for low-carbon products, services and technologies on the total equal to approximately 90% in 2021-2023;\n> incidence of sustainable financial mechanisms equal to approximately 48% in 2023 and above 70% in 2030.\n\nFinally, Enel is committed to improving its performance in other environmental aspects concerning climate change, fixing increasingly ambitious goals, such as the 65% reduction in water requirements for the electricity generation process by 2030.

Reliability, safety and continuity of distribution, innovation, customized digitalization, together with quality, effectiveness and transparency in the sale of energy and services have characterized and characterize each stage of our relationship with customers. We are committed to remain customer centric, providing them with quality products and services throughout the world.\n\nIn 2020, 484.6 TWh were transported on the Group\u2019s distribution grid (507.7 TWh in 2019) and the final number of energy and gas customers was almost 70 million, much the same as in 2019 (70 million). Energy sales amounted to 298.2 TWh in 2020, down by 74% compared to 2019. Enel also manages a demand response capacity of around 6 GW.\n\nWhy is it important for our stakeholders?\n\nReduce environmental impact, generate cost savings, ensure a high quality experience: this is what the new generation of customers expects from players like us who are committed to sustainability, and who aim to become the best reference point on the market.\n\nWhy is it important for Enel?\n\nElectrification and digitalization guide our new relations with our customers. We have created an ecosystem of products and services that make sustainability accessible to everyone.\n\nOperational excellence and distribution quality\n\nThe future of the world depends on successful acceleration of the energy transition; today, the distribution network plays an important role in facilitating this evolution, supporting the decarbonization and electrification processes. In the coming years, it will be essential to increase the use of electricity in all those sectors that still rely heavily on fossil fuels, while ensuring at the same time that the grid is capable of carrying an ever higher percentage of renewable: currently the most sustainable and economic form of energy generation.\n\nAs a modern DSO (Distribution System Operator), we tackle the dual challenge of remaining virtuous in modern economies and helping the emerging economies to access energy. The grid must become ever more \u2018intelligent\u2019, modern and digital. At the same time, as physical infrastructure in the territory, the grid is ever more exposed to such climate change related phenomena as flooding, drought, scorching heat and extreme cold. This can be addressed by increasing the security, resilience and reliability of grids, in order to continue guaranteeing high service quality standards to the end customer.\n\nToday, our Grid is \u2018networked\u2019, which means that electricity can be distributed from a point of generation to a point of delivery via various possible routes. This structure implements the concept of resilience, being the ability of the Grid to suddenly find an alternate supply route if there is a fault on the usual route.\n\nGiven the vast size and complexity of our Grid, which comprises 2.2 million km of lines throughout the world, the monitoring and management of these reconfigurations in the shortest possible time require a high degree of digitalization. Due to the remote collection in real time of large quantities of data about the state of the grid, today\u2019s technology enables us to respond suddenly to alterations affecting our lines. This data is collected and processed in control centers, which have real-time information about the state of the entire Grid so that it can be monitored and managed.\n\nFor this system to work, we need data collection devices like the digital meter that, in addition to measuring consumption, enable us to take remote action. This meter in fact talks to other nodes, the concentrators, that for now...\norganize the measurement data before transferring it to our systems, but which will soon become key data processing centers. This data is aggregated via the secondary and primary substations, before arriving at the central infrastructure. Digitalization of the entire chain from us to the customer means that all this activity can be carried out quickly and in a secure manner.\n\nSmart meters are therefore the cornerstone of distribution grid innovation and digitalization work, the driving force behind urban redevelopment and fundamental enablers of advanced home automation. From the beginning, their installation has been accompanied by specific information and awareness campaigns, given that energy savings of 10% can be achieved by using this technology, particularly thanks to the real-time availability of energy use information.\n\nAt the end of 2020, 44.3 million end users had an active smart meter and 18.2 million end users had second-generation meters (CE2G).\n\nIn addition to transmitting detailed measurement data (daily 15-minute load curves) to the concentrator, the latter provide a customer-dedicated communication channel for access to such services as demand response, energy efficiency (for example, a warning that available power is being exceeded and the limiter is being activated), the promotion of awareness and home automation, and the customization of tariffs, allowing the introduction of innovative forms of contract. A more advanced communication standard will be introduced during 2021, making new Active-Demand applications available. We have also launched the \u2018Circular Smart Meter\u2019 project, which aims to reduce the environmental footprint of smart meters through, for example, the end-of-life use of their materials, starting with plastic and copper. For further details, see the \u2018Circular economy\u2019 chapter of this document.\n\nIn this context, the distributor plays a new role as system orchestrator, since the grid is not just a highway for electrons, but also the traffic warden who directs the flow and the \u2018service station\u2019 that offers new opportunities.\n\nA Grid is usually established to meet local needs and so there are many variants. Grid Blue Sky seeks to go beyond this reality by imagining the unified management of all our grids. In past years, the vision focused too much on the autonomy of specific grids, considering them as stand-alone entities with little mutual interaction. Grids that were added over time, without achieving a unified vision and level of service.\n\nIn order to tackle these challenges, a \u2018platform\u2019 model is being adopted with two objectives: on the one hand, create an ecosystem that makes available business processes and solutions via Grid Blue Sky, in order to improve the economic and service performance provided to customers; on the other, build a new model for the grid of the future, Grid Futurability, designed to improve the context in which we live, in both the short and long terms. Innovation becomes systemic with Grid Futurability, digitalization and automation make the grid ever more resilient and flexible while, at the same time, the platform model helps to make cities more sustainable and to provide new services based on the differing urban and rural contexts, thus maximizing value for both customers and the grid. The purpose of platformization is therefore to make possible and guarantee the full integration of sustainability within the value chain. Lastly, during 2020 an analysis was carried out in the context of the Grid Blue Sky project, in order to identify the most significant topics in relation to the UN sustainable development goals. The principal actions focus in two main directions: the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (partly via a major effort to digitalize processes) and the profiling of new data fields, being platform parameters used to support the decision-making process when developing new technical solutions and to enhance stakeholders engagement.\n\nThe Grid is also a \u2018mine of materials\u2019 that, suitably regenerat-ed, can be used as inputs for the production of new assets or new products in other productive value chains. Adopting a \u2018grid mining\u2019 approach, the entire value chain of grid assets is being analyzed with a view to improving long-term value creation and incorporating the \u2018Circular by design\u2019 principle right from the asset design stage. The idea is to rethink productive processes, limiting the use of virgin materials, increasing the resilience of the supply chain and reducing environmental impacts such as, firstly, the emission of climate-altering gases. A number of grid mining solutions are being tested or sought, considering the high volume of end-of-life assets retired in the various countries. They need to have a scalable business model or be particularly attractive in terms of the volumes acquired in the marketplace and installed on the grid.\n\nAccordingly, work continued during 2020 on integrating the creation of stakeholder value (CSV) model and the circular economy within our business processes and, in particular, within the supply chain, in order to improve the sustainable footprint of the grid via the proactive and inclusive engagement of stakeholders and the adoption of solutions that maximize value creation.\n\nThe Urban Futurability project is one of the most representative examples. Here, due to design work that included the stakeholders, the platform model for the grid has made it possible to devise new services for citizens and where, for the first time, an urban sustainable work site model has been applied to the cable-laying process, adopting solutions that reduce the environmental impact and the inconvenience felt by citizens.\n\nThe continuous improvement of infrastructure becomes central to the socio-economic development of communities, as well as for the daily life of people. This is fully consistent with the commitments made in relation to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals and in particular SDG 9 \u2018Infrastructure and innovation\u2019.\nEnel for Goi\u00e1s \u2013 connection of isolated communities\nDelivery energy to rural Cavalcante (Brazil)\n\nWe are transforming the lives of many families that have been waiting decades for electricity. We are delivering energy to more than 130 families in rural Cavalcante, in the State of Goi\u00e1s. We have installed over 600 poles and built 33 km of new grids. This is the fourth rural connection project completed by Enel, in collaboration with the government of Goi\u00e1s, in less than six months.\n\nAround one hundred isolated communities have been connected using offgrid solutions, under a plan that will continue throughout 2021. In particular, to facilitate installation of the technical solution identified and ensure that it meets the needs of the communities served, a preliminary field analysis involved about 1,100 potential users so that their territorial conditions and requirements could be understood better. This work made it possible to improve the energy access solutions employed (offgrid, grid extension) and, at the same time, contribute to the development of the communities via new training projects, new skills and enhance tourism and social cohesion.\n\nRethinking one\u2019s business by applying an ecosystem and circular logic also means identifying new opportunities to put customers at the center, offering customized products and services, to build and strengthen a relationship based on trust, transparency and rational use of energy. In fact, the customer is ever more interested in the strategic business steps taken towards a sustainable economy. Consumers wish to contribute, via their decisions, to the protection of the planet, but they only choose the sustainable options if they are more economic and practical, with superior performance.\n\nQuality of service and promotion of responsible and aware usage\n\nOur primary objective is to guarantee a high level quality service and maximize customer satisfaction, anticipating market needs in order to ensure reliable responses and establish lasting relations with customers, based on dialogue, collaboration and trust: aspects that refer not only to the supply of electricity and/or natural gas, but also and above all to the intangible aspects of the service perceived by the customer. We strive constantly to improve the channels and methods by which contacts are made, our back office processes, and the monitoring of complaints and requests for information, in order to reduce response times and ensure proper management. We dedicate great attention to the analysis of customer reports, in order to understand customer perception and any critical issues in progress, so that the appropriate corrective actions can be implemented immediately without compromising overall customer satisfaction.\n\nIn 2020, we promoted the adoption of new solutions and innovative technologies aimed at improving the customer experience and also involving startups and stakeholders, as well as sharing best practices in order to spread them to the various countries of operation with specific market-related customizations, thus minimizing time-to-market. Relations with consumer associations have been intensified, exploring collaboration opportunities aimed at improving the relationship with customers and working together to create services that increasingly respond to new needs and requirements, without neglecting the weaker sections of the population.\n\nIn 2020, due to the pandemic, our communication channels had to adapt to the new way of working from home, ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of our customer relationships. Thanks to a globally coordinated effort, based on promoting digital channels, various measures were successfully taken to meet the growing needs of customers, in line with restrictions on mobility and social distancing.\n\nPutting the customer at the center means developing new relationship models that promote listening and involve-\n\nCustomer satisfaction\n\nThe attention paid to service quality issues is confirmed again this year by the results of customer satisfaction surveys carried out in all the countries where Enel operates as an electricity vendor or distributor.\n\nIn Italy, despite the pandemic, the customer satisfaction index (CSI) for 2020 was 93.8 for the regulated market (92.4 in 2019) and 91.9 for the free market (90.2 in 2019), with improvements in both markets.\n\nIn addition, monthly satisfaction surveys are carried out among customers who have received an answer to a written or verbal complaint. The survey is conducted by telephone interview after a response has been sent or the customer has been contacted by telephone.\n\nIn Iberia, through the subsidiary Endesa, efficient customer service is the main value pursued in the relationship with customers, striving for maximum efficiency in the operation of its customer service channels, tools and platforms through a process of constant innovation and improvement. 20 key indicators are monitored every month, to ensure constant improvement of the customer relationship compared to the previous year. The CSI has been rising over the years, reaching 73.4 for the free market (73 in 2019) and climbing to 77 (72 in 2019) for the regulated market in 2020.\n\nIn Romania, customers can voice their opinions via the contact center, e-mail and website. Information is gathered once a month and the results are used to improve the service quality and customer satisfaction.\n\nThe general satisfaction index was 8.2 for the free market and 8.4 for the regulated market.\n\nIn Latin America, customer satisfaction indicators are a fundamental consideration when defining strategies and designing new products. In Brazil, customer satisfaction is measured every year using several specific indices. The principal index is calculated by the Brazilian association of electricity distributors (ABRADEE \u2013 Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Distribuidores de Energia El\u00e9trica). This index is determined after conducting a sample survey among customers on such aspects as: energy supply, information and communication, utility bills, customer support and image. No less important, the IASC index (customer satisfaction indicator) is calculated by the Brazilian regulator, Anel \u2013 Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Energia El\u00e9trica, after conducting a sample survey of residential customers on such aspects as customer care, reliability, information and price. Lastly, the NPS (Net Promoter Score) determines the percentages of satisfied and dissatisfied customers based on responses to the question: \u201cHow likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?\u201d\n\nSurveys are also carried out in Peru, using structured and standardized questionnaires, among people who have used the contact point services. Finally, in Colombia, there is a customer satisfaction form designed to measure market perception of the supply of products and services in order to direct initiatives and the respective resources more efficiently. The quality satisfaction index (ISCAL), the key elements of which include the commercial relationship and billing, has remained at excellent levels in recent years, thanks to the development of the customer relationship plan.\n\nIn Chile, a new methodology was applied in 2020 in order to obtain more direct customer feedback. This replaced the previous electricity service quality indicator (ICSE) and makes reference to the \u201cfinal satisfaction\u201d, as represented by the direct response given to the question: \u201cHow satisfied are you with the service provided by Enel?\u201d, with a choice of predetermined answers. The survey was carried out in the form of online panels with a statistically-valid sample providing results with about 99% confidence.\n\n(1) Value is calculated on a scale of 1 to 100. The values for 2020 have been estimated on the basis of established trends. Following a change of methodology, from 2018, the CSI value is determined annually rather than half-yearly as it was in 2017 and 2018.\n\n(2) The calculation method has changed from a scale to 100, to a scale to 10.\nManagement of complaints\n\nIn all the countries where Enel operates, customers have various channels available through which to make a complaint or request information (post, website, toll-free number). Enel constantly monitors the feedback received, in order to understand the customer\u2019s perception and any ongoing critical issues and to implement the appropriate corrective actions. In Italy, for example, through Enel Energia, the Enel Group monitors the commercial quality of all its contact channels, systematically monitoring the sales and management processes. The goal is to ensure the fulfillment of requirements in compliance with current legislation, privacy and rules protecting the freedom and dignity of workers. Customer reports are managed through dedicated channels and analyzed by a specific working group so that the most suitable actions are taken, both at the complaint management stage and, above all, in preventing the underlying causes. This year, in Italy, there was a reduction in the time required to manage complaints, which fell below the threshold times required by ARERA (Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment) and simultaneously increased the satisfaction of complaining customers.\n\nIn Iberia, complaints are managed both centrally by the \u201cAtenci\u00f3n de Reclamaciones\u201d (attention to complaints) unit and locally through six local units, in order to prevent any disruptions and determine the appropriate tools needed to resolve them, thus improving the efficiency of the process. The use of the new complaint management model introduced in 2019 was consolidated in 2020, with a reduction in the number of complaints and an end-to-end approach to the process that has made it even more efficient, with shorter processing times and a more positive customer perception.\n\nIn Romania, customers can send reports using different channels: dedicated e-mail address for complaints and requests, website, direct call center helpline or even visit a Punto Enel. In Colombia, a digital transformation of the process has started and an automated procedure (RPA - Robot Process Automation) adopted for the management of complaints about energy usage, in order to speed up the process of responding to customers. In Brazil, a customer experience team analyzes the causes of complaints using analytical tools (e.g. geographical analysis of complaints), surveys and forums with customers themselves, to develop improvement actions.\n\nIn Chile, major action was taken to improve the customer experience via contact channels and on-site visits, thus enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing the number of complaints. In order to implement this \u201cservice quality plan\u201d, it was necessary to adopt new guidelines for assessing the contact channel, deliver training courses to employees, develop new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) functions, and develop reports to monitor delayed orders and the key satisfaction indicators. This plan has resulted in a 16% reduction in the number of complaints.\n\nCare of vulnerable customers\n\nWe want to remain attentive to the needs of citizens, improving and maintaining access to electricity in the most disadvantaged areas and among the poorest populations. All the countries in which the Group operates in fact provide forms of support, often linked to state initiatives, which make it easier for certain sections of the population to pay electricity and gas bills, thus allowing equal access to energy.\n\nIn Italy, since 2008 for the electricity sector and 2009 for the gas sector, a discount has been provided for domestic customers experiencing financial hardship and \u2013 for the electricity sector only \u2013 for customers who use life-saving electro-medical equipment (known as the \u2018social bonus\u2019). The bonus is funded with state resources and specific tariff components determined by the Authority. Applications for the bonus are handled by the local municipality and \u2013 if approved \u2013 customers are awarded a credit on their bill that varies according to their income and number of people in the family. In 2020, the social bonus was awarded to approximately 596,000 customers of Enel Energia and approximately 421,000 customers of Servicio El\u00e9ctrico Nacional. In general, protection is also extended to those who find shopping stressful or challenging, in which staff are trained to welcome persons with disabilities (e.g. accessible shops, priority service, sign language interpretation, chairs and in-store areas reserved for breaks), targeted offers, annual analysis of local needs to ensure a more appropriate offer of services. The energy mediator also helps the population of the neighborhood to perform seemingly simple tasks such as reading meters, signing contracts or accompanying local people to the Enel shop when necessary. A similar pilot project will be launched in 2021, in another disadvantaged area in the Faur/Rep\u00fablica district of Bucharest.\n\nIn Brazil, customers who rely on life-preserving electro-medical equipment have priority over other customers on the telephone channel and their requests are monitored and promptly supported. In addition, Enel appropriately manages customers with special subsidies offered by the government, such as the \u201cSocial Electricity Tariff\u201d (TSEE) subsidy provided for low-income people. Again in 2020, Enel promoted several initiatives that focused on energy efficiency aimed especially at low-income customers: the replacement of fridges and lights, seminars on responsible energy use and household budgeting, inclusion in the social electricity tariff lists.\n\nIn Chile, action plans have been developed to minimize the impact on customers of the economic crisis associated with the effects of the pandemic. In particular, as a healthcare precaution, meters were not read in several months during the year and web/social media campaigns were promoted to encourage self-reading by customers. Easy payment options were introduced (ability to agree a specific payment date without interest and up to 12 installments) and specific projects were developed in order to enhance the customer experience via the use of digital channels.\n\nAgain in Chile, priority support was introduced during 2020 for electricity-dependent (ED) customers, being those who need to be connected to a medical device that runs on electricity. In addition to the installation of generators, 57 new lithium batteries had been installed by year-end in hospital departments where the installation of traditional electrical equipment was not possible. Lastly, in the context of the Value for Disability project (see the \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter of this document), actions were identified at Group level that will be implemented in the coming years. These include: the start of slow shopping, being the creation of shops with areas and times dedicated to those who find shopping stressful or challenging, in which staff are trained to welcome persons with disabilities (e.g. accessible shops, priority service, sign language interpretation, chairs and in-store areas reserved for breaks), targeted offers, annual analysis of the customer experience of persons with disabilities and er groups. Enel has a presence in the Ferentari district of Bucharest, one of the most disadvantaged. By appointing a trusted person from the community, called an \u2018energy mediator\u2019, Enel has been able to gain a better understanding of local needs to ensure a more appropriate offer of services. The energy mediator also helps the population of the neighborhood to perform seemingly simple tasks such as reading meters, signing contracts or accompanying local people to the Enel shop when necessary. A similar pilot project will be launched in 2021, in another disadvantaged area in the Faur/Rep\u00fablica district of Bucharest.\nrelated qualitative score, as well as the launch of products designed using the \u201cdesign for all\u201d technique, which takes account of the needs of everybody, thereby broadening their user base and overall satisfaction.\n\nA transparent relationship with customers\n\nIn 2020, customers changed their lifestyles and buying habits as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. The resulting social distancing accelerated the use of e-commerce and attracted new customer segments to digital channels. This unstoppable acceleration towards the digital transition is accompanied by increasing demands for a more customized experience. In this context, the Enel One and Unica commercial offers have been launched in Italy and Spain respectively, in order to make things easier and more transparent for customers, with greater flexibility. The Enel Group has launched new digital channels and expanded the payment methods available to customers, in order to mitigate the difficulties generated by the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic. Consistent with the official efforts made to mitigate the effects of climate change, we have intensified our commitment to the energy transition, focusing on the digitalization of customer relations with digital payments and installation plans, listening to customers as part of the continuous improvement process, the circular economy and bill discounts, inclusive offers for senior, disadvantaged, low income, socially excluded, and vulnerable customers, online sales, digitalization of documents and filing, digital bills, interactive bills, innovative and inclusive digital services, responsible consumption, and flexible offers thanks to open meter.\n\nIn all the countries where the Group operates, specific customer service channels have been set up: physical, telephone and online, to keep customers constantly informed about the features of the products and services offered. Access to information has also been strengthened through the use of social media channels, such as Facebook and Twitter, and specific apps. In order to guarantee that communication with customers is truly transparent, correct and effective, Enel undertakes to ensure that any cultural, linguistic, illiteracy or disability barriers do not affect equal access to information for customers. Services dedicated to deaf people have been developed in Spain and Peru, thanks to the collaboration with the Italian startup Pedius, which has been operating in Italy since 2018.\n\nIn Italy, in addition to the www.enel.it website, which allows customer relationships to be set up and maintained for commercial and management purposes, there is a specific Enel Energia app designed to manage utilities quickly and easily, providing access to all the data relating to bills, usage, payment status, etc. It also allows the services associated with the various supplies to be activated or changed, information to be received about new offers and promotions, while also providing access to the dedicated loyalty program. The Enel Energia website www.enel.it also contains a guide with audio-visual content explaining the bill and a chat function is available for deaf customers; the chat also offers an English-language service via a dedicated call-back option. In addition, staff in Enel shops are able to assist foreign customers and the contact centers offer a dedicated service to German-speaking customers in the province of Bolzano. As part of the \u201cEnel Social Services\u201d program, created in collaboration with the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the National Electricity Service sends the bill in Braille to blind customers.\n\nIn Iberia, the www.endesa.com website provides various functions and payment methods, a section dedicated to privacy management, a chat function available on the app and innovative ways of viewing usage and invoices. The pandemic in 2020 accelerated the digitalization process, thus boosting online services. By the end of 2020, the www.endesa.com website has accumulated 2.7 million registered customers (17% more than in 2019). All commercial communications, invoices and information sent by Endesa to its customers can be received in two languages: Spanish and Catalan. The www.endesa.com website is available in Spanish, Catalan and English. The company has also implemented a channel for persons with hearing or language disabilities using the Pedius app, which allows customers to ask questions about their bills or contract and receive personalized information. In addition, Endesa is committed to overcoming any physical, social and language barriers, particularly through digitalization. Customer contact points are all located on the ground floor to provide access for people with disabilities. Finally, Endesa has a special unit to manage relations with consumer associations and public bodies, which holds regular meetings and participates in various industry forums with a view to adopting increasingly appropriate measures for the continuous improvement of customer relations. In Spain, the telephone channel became a point of reference in the sector during 2020, obtaining the Excellence in Customer Relationship award (from AEERC - Spanish association of customer relationship centers) for the best digital transformation project: the integration of Watson (IBM AI) as a further customer interface with the contact center. The use of AI was fundamental to the provision of good service in those months during which, due to the pandemic and the lockdown, it was not possible to serve customers via other channels.\n\nIn Romania, the www.enel.ro website provides a series of on-line services to customers in Romanian and English, such as payments, support and even the ability to activate electronic invoicing via text message or e-mail, directly from the website. Phase 1 of the FORCE project (Focus on reinvention of the customer experience) was completed in 2020. This involved remodeling entire processes and the messages sent to customers, using a multi-channel approach in order to accelerate the response to any problems reported.\n\nIn Brazil, new digital platforms have been developed to provide the same information and the same level of customer service, regardless of whether customers choose to be assisted in person, remotely or digitally. In 2020, Enel used social media networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, to keep customers informed about power cuts and emergencies, publishing pictures of the location, a map of the sector and the estimated downtime; this generated greater customer satisfaction, due to the transparency, immediacy and precision of the information provided. A new contact channel via WhatsApp, activated in October, has already received 16,000 visits. This readily-available channel seeks to answer questions relating to bill payments, the input of readings and the reporting of emergencies. In addition, a number of totems were installed in Macul, Perol\u00e3o and Coqueiros, allowing customers to pay their bills immediately, by credit or debit card, without having to present any documentation, stand in line or handle cash.\n\nIn Brazil, there is a wide range of customer communication channels, with 80% of contacts made through digital channels. Using the website at www.enel.com.br, text messaging and the app, customers can access information and services while maintaining a transparent relationship with Enel. They can also communicate with Enel through the main social media (Facebook, Twitter or Instagram), using specific applications for each, and an assistant can also be contacted via chat (WhatsApp, Messenger, DM-Direct Message or e-mail). Virtual assistant Elena, a WhatsApp chatbot, is also available to interact with customers and show them the easiest way to fulfill their requirements.\n\nIn Latin America, a new version of the Enel Clientes application has been created, with improved design and interface, in order to improve the user experience: various Enel services are available, such as reporting emergencies, paying tickets, viewing account details, branch information, meter readings and personalized messages about the supply of electricity, and making direct contact with the company. There have been more than 148,000 downloads since the new version was launched. In March, Enelbot was activated on the www.enel.cl website in order to give customers a new, readily-accessible contact channel. This service provides automated responses to balance requests, payments and the reading of income. Enel complies with current customer privacy regulations in all the countries where it operates. We also strive to monitor all third-party companies that may be in a position to use the personal data of customers. To this end, dedicated clauses are included in contracts with partners who use personal data to carry out specific activities, for\nexample sales services or customer satisfaction surveys. Customer data is an expression of the individual\u2019s personality and identity, therefore it must be treated with due caution and guarantees. Enel considers personal data to be a shared and corporate asset at the same time. For this reason, we have appointed a Data Protection Officer to guarantee full respect for the privacy of all the individuals with whom we interact. For further details, see the \u201cGovernance\u201d chapter of this document.\n\nEnergy-saving commercial offers, products and services\n\nIn all the countries where Enel operates, a wide range of high energy performance products have been launched to guarantee savings in terms of both consumption and emissions. Endesa has become established as one of the main players in the solar self-consumption market in Spain. Thanks to the experience gained and its technical knowledge, the company supports customers in enhancing the technology needed to accelerate the efficient consumption of energy, contributing to the generation of clean and renewable energy. Via its subsidiary Endesa X, the largest private self-consumption solar project in the Spanish hotels sector was launched during 2020, for Protur Hotels on the Island of Majorca, with a total power rating of 2.8 MWp and an annual output of 5,000 kWh. In environmental terms, this will reduce annual emissions by 1,648 tons, which is the equivalent of planting more than 100,000 trees. Endesa X also promotes an energy management system that makes it easy to find out how to obtain significant energy savings. With appropriate monitoring and proactive management, consumption may be reduced by 10-20% while, with the replacement of obsolete equipment, energy consumption can be reduced by 15-25% in the case of water heaters and/or fridges that are more than 15 years old.\n\nLastly, in the context of developing electric mobility, numerous energy efficiency projects have been launched to improve people\u2019s awareness of usage, promoting the replacement of obsolete electrical equipment (fridges, freezers, lighting), with a significant impact on energy consumption and on improving energy efficiency in homes, as well as public and private facilities. During 2020, more than 190,000 customers benefited from educational projects on the responsible use of energy, and mobile units equipped with a model explaining how energy is generated, transmitted and distributed visited various areas of the country. In addition to explaining the process and simulating various types of energy usage, these traveling exhibitions also made interesting multimedia activities available to visitors of all ages. Furthermore, in order to tackle and minimize the damage caused by Covid-19 in Brazil, the #JuntosNaMesmaEnergia package of initiatives was launched, with video lessons and seminars through the Enel Shares platform, including guidelines for responsible energy consumption and safety advice relating to the electricity grid during the lockdown.\n\nIn Chile, two major projects related to \u201cCarbon footprint\u201d and \u201cEnergy management platform\u201d were organized and implemented, at least in part. In collaboration with For The Planet, a local company, during 2021 Enel will adopt a new tool for quantifying and checking the carbon footprint of customers who, via the platform, will be able to monitor their greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) into the atmosphere and change their habits, in order to behave in a more sustainable manner. At a small additional cost, this program also includes carbon footprint training and suggestions and support throughout the contract period. With regard to the second project, Enel Distribuci\u00f3n Chile, in collaboration with Enel X, has provided energy management tools to customers so that their facilities can achieve established energy efficiency objectives. This is made possible by using two systems:\n\n- Utility Bill Management (UBM), a web platform that improves operational efficiency via the automated management of account services and the display of consumption;\n- Energy Management System (EMS), an online system for monitoring energy and power consumption that can manage the energy efficiency of various installations/items of equipment.\n\nFrom energy to new services\n\nEnel X, a Global Business Line of the Enel Group, is a leader in the sector of innovative and sustainable solutions that support the energy transition. Via a strategy built on four pillars \u2013 digitalization, platformization, integration with the commodity and ecosystem \u2013 Enel X offers integrated solutions for the electrification of use cases, for the more efficient consumption of energy and for adding extra value via the offer of new products and services: from public and private electric mobility, including public transport, to products for the electrification of the home, making it more energy efficient thanks to their digital content, and to the use of artificial intelligence for, but not limited to, the ever greater optimization and customization of the solutions offered to customers. Modular solutions that embrace the world of digital financial services and whose central strategy is the satisfaction of customer needs. Each solution is able to translate the decarbonization, electrification and digitalization objectives into sustainable and advantageous actions that can support cities, businesses and individuals in an ever changing world. Enel X is organized into six Global Business Lines, representing a model that allows urban ecosystems to be connected with industrial districts and production chains, mobility needs and individuals. The scope of action of the six Business Lines is described below, together with the principal results achieved during 2020.\n\n- e-City, which offers integrated services to public administrations, including street lighting, digital services that support their town planning activities, energy efficiency services, and a complete, modular solution for the electrification of public transport, all with the objective of restructuring the urban environment with innovation, efficiency and integration. In the last year, more than 140,000 lighting points have been electrified in 912 e-buses operate in Colombia, Chile and Spain, while about 1,700 municipalities in Italy use the YoUrban portal for maximum control over the level of services offered by Enel X and to monitor their progress. This portal will be extended to the other countries served by Enel over the next few years.\n- e-Industries, which offers solutions for companies with a special focus on flexibility-related services. Enel X has confirmed its leadership in the demand response area, with capacity totaling more than 6\nGW under management globally, and has helped customers to close PPA totaling 500 MW around the world, with an emphasis on North America.\n\n> e-Home, dedicated to people, with a mission to manage domestic ecosystems, which offers innovative automation products and services accessible by all, for more intelligent, secure and efficient homes. About 55,000 highly energy efficient items of residential equipment (conditioners, water heater, solar systems) were installed during 2020, approximately half of which in Italy alone, contributing to the achievement of challenging energy efficiency objectives and avoiding the annual emission of about 15,000 tons of CO\u2082. Enel X Sun Plug & Pay has also been launched. This innovative solar system can be installed quickly and easily on balcony railings (or walls), delivering immediate savings on household electricity consumption.\n\n> e-Mobility, which covers all types of customer with a view to becoming a technological leader in the sector, promoting electric mobility and the ever wider availability of increasingly efficient charging points. Over 90,000 charging points are connected to the JuicePass app, which manages all the charging services available on public and private columns. Enel X even entered into the Chinese market during 2020.\n\n> Financial Services. Just one year after official inclusion on the Bank of Italy register of financial sector operators (with an e-money license) during 2020, Enel X Financial Services Srl presented the Italian market with its first consumer product, Enel X Pay, the agile and secure online current account that is easily accessible by app, with Italian IBAN and digital and physical cards linked to the Mastercard circuit. Enel X Pay responds to the need for ever more simple, agile and secure payment instruments, without intermediaries, by providing a payment solution that keeps pace with technological change in an evolving world. Enel X Pay makes it easy to pay for coffee on the go, the latest delivery while relaxing on the couch, car taxes and bills before they fall due, make credit transfers, top-up phones, transfer cash P2P, pay various levies, interbank orders (MAV) and tax demands (RAV), and access the PagoPA system (payments by citizens and companies to the public administrations and the managers of public services).\n\n> Ultra Broadband. Enel X offers companies, residential customers and urban centers a series of solutions for obtaining the benefits of Ultra Broadband (UBB). Enel\u2019s electricity infrastructure is used to promote the development of optical fiber networks and, as a wholesale infrastructure operator, the TMT (Telecommunication Media Technology) segment is offered a portfolio of neutral connectivity services. The UBB solutions provide wholesale connectivity to companies via dark fiber and circuit capacity services. In addition, FTTH (Fiber to the Home) connections are made available to residential users and SMEs, via active or passive services targeting TLC operators (over the past year, the program has been launched in Bogota, San Paolo and Buenos Aires). 4G availability is being expanded and 5G introduced with hosting and aerial connectivity services. Ufinet, the leading wholesaler of optical fiber networks in Latin America with which Enel X has partnered, won the 2020 Frost & Sullivan Best Practices Award for persons and organizations that have innovated strongly or made a dramatic difference.\n\nEnel X is guiding the energy transformation throughout the world, due to its ability to adopt and change rapidly, and act as a catalyst for innovation and change that improve constantly the lives of people. Among the various innovation projects developed in 2020, a new, free solution known as Enel X & Here City Analytics \u2013 Mobility Map has been devised, designed, developed and adopted in record time, in response to the Covid-19 emergency. The daily mobility statistics are intended to help public administrations verify the effectiveness of their mobility restriction policies in combating Covid-19 and define data-driven strategies for the new phase of normality. The project, implemented in partnership with Here Technologies, draws on various data sources (cars connected, maps, navigation systems, mobile apps, open data) to generate indicators of mobility at national, regional, provincial, municipal and sub-municipal level. After launching the service in Italy (April 9, 2020), Enel X & Here City Analytics \u2013 Mobility Map was also released in Spain (April 30, 2020) and Brazil (May 22, 2020). The map has been clicked on more than 3.5 million times by over 200,000 unique visitors and, via the Enel X YouUrban portal, more than 1,800 PA users are able to download additional start and destination data for movements between key cities and regions.\n\nDue to the pandemic, demand for remote medical advice has increased and, accordingly, Enel X has developed the Smart Assistance Diabetes project which provides a 24/7 monitoring service for the management of diabetes. This project offers an integrated ecosystem of digital tools that are able to make various measurements (glycemia, ketonemia, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, heart rate) and, via the app, record the data in an on-line clinical record that can be consulted at any time, any day of the week. In addition, monitoring their own clinical parameters or speaking to doctors or specialists directly from home, customers in need can benefit from the support of a central medical team capable of providing immediate answers.\n\nEnel X and Mastercard also won a tender promoted by the Israeli government for the creation of an innovation laboratory which aims to stimulate the development of fintech and cyber security start-ups in Israel (FinSec Lab in Be\u2019er Sheva). For further details, see the \u201cInnovation\u201d chapter of this document.\n\nThe electrification of consumption in transportation, buildings and industries, and digitalization via the use of global platforms, are the critical success factors of Enel X, which also has the sustainability/circularity of solutions as a competitive advantage. In this regard, the company has set up a specific process, known as the Enel X Boosting Program, unique in terms of completeness and innovation, that can measure the circularity of the solutions offered in order to identify possible improvements and the related roadmap. All the details are presented in the \u201cCircular economy\u201d chapter of this document.\n### Our people\n\n#### Gender - % of women in selection processes\n\n| Activities | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Gender     | 50% women         | 44% women    | OFF-PLAN | 50% women         | $   | A   |\n\n#### Climate survey (%)\n\n| Activities | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Performance appraisal (%) | 100% people involved | 100% people involved | ON-PLAN | 100% people involved | $   | A   |\n\n#### Reskilling and upskilling - Promote and plan reskilling and upskilling programmes for Enel people in order to support the energy transition\n\n| Activities | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Gender     | Female managers (%) and middle managers | Increase the number of female managers and middle managers | ON-PLAN | 22.6% managers and middle managers | $   | A   |\n\n#### Disability - Adopting a systemic approach to disability inclusion\n\n| Activities | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Disability | Appointing Focal Points in 100% of the Group Countries in which there is at least one Enel person with a disability | Focal Point appointed in 100% of the Group Countries in which there is at least one Enel person with a disability | ON-PLAN | \u2022 Launching a structured process to analyze the needs of Enel people with disabilities | $   | A   |\n\n---\n\n(1) Selection processes involving blue collar workers and the USA perimeter are not included as local legislation protecting anti-discriminatory practices in the recruiting phase does not allow this figure to be monitored.\n\n(2) Eligible and reachable persons: those who have a permanent contract and have been in place and active for at least 3 months during the year.\n\n(3) Including female top managers.\n\n(4) Digital sustainability initiatives are aimed at promoting awareness of sustainability issues through digital technology.\n\n(5) Includes international and intercontinental travel by authorized Enel people, monitored by the integrated Travel Security system.\n\n(6) This refers to services to mitigate the risk of assault and kidnapping for colleagues working in countries with very high levels of crime.\nAs a result of the pandemic, 2020 was an exceptional year, which highlighted how the increase in the individual responsibility of our people has made it possible to guarantee operations and continuity in a crisis situation, and how the pathway embarked on cannot be left behind, but must rather mark the beginning of a new shared way of working. Over 36,000 people at Enel, of whom about 15,000 in Italy, started working remotely within a few days, experimenting with a new routine, profoundly different from how it used to be, and demonstrating great adaptability and a deep sense of responsibility. Therefore we have in 2020 carefully curated and strengthened our people empowerment processes, aimed at supporting the evolution of the organizational culture, to enable people to become more effective in the challenges they will face in the future. The evolution of the global scenario has also imposed a new, more dynamic world of work in which a different leadership model is needed: a \u2018soft\u2019 leadership that values people\u2019s talents, attitudes and aspirations. The characteristics of the leader of the future are empathy, generosity, the ability to inspire, to work together to affirm the company\u2019s collective aspect, and to listen in order to boost their teams\u2019 potential. In a scenario undergoing a constant transformation, the necessary skills change: upskilling and reskilling strategies assume ever greater importance to allow companies to develop talent and contribute to socially responsible approaches to accompany the transition without leaving anyone behind. We are therefore investing not only in technical tools, but also in relational skills, soft skills and proximity to our people. In a context of uncertainty and crisis, attention to caring for our people is central to us, through active engagement with individuals, different groups and organizational contexts.\n\nThe pathways of empowerment, job change, mentoring, job shadowing, coaching and open feedback favor the sharing of knowledge of people who, with a view to circular economy, are contributing their skills to help others. Despite the pandemic, to take advantage of the opportunities for digitization, it was possible to continue mentoring, coaching and shadowing, via remote sessions, to exchange experiences, acquire different points of view, expand skills and strengthen the network of relationships. Trust, responsibility, proactivity and innovation are the key values of our Open Power approach, the basis of the creation of an open and dynamic working environment, which favors the entrepreneurial approach, risk-taking and management of discontinuity, courtesy of the increasing integration of diversity. These are the values that enable us to continue to grow while maintaining the commitments made with our people, our customers and the market.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, the Enel workforce numbered 66,717, down by 1,536 compared to the end of 2019. This reduction is the effect of the net balance between new recruits and terminations in the year (-565 people) and the change in scope (accounting overall for -971 people), including the sale of the hydroelectric power plants in the United States, the sale of the Reftinskaya GRES plant in Russia and the acquisition of Viva Labs AS (Enel X Norway).\n\nWhy is it important for our stakeholders?\n\nThe community that surrounds us is betting on our value over time. This means relying not on an abstract entity but on all our colleagues, on our values, and on the ability to accept different internal and external points of view.\n\nWhy is it important for Enel?\n\nA company that becomes the supporting architecture of a generative culture is sustainable, open and ready to react to the challenges of the future. By realizing that the \u201cI\u201d is enriched by belonging to a team, we move from individualism to success.\nConnected and close: smart working and care during the outbreak\n\nDuring the Covid-19 outbreak, Enel promptly intervened with measures to ensure staff safety and the continuity of the business. This was an action on a global scale, made possible by the smart working experience, which began in Italy as early as 2016 and was gradually extended throughout the Group, as well as by the technological transformation started in 2014, which led to the integration of digitization into the company strategy, making Enel the first entirely cloud-based utility service company. Over 36,000 people in the countries where the Group maintains a presence have worked in smart working mode, and a dedicated task force was set up in order to monitor the emergency, to decide on the action to be taken and to share experience across the various countries. Initiatives have also been set up to support the transition to the new digital scenario, promote a working culture based on autonomy, delegation and trust, and promote better time management, supporting the well-being of people and their families. As well as smart working, many flexibility measures are active in the various countries. These are set out in the table below.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, Enel took out a global insurance policy for all employees in the event of admission to hospital due to Covid-19 infection, which has been extended to 2021. The policy, designed specifically for the Group\u2019s needs, guarantees an extra allowance in the event of admission to hospital, on top of all other policies and forms of healthcare already available to employees. In Italy, a trade union agreement was also signed to protect people in the Company who were unable to work remotely during the lockdown, establishing a solidarity system whereby all employees could choose to donate one or more days of their holidays to the colleagues in question.\n\nTo provide emotional care for people during the Covid-19 outbreak, a free listening and psychological support service was made available from the very beginning in the Group\u2019s main countries. Moreover, the #1WorkWellFromHome video-manifesto was also created and disseminated via a dedicated communication campaign, with suggestions on how to improve remote working time management, encourage inclusion and delegation, safeguard physical and relational well-being and work-life balance, and counteract hyper-connection. A dedicated section was created on the company global intranet with useful information, advice and materials. Specifically, the new section contains recommendations for prevention and behaviors to adopt together with information on working on digital and physical working, with a specific focus on cyber frauds.\n\nLast but not least, three sections are available on the e-learning global platform, updated on a daily basis with new content:\n\n- \u201cWorking together\u201d: coaching clips, advice and suggestions for the best use of IT tools;\n- \u201cLearning\u201d: support for smart working activities;\n- \u201cRegenerating\u201d: tutorials on personal and family well-being.\n\nInvesting in our people\n\nIn the current scenario of transformation and uncertainty, which requires new skills, professionalism and flexibility of adaptation, our ambition is to provide an experience that inspires and empowers our people. Engaging and motivating our people to reach their full potential, providing opportunities for their personal and professional development, ensures that our business continues to grow and\n\n---\n\n(1) https://www.enel.com/company/stories/articles/2018/07/sustainability-report-2017-enel-model-open-power-seeding-energies\n\n(2) Next normal: our future way of working when it will be possible to return to a new dimension of \u201cnormality\u201d at the end of the pandemic, at different times depending on the situation in various countries.\nsucceeds in its support of our Group strategy. The selection and recruiting, training and development processes therefore play a key role at the Company.\n\nAttracting new talent\n\nDespite the pandemic, over 3,100 new people were recruited in 2020, relations with universities were consolidated by means of a series of ad hoc initiatives, and the Recruiting Day project was globally expanded, based on an aptitude model aimed at supporting the various recruitment requirements. As the pandemic progressed, new digital tools were also introduced to support the selection process: a pilot project introducing a video interview using a virtual assistant, artificial intelligence and a global gamification experience known as Enel Attitude: a mobile gaming app with the purpose of profiling people\u2019s aptitudes.\n\nOver 2020, several \u2013 mainly digital \u2013 initiatives were developed, related to talent attraction and employer branding. The section of the careers site has been improved and the Enel People campaign has been launched, to offer an exploration of life at the Company, listening to people\u2019s opinions on innovation, sustainability and technology, but also their personal experience at the Group. As well as collecting all open positions in the various countries where the group maintains a presence, the section thus represents a view using a virtual assistant, artificial intelligence and a more active role for individuals, who can offer their personal skills. The courses on offer also included behavioral, managerial, agile and linguistic training, as well as sessions on well-being and safety, and digital skills and culture.\n\nOsmosis and cross-fertilization to unleash the creativity of our people\n\nThe energy transition and an increasingly advanced technological evolution, platformization, artificial intelligence and a very high degree of automation are factors that open up new scenarios for the Group and for people, and determine the need for new technical and professional profiles and the natural disappearance of others. Therefore, in response to the multiple stimuli of the outside world, the reskilling and upskilling programs have been boosted. The former is aimed at creating new work profiles through the learning of new skills to fill positions or roles different from previously; the latter, on the other hand, focused on the development of existing professional skills for an improvement in the performance of their role.\n\nOngoing training of people, also known as continuous learning, is the central pillar of our education strategy. In 2020, approximately 18 million euros were spent on training, with an average cost per employee of 2775 euros; 93.5% of the workforce took part in over 2.7 million hours of training (about 41 hours per head), around 100,000 hours more than the previous year, despite the Covid-19 pandemic, thanks to some of the training courses having been redesigned to be conducted remotely. Courtesy of the adaptability and versatility of the technological platforms, primarily the eDucation training platform, it became possible to build an advanced learning experience that has improved people\u2019s ability to take advantage of training using virtual tools and sessions. Enel\u2019s new training paradigm aims to contribute to the empowerment of people through the exchange, aiming at the cross-fertilization of knowledge, respect for diversity and a more active role for individuals, who can offer their personal skills. The courses on offer also included behavioral, managerial, agile and linguistic training, as well as sessions on well-being and safety, and digital skills and culture.\n\nSpecifically, the training action lines are aimed at strengthening the dissemination of digital culture with a view to sustainability, building a train the trainer approach, disseminating increasing proximity to the business (\u201cclose to business\u201d), internally extending new behavioral styles related to soft leadership, training on new skills and new habits (new behaviors to face up to the next normal). In terms of digital skills, in 2020 Enel involved over 50% of people in dedicated training activities, and starting from 2021 it is committed to launching 20 global initiatives on digital sustainability: this ambitious goal aims to raise awareness of the opportunities offered by technology to be more sustainable and to minimize environmental impact. The dissemination of the train the trainer approach over 2021 will enhance the exchange of skills, attitudes and internal know-how, by means of the cross-fertilization of knowledge, from the most specialist to the most strategic.\n\nIn 2020, the Schools and Academies focused on programs dedicated to responding to the specific and technical training needs of the different business areas, in conjunction with university partners and renowned research institutes, with the support of the Enel Foundation. From 2016 to 2020, nine Schools and five Academies were activated and, in the future, to face the great challenges of the Strategic Plan, the Academy model is expected to be strengthened, to meet Group requirements better. The three main areas of training in 2020 were digital culture, safety and soft skills. In 2021, there will be a specific focus on the new model of gentle leadership and new habits, behaviors and professional lifestyles, related to a constantly changing context. Finally, Enel\u2019s commitment to raising awareness of anti-corruption issues remains strong: the interventions to disseminate knowledge of ISO 37001 certification for the Group\u2019s Italian companies, Model 231 and Global Compliance reached a course redemption level of around 80%, while the new training course on the new Enel Code of Ethics is scheduled for 2021, the document having been updated in 2020.\n\nValuing and enhancing our people\n\nIn 2019, the process of qualitative and quantitative performance appraisal saw the engagement of Group people at various levels in a fluid process of exchange and across the all-round feedback, shifting the focus towards the organizational network rather than pursuing a hierarchical model. In particular, 100% of eligible people were involved in the 2019 process and the process was completed in July 2020, with a delay due to the pandemic. For 2020 performance appraisal, the process will be reviewed, aiming at boosting individual specificities and enhancing people\u2019s talents and inclinations.\n\nFinally, a new campaign was launched to define success planning, the process whereby all Group managers are required to identify the high-potential people available to fill managerial roles in the short term (ready) and in the medium term (pipeline). To accompany successor development, the appointing manager, the manager responsible and the People and Organization Function identify shared development actions, based on individual and professional profile, in relation to the positions for which the successors have been earmarked. Successor identification follows criteria based on meritocracy, diversity and the horizontal nature of the profiles. New managers are appointed following an aptitude assessment, to explore the candidates\u2019 strengths and areas for improvement, assessing their readiness to hold a managerial position, by means of a structured process codified in specific guidelines. The assessment is designed to identify people capable of implementing Open Power values and behaviors, to meet the challenges that Enel sets itself.\nListening and dialogue\n\nIn light of the digitization of relationships as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Enel has also decided to revisit the listening channel. While most of the listening within the Group until 2018 took the form of the climate survey, which takes place every two years. In 2020 the ground was prepared to lead people towards more constant and dynamic ways of listening and direct involvement in the implementation of sustainable action plans aimed at improving organizational well-being.\n\nIn late December 2020, the \u2018Open Listening: An interview to build our future\u2019 survey was launched. 70% of people responded to an invitation to imagine the future of work in the era of the \u201cnext normal\u201d, from remote working methods to workspaces, from new technologies and psychological/physical well-being to the new leadership models of the future. The overall level of people engagement was 93.5% (the overall engagement index result for the previous Climate Survey was 81%). To follow the results, targeted, global and specific action plans will be drawn up on the various targets.\n\nA further essential element is People Business Partners, figures dedicated to listening and dialogue with people, able to grasp individual aspirations and integrate them with the organization\u2019s needs.\n\nFinally, Enel considers internal communication a mainstay in the creation of corporate culture, people growth and the growth of the organization, stimulating and promoting the exchange of information, know-how and experience. Internal communications are also the main vector to disseminate the Enel strategy and the objectives identified for the near future.\n\nDiversity and inclusion\n\nInclusion = Value is the paradigm that represents our approach to attention to people, based on the inclusion of diversity as an essential factor in the creation of sustainable value. This approach is even more relevant these days, given current circumstances where it is essential to innovate, co-create, bring out and attract talents and create a framework that enables everyone to express their uniqueness at all times, even in new unprecedented situations. At Enel, inclusion means taking care of all aspects of diversity, from the visible to the most concealed, and to enhance the multiple talents of each person. It also means creating open contexts that welcome diversity and ensure everyday organizational and interpersonal conditions so that everyone\u2019s potential can be expressed freely, stimulating innovation and promoting new opportunities.\n\nEnel\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion started in 2013 with the issue of the Policy on Human Rights, followed in 2015 by the Diversity and Inclusion Policy, in parallel with adoption of the seven Women Empowerment Principles (WEP) promoted by the UN Global Compact and UN Women and in compliance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The Policy acts as a reference point for the evolution of the Group\u2019s culture of caring and inclusion. Its fundamental principles of non-discrimination, equal opportunities and equal dignity for all forms of diversity, inclusion, balance between private and professional life are milestones for the development of specific initiatives that address as a priority the dimensions of gender, disability, age, nationality and the dissemination of the culture of inclusion at all levels and in all organizational contexts.\n\nIn 2019, the Workplace Harassment Policy was also published, which highlights the principle of respect for individual integrity and dignity in the workplace and addresses the issue of sexual and discrimination-related harassment. In 2020, the principles of the aforementioned policy were recalled in the Statement against harassment in the workplace, published on the Enel website. On issues related to harassment, several countries launched specific training initiatives in 2020 (Italy, USA and Canada, Peru, Colombia, Korea and Australia); in 2021, a global course will be launched for all Group countries. The People Care and Diversity Management Holding unit, created in 2016 and merged in 2020 into the new People and Organization Innovatibility unit, performs governance functions globally on these issues, ensuring harmonization and monitoring of local initiatives and best practice sharing. Indicators measuring progress on diversity and inclusion are the focus of a detailed reporting process.\n\nEnel\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion is also stated in public objectives in the Sustainability Plan, the progress of which is documented in the Sustainability Report. These aim to increase the percentage of women in selection processes, the percentage of women managers and middle managers, and promote the adoption of a systemic approach to the inclusion of people with disabilities. The Sustainability Plan and Report are analyzed by the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Control and Risk Committee, and subsequently approved.\nby the Board of Directors. In late 2020, the Board of Directors approved a specific action plan associated with the Value for Disability project, with the aim of expressing the potential of people living with disabilities at company, social and economic level.\n\nEnel has obtained numerous acknowledgments in thematic indices and in the main rankings related to diversity and inclusion which recognize the value created by Enel\u2019s sustainable and innovative business model for people, the Group and society.\n\nThe commitment and transparency in favor of gender inclusion were confirmed by Bloomberg in 2021, with the inclusion of Enel and its Spanish subsidiary Endesa in its Gender Equality Index for the second time. Enel was acknowledged for its commitment to promoting the presence of women on the Board, in managerial positions and in new hires, the contribution in terms of pay equality and work-life balance, and in the prevention of harassment.\n\nThe Company ranked eighth in the world in March 2021 and among the top 100 companies in the index, as well as being the first company in Italy in the Gender Equality Global Report & Ranking. This positioning followed the March 2020 inclusion in the Equileap top 20 Gender Equality rankings in Europe. The ranking analyzes 19 criteria related to gender policy, including gender balance throughout the corporate population, gender pay gap, parental leave, and the prevention of sexual harassment.\n\nIn addition, in 2020 the Group ranked first within the \u201cElectric Utilities and Independent Power Producers\u201d industry group of the Refinitiv Diversity and Inclusion Index. The index has rewarded Enel\u2019s attention to gender diversity, workplace inclusion policies and human capital development. In 2020, several awards were recognized for the promotion of diversity and inclusion in the countries, including the Impulsa Talento Femenino award (Chile), the Friendly Biz Corporativo and Sello de Oro Equipea awards (Colombia), Best Workplace 2020 (Greece) and the Expocoaching Award (Spain).\n\nUnlock Inclusion\n\nAt Enel, the evolution of the culture of inclusion represents a journey of various steps, represented in 2017 by the awareness of the value of all diversity. In 2018, by the importance of the uniqueness of each person to create value for people and the business, and in 2019 by the sustainable value generated by inclusive behaviors. In 2020, when agile working methods were tested under emergency conditions, inclusion took on an ever deeper meaning. It is important to ensure that people are genuinely connected and to stimulate individual responsibility to act consciously to overcome the invisible barriers that technology can create under such conditions. Enel then organized a global event, \u201cUnlock Inclusion\u201d, with the aim of stimulating reflection on the behaviors that generate authentic inclusion and the conditions to ensure a context to enable these, by means of live-streamed round tables, workshops and local events. Awareness-raising initiatives on the culture of inclusion also involved about 1,500 Group managers, with an online training session on unconscious bias, with the aim of exploring how they work and which strategies can contain them.\n\nThe Company\u2019s commitment to the culture of inclusion of diversity is also expressed in the measures taken by the governing bodies with regard to their composition and in their constant attention to company strategies on these issues.\n\nIncluding all\n\nBoosting diversity means paying attention to its multiple aspects. In terms of age, the various countries and Business Lines promote a wide range of training initiatives and the exchange of intergenerational knowledge. In 2020, over 120 juniors and 620 seniors have been involved in internal training, coaching, mentoring, shadowing initiatives and as ambassadors on specific topics. In particular, Colombia has started the \u201cTalent Silver\u201d project, Peru the \u201cSensei Program\u201d and Greece the \u201cYour voice\u201d project. A global plan is in place to activate a tutor both to accompany the onboarding period of newly hired colleagues and to facilitate the integration of expat colleagues in their destination country.\n\nIn terms of LGBTQ+ issues, some countries (Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Greece, Romania, Germany, Australia, Italy and Peru) have organized awareness-raising, training and specific communications campaigns to reflect on inclusive language, shed light on stereotypes and explore specific aspects of LGBTQ+ perspective, in particular for IDAHOBIT Day. Ethnic diversity is a topic of increasing attention in some countries, especially in North America, where it is one of the priorities of the diversity management approach, also confirmed in public statements of the management against racism, starting from the candidate selection and recruiting phase. In Brazil, too, the enhancement of ethnic diversity is considered a central element and is taken into account from the selection phase onwards, with positions dedicated to people of color.\n\nThe gender and gender pay gaps: our action plan\n\nEnel continues its commitment to overcoming the gender gap and achieving pay equality with an organic approach of actions that influence all phases of women\u2019s journey in the organization: from representation at entry level to empowerment and development in positions of responsibility, paying attention to various relevant moments in personal and professional life. The action plan aims to achieve equal pay by leveraging on measures that influence the pay gap both directly and indirectly, producing a gradual increase in female representation at different organizational levels, thus promoting natural generational renewal and consequently equal pay.\n\nWith regard to indirect measures, there is a steady increase in women joining the Company and in positions of responsibility in the organization. Selection processes are closely monitored to ensure a fair balance of the two genders in the candidate pools, with a rising trend in the last four years (44% in 2020) and a target of 50% in 2021. A major commitment has also been made to increase the number of women in positions of responsibility. Various actions have been introduced globally, including a public goal to increase the number of women managers and middle managers and the setting of criteria for the fair composition of succession plans. As at late 2020, women account for about 22% of the entire Group workforce, around 22% of the managers and approximately 11% in executive positions (CEO-1) out of the total of these positions (2 out of 18).\n\nThe direct measures with an impact on the gender pay gap include internal policies addressing succession plan management and salary review processes, which take into account gender diversity as well as the allocation of a budget dedicated to ensuring equal pay for equivalent roles. In addition, the commitment to promote gender equality also resulted in setting a specific MBO 2021 track as part of the MBO objectives assigned to the management of the People and Organization Function.\nFor the purposes of monitoring equal pay, there is a steady increase in the Equal Remuneration Ratio (ERR) index. 83.3% in 2020, a slight increase on the 83.2% in 2019 (equivalent to 82.4% at the same exchange rates against the euro). This result is proof of all the actions taken to advance women\u2019s standing, not only in senior management, the effects of which will be fully appreciable in the medium to long term, also taking into account the generational dynamic.\n\nIn countries where the Group maintains a presence, numerous initiatives are in place to promote the empowerment of women and a leadership style that welcomes traits inspired by female models such as \u2018Empowering Conversations\u2019 in Italy, \u2018Women Open Power\u2019 in Peru, \u2018Resiliencia y Mujeres en Tecnolog\u00eda\u2019 in Argentina and the \u2018HER Community\u2019 experience in Greece. As far as the parental dimension is concerned, there are several ad hoc parenting programs available to the Enel workforce, women and men alike. In all Group countries, the \u2018Parental Program\u2019 is active, aimed at promoting organizational and personal awareness of the value of parenthood and at reconciling personal and professional needs in this stage in life.\n\nIncreasing importance is also accorded to supporting initiatives that promote the presence of women in study and professional pathways in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics), in conjunction with schools, universities and institutions, to overcome gender stereotypes and disseminate the importance of the technical and scientific culture, increasingly integrated with the humanistic dimension. In particular, STEM initiatives are aimed at female students who will be working in a few years\u2019 time in the professions of the future, to which Enel looks with interest to increase gender diversity at all organizational levels. Every year, Enel organizes in all Group countries awareness and orientation sessions, in which thousands of young women take part. Specifically, in 2020 Italy launched the \u2018Tech Talk\u2019 cycle of digital meetings, with the participation of female role models from the world of science, culture and entrepreneurship, at national and international level. Brazil organized the \u2018Mujeres de Energ\u00eda Program\u2019, a volunteer initiative involving women working in technical sectors as its spokesperson.\n\nIn Colombia the \u2018Plan Semilla\u2019 aims to train and provide employment opportunities for women experiencing social hardship whereas the \u2018USAID Program\u2019 aims to disseminate the importance of the role of women in the energy transition. Argentina organized courses on energy transition; finally, in Spain the \u2018Desmontando estereotipos\u2019 and \u2018Orienta \u2013 T\u2019 projects involving Enel colleagues and psychologists from external associations have been active for several years.\n\nFinally, all countries have held numerous events for the International Women\u2019s Day and the International Day Against Violence against Women, to celebrate the value of women and equal opportunities and raise awareness of respect for rights and overcoming gender bias. In February 2021, to confirm its commitment to these issues, Enel joined the \u2018Equal by 30\u2019 campaign, promoted by Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM), the public initiative whereby various public and private sector organizations have committed to promoting gender equality in terms of pay, leadership and opportunities in the clean energy sector by 2030. Three specific commitments have been set on raising awareness for an increasing number of girls towards STEM disciplines and professions, fair representation of women in selection shortlists, and growth in the number of women in managerial positions.\n\nValue for Disability\n\nEnel plays great attention to disabilities, of particular significance in Italy, which hosts 80% of the Group\u2019s around 2,200 people living with disabilities. In countries where the legislation provides for minimum quotas for the inclusion of people with disabilities, the Company is in line with the regulatory provisions. People living with disabilities are also present in some countries where there are no legislative constraints. To ensure the full inclusion of people with disabilities and in line with the approach indicated by the UN Convention, Enel provides tools, services and working methods, and promotes initiatives aimed at creating an accessible environment that promotes the independent expression of the talents and potential of everyone in the organization.\n\nIn 2019, Enel\u2019s commitment was made public by the Group signing up to the worldwide \u2018Valuable 500\u2019 initiative, aimed at private companies committed to recognizing and expressing the potential of disability at company, social and economic level. This membership resulted in 2020 in the worldwide \u2018Value for Disability\u2019 project, aimed at defining concrete actions to promote the full inclusion of people with disabilities. The approval by the Board of Directors of the action plan resulting from the project in late 2020 was assigned as an MBO track to around 50 managers in the Functions involved. One specific stream of the project is dedicated to Enel employees, with a focus on physical and digital accessibility, participation in organizational life and evolution in the inclusivity of the corporate culture. As part of the project, a specific tool to detect the organizational needs of people living with disabilities has been designed and tested, inspired by international standards. In addition, the corporate commitment to the development of the inclusive culture in the organization has been underlined with the inclusion of the accessibility topic in the Code of Ethics and the disability targets in the Sustainability Plan. The action plan resulting from the project will develop over 2021 and specifically includes the validation and adoption of the questionnaire for work inclusion, the development and provision of widespread training on accessibility principles, the evolution from the perspective of inclusivity of safety, travel, recruiting and employment branding processes, and the establishment of a disability community network to facilitate the identification of new needs and the sharing of best practices.\n\nFor further details on the project, see the \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter of this document.\n\nIn 2020, further initiatives were implemented in different countries, with the support of specific organizational focal points. Among the most significant initiatives launched in Italy, worthy of note are the \u201cDisability and Work Research\u201d and the \u201cItaca project for intellectual disabilities\u201d aimed at developing the acquisition of digital skills for people with mental illness, the launch of the IT call center dedicated to the assistance of people who use assistive tools, and the \u2018Auticon\u2019 project to promote work inclusion for people with autism on specialist activities in IT processes.\n\nIn Spain, attention has been focused on improving the integration of people with disabilities at risk of exclusion from work, moreover with the \u2018Plan Familia\u2019, which offers a counseling service is provided to colleagues with family members living with disabilities. South American countries have set a benchmark with other companies and have launched a survey to assess the level of disability awareness among colleagues; Colombia has started a recruitment project as part of the local Productivity Pact; in the United States, a campaign has been promoted to highlight the needs of people living with disabilities. For the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, various events have taken place in all Group countries to raise awareness of the value of different skills and to overcome stereotypes.\n\nCaring for all\n\nEnel promotes organizational and personal well-being, as well as solutions to improve work-life balance and to support the tangible and daily needs of individuals in order to respect all the situations, including contingencies, that an individual may be required to deal with during their working life.\n\nThe non-salary benefits awarded in the main Group countries cover 98% of the Enel workforce. The main support initiatives and the extent of their coverage of the Enel workforce are set out below.\n\n| Non-salary benefits major Countries | Involvement |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|\n| Covid-19 insurance                | 100%        |\n| Pension fund membership           | 81%         |\n| Additional parental measures (maternity, paternity and parental leave) | 93% |\n| Parenthood support initiatives    | 99%         |\n| Child support initiatives         | 83%         |\n| Loans                             | 92%         |\n| Leisure and cultural initiatives  | 93%         |\n\n(1) Non-salary benefits are the series of goods and services provided by the company in addition to monetary pay.\n(2) Italy, Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Romania, Chile, Colombia, Russia, USA, Peru, Mexico.\nCaring activities concern the spheres of personal, family and organizational life. A few examples are given for each field, as carried out in the different countries where the Group maintains a presence.\n\n> Caring for people. Among the initiatives taken by Enel, including to support new working methods during the Covid-19 outbreak, particular attention has been paid to the inclusion of those suffering from a chronic disease (\u201cMaCro@Work Caring\u201d). For further details, see the introduction to this chapter. In Italy, workshops have been organized on well-being, eating disorders and digital education, as well as fitness activities, meetings with writers and events to improve self-awareness, psychological counseling services for people exiting the Company and an awareness campaign for blood donation. The promotion of physical well-being is encouraged in Italy by means of a specific agreement with the networks of gyms throughout the country, and likewise in Spain under the \u201cPrograma Entren\u00e1te\u201d, which encourages physical activity. Colombia works systemically on these issues via its \u201cEstrategia de Salud Organizacional\u201d, which identifies elements such as consistency, gratitude, service, compassion and resilience as the fundamentals of happiness, influencing the full development of the person, the working environment and the organization\u2019s results. Among all the various experiences, Mexico stands out for promoting an integrated approach between well-being, engagement and happiness, expressed in the \u201cBecome and Engage \u2013 BE Program\u201d project, which includes a wide range of activities associated with a gamification system and provides access to benefits and supplementary welfare services.\n\n> Caring for families. In 2020, a wide range of digital initiatives took place, including the \u201cEnel Talent Day\u201d webinars focused on university orientation and the world of work for employees\u2019 children, deployed in five editions in Italy and subsequently extended to Spain and Romania, involving a total of around 1,000 children. In Italy, a \u201cCare Master\u201d dedicated to caregivers in the Company has been organized. A subsidized online family counselling service is also active, as are the \u201cNew Parents, New Energy\u201d parent training sessions. Time saving family services are also available: baby-sitting, elderly care and home help. A range of initiatives have been introduced, in conjunction with the mobility manager network, to promote the sustainable movements of Enel staff, including specific agreements for public transport subscriptions. Finally, all Enel mothers and fathers of children attending primary school are granted entry permits for their children\u2019s first day of school. Spain has a dedicated channel on the company intranet, offering a wide variety of products and services at competitive prices, as well as leisure offers and training sessions, but also providing the option to make donations to improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable. An app can also be downloaded to access various services such as private car sharing, car cleaning and repairs, a dietician and a travel agency.\n\n> Caring in the organization. In addition to local legislation, many countries have taken measures to improve maternity, paternity and parental leave, and leave is granted for special days or in particularly severe circumstances. In Italy, from a solidarity point of view, holidays or rest periods (solidarity holidays) can be granted to colleagues to help their loved ones with very severe personal or family circumstances. Where maternity leave is concerned, in more than half of the main countries in which Enel operates, a higher number of leave days is offered than those provided by the local legislation. In terms of salary aspects, if local legislation does not guarantee full pay during the period of maternity leave, Enel intervenes to close the gap. With regard to paternity leave, in some countries, Enel intervenes with additional measures both in terms of the number of additional days of leave and in terms of salary covering any gaps. Finally, various measures are available for child sickness leave, for the birth of twins and with measures in addition to local legislation, and also in the event of adoption, where additional measures are extended to parents of adopted children. In Spain, it is also possible to take advantage of daily flexibility adapted to the temporary needs of the worker, in the form of a temporary change in working arrangements, reductions in working hours and leave for family care.\n\nSupplementary healthcare assistance and additional pension coverage\n\nThe majority of countries where the Group maintains a presence offer supplementary health insurance policies at advantageous conditions with respect to the alternatives available on the market. In many cases, the Company provides benefits related to prevention and periodic checkups (see also the \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d chapter). For all Italian employees and their dependent family members, in agreement with the trade unions, Enel set up the Supplementary Healthcare Provision for Enel Group Employees (FSDE) in 1997. The Provision disburses repayments and redemptions for healthcare expenses, promotes initiatives for the disabled and individuals subject to socially challenging situations (drug addiction, alcoholism, learning difficulties, psychosocial disorders) and sets up preventive medicine programs. Also in 2020, members were able to take advantage of symposia with the Italian National Council of Psychologists (CNOP) and Italian Psychosanalytic Society (SPI) for psychological support services. In line with the FSDE solidarity principle, former Enel employees can also continue to benefit from the services offered by the Provision by continuing to pay the membership fees. Staff support measures also include the option of accessing fixed-contribution and other pension plans, such as membership of mandatory or optional schemes and the award of various types of individual benefits in services associated with post-employment benefits provision. As at December 31, 2020, 80% of Enel group employees were covered by retirement plans, mandatory or voluntary schemes. The largest pension funds are in Italy (Fopen and Fondene), Spain and Brazil. See also the \u201cConnected and close: smart working and care during the outbreak\u201d section of this chapter.\n\nSafe travel\n\nAs of 2016, Enel people travelling to destinations considered at risk have been provided with specific information detailing the healthcare situation and safety conditions of the countries in question. Specifically, by means of the company travel reservations system, the Security Guide, Security Travel Guide and Health Guide are sent out before departure, with any necessary updates added just before departure or during the trip. In relation to specific risks associated with the destination, whenever necessary Enel prepares suitable protective measures (expert guides, bodyguards, etc.). To coordinate the entire process, a 24/7 supervisory function supports staff during travel, monitors the relevant news reports and coordinates responses in the presence of situations of objective danger or emergency. The model is active in all Group Countries, guaranteeing 100% coverage of international and intercontinental travel with the integrated Travel Security system.\nIndustrial relations\n\nEnel complies with labor law in the various countries and the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) concerning workers\u2019 rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining, consultation, right to strike, etc.), systematically promoting discussion between social partners and seeking an adequate level of agreement and sharing of corporate strategies by employees. In 2020, the percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements was 90.8%, in line with the figure for 2019 (91.1%).\n\nIndustrial relations activities on the Group level continue to be conducted in accordance with the model laid down in the Enel Global Framework Agreement (GFA) signed in Rome in 2013 with the Italian Federations, and the global unions IndustriALL and Public Services International. The agreement is founded on the principles of human rights, labor rights and of the best and most advanced transnational industrial relation systems of the reference multinational groups and institutions on the international level, including the ILO. These principles include one on remuneration, whereby the minimum payment made to Group employees cannot be lower than the level established by the collective bargaining agreements and legislative and regulatory texts in force in the various countries, in line with the provisions of the ILO conventions. Enel guarantees that the equal pay principle is respected in all countries in which it maintains a presence, and therefore commits to guaranteeing the living wage for all its employees. It also promotes initiatives to ensure equal pay for equal work for men and women. Under this agreement, Enel acknowledges the right of its employees to set up or participate in trade union associations in order to protect their interests. It also awards them the right to be represented, in the various generation units, by trade union organizations and other forms of representation elected in compliance with the legislation and practices in force in the countries concerned. Enel acknowledges the value of collective bargaining as a tool to determine the contractual conditions of its employees and to regulate relations between company management and trade unions. Enel complies with the principle of trade union independence and does not interfere in any way with the organization of representation, allowing its employee representatives access to the workplaces in order to communicate with their members, in compliance with the law and the industrial relations systems in force in each country. Enel provides adequate information to its employees and to the trade union organizations that represent them, in order to facilitate collective bargaining. Enel therefore adheres to strict neutrality with regard to workers\u2019 decisions whether to join a trade union and/or the choice of the trade union by which to be represented; it recognizes as interlocutors the trade union representative of the workers in the Company, in compliance with national legislation. In the event of a discrepancy between local and international standards, Enel strives to apply the provisions that best protect workers\u2019 rights. The GFA agreement is also acknowledged and acclaimed as best practice among European and non-EU multinationals. Enel provides its people with a full range of information concerning collective labor agreements and trade union agreements, in accordance with current legislation, over the company intranet. In the event of organizational changes, Enel provides prompt information as indicated in the table below.\n\n| Country          | Minimum Period | Legal Provisions/Collective Agreements |\n|------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Italy            | 25 days        | Legal provisions                      |\n| Spain and Portugal | 30 days       | Guarantee Framework Agreement of Endesa SA and subsidiaries in Spain (September 12, 2007) |\n| Russia           | 60 days        | Legal provisions                      |\n| Romania          | Obligation to inform and consult worker representatives on business developments and to inform them periodically about the Company\u2019s economic situation. For group layoffs, at least 30 days\u2019 notice for the trade union organizations and 20 days\u2019 notice for workers. The maximum period for the group/layoff procedure is 90 days | Legal provisions |\n| Argentina        | Obligation to periodically update worker representatives; traditionally the notice period for changes in working hours, employee roles or place of work is 48 hours, although there is no specific regulation | - |\n| Brazil           | Obligation to issue a \u201ctimely\u201d notice | - |\n| Colombia         | Neither the law nor collective bargaining provide for a minimum notice period in the event of organizational changes | - |\n| Peru             | Neither the law nor collective bargaining provide for a minimum notice period in the event of organizational changes | - |\n| Chile            | Neither the law nor collective bargaining provide for a minimum notice period in the event of organizational changes | - |\nThe effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have amplified vulnerabilities and also the inequality within the various communities we operate among. Thanks to the strong roots enmeshed in the territory, we have been able to identify immediate measures for supporting urgent medical and socio-economic needs in the poor countries where Enel operates, from Europe to Latin America, Asia to Africa and Australia. More specifically, around 450 sustainability projects have been developed in two areas of intervention:\n\n- containment of the health emergency with initiatives to support hospitals and for front line assistance to citizens;\n- support for the economic revitalization of communities, through programs to support food security, development of micro-entrepreneurship, services dedicated to vulnerable customers and distance vocational and educational training.\n\nHere are some examples of projects:\n\n- **Allacciamo le energie** (Connecting energies) (Italy), by which Enel has connected to the electricity grid or increased the power of public-health facilities and areas, including temporarily, to tackle the medical emergency. From field hospitals, drive-in screening stations, to new care spaces placed adjacent to medical facilities or at trade fairs and hotels, tens of facilities throughout Italy have benefited from free connection to the electricity grid. The project was launched in March 2020 for the completion of the field hospital in Crema, a 35-bed medical facility constructed by the Italian army, enabling the supply of 400 kW to the installation for all the required equipment in just a few hours;\n\n- **Home meal deliveries** (Brazil), where Enel X, in collaboration with Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo and Riba, an electric transport company, developed a home meal delivery system for the community of Parais\u00f3polis in the southern part of S\u00e3o Paulo. By providing electric scooters and hiring delivery riders, logistics costs for the distribution of meals produced within the same community, delivered to residents in the area to support them during the pandemic, have been reduced. The initiative forms part of the Brazilian #JuntosNaMesmaEnergia (Together with the same energy) campaign, a series of initiatives focused on prevention and action against Covid-19 in Brazil.\n\nOther projects are described within this chapter.\nLOCAL AND GLOBAL COMMUNITIES\n\nResponsible community relations constitute a pillar of Enel\u2019s strategy. Constantly and proactively considering the needs and priorities of society makes it possible to accept new challenges and redefine an increasingly competitive business model, developing new creating shared value strategies and innovating in processes, also through scalable solutions.\n\nIn 2020, with around 2,100 projects and more than 8 million beneficiaries in the various countries where we are present, we made a tangible contribution to the development and social and economic growth of local areas: from the expansion of infrastructure to education and training programs, from initiatives aimed at social inclusion to projects designed to support cultural and economic activities. Specific initiatives were intended to promote access to energy, tackle energy poverty and promote social inclusion for the weaker categories of the population, by adopting new technologies and approaches of the circular economy.\n\nThe essential lever to carry out these projects is the recourse to around 1,000 partnerships with non-profit organizations, social enterprises, start-ups and institutions operating locally and internationally that promote development of the territory through innovative and tailored interventions.\n\nWe are continually seeking social innovation ideas and solutions via the Open Innovability\u00ae ecosystem, based on openness and sharing (for more details, please see the \u201cInnovation\u201d chapter of this document).\n\nFrom an operational viewpoint, knowledge of specific local requirements and continually listening to the needs of stakeholders are fundamental elements for mapping as comprehensively as possible the potential positive, but also negative impacts that the Group\u2019s activity has on the communities where our plants operate. This approach has also allowed us to develop robust actions for the new context associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, given the changed conditions caused by restrictions such as social distancing and restricted movement.\n\nWith a view to mitigating the risk associated with relationships with communities and, more generally, human rights, we carry a specific analysis both for potential critical issues and respond rapidly as needed. This configuration will be continually and proactively considering the needs and priorities of society makes it possible to accept new challenges and redefine an increasingly competitive business model, developing new creating shared value strategies and innovating in processes, also through scalable solutions.\n\nIn selecting the numerous proposals received in response to the call, Enel Cuore gave priority to those interventions that were able to promote innovative and shared forms of living (flexible residency, co-housing, shared condominiums) and especially to guarantee people with disabilities a path of employment and work integrated to those interventions that were able to promote innovative and shared forms of living (flexible residency, co-housing, shared condominiums) and especially to guarantee people with disabilities a path of employment and work integrated.\n\nValue for Disability\n\nThere are more than 1 billion people in the world living with disabilities, concentrated for the most part in low income countries. It is the largest minority in the world (15% of the global population). Levels of participation in social and economic life, and also access to education and care are significantly less than for the rest of the population. For this reason we wanted to launch local projects to promote an increase of skills, employability and entrepreneurship of disabled people. Here are some examples of projects:\n\n> \u201cBalneario inclusivo\u201d (Inclusive swimming) (Chile). We created an inclusive beach by providing two amphibian chairs and other items that have allowed people with disabilities, who have never been able to go into the sea, to enjoy swimming fully. Around 600 direct beneficiaries and more than 3 thousand indirect ones, given that the beach welcomed all disabled people from the municipalities adjacent to the Quintero area;\n\n> \u201cCocina inclusiva\u201d (Inclusive cooking) (Chile). Substantive support for the development of entrepreneurship and skills of disabled people via the realization of an infrastructure within a school complex, which will act as a cooking laboratory and where people will be able to learn advanced culinary techniques. This training will help the young students in their quest for work. In addition, another success factor has been the partnership developed with the Association of industrial companies of Mejillones and with the company that provides the catering service to the Atacama site;\n\n> \u201cMettiamo su casa!\u201d (Let\u2019s make a home!) (Italy). An initiative launched by Enel Cuore in 2017, targeting tertiary sector associations, in partnership with other entities, with the aim of promoting home autonomy of young adults with intellectual and social disabilities. In selecting the numerous proposals received in response to the call, Enel Cuore gave priority to those interventions that were able to promote innovative and shared forms of living (flexible residency, co-housing, shared condominiums) and especially to guarantee people with disabilities a path of employment and work integrated with the community. We have supported a total of seven projects, each one with elements of innovation, transferability and sustainability, whose value is measured by the degree to which they change the life of people and their communities.\nCreating Shared Value\n\nThe significant results achieved to date were made possible thanks to a \u201cCreating Shared Value - CSV\u201d strategy and model, in which success of the company is directly related to the prosperity of the communities where it operates. The strategy stands on three primary pillars:\n\n- making the value chains of the Business Lines sustainable by minimizing the use of natural resources and maximizing the value created for community (sustainable sites, for example);\n- developing sustainable and inclusive products and services, for identifying solutions that solve the requirements of people (services for vulnerable and disabled clients, for example);\n- expanding the ecosystem of partnerships and collaborations, to continually seek ideas and talents within and outside of the company.\n\nSince 2015 we have launched a new way of managing relationships with communities via a CSV model that integrates socio-environmental factors within business processes and throughout the entire value chain, with special reference to operations of business development, engineering and construction and procurement, in addition to management and maintenance of assets. A model whose primary phases are described in the infographic below, and that describes a wide range of socio-economic, environmental and cultural data. In particular, a materiality analysis is provided to correlate the priorities of stakeholders with those of the Group in order to identify and meet common needs.\n\nWithin the Engineering and Construction phase and thanks to the best practices on circular economy and sustainability in the use of resources for renewable energy generation, we have defined a \u201csustainable construction site\u201d model. This has the aim of minimizing impacts (for example by installing photovoltaic solar panels to meet part of the energy demand, the adoption of measures for saving water, including the installation of water tanks and rainwater collection systems, the use of electric vehicles for transferring workers from the city to the construction site and for travel within the construction site) and for promoting the opportunity for development via the involvement of local manpower, at the same time guaranteeing better operating efficiency and respect for the region. The primary indicators defined for the application of the model and relating to the various Business Lines:\n\n- reduction of environmental impacts (emissions, water use, waste management, saving natural resources, biodiversity);\n- social inclusion (local manpower, health and safety, local community projects);\n- development of the circular economy (reuse of materials, extension of useful life, shared platforms).\n\nResults 2020\n\nIn 2020, 1,425 applications of the CSV model have been realized in the various phases of the value chain.\n\nCSV APPLICATIONS\n\n| Business Development | Engineering & Construction | Operation & Maintenance |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 23                   | 4                         | 78                      |\n| 94                   | 66                        | 1,080                   |\n| 5                    | 2                         | 71                      |\n| 122                  | 72                        | 1,231[1]                |\n| 1,425                |                           |                         |\n\n[1] The total value includes 2 CSV applications related to the Market area.\n\n(1) An application is interpreted as the use of at least one CSV instrument in relation to an asset. In any phase of the value chain and in any Business Line. The CSV applications in the BD phase include applications regarding BD opportunities (also at the beginning phases) and business projects output from the pipeline. They can also relate to assets in O&M in the case of modernizing projects or decommissioning activities. The CSV applications in the E&C phase can refer to assets passed to the O&M phase at the end of the year. The number of CSV applications in Infrastructure & Networks (I&N) may refer to the concession area, but also areas identified by municipalities and subations. For the NFS parameter alone (i.e. excluding companies consolidated using the equity method, foundations and non-profit organizations of the Group) and the companies for which the BSG - Build, Sell and Operate mechanism was applied the number of CSV applications for 2020 amounts to 1,396 (compared to 1,318 in 2019).\nThe sustainability of the strategy is also confirmed by the progress achieved in terms of the Group\u2019s contribution to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), with particular reference to projects for:\n\n- ensuring inclusive, equitable and quality education (SDG 4), which has benefited 2.3 million people;\n- ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy (SDG 7) which has affected 9.8 million people to date;\n- promoting sustained, lasting, inclusive and sustainable economic growth (SDG 8) with 3 million beneficiaries.\n\nThe results achieved have allowed us to review our goals for 2030, doubling the number of people that may benefit from projects that ensure quality education (SDG 4); target of 5 million beneficiaries for 2030) and access to energy (SDG 7: target of 20 million beneficiaries for 2030). We have also confirmed the commitment to initiatives for promoting lasting, inclusive and sustainable economic growth (SDG 8: target of 8 million beneficiaries for 2030).\n\nThe LBG method\n\nWe make a substantive contribution to the development and social and economic growth of the territories and communities where we operate with varying types of intervention, ranging from the expansion of infrastructure to education and training programs, from initiatives targeting social inclusion initiatives to projects supporting local cultural life. The LBG (London Benchmarking Group) method, defined by a work group in which more than 100 international companies participate, identifies a measurement model that makes it possible to clearly determine and classify the Company\u2019s contribution towards the development of the communities where it is present.\n\nIn particular, according to the LBG standard, the expense for the contributions to the communities can be divided as follows:\n\n- donations: pro bono contributions and without obligations for the beneficiaries, except that they have to use the donation for charitable purposes and for non-profit associations. For Enel, this item includes all the moneys and \u201cin kind\u201d charitable donations, including those for philanthropic and solidarity activities;\n- community investments: medium-long term involvement in community support projects, also in partnership with local organizations, aimed at addressing significant problems both for the territory and for the Company. This category includes, for example, projects related to a wider strategy to the benefit of the community such as \u201cAccess to electricity\u201d, or specific initiatives dedicated to the communities near the power plants;\n- commercial initiatives with a social impact: contributes to activities connected to the core business, in which the Company promotes its own brand and its own corporate identity. Examples of these initiatives are the marketing activities that also provide benefits for the community, or that include contributions for charitable purposes.\n\nIn 2020, we contributed more than 104 million euros to the communities we operate in.\n\nSome examples of sustainability projects\n\n- \u201cUrban gardens below electricity lines\u201d (Brazil): the program, developed with a local partner, promotes and incentivizes the creation of urban gardens by offering parcels of Enel-owned land situated under electricity transmission cables to residents of urban areas to cultivate organic food. The produce of the gardens is then marketed and sold directly by the local growers, thereby creating opportunities for work, professional training, social entrepreneurship for low-income communities. The initiative represents an opportunity for requalifying the urban space below the electricity cables, at the same time supporting the commercial activities of small producers and growers. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, we established a partnership for supplying 11 tons of food produced by the urban planters for the community of Parais\u00f3polis, providing direct and substantive support to particularly vulnerable communities. This partnership forms part of the pilot project developed by Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo with the NGO Cidades sem Fome.\n- Digitization and support for SMEs to tackle the Covid-19 crisis (Spain): Endesa and the non-profit organization Youth Business Spain Foundation launched a national program with the goal of helping small businesses and independent workers tackle the economic crisis caused by the interruption of entrepreneurial activity in many sectors, due to Covid-19. The program assists small business men and women to enter into a program of orientation and reactivation of activities via dedicated consulting and training plans, social micro-lending initiatives, the purchase of computer equipment and support for the development of ICT and digital skills, offering them a strategic overview for...\nthe development of websites, e-commerce platforms and digitization of customer relationships. The project forms an instrument for social and economic integration and is aimed in particular at the groups considered the most vulnerable: young people up to 35 years, small entrepreneurs in the 55 to 65 age group, women, immigrants, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities.\n\n> Help for families to overcome the digital divide (Spain): the interruption of in-person education during the pandemic has given rise to numerous problems associated with the digital divide, causing difficulties especially among low-income families who have no PC or tablet or internet connection. Via a series of actions, Endesa is committed to rebalancing the digital divide among children and young people of various economic backgrounds, with the aim of avoiding a real educational crisis in the areas most at risk, such as the peripheries of large cities or rural areas. The plan envisages education in digital skills for teachers and students, as well as the donation of more than 5 thousand computers and computer devices to students belonging to families in vulnerable situations.\n\nAurora solar Park: our first sustainable, dual-use plant\n\nSolar energy with dual-use means using the land for generating solar energy and at the same time applying practices to preserve the natural capital and offer services to the ecosystem. The Aurora Park does not just generate energy, but plays an essential role for pollinators, wild fauna and in improving water quality. Certain studies have demonstrated that climate change has contributed to the reduction of the bee population, these fundamental pollinators help maintain our ecosystem. At Aurora Park, our approach with a secondary aim, of defending pollinators, is helping us to resolve both problems. We generate energy without harmful emissions and provide a favorable habitat for bees. The beekeeping cooperatives found beyond the fence, but still on Enel land, are exploiting the local flora and ecosystem at the Aurora site to help the populations of bees, with the aim of enhancing the productivity of growers of the surrounding agricultural businesses. In addition, these generate a sweet product that consumers can enjoy: Aurora honey is being sold to the food and drinks industry and is being used in products such as snacks and even beer.\n\nEnel Cuore\n\nThe Enel Cuore (Enel Heart) non-profit organization born in 2003 out of our wish to express our commitment to social solidarity in a transparent way, to be close to people and the community with genuine heartfelt energy. Thanks to the Open Power approach, the non-profit is increasingly involved in social issues by supporting numerous activities of tertiary sector organizations in Italy. As in previous years, during 2020, the orientation towards large-scale impact projects for the community\u2019s children and young people, but also adults, especially in the poorer socio-economic conditions, addressed support for education, parenthood and work.\n\nHowever in 2020, to meet the health care needs and support our country in the Covid-19 pandemic, Enel Cuore concentrated efforts on projects for supporting frontline organizations involved in tackling the emergency, with a contribution of 23 million euros for Civil Protection Department, medical facilities, non-profit organizations, local administrations throughout the country. An initial part of the fund was designated for the more urgent interventions in Lombardy, such as the Mutual Rescue Fund established by the Municipality of Milan, San Raffaele hospital and Humanitas Gavazzeni hospital, Bergamo. The commitment of Enel Cuore was then extended to the other Italian regions: from Liguria to Sicily, Emilia-Romagna to Apulia. Grants enabled new intensive care beds to be set up, pre-triage facilities for admitting patients, purchases of medical equipment and personal protection equipment for the doctors and nurses.\n\nAmong the main projects was the crowdfunded \u201c5 non-profit organizations\u201d initiative, a collection of internal funds that also involved the senior management and the Boards of Directors, and which concluded with more than 1 million euros pledged, an amount that was then doubled by Enel Cuore. More than 2 million euros destined for five tertiary sector associations for the fulfilment of projects to protect the weaker population groups. The beneficiary associations:\n\n> Caritas: support for tackling the health care, social and economic emergency needs of people in extreme poverty, responding to the need for food via the Em- pori Solidali (cohesive marketplaces), material help for families in economic difficulties, and the distribution services of primary goods (food, home products, hygiene products) to allow rapid resumption of activity for families in difficulty.\n\n> Fondazione Banco Alimentare (Food Bank Foundation): support for guaranteeing supplies of charitable organizations and families by expanding the power of the distribution network of the Foundation\u2019s food goods, especially in the central-southern part of the country, by hiring new people, acquiring temporary storage, personal protection equipment, activating ordinary and extraordinary cleaning works and purchasing fuel for the vehicles to transport the food.\n\n> Comunit\u00e0 di Sant\u2019Egidio (Sant\u2019Egidio Community): support to the project \u201cEmergenza sanitaria 2020, Programma Viva gli Anziani\u201d [Health care emergency 2020, elderly program] of the Community of Sant\u2019Egidio, the ACAP non-profit organization has the goal of extending the program already activated in various Italian cities for supporting elderly people, providing home support services and meeting daily needs in order to limit the need to go out (shopping and meals at home, medical prescriptions and medicines, distribution of essential needs, transport/accompaniment service for urgent and unavoidable visits).\n\n> Federazione Italiana Superamento Handicap (Italian Federation for Overcoming Handicaps) (FISH): support to the project \u201cCovid-19 Per le persone con disabilit\u00e0 insieme si pu\u00f2!\u201d (Covid-19 For people with disability together we can!) promoted by FISH. The project aims to provide a series of integrated interventions intended for limiting the effects of the emergency due to the pandemic and the consequences, which are even more serious for people with disabilities. In particular, the project has the aim of guaranteeing continuation of medicinal therapies and rehabilitative services, offering personal and family psychological support and continuing daily activities (education, food shopping).\n\n> Federazione Nazionale degli Ordini delle Professioni Infermieristiche (National Federation of Nursing Professions) (FNOPi) support for the establishment of the cohesion fund #NoiConGliInfermieri (#WeWith- TheNurses) to support all nurses and their families involved in the health care emergency. In particular the funds intended for physical and psychological support for full recovery of nurses who have fallen ill carrying out their work, those forced to quarantine having contracted the virus, families of those who were lost due to the illness.\n\nFor more information please refer to www.enelcuore.it.\nAccess to energy\n\nAccess to energy represents a challenge and a primary need as stated by the United Nations SDG 7, which aims to provide everyone with access to economic, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy systems. The Energy Progress Report provides the international community with a global dashboard for recording progress toward this sustainable development goal. The 2020 report highlights that 789 million people in 2018 did not have access to electricity, a figure which is down compared to the 1.2 billion of 2010.\n\nWith a constant and proactive approach to the needs of society, we aim to develop sustainable business models that can drive change and guarantee not only access to clean energy, but also sustainable development of communities. Modern energy services and connectivity represent the keys for changing the quality of life of people, transforming communities into ever more connected spaces. For example, to achieve this goal we shared the Wi-Fi of our electricity power plants located in rural areas with the adjacent communities and we promoted the development of digital incubators for the development of new services. In all countries where we operate, we are close to people and support in particular the most vulnerable sections of the population, both through initiatives, usually inspired by the government, that provide economic support in facing energy costs, and through projects in developing countries that promote access to energy by a greater number of persons.\n\nThis commitment is confirmed in the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan through the definition of specific objectives, including an increase in renewable sources, energy efficiency initiatives, the development of sustainable and circular products and services, engaging local communities through a creating shared value model (please see the section \u201cValue for territories\u201d in this chapter and the \u201cAt a Glance\u201d chapter).\n\nThe Strategic Plan, the Sustainability Plan that describes in detail the goals and commitments from an ESG point of view, including access to energy and the related financial and non-financial reporting are analyzed and monitored by the Board of Directors, by means of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Control and Risk Committee (see the Report on Corporate Governance, available at www.enel.com). Top management is engaged on a daily basis in realizing these strategic objectives by contributing towards supporting the global challenge of guaranteeing access to energy. In line with Enel\u2019s sustainable business model, each Business Line/country promotes specific initiatives for its area of responsibility, such as the development of renewable assets in mature countries and in developing countries (Global Power Generation Business Line), energy efficiency, responsible consumption and offers dedicated to vulnerable segments (Infrastructure and Networks, Enel X, Market-Countries). To support top management, each country is responsible for managing relationships with institutional bodies, regulatory authorities on a national, regional and local level, and associations for promoting the development of solutions for access to energy according to different needs. The Innovability\u00ae Function, both on a holding level and on a Business Line/country level, also promotes the dissemination of a shared value model. It supports innovative solutions that can promote access to energy in remote areas with limited access to electricity.\n\nPromoting access to energy in developing countries\n\nWe are committed to promoting access to electricity in developing countries via initiatives and projects for improving the living conditions of communities and the availability of energy. A commitment that does not involve only the supply of electricity, but also the possibility of making innovative and clean energy generation technologies available to populations with a reduced environmental impact and at competitive prices. For example, approximately 1,700 MW of renewable generation was commissioned in Latin America in 2020, increasing the total renewable capacity to more than 17,500 MW. In Africa, Enel Green Power is currently the main private operator in the renewable sector in terms of installed capacity (more than 900 MW in operation and almost 900 MW under construction), with a presence in different countries, including South Africa, Zambia and Morocco. In Asia, the Group is present in India through its subsidiary BPL Ener-\nes were reduced significantly, training seminars for customers were organized on issues such as energy efficiency and electrical safety. Two local people were hired as consultants for informing new customers of the new benefits they can access via the portfolio of product and services Enel X offers.\n\n**Fighting energy poverty in developed countries**\n\nEven if the system for access to energy is guaranteed in developed countries, following the serious global economic crises that affected low-income families in this country in particular, there are consumers who find it difficult to pay their energy costs. Even if governments have the primary responsibility of guaranteeing sustainable, safe and economic access to basic energy services, the electric sector can contribute towards promoting sustainable social-economic development. We have always been committed to collaborating with governments to combat energy poverty and promote access to energy for the vulnerable population of developed countries. Over recent years, we have adopted different forms of support, often through existing government initiatives, in order to reduce the cost of the energy bill for vulnerable customers in developed markets, such as Italy, Spain and Romania (see also the section \u201cCare of vulnerable customers\u201d in the chapter \u201cElectrification, digital and platforms\u201d). Various campaigns and activities were also organized to provide the population living in vulnerable conditions with advice about responsible energy consumption. Here are some examples of the projects carried out in Spain:\n\n- **voluntary energy program**, intended to help low-income families by providing them with specific advice about responsible energy consumption by distributing energy efficiency kits and, in some cases, introducing improvements to the electrical systems of the most vulnerable families. This initiative is managed by volunteers, who are employed by Endesa, in close collaboration with civil society organizations. In the first half of 2020 the project was suspended following the pandemic and resumed in the second half of the year in digital format. During 2020, 153 families were involved.\n\n- **training for responsible energy consumption and tariff optimization**, currently in online mode, which in 2020 saw the participation of 136 institutions which provided advice to around 22 thousand people who struggle to pay their energy bills. The course received an assessment of 4.5/5.\n\n- **project Confia (Spain)**: agile project for improving management of vulnerable customers via the Blockchain. This pioneering project is an example of open innovation where Endesa, the Municipality of Malaga, the University of Malaga, two software suppliers and Alastria collaborated to improve coordination between the public administrations involved, social services and energy companies. This innovative management system allows social services to be able to identify situations of difficulty in real time involving vulnerable customers, in order to give them immediate support to address the payment of electricity and gas supplies, ensuring that they can benefit from the support prescribed by law. This project unites the Endesa social commitment, technological innovation and the continual quest for process efficiency.\n\n**Main projects in progress and resettlement management**\n\nA presence in such a vast geographic perimeter of countries and regions necessarily calls for the evaluation of very different scenarios and radical knowledge of each area and the needs of the various stakeholders in order to identify targeted solutions. Each infrastructure project is discussed therefore, with evaluations by the community and involved stakeholders, which could involve criticism or partial acceptance in some cases, especially when related to resettlement activities. In these latter cases, the Group may be exposed to reputational risks, also in relation to their interaction with local suppliers, as well as operational risks related to delays in executing projects or completing them, with possible repercussions on the supply chain. The involvement of the concerned parties in the processes for the planning and development of the infrastructure is of fundamental importance, especially if the construction of a new plant involves the resettlement of a part of the resident population in the surrounding areas. Resettlement management must involve the population and the concerned persons as well as a close evaluation of the psychological and social problems that are possible on an individual and collective level. The approach when selecting potential sites is therefore to minimize as far as possible the need to move the population. This is done by analyzing the economic, political, cultural and social-demographic aspects, including an analysis of the daily life of the communities that live in the area of influence, the distribution of the population, the organizational forms, the employment and remuneration levels. In the cases in which resettlement is confirmed, the project is carried out in compliance with applicable international standards, considering possible impacts on the different forms of physical, human, economic, environmental and cultural capital of the concerned populations. Any resettlement projects will be carried out in compliance with the applicable legislation of the involved country, including the local regulations that specify the conditions for resettlement and the methods for calculating the related economic compensation. Enel\u2019s sensitivity to this issue is also addressed in the Group Policy on Human Rights (see chapter \u201cSound governance\u201d) and the processes for interacting with the communities are inspired by a model for shared creation of value. A description is provided below of the most significant cases in progress related to plants constructed in the past but that present residual areas of criticality, the positive and/or negative impacts (actual or feared) on the territory and the way in which the concerned Group companies are promoting a proactive dialogue to reach solutions that are as shared as possible.\n\n**Bocamina plant (Chile)**\n\nThe Bocamina II plant is a 350 MW coal-fired thermoelectric power plant whose construction started in 2007 in the municipality of Coronel, Region of Bio Bio, in Chile. The plant is part of the Bocamina coal-fired thermoelectric power station, whose first unit, 128 MW, was built in the 60s and put in operation in the 1970. The second unit was built in an area next to the first, with approximately 1,300 families living nearby. The construction of the second coal-fired generation unit implied the relocation of the families living nearby to the site intended for the plant. The method for relocating families has been completely reviewed since 2017 and aligned with the main applicable international standards, including standard IFC no. 5 \u201cLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement\u201d. We started a detailed analysis process in order to identify the suitable actions to implement in order to improve relationships with the local community. This analysis was carried out also with the support of a company with considerable experience in this topic, Environmental Resources Management, and an action plan was prepared based on the results. The new neighborhoods had social, sports and religious infrastructure which were not initially considered for the process, enabling community values to be recovered. To date, all families involved in the relocation process have been consulted and involved, with more than 1,200 agree-\nments concluded out of a total of 1,370. The remaining families decided not to go along with the relocation and stayed in the original place. The relocation process was formally closed in August 2020.\n\nIn a press release on 4 January 2021, we announced that via the subsidiary Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile SA, we disconnected the electricity grid and terminated the group I activity of the coal-fired plant in Bocamina, in the municipality of Coronel in Chile. Group I was disconnected from the electricity grid three years in advance of the date identified in the Chilean National Decarbonization Plan. This goal, linked to the closure of the Tarapac\u00e1 coal-fired plant, achieved on 31 December 2019, and the last Enel coal plant in Chile, Bocamina group II, scheduled for May 2022, marks progress in the decarbonization of the Enel generation mix in the country.\n\nThe process for a true transition started in Coronel by Enel from 2017, allowed us to redesign relationships with the communities and focus on local development, respect and transparency between the parties. During the course of the year, various actions were implemented in favor of the communities, always based on the criteria of accountability, transparency, measurement and equity of solutions, in order to create shared value over the long term. Below are some examples:\n\n- identification of structural improvements needed for the homes in the communities of Huertos Familiares and Do\u00f1a Isidora. In 2018, a technical committee was formed, comprising representatives of the Company, the community and CITEC Universidad del B\u00edo B\u00edo, which focused on identifying the repairs that were necessary for the homes with construction defects. The works initiated in 2020 for the repair of six prototype houses, at the end of which we will apply it on a larger scale;\n- the creation of a dashboard summarising the impacts on the quality of life of families due to construction defects in the homes the communities lived in starting from 2010, as well as the quantification and liquidation of the relative compensation;\n- reconstruction or financial compensation for the 12 churches which were not involved in the relocation process;\n- agreement for the reconstruction of the historic Rosa Medel church in Coronel. According to the agreements in force with the municipality and with the community, the Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile financing was defined in 2020;\n- the development of the \u201cMi barrio, nuestro barrio\u201d (\u201cMy neighborhood, our neighborhood\u201d) program, which includes implementation of requalification projects for new and pre-existing areas affected by the plant. As well as the completion of a sports center in the community of Huertos Familiares and a social center eco-built by the women of Cerro Obligado, the construction was completed of a \u201cSense park\u201d, which offers an experience in the indigenous greenery and vegetation. From 2020 the works were initiated for further social sites in three neighborhoods of Coronel as part of the plan for the recovery of common spaces for the relocated communities;\n- Coronel cleaning plan: the plan involves the elimination of the micro-waste landfills and the removal of residual materials from the homes where the transferred families lived previously, avoiding environmental impacts and situations of abandonment and insecurity;\n- transfer of eco-sustainable skills and circular economy projects: in the community of Cerro Obligado an eco-building and an eco-furnishing training project solely for women was realized in collaboration with the NGO Sense, to date four women have had the training and from 2018 had their own operation in their workshop in Coronel where they reuse pallets and other materials of various local industries, transforming them into furniture and other items. The workshop also has electric vehicles to deliver their products;\n- community participatory process. Chile\u2019s longest mural was created in Coronel, outside the perimeter wall of the Bocamina power plant. The project involved more than 70 people, from children to grandparents. Also in 2019, Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile defined a method of participation in special loans with the fishing community for reinforcing traditional fishing. Last year two funds were launched relating to 2019 and 2020, allowing more than 580 small entrepreneurs to access the resources for improving their operations. Again to reinforce the local entrepreneurial fabric, Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile has since 2016 made available to the small enterprises of Coronel, an annual fund which 150 businesses have been able to access for improving their operations. The latest edition of the fund will be fulfilled in 2021.\n- in order to promote relations, dialog and transparency, the Casa Abierta Coronel has been available for some years. It is a place of reference for the entire community, in line with Enel\u2019s Open Power vision, where it is possible to speak openly with the Company, receive information, raise any complaints and evaluate solutions with a group of available experts. The criteria at the basis are transparency, fairness and non-discrimination. Via the development of a system for managing community complaints and/or requests according to the criteria of transparency and equity, it has been possible to resolve almost 600 cases successfully thanks to a multifunctional team which includes legal experts, relocation and sustainability consultants, and that ensures verifiability, transparency and equity of the solutions.\n\nFurther information can be found in the Enel Chile and Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile Sustainability Report (www.enel.cl; www.enelgeneracion.cl).\n\nAlto Bio Bio plants (Ralco, Pangue and Palmuco \u2013 Chile)\n\nEnel Generaci\u00f3n Chile manages three hydroelectric power plants in the area of Alto Bio Bio (Ralco, Pangue and Palmuco), which is an area with the historical presence of the indigenous Pehuenche populations. In numbers, the Pehuenche population in the area of influence of the plants amounts to approximately 3,000 people, comprising 800 families in 10 communities (Pitril, Callaqui, El Avellano, Auki\u00f1 Wallmapu, Quepuca Ralco, Ralco Lepoy, El Barco, Guayal, Pwen Mapu and Ayn Mapul). In February 2017, an important collaboration agreement was signed with 25 families of the Auki\u00f1 Wallmapu community to start local development projects. The agreement resolves the conflict regarding the impacts generated during the construction of the Ralco plant. On the same issue, in June 2017, Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile also signed two agreements with the El Avellano and Quepuca Ralco communities. In March 2017, Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile officially handed over to the El Barco community its ancestral cemetery, thereby providing a substantive response to the company\u2019s commitment to the community following the construction of the plant. In the same context, in 2020, Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile and the local communities marked an important step forward with the project for the Quepuca Ralco school. The construction of the school is part of the company\u2019s commitments following the construction of the Ralco plant. The agreed plan celebrates the cultural identity of the Pehuenche communities.\n\nSocio-economic development\n\nFollowing a request made mainly by the El Avellano community, a community project was created in 2018 for the collection, transformation and sale of hazelnuts. In 2019, the production department was inaugurated, which made it possible for the community to transform its autochthonous hazelnuts into subproducts to supply to the market, thereby expanding sales to other customers. The project is promoted by Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile, together with the University of Concepci\u00f3n, the community of El Avellano, the municipality of Alto Bio Bio and the Pehuenche foundation. It made it possible to transform a traditional activity into a micro-entrepreneurial activity for the community, while also preserving the natural hazelnut forest. In consideration of the touristic and recreational potential of the areas near the plants, and in order to promote the social-economic development of the local communities, specific projects promoting sustainable tourism were started. In particular, one was started for the area adjacent to the El Barco Laguna, where local business people currently offer camping, tour and gastronomy services. More than 6,000 tourists visit the area every season, representing an important potential for this initiative. The collaboration between Enel and the community was car-\ned to return approximately 6 hectares of indigenous land near the Pimpiqu\u00e9n hydroelectric power station. Today, the community manages this territory with a sustainable tourism project, opening the areas ecosystem to visitors, which is explained according to the Mapuche cosmovision of conservation of the equilibrium of natural resources. This area, which is called Parque La Isla, welcomes approximately 6 thousand tourists every year, bringing economic benefits to the community. A large amount of their profits are invested in park conservation. Thanks to the training of local artisans and the growing flow of visitors, an increasing number of people can benefit from this project by selling their products. To guarantee the presence of the beautiful waterfalls, Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile releases the water from its hydroelectric operation for the benefit of local tourism.\n\nIn 2020, a new phase of the program was initiated and which envisages the integration of the \u201cCommunity of water\u201d in technological programs. Water users were organized within the territory in Chile for correct distribution of this precious resource among the different users with rights. To identify initiatives for water preservation in the hydroelectric basins shared with the agricultural sector, in the region of Maule, a \u201cHydroenergy by design\u201d study was carried out to identify conservation strategies jointly with the local stakeholders for the hydrogeological ecosystem. This program, shared with the territory, will lead to territorial environmental planning according to collective participation.\n\nEl Quimbo plant (Colombia)\n\nEl Quimbo is the most imposing civil engineering project realized by the Enel Group over the past years and represents one of the greatest hydroelectric investments in South America. The power plant has an installed power of 400 MW and is located in the region of Huila, south-west of Bogot\u00e1. The project was authorized in March 2008 and obtained the environmental license in May 2009 and, in November 2010, construction began. The project consists of a 55 kilometer long reservoir, making one of the largest reservoirs in the nation, and its dam is 151 meters high. The Quimbo Project has foreseen important investments for infrastructure, the environment and surrounding communities. From the beginning of construction, Enel has expressed its full availability and support, while in the remaining 5% processes were reinforced via technological transfer and legal/administrative support. In addition, following the spread of Covid-19, the company contributed to tackling the food emergency, providing food in the six municipalities of the area affected directly, and the health care area, providing more than 500 personal protective equipment kits to the medical staff in 12 centers in 10 municipalities of the region of Huila (a total of 750 people).\n\nThe projects continued to address the needs of the community with a view to the creation of shared value, and new ones were launched with important entities and associations. In particular:\n\n- 89 production projects were consolidated associated with the cultivation of cacao, passion fruit, pineapple, coffee and animals;\n- the grant intended for the realization of various production projects and for promoting economic growth in the directly influenced areas was paid out entirely. In El Agradro (137 benefiting families) and Garzon (13,832 benefiting families) the actions related to the improvement of water/sanitary conditions in the town center and the road infrastructure, while in Gigante (2,559 benefiting families) projects were aimed at agricultural production and the improvement of road and sports infrastructure in the rural areas of the municipality;\n- the cooperation agreement signed with Casa Luker, the\nUnited States Agency for International Development \u2013 USAID, the EAFIT University and Saldarriaga Concha Foundation continued in the six municipalities covered in 2019 El Agra- do, Garz\u00f3n, Gigante, El Pital, Campeche, Riveral and was extended to the municipalities of Algeciras and Hobo.\n\nIn April 2020, cacao was planted over an area of 132 ha, with the involvement of 100 farming families. 266 people participated in the \u201cSoy Cacauccor\u201d training and 162 families were included in the planting and rehabilitation programs. These producers will plant an area of 120 ha and will rehabilitate another 200. Lastly, with the support of the EAFIT University, the analysis of skills was completed in eight associations of cacao producers in Huila: Asopeca, Asprocar, Asocacaco El Pital, Asociagante, Ambic- ar, La Cacatera, Asproagrodo and Asacopetrollos.\n\nEnvironmental management\n\nThe educational and support projects continued for the management and rational use of natural resources and environmental protection in the communities in the areas of direct and indirect influence, including the educational institutions of the six municipalities of the area. In particular, in 2020 the following was carried out:\n\n- 10 dedicated training sessions for the relocated families, with the topics being the three pillars for generating efficiency in production projects: rational use and management of water for consumption and irrigation, production, agrifood marketing and technology, marketing and production administration and organization of producers.\n- More than 320 actions for promoting environmental awareness in the regions concerned, including training courses in the electricity industry and consulting local interest groups for making them independent in the management and conception of projects.\n- 7 actions dedicated to sustainable tourism which saw the participation of public and private institutions and organizations belonging to the areas directly influenced. One of the initiatives launched the first webinar on tourism, held by the University of Medell\u00edn: \u201cSustainable tourism in times of pandemic: An opportunity for change\u201d, which made possible to make tourism operators aware of the impact that this activity has on ecosystems and on the importance of issues such as preservation of biodiversity, circular economy and climate change. Taking part in the initiative were 58 people from the departments of Huila, Caldas, Cauca, Cundinamarca and Antioquia.\n\nCommunication channels and legal proceedings\n\nSpecific communication channels were defined to provide information and respond to all the questions from the community regarding the project (dedicated web page, social channels, newsletter etc.). In the Garz\u00f3n and Gigante offices, around 580 people were assisted following requests and petitions. 96% of people were satisfied with the assistance they received.\n\nAdditional initiatives and information about the projects are available in the Emgesa Sustainability Report 2020 (https://www.enel.com.co/es/medio-ambiente-desarrollo-sostenible.html) and on the website dedicated to the project (https://www.enel.com.co/es/conoce-enel/emgesa/el-quimbo.html).\n\nRestoration of the tropical forest (Colombia, Quimbo hydroelectric plant)\n\nSince 2014, Enel-Emgesa has developed the largest ecological restoration project of the dry tropical forest in Colombia over an area of 11,079 ha as an environmental compensation measure of the construction of the El Quimbo plant in the region of Huila. During the initial pilot phase (2014-2018), the best strategies and the native species subject to restoration were defined for an area of 140 ha. The primary results were the propagation of around 215 thousand plants of 62 indigenous species, the construction of 21,840 m of fencing for controlling the animals from neighboring farms, the building of a research center and the discovery of a new unique plant species called Pitcairnia huilensis. A protected area of 918 ha called Cerro Matambo was declared within the restoration area, to help preserve the biodiversity of the region. During the second phase, launched in 2018, a goal was set of 500 ha to be in active restoration by 2021, of which 240 ha had already been restored in 2020. This will involve the conservation and maintenance of 478 thousand plants of at least 40 different species. The project will continue in the subsequent years until completion of the goal of total restoration.\n\nOther development projects\n\n850 MW EGP-Nareva consortium wind power program\n\nIn March 2016, a consortium of Enel Green Power and the Moroccan company Nareva, in partnership with the supplier Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, was awarded the project for the development, construction and management of five wind plants in the communes of Midelt, Tan- ger, Jbel Lahdid, Boujdour and Tiskrad with a total installed capacity of 850 MW. Their construction will require a total investment of approximately 1 billion euros.\n\nThe investment will provide renewable energy, supporting social, economic and environmental development in the various areas involved, increasing access to electricity and reducing dependence on fossil energy sources. The investment also complies with the principles adopted by the international community concerning environmental protection, human rights and the reduction of emissions from coal, and does not involve any kind of extraction.\n\nIn preparing the proposal, the consortium carried out a preliminary analysis of the social, economic and environmental context (SEECA) with the help of external specialists in the areas in which the plants are to be built. The SEECA identified the relevant socio-economic problems and the specific needs of the local communities that include, among others: development of infrastructure, development of education, health care, development of social services, poverty and protection of cultural heritage.\n\nFurthermore, an Environmental Social Impact Assessment was carried out in compliance with the standards of the International Finance Corporation and with international guidelines, for investments in the Midelt and Boujdour sites. It is being carried out for the Jbel Lahdid site and will be developed for Tiskrad. Various consultation processes were carried out with the stakeholders in Midelt, Boujdour and Jbel Lahdid. For all sites, a second SEECA and consultation is performed.\n\nFrom the analyses performed we can determine the impacts and benefits for each site, from which the Sustainability Plans can be defined. The sustainability actions and projects are realized during all phases of the renewable project, starting from the construction and continuing into the operation. Specifically, during the construction phase, the consortium is carrying out sustainability actions within the \u201csustainable construction site\u201d model, based on practices and solutions that maximize the social, economic and environmental benefits for the territory and surrounding communities. This model is a standard Enel practice adopted in all sites around the world.\n\nFor the Midelt plant, the financial close was on November 5, 2018, and the construction phase started in December 2018 and ended in November 2020. The application of the sustainable construction site model on this plant generated positive impacts for local communities in terms of employment, training and skills transfer: 300 workers, selected from local communities, were trained and employed by contractors and active local SMEs, for example in the transport, hotel, restaurant and cleaning sectors. The minimal environmental impacts were measured and therefore mitigated by adopting virtuous solutions and actions regarding emissions, water consumption and waste. The main solutions that were implemented are indicated below:\n\n- CO2 emissions: photovoltaic mini-grid to power the base camp and auxiliary services; generation of photovoltaic energy integrated with batteries used to power the turbine erection phase, autonomous photovoltaic modules to power prefabricated buildings/containers at the base camp; street lights powered by photovoltaic plants;\n- Water use, incentivizing recycling: adoption of collection, treatment, storage and reuse systems for rainwater, for example for the production of cement and for community use; reactivation of the well to benefit the community with the installation of a pumping system powered by the photovoltaic plant;\n- Use of materials and promoting recycling: reuse of all excavated materials for improving road and slopes conditions, and for creating new access and transit roads to the benefit the community; recycling of wood and metal used to create signs within the site.\n\nThe consultation of the SEECA for the Midelt site led to the definition of specific sustainability projects subject to development during the plant operation phase. A plan is also being finalized for the application of the Sustainable Plant Model, intended to maximize social, environmental and economic benefits for the territory and surrounding communities during the operation phase, similar to that achieved during the construction phase with the sustainable construction site.\n\nThe adoption of a sustainable construction site model is also in progress for the Boujdour site with practices similar to those previously described. Specific actions have been also launched during the construction phase intended to maximize the benefits for the surrounding communities in terms of employment, creation of skills and use of local SMEs, which will also continue during the plant operation phase.\n\nIn addition, during 2020, a due diligence of human rights was performed for the Boujdour site based on the principle UN guidelines for businesses and human rights, with\nthe support of a renowned independent non-profit organization with broad experience in this field. The result of this activity was the drafting of an action plan for interventions beyond the initiatives above mentioned, some of which had already been realized, for:\n\n- guaranteeing anonymous access to grievance channels by employees and the community;\n- avoiding discrimination in employment and promoting the use of Saharawi staff, including by means of specific training programs;\n- launching ad hoc projects/infrastructure for the needs of the people who live in remote villages or for small local businesses.\n\nThe results of the due diligence were also considered for a new SECOA and for defining the process for consulting representatives of the Saharawi population, carried out independently by primary company with proven experience in the area of sustainability. The consultation included vulnerable groups, all ethnic Saharawis, and was conducted in Hassaniya Arabic, the Saharawi language, thanks to the inclusion of an expert on this ethnic group in the team. Interviews generally focused on expectations and concerns about the project, perception of the project by the community, general challenges in the province and in the areas neighboring the site, means of support for the population, access to water and to electricity.\n\nThe consultation lead to a \u2018social license\u2019 to operate in light of the general acceptance of the renewal project by the Saharawi stakeholders, who highlighted numerous opportunities deriving from it in terms of employment and local economic development, evaluating the project in line with the advocacy activity they carried out for their people\u2019s right to development, work and access to energy. Some young people expressed the fear that the absence of local skills in the area of renewables would form an obstacle to their employment in the project. Therefore the Sustainability Plan specific to Boujdour promotes the inclusion within the project\u2019s value chain of the communities and small local businesses during the plant operation phase with a particular focus on ethnic Saharawis, training and construction for local skills, intervention in favor of the more vulnerable herding communities, and support for local cooperatives.\n\nWindpeshi project \u2013 Colombia, La Guajira\n\nThe Enel Group wishes to drive the energy revolution in Colombia, also promoting the development of new operating dynamics, such as the introduction of energy of-fers, the creation of new opportunities for diversification of the existing energy mix and increase of market competition. This will generate a benefit in the optimization of the use of energy resources which contribute to the efficiency of the energy system in Colombia, a country which recently initiated the construction of new renewable energy projects. Via the Group\u2019s experience and know-how developed throughout the world, Enel Green Power is primed to offer Colombia a strong impulse for diversification of the energy generation mix, promoting and sustaining the development of renewable energy sources, i.e. wind and solar, and continuing to pay attention to future opportunities in the Colombian electricity sector.\n\nIn 2019 five Enel Green Power projects were awarded around 740 GWh/year in the Cargo por Confiabilidad tender. The winning projects, three of which were wind and two solar, will supply the country\u2019s energy systems. Windpeshi, Tumawind and Chemesky are the wind farms in the La Guajira department, a region characterized by a significant presence of the indigenous population, which represents 20% of this population in the whole country. Historically, it is a region with a very high rate of primary unmet needs such as access to potable water, energy and education.\n\nFor the Windpeshi plant, the Group launched the construction both of the wind farm and a transmission line. In both cases, the communities involved were consulted: 11 relating to the wind farm and 23 regarding the transmission line. The consultation process enabled identifying opportunities for developing projects that can promote access to both potable water and to education. In particular with reference to:\n\n- access to potable water, the Windpeshi public water system was established, a sustainable system for promoting water access for rural communities around the region. The project will benefit 3 thousand Wayuu indigenous people and will allow them to obtain water, draw it and make it drinkable, store and distribute it, improving the population\u2019s quality of life. This project was financed by the \u2018obras por impuestos\u2019 mechanism and falls within the Colombian Ministry of Housing\u2019s \u2018Guajira azul\u2019 program. A second water system, Amalipa will benefit the communities in the area of influence of the transmission line. Lastly, to allow the use of water for other purposes, via the agreement signed between Enel Green Power, the Ministry of Housing, as part of the \u2018Guajira Azul\u2019 program, Foundation ACDI/VOCA, the Colombian army and the municipal administrations of Uriiba and Maicao, the construction and restoration of the wells are proceeding, which will facilitate access to water sources in the La Guajira Department.\n\n- access to education, an agreement was signed with SENA (National Training Service) for launching employment training and sustainable entrepreneurship processes in the communities affected by the projects, as well as non-qualified specialization in the project activities. During 2020, 65 people were trained on topics relating to construction. An agreement was also reached with the University of La Guajira for the drafting of an intercultural manual, which will represent an essential instrument for interaction in the various projects in the Wayuu territory, including the dynamics and specifics of the ethnic communities. Lastly, via an agreement with Artesan\u00edas de Colombia, traditional processing of Wayuu fabrics is being promoted in the area affected by the Windpeshi wind farm.\nThe ability to anticipate and adapt to change has become a crucial part of business. The global scenario of Covid-19 has forced companies to stop and think about their internal and external processes and about their way of innovating. In our capacity as sector leader, and keeping in mind our sustainability objectives, we have launched a global call to reinvent the manner in which our activities are managed in what will be the new normality.\n\nReShape is a global call for the energy transition, to conceive, along with problem solvers, start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises new ways to transform innovation into solutions for the world energy context of the future and for new global needs. The term chosen, ReShape, refers to the ability of the organization to change and reinvent itself constantly, both inside and outside, and reflects our global commitment to Open Innovability\u00ae.\n\nThe challenges launched with our call cover all our Business Lines: from energy generation to the creation of new added value products and services, from robotics to artificial intelligence, from virtual reality to automation, from construction of renewable plants up to technologies and algorithms to understand better the needs of customers and thus rationalize the entire customer journey in the digital era. Some examples:\n\n- Applying automation to renewable plant construction\n- Ensuring rapid sanitization in field operations and external spaces\n- Providing remote site visits for Enel X\u2019s industrial & residential customers\n- Fostering Enel customers\u2019 digital experience\n- Improving Enel\u2019s end-user profiling\n- Digitalizing scalable recovery plans for local markets\n- Developing connectivity & digitalization to overcome social inequality\n- Increasing automation of O&M in renewable power plants\n- Increasing employees\u2019 safety and ensuring correct distancing and traceability\nTechnologies and Innovability\u00ae\n\n\u201cSustainability is our goal and innovation is our tool to achieve it.\u201d We innovate in order to create the conditions to be more sustainable. These two concepts go hand in hand, and which merge in the word Innovability\u00ae, defined for the first time by us and which demonstrates the degree to which one deeply permeates the other.\n\nAn \u201cOpen\u201d approach that promotes the richness of innovation by involving internal and external entities and that makes us ready to reassess several traditional business models with a view to creating new ones.\n\nWe want to innovate to safeguard the environment, but also to create conditions of equality and inclusion for those who otherwise would have fewer possibilities, including from a work-related perspective. A practical example: in our Company we have a deaf person, who feared that he/she would not have the same opportunities for growth since he/she could not use video conference systems without lip reading. We therefore found a start-up with which we put together a service that has allowed all of our deaf people to take part actively in video conferences in a perfectly integrated way. The step from social to economic sustainability was, at the end of the day, brief: having facilitated the inclusion of people into the Company, we moved on to customers, which meant doing something socially useful, but which was also a business choice. It is enough to think how many millions of deaf or partially deaf customers can benefit from this service and how many can be made loyal to the Company, thus making us even more competitive and sustainable.\n\nWe identify the most innovative solutions to meet the main challenges of sustainable development as well as the 17 SDGs of the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations, both in line with and as a support for the Group\u2019s Strategic Plan. The Company further dedicates a part of innovation to exploration activities which can open significant new fronts of innovation in the near future. Currently, we are defining a three-year innovation plan, shared with top management and submitted for approval to the Group Innovation Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer. The holding Innovability\u00ae Function (Innovation and Sustainability), reporting directly to the CEO, in collaboration with the various Functions and Business Lines in all countries where the Group operates, manages innovation activities, in conformity with regulations currently in force and with our own compliance programs. Furthermore, dedicated facilities at Business Line level have been set up to facilitate the development and dissemination of innovative solutions.\n\nIn order to promote innovative solutions, we have created new instruments, such as openinnovability.com, a crowdsourcing platform for gathering the best solutions, the Innovation Academy and the Idea Factory to leverage the interaction and development of creativity and entrepreneurship within the Company. In addition, a global network of Innovation Hubs and Labs is present in order to make contact with start-ups and other stakeholders present in the innovation ecosystems around the world.\n\nThe Open Innovability\u00ae ecosystem\n\nThe way to win challenges and lead change is to search constantly for innovations that can promote sustainable development, start-ups, independent innovators, potential partner companies, universities and research centers, associations and ONGs.\n\nWe are open to innovative ideas in a very dynamic way: stimuli and influences can arrive from outside and inside the Company. It is important that there are the right ecosystems in which information can circulate and give life to sustainable and scalable business projects and models.\n\nOur platform for gathering innovative solutions: openinnovability.com\n\nOur crowdsourcing platform, openinnovability.com, has hosted over 145 challenges in total, reached 500,000 solvers, gathered thousands of solutions originating in over 100 countries worldwide, assigned economic awards and entered into collaboration agreements with Italian and international companies, start-ups, researchers and single individuals. Specifically, in 2020 53 innovation and sustainability challenges were launched, of which 15 cross-posted on partner platforms, 28 dedicated exclusively to people within the Company and 10 targeted externally. Seventeen challenges concerning the health emergency linked to the Covid-19 pandemic were also launched. In particular, while the world has begun to define a new normality, we have launched the global challenge ReShape, with the aim of identifying innovative solutions for the future of energy and to face emerging needs. Of the more than 300 innovative proposals received, around half are from ecosystems that are under the responsibility of the Innovation Hub (for more detailed information see page 145).\n\nThe challenges launched by Enel have also been disseminated on other platforms (for example, innovitalia.esteri.it of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation) and specialist channels (Focus.it, Wired.co.uk and Rinnovabili.it). At the same time, our crowdsourcing platform is open to the publication of challenges from external companies that are seeking innovative and sustainable solutions to unresolved problems. In 2020, 6 challenges for external companies such as the ESA (European Space Agency), Marzotto Venture Accelerator and Extreme-e were published and/or managed.\n\nWhy is it important for our stakeholders?\n\nWe must change in harmony with the world around us, with the people that live in it, with the society to which we contribute, and with the environment in which we live. Only in this way can we really create sustainable progress.\n\nWhy is it important for Enel?\n\nIn order to survive, living beings renew their cells continuously. A culture of widespread Innovability means that the whole Company aims to renew itself constantly, thereby ensuring its survival.\nTogether let us create a better future: our partnership agreements\n\nAs of today, 64 innovation partnership agreements with companies of different sizes and markets are active. Of these, 8 are of Group relevance with the involvement of various Business Lines in different thematic areas. During the last year, agreements have been renewed with Cisco Systems and Intesa Sanpaolo, the former focused on the development of products and services to support the achievement of IoT platforms and cyber security functionalities, and the latter with the aim of facilitating, on the one hand, access to credit for start-ups and small and medium-sized companies of the energy ecosystem and, on the other, the development of digital innovation. Collaborations related to the circular economy have also been developed, in particular with Novamont for the recycling of plastics and the use of biodegradable oils, and with the US multinational 3M for the use of new materials and sensor technology for the health and safety of our people, predictive maintenance, and efficiency of the distribution grids and generation plants. We are also pursuing collaboration in the sector of the space economy, cooperating with several market leaders among which Thales Alenia Space, a reference point for the realization of space technology and a partner for the achievement of innovative space services, especially satellite technology. Together with the ESA, we are further promoting the development of space sector applications to support the security of the distribution grid, economic and environmental sustainability and circular cities.\n\nThe network of ideas with start-ups, and not only: Our Innovation Hubs and Labs\n\nThe Innovation Hubs and Labs help the Group to consolidate the new collaboration model with start-ups and SMEs, which sees the latter propose innovative solutions and new business models, whereas we make available our expertise, facilities for testing, and a global network of partners to support their fine-tuning and scale-up. We rely on a global network of:\n\n- 10 Innovation Hubs (of which 3 are also Labs), located in the most significant innovation ecosystems for the Group: Catania, Pisa, Milan, Silicon Valley, Boston, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Moscow, Santiago de Chile, Tel Aviv, they handle relations with all players involved in innovation activities and constitute the main source of scouting for innovative start-ups and SMEs;\n- 22 Innovation Labs (of which 3 dedicated to start-ups), these allow start-ups to develop and test their own solutions together with our people from the various Business Lines. Milan, Pisa, Catania, S\u00e3o Paulo, Haifa and Be'er Sheva are among the most representative. For further details visit the site: https://startup.enel.com.\n\nDespite the pandemic, in 2020 we met more than 2,600 start-ups, launched more than 70 new collaborations and organized more than 40 bootcamps dedicated to different technological areas; furthermore, two new geographical Countries and Regions (Canada and Australia) were opened for the scouting of start-ups. Enel X and Mastercard won a tender from the Israeli government for the creation of an innovation laboratory which aims to stimulate the development of fintech and cyber security start-ups in Israel (FinSec Lab in Be'er Sheva). The Innovation Lab will be capable of simulating systems, processes and financial data to supply an environment in which the start-ups can develop, test and display their products.\n\nSome examples of innovative solutions\n\nImportant objectives were achieved during 2020 with regard to innovations which included generation and distribution of energy, aimed at accelerating sustainable growth towards the energy transition, through the study and adoption of innovative technologies and solutions for increasing sustainability and efficiency, as well as supporting safety on worksites and the operation and maintenance of assets. Through innovation we have demonstrated our resilience by remodelling approaches and processes, beginning with automation, remote control systems and technologies to support security, virtual visits, remote maintenance tools, solutions for and surveys of augmented and mixed realities, on worksites and in power plants, as well as artificial intelligence, and finishing with remote operations and experimental activities. The new approach adopted has involved not only us, but the entire network of partners, facilitating the remodeling of the innovation journey and supporting the entire ecosystem.\n\nPontevecchio: a big project in a small lake. In Tuscany, Enel Green Power is testing an innovative system for the management of the sediments that accumulate in the basin of an artificial lake. It is a project that could help the entire hydroelectric industry in as much as, besides reducing operating and maintenance costs, the solution is capable of restoring natural river transport, thereby contrasting phenomena of coastal erosion.\n\nInnovative solutions for detecting ice on the blades of wind turbines. An experimental campaign on an innovative system for automatically detecting the presence of ice on turbines, using optical fiber, has been successfully completed on a wind farm in Greece. The initial results show great potential for improving the safety of operators and reducing production losses.\n\nSolutions of artificial intelligence for a computerized vision to support wind turbine maintenance. The artificial intelligence solution has shown the efficiency on 45 wind turbines of solutions for recognizing images which facilitate the automatic detection of faults. The solution is completely integrated into our image acquisition approach and leads to a 60% reduction in inspection and data analysis times compared to the current method.\n\nSmart meters. We can be considered among the world leaders in smart meter technologies, also known as Open Meters, for which we are putting into effect our third generation, in which our cutting edge technologies enable functionalities that go beyond the traditional concept of simple measuring. It is a custom solution that exploits a dedicated channel of communication (Chain 2) through Power Line Communication, offering customers the chance to receive real-time data on energy consumption, but also to optimize grid operations (using predictive maintenance, load balancing and protection of revenues) in terms of quality and efficiency.\n\nRobotics. Four legs to be able to move over different types of terrain and environments, the ability to customize in order to carry various types of mission, two hours of autonomy and above all, the capacity to take on board and learn from the variety of activities that it carries out. We are talking about ANYmal, produced by ANYbotics, the Swiss start-up identified during a bootcamp organized by the Madrid Innovation Hub. It will be capable of carrying out missions both in autonomous mode and by giving added value to the people of Global Power Generation Enel, providing support and help. ANYmal combines the locomotion capacity of an animal\u2019s body with the use of algorithms of artificial intelligence, which allow it to analyze the surrounding environment - internal or external - and to take reasoned decisions.\n\nANYmal underwent successful experiments in Italy at the combined cycle thermal power plant in Porto Corsini (Pavenna). It is a significant innovation at the service of the human component: the robot can help our people to carry out autonomous inspections, generating added value and intervening in environments that are difficult to reach or potentially risky.\n\nElectric mobility: Enel X JuiceBox Pro and JuiceBox Pro Cellular. This is the latest line of domestic charging stations, which unites sustainability and innovation and presents a case realized in recycled plastic and a design which aims at reuse and recycling. In 2021, in Europe alone, 30,000 new Boxes will be produced, using 62 tons of waste plastic. The results in terms of performance are comparable to those obtained using virgin plastic (see also the chapter \u201cCircular economy\u201d).\n\nIn May 2020, the World Economic Forum recognized our Network Digital Twin\u00ae as an extraordinary innovation born within the energy sector to enhance systemic efficiency. This program is a digital platform that creates a virtual replica of the infrastructure of physical power supply, of its components and of system dynamics. It is based on the use of new technologies such as 3D modeling for the examination of grid components, sensors for monitoring the infrastructure together with artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality, with a view to improving operations in the field and management of data in real time. These combined applications support the functioning of the system, grid design, integration of distributed energy resources and management of the workforce.\n\nFurther innovative solutions are dealt with in the various chapters of the present document.\n\nMaking innovation on cutting edge technologies: the Innovation Communities\n\nWe have created the Innovation Communities, open communities, without hierarchies, made up of our people who are passionate about technology (and not only), who desire to share ideas and projects and to participate firsthand in the innovation process. They are groups of people open to other views and to the exchange of experiences, ready to accept new ideas and opportunities, and who share a basic project: to make the world a better place using sustainable innovations. The communities are dedicated to a crucial innovation topic, from artificial intel-\nligence to robotics, from drones to the Blockchain, and are a point of reference for different technologies.\n\nBlockchain: the Blockchain exploits the characteristics of an information network of nodes to manage data and information securely in a shared manner without the need for a central control and assessment body. We have sought and promoted collaboration with different players because the success of any project in this sector depends on the ability of participants to activate a network effect from which everyone can benefit. The Group has worked on various use cases (for example, the traceability of assets, trading, the management of energy poverty, and so on). The Community works on verifying the value of the new proposals, evaluating projects and diffusing their use, and, in particular, in 2020 it contributed to producing the consultation document for the national strategy published by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development.\n\nDrones: since 2012 we have made ample use of this technology in all countries, in generation plants, and in Business Lines linked to electricity distribution, and we have become an important stakeholder in the sector. The objectives of drone use are multiple: increase the efficiency and efficacy of operations and maintenance processes, but above all reduce exposure to risk for workers involved in interventions on our plants. The main uses concern, therefore, thermal imaging and the inspection of geothermal, hydro, solar and wind plants, the detection of abnormalities, 3D modeling, photogrammetry and laser scanning. Several new devices are in test phase, such as drones capable of transporting heavy loads or hydrogen powered drones capable of covering long distances. We can currently count on over 200 drones and 450 pilots worldwide. For many years in Italy we have been doing tests and gathering evidence in collaboration with regulation bodies such as ENAC (Ente Nazionale per l\u2019Aviazione Civile - Italian Civil Aviation Authority) and ENEA (Ente Nazionale di Assistenza al Volo - National Agency for Flight Assistance). In 2020, the Community dedicated to drones also promoted in-house training activities, for example regarding European regulations in this area.\n\nEnergy storage: accumulation systems open new frontiers in the field of sustainability. Thanks to these systems it is possible to improve the level of reliability and to increase distribution quality indicators. In combination with the traditional generation methods, storage also ensures balancing of the grid and stability of system loads at national level. Beyond traditional lithium batteries, the Group is seeking new accumulation systems, such as solid state batteries, vanadium flow batteries, gravity batteries and other alternative technologies for long-term storage applications.\n\nAugmented and virtual reality: this Community aims to seek out sector products and platforms in order to follow their technological evolution and redefine use cases for the Company. At the moment, tests are under way to evaluate the effective application of specific tools of augmented reality and their integration into personal protective equipment. Into the main use cases fall remote assistance and inspections, digital twins for plants and grids, hands-free operations and the resolution of problems. In 2020 a shared database was created to gather all available virtual scenarios to be utilized for the training of people.\n\nWearables: the main applications of wearables concern safety. These include sensors to check correct use of personal protective equipment, tools to track personnel on job sites and avoid interference, or devices to help people carry out their work in hands-free mode, without having to interact with potential sources of distraction such as smartphones or printed manuals. Wearable devices embrace a very vast range of products, among which smart glass and smart watches, as well as localization devices.\n\nRobotics: this technology offers the possibility of supporting people in high risk and remote places or who do demanding or repetitive work. The main applications concern the construction and automated maintenance of photovoltaic fields or other inspection and maintenance activities in areas that can contain risks for personnel. We are testing legged robots for specific and autonomous inspections. Remotely Operated Vehicles for underwater inspections of cables and Operation & Maintenance of hydroelectric reservoirs, photovoltaic plants and wind turbines. The new frontiers in the use of robotics include autonomous construction with diverse possible applications in the generation field.\n\nArtificial intelligence: AI and machine learning: currently AI and automatic learning are broadly used for the automation of processes and of physical device operations, from sensors to drones, on up to robots. Our Business Lines make ample use of such technologies applied to analysis of images concerning O&M Functions. The Group can benefit from an ecosystem of artificial intelligence, a unique place where each user can access services developed internally and a data school for the development of in-house know how.\n\nAdditive manufacturing/3D printing: this is a computerized production process used to create a product beginning from a digital model, and is considered the technology of the future for generating, improving and repairing a product, above all because it facilitates the reduction of production or repair times, thus ensuring greater reliability in particular, this process concerns the fabrication of mechanical components for the repairing of important elements subject to wear and tear (turbine blades, burner parts) and for redesigning and creating innovative components with complex geometries and special materials. As of today, the biggest challenge that this technology must overcome concerns above all the definition of a quality system for finished products. This means defining modalities of production and precise parameters based above all on the behavior of the materials, which inevitably changes compared to traditional technologies of production.\n\nGlobal Power Generation RoBoost Program\n\nAn innovative flagship program, launched in 2018 to promote the diffusion of robotized ready-to-market technologies for O&M activities along the entire value chain to facilitate the allocation of people to value added activities, with economic savings included.\n\nThe main technologies that are the subject matter of the program, active in 14 countries, are thermographies with drones and AI, wind turbine inspections with drones and AI, robotized bathymetries, underwater inspections with ROVs, remote assistance on smartphones, smart glass and augmented reality, inspections with drones on thermal, hydro and geothermal plants. The main results in 2020 are as follows:\n\n- a global robotization of about 82% of robotizable activities in 2020. The index shows an increase of 9% compared to 2019, following the growth of the perimeter of the plants considered and thanks to the new use cases in the RoBoost catalogue (products developed/new entries from the market);\n- robotized activities amount to 6,339, equivalent to 40% of generation plants (cumulative figure 2019-2020);\n- about 14 million solar panels were inspected with drones and AI amounting to about 4.5 GW and 12 Gwh of production recovered;\n- about 1,000 inspections overall on thermal, hydro and geothermal plants;\n- over 12,000 added value activities following the program, of which over 80% involving solar technology. A result of this sort means greater training activities, more safety, more expertise and getting the best out of our people.\n\nAt the end of 2021 a rate of robotization of 60% is envisaged, with a growth of robotizable activities of 149%.\n\n(1) All activities in which an allocation of our people or those of suppliers and stakeholders is recognized on greater value activities compared to those executed in the traditional manner because they are safer, are exposed to lower risks, have more training, are allocated to more digital and less physical objectives, and so on.\n\n(2) Index of robotization = robotized activities/robotizable activities. Robotizable activities are all those activities eligible for application of robotization for example, manual thermography, where it is now possible to carry out inspections with drones, or bathymetry done by people maneuvering a traditional boat, that is now possible to do with a robotized boat. Robotizable activities have been calculated via a mapping of all cases in which ready-to-market robotized products are present and multiplied by annual frequency. Robotized activities are all those robotized for each use case for a total of 6,339.\n\n(3) 2019: 1,873 robotized activities out of 4,324 robotizable activities. 2020: 6,339 robotized activities out of 12,203 robotizable activities.\n\nCreating value in the future: intellectual property\n\nOur intellectual heritage is a complex of critical information and is at the base of a sustainable growth. The ecosystem of Open Innovation\u00ae generates innovation through the sharing of internal and external solutions that give life to a flow of ideas that demands suitable forms of protection. On the one hand, intellectual property presides over and regulates the sharing of ideas, technologies and knowledge which originate both in the Company and in start-ups, universities, with suppliers, programers and consultants; and, on the other, in so far as it is the authentic expression of the link between knowledge, innovation and progress, it is a tool at the service of strategic objectives of decarboni-\nThe Group\u2019s main patents and designs\n\nIn the framework of the Global Infrastructure & Networks Business Line, our patent heritage contributes in a significant manner to the strategy of creating platforms and the exploitation of network externalities in the services market, as well as automation of the management of utilities, with a reduction of related CO\u2082 emissions and operating costs. In particular, two patent families are most significant: that of the method for remote detection of electricity, water and gas consumption, and that of the system for the remote reading and control of electricity consumption. Within the Enel X Business Line, particularly significant are the designs present in the gaseous phase in the fumes from combustion fumes of thermal power plants before their emission into the atmosphere; (ii) the patent for the device for measuring the analytical concentration of elements present in the gaseous phase in the fumes from coal-fired thermal power plants; (iii) the patent for the microinjection system and dosage of oxygen for waters discharged from hydroelectric plants which, by facilitating the increase in the level of oxygen, avoids the ecological impact associated with this absence.\n\n- digitalization of operating processes: in this regard, the method for automatic evaluation of the efficiency of a Kaplan type hydraulic turbine is representative, as it optimizes output in all operating conditions.\n\nInnovation begins with you: a new culture\n\nWe want innovation to be the daily work of everyone, to promote and diffuse the culture, the knowledge and the behaviors of Open Innovation, disseminate methodologies for leveraging innovation and promote the entrepreneurial spirit. Eight Idea Hubs are present in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Italy, Romania, Spain and Peru, which design and manage local and programs and supply the tools to facilitate the adoption of innovative instruments, thereby favoring creativity. These Hubs promote an approach that allows people to think and act differently, in a non-linear way, as well as encouraging experimentation and supporting the Company in overcoming challenges (new problems or opportunities) using innovative methods.\n\nThe main programs\n\n- Enel Idea Factory is a service on demand, launched in 2014, that allows the activation of facilitators capable of guiding a process that seeks solutions to company challenges, breaking paradigms, leveraging lateral thinking, stimulating co-creation and tearing down organizational silos. In 2020 over 250 design solution sessions were held globally involving over 2,160 participants (of which 112 external), generating more than 950 ideas and giving rise to different company initiatives.\n\n- Innovation Academy: a training journey, launched in 2017 with the aim of training our people up to creativity, to the development of ideas, to collaboration and to customer centricity and to educate future facilitators of the Enel Idea Factory. The following courses are part of Innovation Academy training: Emotional Intelligence, Creative Problem Solving, Design Thinking, Lean Start-ups. The Academy promotes a \u2018Train the Trainer\u2019 approach. Therefore a significant part of the courses are given by in-house teachers whereas other key players have been people from the Idea Hub as well as Innovation Ambassadors.\n\n- Innovation Ambassadors: The project was launched as a pilot in 2018, and over the years has become a tool for in-house innovation known and used mostly by Company areas. During 2020 the project was extended to three new Countries: Peru, Spain and Argentina, seeing the participation of over 200 people the world over. The Innovation Ambassadors support the mission to \u201cmake sure that innovation becomes part of the daily work of everyone in Enel\u201d, covering different roles: they are facilitators of workshops that stimulate lateral thinking, the co-creation of innovative solutions and customer centricity; in-house teachers of Innovation Academy courses; mentors on innovative projects in the development and realization phase and, finally, promoters of events targeted at introducing and encouraging innovation. This Community, based on the voluntary collaboration of participants, further promotes interfunctional collaboration and proactiveness at all levels.\n\n- MAKE IT HAPPEN: This program of Company entrepreneurship aims to make our entrepreneurs emerge by giving them the opportunity to propose and develop new ideas capable of creating value for the Company. In 2020, we received 91 project proposals, which saw the involvement of over 250 people from 11 countries. Three events for the presentation of ideas and projects were held (Pitch Day, during which 7 projects were introduced, 6 of which moved to development phase).\n### Priorities\n\n- Economic and financial value creation\n- Innovation and digital transformation\n- Growth accelerators\n\n### Plan\n\n- SDG\n\n### Target\n\n#### Activities\n\n| Activities | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Coverage of web applications posted on the internet with advanced cyber security application solutions | 100% | 100% | ACHIEVED | | | |\n| Disseminating the IT security culture and changing people\u2019s behaviour in order to reduce risks | 15 cyber security knowledge-sharing events held each year | 16 events delivered | ON-PLAN | 15 cyber security knowledge-sharing events held each year | | |\n| Information security verification activities (Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Assessment, etc.) | 500 verification activities per year | 1,139 verification activities carried out | ON-PLAN | 800 verification activities per year | | |\n| Execution of cyber exercises involving plants/industrial sites | | | | 36 cyber exercises | | |\n\n#### Activities\n\n| Activities | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Activities to reduce CO\u2082 emissions | -10 mil printed pages | -48 mil printed pages compared to 2018 | ON-PLAN | -13 mil printed pages in 2023 (vs. 2016) | | |\n| Extension of the use of video communication systems | Intensive use of the \u201cUnified Communications and Collaboration\u201d (UCC) platform with the integration of video communication services; 6 mil meetings held via video communication services | ON-PLAN | Extension of the use of video communication systems | | |\n| Reduction of CO\u2082 produced for optimization of PCs, laptops and monitors in Italy | Enhancement of mobile accessibility with a further reduction in idle hours; 18 mil hours of downtime | ON-PLAN | Activities to reduce PC, laptop and monitor downtime | | |\n\n---\n\n(1) This refers to training services, carried out by a mixture of cyber and business personnel, which is mandatory and necessary to educate internal stakeholders on the correct use of the Enel CERT in terms of engagement, communication, communication confidentiality and cyber incident response services (detection, analysis, response, recovery).\n\n(2) Cumulative value for the three-year reference period.\n\n(3) The 2020 result has been significantly impacted tied to the pandemic. The target has therefore been redefined from 2019, being a year not affected by this situation.\n\n(4) The use of this platform has encouraged a wider use of laptops and devices offering better energy performance.\nDIGITAL SUPPORTS AND CYBER SECURITY\n\nTechnology has embarked on a journey that doesn\u2019t seem to stop, especially during the period of the pandemic, characterized by bywords and concepts such as cyber security, smart working, data driven, and platformization. Enel faced 2020 with marked resilience which, rather than resulting from contingent challenges, is the consequence of a path already taken several years ago firstly with the decision to adopt a cloud computing approach, ultimately allowing us to overcome this disruption thanks to our ability to rely on a modern and flexible structure. The Group is committed to protecting its critical infrastructure, disseminating the cyber security culture, virtualizing asset management operating activities, and promoting the use of video communication systems.\n\nThe digital transformation\n\nThe radical and high-speed energy transition process requires utility companies to evolve and become the coordinators of a complex system with multiple actors/owners and different technologies and locations. We will need to take conventional asset-intensive business models, which are typically linear in nature, and add also circular platform type models. In this context, digital technology will play a key role because the platform will enable management of this growing level of complexity overseeing a sustainable energy transition within a constantly evolving normative context. Scalability and efficiency will be guaranteed by models of reuse and plug&play techniques enabled by digital technology which, in turn, will bring down marginal costs. Thanks to digital technology, customers \u2013 simultaneously consumers and generators of energy \u2013 will play an increasingly active role in the ecosystem, acquiring innovative and sustainable energy solutions and services and gaining access to a pool of shared resources.\n\nSince 2015 we have been focusing on simplifying application maps, developing global technologies that can be used horizontally across the entire value chain, shifting from hundreds of technologies to just a handful. Enel has decided to pick up on this value creation opportunity by setting up two complementary business models: the traditional \u201cOwnership business model\u201d, in which the platforms form a powerful business accelerator catalyzing the investments of third party suppliers of services and products. Effectively, Enel is accelerating the launch of digital solutions for platforms throughout the entire organization:\n\n- in electricity generation, our digital platforms support the extension of the portfolio of power plants for the development of the business, engineering and construction, operation, and maintenance, also including resources managed through joint ventures and partnerships;\n- in Infrastructure and Networks we are adopting a new operating model to standardize operations and maintenance, management of customers and resource allocation processes by means of a global IT platform. This model will also allow rapid integration of new distribution networks into our ecosystem;\n- in retail sales we are focusing on company-wide IT solutions in order to standardize customer operations both for products and for new value added services. We are also expanding the Enel X platform business model, creating innovative products and services for the B2C, B2B, and B2G segments and distributing them on the global level.\n\nThe process of integrating digital technologies in services, infrastructures, and in all aspects of the business has resulted in substantial changes in terms of culture, processes, and value creation, following the development of new sustainable business models. Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, cyber security, Big Data, and cloud computing are among the core elements in which Enel is investing.\n\nIn Enel, the digital transformation process is guided by the Global Digital Solutions unit which, working together with all the Holding\u2019s Business Lines and Functions, guides strategic choices, defines development paths, and guarantees their implementation. The operating models call for an agile working approach to anticipate market demand, with constant attention paid to satisfying internal and external customers, to guarantee innovation and flexibility, and the Company\u2019s rapid adaptation and reaction to change.\nFour key platforms that make routine activities more sustainable\n\nCloud computing\nFor Enel, cloud infrastructure is a fundamental strategic enabler that has allowed the use of IT resources in terms of infrastructure and applications whenever required, since fully exploiting the access possibilities provided by the network makes it possible to reduce waste deriving from consumption linked to unused resources. The cloud used by Enel requires approximately 16% less energy on average than conventional on-premise infrastructure, allowing an average reduction of CO\u2082 emissions of around 88%.\n\nUnified Communications and Collaboration\nThe Unified Communications and Collaboration (UCC) Platform integrates communication services in real time such as instant messaging (chats), IP telephony, and video communication with different media, such as voicemail, email, text messaging and fax, fully exploiting the sharing model that uses the Internet to allow sharing and use of contents from a PC, smartphone or tablet. This reduces the need for travel and hence CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nData sharing and e-API\nThe e-API digital ecosystem (Enel Application Programming Interface) is the digital environment through which all companies in the Enel Group can quickly and automatically share information that would normally be limited to specific vertical applications (information silos). The ecosystem is supported by an API, thanks to which the Company\u2019s systems can exchange information flows in real time by means of interfaces and data tracks, making use of the latest developments in interoperability standards. This ecosystem has helped to speed up the adoption of digital solutions, facilitate the effective reuse and exchange of information, reduce data redundancies in Enel and, more generally, reduce the time and resources used in the exchange of information flows.\n\nEnel beyond the cloud: more than one thousand sites connected with one of the biggest network virtualization projects in the world\n\nThe initiative forms part of Enel\u2019s broader strategic BCC program (Beyond Cloud Computing), in which software-defined WAN technology able to optimize cloud-based access to applications and the use of connectivity and edge computing solutions are merged to create a telecommunications architecture that helps to pursue operational excellence through intensive digitalization of processes.\n\nIn one of the world\u2019s largest business telecommunications network virtualization initiatives, this project has speeded up the Group\u2019s process of digital transformation. Created and developed in Italy by Enel with Accenture, Cisco and Sirti, the program has led to a reduction in operating costs while significantly increasing agility of corporate infrastructure, connecting more than 1,000 sites in 3 continents and more than 10 countries (Italy, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Russia, and several sites in North America).\n\nEnel has therefore greatly reduced its go-to-market times, optimizing management costs through rationalization of systems, and also reduced operating costs, making it possible, for example, to handle maintenance operations remotely. In addition, Enel can upgrade its network with innovative technologies such as the IoT and augmented/virtual reality in order to facilitate control, management and maintenance of its geographically distributed assets. The new infrastructure\u2019s capabilities and agility played a key role in overcoming disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, when Enel was very quick to implement smart working for more than 37 thousand people, allowing them to access the Company\u2019s applications and work in safety.\nMachine learning and predictive maintenance\n\nMachine learning technologies have been adopted by Enel to conduct predictive analysis in relation to the maintenance of electricity distribution networks and generation plants, identifying possible errors in advance and acting before faults occur on the main components. Reducing the risk of malfunctions has a significant impact not only in economic terms, but also in relation to the environment and personal safety. This has led to improvements in the service quality provided making it more sustainable over time, while also optimizing the use of internal resources, boosting occupational safety levels, and allowing focused inspections, especially of the most fault-susceptible equipment.\n\nDecarbonization contribution of shared IT services for Enel people\n\nA path of transformation cannot be pursued without placing people at the center of the process and meeting their needs. For the people working in Enel, digitalization is a new way of thinking of corporate processes, starting from the experience gained within the Company, following an integrated services logic and exploiting the new opportunities offered by digital technology to the full. Also, the IT equipment life cycle is managed with the aim of extending the useful life of each device as long as possible through initiatives such as selling decommissioned equipment to Enel people and promoting reuse and recycling when the equipment reaches the end of its life cycle.\n\nBy means of the \u201cUnified Communications & Collaboration\u201d platform, Enel strengthened, integrated and extended its digital services and tools during the Covid-19 pandemic. These actions led to a spread in the use of video communication solutions, helping to maximize savings on travel and out of office missions while also reducing CO2 emissions.\n\nIn 2020, monitoring continued of electricity consumption outside normal working hours (1) linked to the IT workstations (desktop computers, laptops, monitors) of Enel people working in Italy. This measurement is possible because the IT workstations are equipped with a Microsoft function (2) that reveals times when a workstation is switched on but unused. Following the analysis, specific awareness raising initiatives were defined, aimed at reducing electricity consumption. This led to a reduction in hours of disuse and the new IT tools supplied to Enel people during the Covid-19 pandemic led to a reduction in emissions.\n\nThe printing service, which is operational in all Enel sites, takes advantage of the latest generation of printers specifically designed for more eco sustainable use and is developed around an evolved business model that has made it possible to transition from a product concept to a service concept. Thanks to the service characteristics, combined with a more rational use of printouts, and to digitalization, we have been able to reduce paper consumption over the years, thus lowering our environmental impact. Specifically, starting from the number of pages printed and the technical specifications of the various printer models, the quantity of CO2 associated with consumption by printers when printing is calculated, applying each Country\u2019s emissions factor (source: Enelitalia resulting from the specific local mix of energy sources (3).\n\n(1) Enerdata release of April 15, 2020. Considers data in the following countries: Italy, Spain, Russia, Romania, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia.\n\n(2) Monday-Friday (from 7 pm to 7 am); Saturday and Sunday. The monitoring excluded servers and PCs that must be constantly on by nature (e.g. GESI application, Enel Points, Energy Exchange, etc.). Specifically, the indicator represents the amount of CO2 associated with the electricity consumption of desktop computers, laptops and monitors, calculated after application of the average CO2 emission value per unit of electricity generated (gCO2/kWh) in relation to the mix of sources present in Italy.\n\n(3) System Center Configuration Manager.\nValue for Disability: technical assistance key 0\n\nInclusion is a daily challenge, especially in an increasingly digitalized world. Several months ago, a dedicated telephone help desk was placed at the disposal of colleagues with disabilities, including temporary disabilities, who use assistive technologies and software, offering assistance with their technical and practical needs. Assistance service key 0 is available for all requirements of our people. Prescribing this key provides access to a specialist service dedicated to managing difficulties with the assistive technologies and software employed. The service is manned by a team with specialized skills in compliance with international guidelines and standards.\n\nCyber security\n\nThe speed of technological development always brings new challenges: and the frequency and intensity of cyber-attacks are on the rise, as is the tendency to focus on critical infrastructure and strategic industrial sectors, highlighting a potential risk of interruption of normal business activities, in extreme cases. Technological transformation would be unthinkable without paying careful attention to cyber security issues.\n\nTypical cyber-attack types have changed radically in recent years: the number has grown exponentially, as has their level of sophistication and impact, with timely identification of sources becoming increasingly difficult. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a further increase in cyber-attacks all over the world. This background obliges companies to implement preventive measures to protect their assets, improving and strengthening their cyber security protocols.\n\nApart from the constant adoption and application of the cyber security strategy, Enel has taken special measures, including temporary disabilities, who use assistive technologies and software, offering assistance with their technical and practical needs. Assistance service key 0 is available for all requirements of our people. Prescribing this key provides access to a specialist service dedicated to managing difficulties with the assistive technologies and software employed. The service is manned by a team with specialized skills in compliance with international guidelines and standards.\n\nPolicies and management models\n\nSince September 2016 the Cyber Security unit has been operating within Global Digital Solutions, reporting directly to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) who works under the Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The unit is responsible for guaranteeing the governance, coordination and control of cyber security issues, definition of strategy, policies, and guidelines in accordance with national and international standards, providing engineering support to protect the Group\u2019s areas of operation, and monitoring the risk posture by performing checks based on processes and technology. The unit works synergically with the Business Lines and with the technical units responsible for systems design and management, thanks to the Cyber Security Risk Managers and Cyber Security Response Managers. CISO and the Cyber Security Risk Managers also constitute the Cyber Security Operating Committee, the aims of which are to evaluate the cyber risk across the business in order to define the risk acceptance criteria based on the Group risk posture, and to standardize the entire process. The Cyber Security Committee, chaired by Enel\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and composed of his main front line, approves the cyber security strategy and periodically checks its progress. Each Group area department participates actively in implementing the cyber security strategy by means of an integrated operating plan aligned with the Group\u2019s objectives.\n\nCyber security strategy and initiatives are recurring topics subject to the oversight of the Group\u2019s principal executive and control bodies (e.g. Board of Directors, Control and Risks Committee, Supervisory Bodies, etc.). In 2017 the Company also set up a specific \u201cCyber Security Framework\u201d policy, which orientates principles and operating processes for a global risk analysis, prevention and management strategy.\n\nThe framework is based on a \u201csystemic\u201d vision that integrates the sector of conventional Information Technological (IT), with that of Operational Technology (OT), linked to the world of industry, and with the Internet of Things (IoT). In defining this framework, the new Cyber Security Risk Management methodology was established in 2017, the methodology is applicable to all IT, OT and IoT environments and it describes all the phases required to carry out a risk analysis and define the related mitigation plan, in line with the stated cyber security goals. Enel has also created a \u201cCyber Emergency Readiness Team\u201d (CERT) for proactive management and response to cyber incidents while collaborating and exchanging information within a network of accredited international partners. Since 2019, a new agreement has been established with USA national CERT, this affiliation brings the number of certifications at 9: Romania, Italy, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Spain, and the US.\n\nEnel CERT is also an accredited member of Trusted Introducer, which includes more than 380 CERTs in more than 60 countries. In September 2018 Enel also joined FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which is the largest and most widespread community in the sector, with over 510 members in more than 90 countries.\n\nDefinition of the IT security strategy\n\nThe cyber security strategy defines objectives and priorities, in order to address and coordinate initiatives and investment activities for the Enel Group considered globally, and to guarantee compliance with cyber security policies, targets definition, managerial reporting, and continuous monitoring of security initiatives in progress. This process is guided by CISO and it uses close integration and synergy with the various business areas, which communicate their needs, share training, analyze opportunities, manage any criticalities, and make proposals for initiatives. Specifically, strategy definition is an iterative activity based on sharing and standardization of the Group\u2019s risk posture target. The various actors involved analyze the options and potential initiatives within their respective business areas in order to assess the feasibility, guarantee consensus, and the necessary funds. The Cyber Security unit guides the process and, together with the other actors involved, gradually consolidates aspects such as future scenario, objectives, and possible strategic initiatives in a cyber security strategy proposal document, with a high-level budget estimate and definition of priorities.\n\nThe cyber security topic is also on the agenda of management meetings (such as business reviews, operational review meetings) and meetings of the control committees (such as the Control and Risks Committee).\nCyber security incident management\n\nThe multiplicity and complexity of the areas in which Enel operates (data, industry, and people) and of the technological components (e.g. business critical systems such as SCADA - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, smart grids and smart meters), which are increasingly integrated in the Group\u2019s digital life, have made it necessary to configure a structured cyber security system. This leads to the need for a new cyber defense model based on a systemic vision that integrates the IT sector (starting from the cloud down to the data center and mobile phone), the OT (everything concerning industrial sector, such as generation plant remote control and the IoT - Internet of Things, the extension of communication and intelligence to the world of things).\n\nThrough the risk monitoring systems CERT collects more than 2 billion events daily from more than 3,700 sources of data concerning corporate assets, correlates them by exploiting automatic analysis techniques, and produces around one hundred \u201cincidents\u201d. The incidents are classified according to the Enel Cyber Impact Matrix on a scale of 0 to 4, making use of the best events correlation capabilities emerging from the adoption of highly advanced services.\n\nThe vast majority of \u201cincidents\u201d are classified at level 0/1; they have no significant impact on Group systems and are automatically or semi-automatically blocked and/or managed by the existing company defenses, preventing and/or mitigating the impact of potential cyber attacks.\n\nIncidents classified at levels 2/3/4 have a potential impact on the Group and are managed by CERT analysts, involving any affected stakeholders. Thanks to the protection services, CERT intercepts 1.7 million at-risk emails, 325 viruses, 154 web portal attacks, and 474 thousand connections to harmful websites every day.\n\nIf a cyber security incident involves a possible data breach, the appropriate and necessary actions are taken immediately, in line with the specific Group policy on \u201cPersonal Data Breach Management\u201d. If a crisis situation should arise that threatens the company\u2019s business continuity and/or the assets, reputation, and/or profitability of the Enel Group, the appropriate actions are taken immediately, in line with the specific Group policy on \u201cCritical events management\u201d.\n\nIn 2020 Enel CERT responded to 140 cyber security incidents with impact level 2; around 40 incidents with impact level 3; 3 incidents with the highest impact level of 4.\n\nThe 3 level 4 incidents are illustrated below.\n\n- **June 7, 2020.** On June 7, 2020 Enel experienced the first level \u201c4\u201d incident. This event shows that, despite an insidious and potentially very damaging attack, the speed and effectiveness of Enel\u2019s response ensured that the impacts on business processes were irrelevant. In fact, no critical issues concerning the remote control systems of distribution infrastructure and power plants were registered, customer data were not exposed to third parties and all internal IT services were rapidly and efficiently restored, allowing all business activities to run smoothly.\n\n- **October 19, 2020.** On October 19, Enel experienced a second level \u201c4\u201d incident. Also in this case, the incident was properly managed; no impacts on OT infrastructures; few IT services were affected, promptly and efficiently restored without impacts on business continuity. The attacker declared a breach of some company data that have been published on internet sharing provider for few minutes (published data have been promptly deleted thanks to Enel Group monitoring activities and communications occurred with relevant Authorities). For this reason, also preliminary notifications to competent Data Protection authorities were done together with a specific communication to interested data subjects.\n\n- **November 2020.** On November 2020, the third incident of \u201c4\u201d level was opened by CERT. After first analysis emerged that the event was not related to any Cyber Security attack.\n\nIn all cases detected, all the procedures defined for incidents and critical events management were activated in order to allow an efficient and quick response, so to minimize impacts on people, services and assets. Particularly, when a cyber security incident result in a potential data breach, the necessary actions are immediately undertaken, in line with Enel Group policy \u201cPersonal Data Breach Management\u201d.\n\nIn 2019 migration of applications to the IaaS cloud was achieved for the entire scope of Enel applications; this implies that all Enel web portals leverage on enhanced cyber security solutions too. For this reason, the number of \u201cinternet web applications protected by advanced cyber security solutions\u201d, considered in percentage terms, stands at 100%.\n\nIn March 2020 we also published the \u201cIT Service Continuity Management Policy\u201d, in order to formalize an adequate process and reduce the risk affecting the availability of IT infrastructure to an acceptable level, support business continuity requirements, and guarantee restoration of IT services based on the results deriving from a Business Impact Analysis, in the event of the occurrence of a severe interruption.\n\nIn 2021, the number of viruses and connections to dangerous sites may change due to the adoption, at the end of 2020, of two new strategic business security technologies, a global detection and response system (EDR \u2013 Endpoint Detection & Response) and a new global solution to protect from outbound connections to harmful websites. In line with the approach already developed in 2019 in relation to the protection of web portals, these new tools provide upgraded functionalities and use innovative paradigms such as embedded analysis modules based on machine learning algorithms. Moreover, by using new functions supplied by reinforced security solutions, the Cyber Security unit can now link multiple attack evidences to the same malevolent activity.\n\nNo cases of nonconformity with cyber security standards and regulations were recorded in 2020.\nMain projects\n\nAll cyber security projects, programs, and initiatives are designed to avoid, mitigate or remediate IT security risks for the entire Enel Group. Consequently, all cyber security activities \u2013 managed with a risk-based approach following the security by design principle \u2013 give rise to a continuous due diligence process that also includes self-assurance activities.\n\nThe most important projects in this area include:\n\n- **CERT \u2013 Risk Monitoring extension**: In the final quarter of 2020 CERT started developing new functions that, by exploiting emerging technologies such as Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) and machine learning, will make it possible to automate and streamline incident management activities and make use of improved visibility of cyber threats, increasing efficiency in managing new threats and conducting the related investigations.\n\n- **Encryption end user device**: designed to protect corporate data in cases where they are stored on a user device that is subsequently lost or stolen.\n\n- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solution adoption**: which managed the creation of a platform to intercept breaches by means of a unified set of technologies supplied from the cloud to prevent all attack types, including malware and many other threats.\n\n- **Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)** which saw the development of a cloud solution used to impose the identification method for users during the authentication procedure. The adoption of MFA makes it possible to recognize a person accessing the system through three different methods: One Time Password (OTP) sent via telephone text message, OTP generated by the app installed on a smartphone, notification and approval request generated via the app. MFA enables compliance with a large number of standards and it is highly recommended to combat emerging threats of credentials theft also based on social engineering techniques (such as phishing, or user behavior not in compliance with the policy). The solution deployment phase started in April 2020. Complete adoption of the solution should occur within 2021.\n\nCollaborations with external bodies and agencies\n\nIn line with the Open Power vision, Enel has made its experience available to increase security of the ecosystem and has forged relations with the academic world and institutional actors to organize courses and round tables aimed at identifying talents with an interest in cyber security topics. 2020 was also accompanied by numerous collaborations with institutional partners and interventions at high-profile national and international conferences, pursued in order to maintain an active role in the industry international community, sharing the Enel cyber security model. In this context, Enel took part in the Confindustria Digitale team, which was formed to assist the development of the Italian digital ecosystem.\n\nEnel participates in World Economic Forum work groups and, in December 2020, contributed to the publication of the report entitled \u201cCyber Resilience in the Electricity Ecosystem: Securing the Value Chain\u201d, aimed at developing guidelines and proposals concerning the responsibility model in the context of the electricity industry value chain for the supply of products, design of solutions, and phases of commissioning and operation. In addition, participation in the \u201cWorld Economic Forum\u2019s Systems of Cyber Resilience: Electricity\u201d project led to the publication of the report entitled \u201cCyber Resilience in the Electricity Industry: Analysis and Recommendations on Regulatory Practices for the Public and Private Sectors\u201d in July 2020. The goal of this report was to provide recommendations for policy makers and companies to improve cyber resilience in the electricity industry.\n\nTraining and information\n\nThe Company pressed ahead with its commitment to disseminating the \u201ccyber security culture\u201d and in 2020 16 cyber security knowledge sharing events took place.\n\nAfter the first launch at the end of 2015, the Cyber Security Awareness Program has become a constant and ongoing initiative at Group level, responsible for disseminating the cyber security culture in order to raise awareness of threats and attacks that exploit the human vector.\n\nOne of the main factors that guided and further strengthened a large number of cyber security awareness and communication initiatives in 2020 was the emergency situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. During emergencies it is extremely important to raise people\u2019s attention levels to ensure they do not fall prey to attacks by hackers and fraudsters. On the other hand, exposure to cyber risks is now even greater, because tens of thousands of Enel people have been operating in smart working mode, using their home broadband network to access Enel\u2019s servers. This results in the need to focus attention on working methods and equipment protection in order to guarantee security of the Company and its assets and avoid compromising business continuity. In particular, bulletins and newsletters have been created and distributed via the corporate Intranet and a series of documents have been made available to spread up-to-date information on cyber security topics and initiatives.\n\nThe past year also saw the release of the \u201cRules of Behavior for Digital People\u201d policy, an articulated code of conduct addressed to all Enel people, to safeguard their digital identity, allow them to act safely in the world of social media and, when necessary, send notifications concerning potential incidents and request assistance.\n\nAnother development was the launch of the Open Tech Journey project, aimed at providing access to training courses focused on technological topics, promoting internal skills to spread awareness of strategic topics and to manage upskilling and reskilling requirements. This was the background to the creation of the Cyber School, which delivered eight \u201cfundamentals\u201d courses on the main cyber security topics. The first courses edition was delivered in a virtual classroom (four courses in 2020 and the remaining four in 2021). All the courses will be re-designed in 2021 in order to deliver them in e-learning mode.\n### Activities\n\n| Activities | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Development of Circular Community activities | Circular Community School: three editions held for about 180 student colleagues | Circular Community School: three editions held for about 180 student colleagues | ON-PLAN | Target outdated and merged into new objectives | E | 10 |\n| Promotion of the culture and best practices of a circular economy at Global Business Line, Global Procurement and Country level | Circular Economy School: three editions held for about 180 student colleagues | Circular Economy School: three editions held for about 180 student colleagues | ON-PLAN | Target outdated and merged into new objectives | E | 17 |\n| Definition and implementation of circular economy solutions in collaboration with the various business areas | Circular economy solutions developed at Global Business Line / Country level and in cross-cutting areas | Circular economy solutions developed at Global Business Line / Country level and in cross-cutting areas | ON-PLAN | Definition and application of circular economy solutions and new business models focused on key technologies | E | 12 |\n| Creation of an ecosystem dedicated to the topic of circular economy in the most relevant countries where the Company operates | Initiatives developed to drive the transition to circularity at national level (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Italy, Peru, Spain, United States) | Initiatives developed to drive the transition to circularity at national level (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Italy, Peru, Spain, United States) | ON-PLAN | Target outdated and merged into new objectives | E | 12 |\n\n### Goals\n\n- **Economic and financial value creation**\n- **Innovation and digital transformation**\n- **Growth accelerators**\n\n### Priorities\n\n- **Plan**\n- **SDG**\n\n### Target\n\n- **Circular Economy**\n- **Innovation and digital transformation**\n- **Growth accelerators**\n\n### Activities\n\n- **Definition and application of suitable industrial and financial circularity metrics to support and enhance circular economy activities, engaging the respective business areas**\n  - KPIs set to monitor CE initiatives: dashboard for CEO Business Review, KPIs for Market\n  - Collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation for the development of Circularities\n  - Start of data collection for Group financial/industrial KPIs\n  - Consolidation and adoption of potential other Business Line/ Country-specific KPIs in 2021\n  - Definition of the Group\u2019s financial/industrial objectives on the circular economy in 2022\n\n- **Strengthening of partnerships and collaborations**\n  - Members of Ellen MacArthur Foundation: Capital Equipment Coalition: Circular Electronics Partnership; Italian Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform: expert group on financing the circular economy; European Remanufacturing Council\n  - Extension of the circular economy alliance and participation in the WBCSD Built Environment Working Group\n  - Strengthening partnerships and collaborations with international networks, companies from other sectors, external players focused on the development of \u2018circular cities\u2019\n\n- **Improving circularity**\n  - 86% by 2030\n\n- **Development of internal skills, culture and know-how on the circular economy**\n  - Training activities, CE community development, internal communication and sharing of best practices\n\n- **Stepping up the sharing of best practices and knowledge on the circular economy with external stakeholders**\n  - Collaboration by drafting position papers, taking part in working groups, and through dissemination activities\n\n- **Engaging with start-ups**\n  - Engaging with startups to accelerate the transition to the circular economy\n\n---\n\n1. Key technologies such as wind power, photovoltaics, smart meters, electric vehicle charging stations, electric vehicle batteries, etc.\n2. For example, circular solutions have been implemented to solve social problems and advance the culture of the circular economy (circular Covid masks in Italy and Argentina)\n3. Lower material and fuel consumption of the Group\u2019s plants throughout their life cycle compared to 2015.\nCIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nThe growing penetration of renewable sources, together with greater use of the electric carrier by our customers, is capable of boosting opportunities deriving from the circular economy and represents the only path towards the decarbonization of the economy and the society in which we live at the speed we need, considering the critical environmental situation of the planet. According to recent studies, the circular economy can contribute up to almost half the global effort toward reaching the decarbonization objectives. The European Union has given a strong impulse toward regulating the circular economy and subsequently, also other governments, cities and territories on all continents have started to develop these issues. Enel actively participates in the discussion on every institutional level, from supranational to local, in order to support this transition both in terms of vision and content and in terms of design.\n\nWhy is it important for our stakeholders?\n\nWe have been operating for some time now with the aim of developing business and achieving results with the full involvement of our stakeholders. Our commitment to circularity is a further step in this direction.\n\nForward looking companies in all sectors have embraced this vision in the last years. Enel started down this path many years ago, and now the circular economy represents a true strategic driver in Enel\u2019s business as well as a growth accelerator along the entire value chain.\n\nRethinking the business model from a circular point of view is first of all a challenge not only in terms of technological innovation but also in terms of collaborating in an increasingly close manner with our own ecosystem.\n\nTo reduce the consumption of non-renewable materials and energies, we need to act on one hand on the resources used as input, switching from resources from non-renewable sources or recycled input, and on the other hand on models of reuse, sharing or product as a service (PaaS), regenerate or recycle.\n\nEnel\u2019s approach for the circular economy is extremely open and transversal, and recognizes that innovation plays a central role that is not limited to technical aspects, but concerns all dimensions of our business: technology, business models, contractual frameworks, collaborations along the internal and external value chain, regulatory and institutional context, etc.\n\nFor Enel, the circular economy:\n\n> is not just a topic of environmental management, but much more than this: it concerns redesigning the entire economic model and therefore transversal governance is needed with respect to economic and environmental areas, on every level (from institutional to corporate);\n> covers the entire value chain but places greater attention above all on the initial phases of designing the products and goods and defining the business models;\n> has to be supported by innovation and the financial and insurance sector to be able to reach its full potential;\n> requires constant updating of the legislative framework, which was established over decades in a context dominated by a linear approach;\n> requires transversal systematic collaboration between public and private along the value chain (suppliers-company-customers), cross-sector, etc., also through open governance tools;\n> must be supported by solid metrics that make it possible to appreciate its progress, as well as training in order to develop a new circular culture.\n\nThe circular economy makes it possible to switch from a model based on the consumption of environmental resources, with the increasing contribution of automation, to a model based on maintaining the value of products and goods, where human work can have an increasingly relevant role.\n\nThe main potential social impacts are:\nemployment, with the creation of new professional profiles in all sectors (not only related to the creation of specific sectors, but above all the redefinition of existing sectors from a circular point of view);\n\nsocial, with benefits deriving from new circular solutions in terms of access to products and services at a lower cost, thanks to solutions such as reusing, recycling, sharing, PaaS;\n\nprofessional, with new opportunities related to professional requalification, the sharing of skills, the creation of new, more transversal profiles, the recovery of more \u2018artisan\u2019 skills, etc.\n\nThe governance of the circular economy\n\nThe success of this transition also requires the definition of an effective governance. The circular economy is a transversal topic and is not associated with only one area, rather it is an approach to be adopted in all lines of business. For this reason, it is of fundamental importance for this approach to be coordinated regarding the strategy, context, skills and that it supports every staff and business area for its effective adoption.\n\nFor this purpose, specific areas have been created in Enel in various Business Lines and various Countries which are coordinated by a Holding area. In particular, whereas the Business Lines redesign or develop business models from a point of view of the circular economy, the units on a country level provide support locally to the development of business opportunities, with considerable collaboration with the local ecosystem.\n\nThe circular activities of the Business Lines and the main projects\n\nIn order to apply a circular approach in a systematic manner, Enel is working in a transversal and integrated manner in all of its business areas and involving suppliers and customers. This results in a structured and effective approach so they can redesign their own model.\n\nFor this purpose, the main areas of activity concern the following aspects.\n\nSuppliers\n\nThe Circular Procurement strategy that Enel is promoting is divided into the following steps:\n\n- involvement of the suppliers: insertion of specific K factors or requirements during the tender phase to reward the commitment of the suppliers in their transition toward the circular economy;\n- definition of metrics and measurement of environmental impacts of what is acquired by means of the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). Currently, on a global level, approximately 200 suppliers are involved in 12 product categories, which today represent more than 60% of the expense for purchasing materials; for the remaining categories, works and services, certification is being applied (Carbon Footprint, for example);\n- co-innovation: starting projects with suppliers in order to jointly redesign the life cycle of goods, also by modifying customer requirements.\n\nAssets\n\nThe circular approach is applied along all the main phases of the life of the assets (power plants, electrical grids, etc.) from the planning (design and input material selections), implementation (management of construction site phases) and operation (maintenance oriented toward extending their useful life) up to decommissioning (management of areas, equipment, materials and infrastructures in order to identify new life cycles through reuse, upcycling, remanufacturing, recycling, etc.).\n\nGlobal Trading\n\nVarious strategies are being defined for managing assets from a circular point of view, and taking the specific aspects of the various assets into account, also considering the secondary raw materials that can be recovered and identifying more efficient valorization methods, both within the Company and in other markets.\n\nSpare parts and equipment New Life\n\nThe application of sustainability and circular economy approaches to the decommissioning of coal-fired plants has generated environmental and economic benefits. The \u201cSpare parts and equipment New Life\u201d project, which was launched in February 2020, has precisely the objective of giving new life to the components in the warehouses and to the equipment of the coal-fired power plants being decommissioned and to obsolete material from all the other thermal power plants.\n\nThis has been made possible by the identified and defined target options, i.e. five business models based on the principles of the circular economy: reuse, resale, donation, recycle and, if applicable, in-house Enel projects.\n\nAs of today, the project perimeter includes materials in the warehouse and equipment (components) from five countries \u2013 Italy, Spain, Russia, Chile and Argentina \u2013 and 14 plants. The main opportunities that have been completed include, for example, the in-house reuse of various materials and components in Italy, Spain and Chile. This has made it possible to obtain, in addition to benefits in terms of sustainability and circular economy, a total value of avoided costs equal to approximately 1.4 million euros.\n\nFurthermore, sales initiatives have been started with third parties, for example for material in the R-GRES warehouse in Russia and in the coal mills of Teruel in Spain. There are many opportunities in the pipeline, which cover all five business models; their activation is therefore the objective of the program for the upcoming months. Progress is measured by ad hoc indicators that have been defined for the project and are periodically monitored.\nGlobal Infrastructure and Networks\n\nThe value chain of the grid assets is currently being analyzed, with the objective of creating long-term value by focusing on two main levers: regeneration of end-of-life asset materials and introduction of a circular approach during the design phase. In 2020, experiments were completed for the regeneration of the plastic coming from decommissioned counters to be used for the production of new counters, and an analogous process was developed in Brazil. Experiments were also started regarding the regeneration of the materials of other grid assets (for example, the supports for the electrical infrastructure and the boxes for the electronic counters).\n\nCircular Open Meter\n\nEnel has embarked on a challenging path aimed at redesigning the value chain by adopting a circular economy model in order to reduce environmental impacts by maximizing the recovery of end-of-life products and materials. With the progress in Italy of the plan to replace 32 million first generation meters, Enel has decided to transform their disposal into an opportunity by using the material originating from the counters being decommissioned to make the new \u2018Circular Open Meter\u2019.\n\nWhen developing this device, a process was perfected for the selection and regeneration of the polycarbonate taken from the meters being decommissioned, which can be replicated in the future in all countries of the Group, if the physical and mechanical characteristics of the recycled plastic material permit doing so. In June 2020, the NMI Certification Body (Nederlands Meetinstituut) for the MID Directive (Measuring Instruments Directive) approved the use of the regenerated plastic for the Open Meter. With this certification, which guarantees the quality of the regeneration process, production started for the first batch of the 30 thousand Circular Open Meters.\n\nMade of 100% regenerated plastic, the new counters make it possible to minimize the environmental impact to the benefit of customers, the territory and the environment. In particular, with the application of the \u2018Life Cycle Assessment\u2019, a standardized assessment method on an international level that quantifies the impact of a certain product on the environment, it was estimated that for the first batch there was a reduction of 210 tons of CO\u2082 emitted as compared to the traditional process. Furthermore, thanks to the reinvestment of the waste material of the old devices in the production process of the new Circular Open Meters (mainly plastic), also a reduction of 31.5 tons of waste was estimated.\n\nIn percentage terms, 48% of the new meters by weight is made of regenerated materials. It is also estimated that 78% by weight of the Circular Open Meter (in addition to plastic, also the metals and steel) can be recycled at the end of their service life.\n\nThe Circular Open Meter is therefore a perfect example of the circular economy, a large step forward toward an industrial model that is increasingly sustainable, innovative and efficient along the entire value chain.\n\nIn order to stimulate the market toward higher standards that can be both an example and a driver for other companies, both suppliers and customers, Enel X provides innovative advisory tools capable of guiding companies and public administrations in defining and implementing sustainability programs. The entire process, which is unique in its completeness and innovativeness, is called the \u2018Enel X Circular Economy Boosting Program\u2019, precisely to underline and emphasize the acceleration/boost aspect and therefore the dynamism and commitment that the entire company constantly demonstrates to pursue its sustainability and circular economy objectives. The advisory service, which supports the recovery of Italian companies and public administrations, includes the following tools.\n\nEnel X Circular Economy Client Report\n\nDuring 2020 approximately 50 Circular Economy Client Reports were completed, which supplied customer companies with solutions for generated savings on a yearly basis of more than 7000 tons of CO\u2082 and 10 GWh of energy. In Italy, important partnerships were established with the main bodies and strategic companies that represent the territory. The objective is to transfer knowledge about the circular economy as a sustainable business model able to generate opportunities that are economically advantageous and competitive, both for the territory and for customer and partner companies internationally.\n\nEnel X Circular Economy PA (Public Administration) Report\n\nTo accompany the public administration toward a more sustainable and circular approach, Enel X has developed an assessment model that aims to evaluate the level of circular maturity of municipalities and identify a series of solutions to implement within a roadmap of concrete interventions that have an impact on the territory. This assessment is performed on both levels of analysis: on a level of the entire urban/city perimeter and on the level of one or more specific sites (buildings and public structures) with a focus on energy circularity.\nFor cities, the assessment covers five survey areas: circular economy, energy, mobility, waste and emissions. Each of these areas is assessed based on four dimensions and specific indicators associated with them, which are useful for identifying the level of circular maturity of a city:\n\n- governance & policy: existence of targets and plans for promoting the circular economy and related issues on a local level;\n- support tools: promotion of initiatives and incentives, by the administration, so that citizens and companies improve their approach to the principles of the circular economy;\n- digitalization: adoption of digital tools to enable the development of circular behaviors by citizens and companies;\n- status quo: assessment of quantitative aspects related to the management of energy and material sources from a circularity point of view.\n\nFurthermore, in order to automate it and make it even more usable, both for large urban centers and small cities, the model is currently being updated thanks to active collaboration with academic and institutional partners. In this way, it will be possible to further extend the area of analysis, adding new areas and indicators and including new data sources, comprehensive of those available via open data.\n\n**Enel X Circular Economy Product Score**\n\nAs instead regards products, the starting point for the Circular Economy Boosting Program is the Circular Economy Score, which allows the degree of circularity of the solutions in the portfolio to be measured. Each product and the upstream and downstream supply chain can in fact be assessed based on parameters of the circularity assessment metrics. This obtains a \u201cproduct score\u201d that serves two functions: on the one hand to calculate the environmental impact and define possible improvements to the production cycle, on the other to measure the effectiveness of the proposed change. The obtained score is then used as the starting point for applying the Circular Economy Boosting Program and increasing the circular maturity of the product through \u201cproduct innovation\u201d and \u201credesign\u201d processes, in order to increase the level of circularity and sustainability. An example of an Enel X product for which the Boosting Program was applied is the device for charging electric vehicles for private individuals, the Juice Box.\n\n**Juice box and the circular economy**\n\nThe application of the principles of the circular economy to the production cycle can provide a considerable contribution to the adoption of behaviors that are more responsible with respect to the planet. An emblematic case of a product score with the aim of improving its sustainability is that of the Juice Box, the latest proposal of Enel X for charging electric vehicles for homes and companies. The Circular Economy Boosting Program was able to identify the lever for increasing the level of circularity of the product and, at the same time, combat pollution created by the plastic used to make the encasing of the small charging station. The procurement of the virgin plastic was replaced by recycled plastic, with the identification of new suitable suppliers and designing and implementing an innovative product inspired by the principles of circularity. After the tests confirmed the results in terms of performance comparable to what was obtained using virgin plastic, at the end of 2020 the first 3 thousand Juice Boxes saw the light of day. In 2021, in Europe only, more than 30 thousand new Boxes will be produced, therefore using approximately 62 tons of plastic waste for their manufacturing, with an additional roll-out already planned in other Countries and Regions.\n\n**Digital**\n\nThe digital area is a fundamental part of the Company and represents a circularity enabler. By developing initiatives for the circular management of IT assets (for example, extension of the useful life and reuse of the devices) as well as other digital solutions that enable and accelerate circular business models (for example, machine learning techniques intended for predictive maintenance, digital management of information about materials, etc.),\n\n**Targets and performance indicators**\n\nOne of the main challenges for the true adoption of a circular economy model is the definition of criteria and reference metrics on an international level that make it possible to distinguish between circular and non-circular solutions, measure the impacts, define the objectives and understand the improvement levers.\n\nEnel measures the economic performance of the new initiatives of all the Business Lines through a periodic metric presented to top management, which measures the environmental impacts and economic performance differentials of this new focus. In particular, a first set of indicators, which are more operative, is used to monitor the activities and initiatives developed on a Business Line as well as a country level. In parallel, an integrated Group process is being developed in order to measure the material and energy parameters related to the five pillars of the circular economy, in physical and economic terms.\n\n**CirculAbility Model**\n\nAbout four years ago, Enel developed and perfected a conceptual model for defining the measurement of the circularity of its business, and made it public online to spread the knowledge and promote the adoption of circular economy models.\n\nThe model, which is called the CirculAbility Model, defines the five pillars of circularity in a quantitative manner and simultaneously manages both the material component and the energy component, providing a single circularity indicator.\\(^1\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) [https://corporate.enel.it/en/circular-economy-sustainable-future/performance-indicators](https://corporate.enel.it/en/circular-economy-sustainable-future/performance-indicators)\nThe model has been shared with other industry operators, competitors and institutions, to provide a proactive contribution to the dialog. In coherence with the Group\u2019s vision, specific approaches have been developed for the various targets:\n\n- **Procurement**: the supply categories are subjected to a systematic analysis of the entire life cycle (\u201cLife Cycle Assessment\u201d), using the EPD (Environmental Product Declaration) to track environmental impacts and all material and energy flows during the supply generation process;\n- **Circular Assets**: in order to manage Group assets with a circular approach, the circularity of the design, construction, operation and end of life phases is measured, making it possible to identify operating initiatives that make it possible to increase the overall process circularity rating;\n- **Enel X**: measurement of the level of circularity of the products and services offered to customers (in order to provide a tool of comparison for interested end consumers sensitive to environmental issues) and of the circularity of industrial customers and the public administration.\n\n### Group circularity indicators\n\nIn order to measure the circularity of its activities in a precise manner, the Group is increasingly focused on analyzing the evolution of the consumption of resources associated with its business activities.\n\nIn line with the productivity indicators of the resources, also provided by Eurostat, we measure the consumption of material for its entire life considering the whole value chain. As regards the generation capacities, this involves measuring the consumption of resources over the entire life in connection to a power plant: from the extracted raw materials, to the consumed materials and the energy used during the phases of manufacturing, construction, operation and decommissioning. This aggregated value is then compared with the energy produced over the entire life. This indicator, on an aggregate level, is presented at Capital Markets Day 2020, and was defined a target for 2030 for improving circularity by 86% in comparison to 2015 in terms of consumption for the entire useful life of the materials and fuels for the generation capacity (the value achieved in 2020 was 54%).\n\nThe objective is to more deeply analyze these impacts by technological supply chain, in order to progressively reduce the Group\u2019s impact on the consumption of resources, tracking the individual materials in an increasingly detailed manner. This represents a fundamental step for ensuring that the transition toward renewable energies and electrification of final demand does not generate in turn new environmental, social and procurement challenges related to the utilized materials.\n\nThe systematic development of these analyses makes a bottom-up aggregation possible to improve the overall impact in terms of Group resources as regards the activities carried out.\n\n### Circular EBITDA\n\nThe circular economy is closely connected to the creation of not only environmental value, but also economic value; it is also measurable in a quantitative manner and therefore can permit a connection between industrial and financial metrics. These hybrid metrics are being defined, also sharing the approaches with various stakeholders inside and outside the Company, and precisely defining the development criteria in compliance with various international forums regarding sustainable finance.\n\nIn general, circular EBITDA takes 3 categories into consideration:\n\n- **Circular Product & Service \u2013 Circular P&S**: supply of products and services that enable the circularity of customers\u2019 sectors considered circular due to the type of products or goods that they supply, renewable energy, charging systems with PaaS for electric mobility, etc.;\n- **Circular Value Chain \u2013 Circular VC**: adoption of circular input and development models: each sector, regardless of the type of output, can insert circularity along its entire value chain in terms of design, materials, etc.;\n- **Enabler**: functions that do not have a direct impact on circularity in terms of material and energy flows, but that are essential because they enable the other areas (for example, digital, supplier management, etc.).\n\nIn line with the Group CircularAbility Model, the levers to use concern both the flows of material and energy (circular flow, both input and output) as well as the business models (extension of the useful life, PaaS, sharing).\n\nThe three categories can overlap: for example, the sector of renewable energy can be put in the Circular P&S category, but, if also the entire supply chain \u2013 from materials to installation and decommissioning \u2013 is inserted in a circular point of view, therefore it can also be put in the Circular VC category.\n\n### Circular city\n\nEnel already started working on the topic of circular cities many years ago, with the awareness that the evolution of the cities cannot be approached only from the point of view of individual technologies or individual sectors, but requires a transversal vision, a clear definition of the economic, environmental and social objectives as well as open governance. Cities are responsible for approximately 80% of global GDP and are also the areas where the global challenges are most critical, because they contribute to more than two thirds of emissions and the world-wide consumption of natural resources. Therefore they represent a laboratory for the definition and implementation of solutions that provide a concrete contribution to the solution to the global challenges.\n\nWith its vision of the circular city, Enel has discussed and collaborated with associations and companies in other sectors to define the context within which it can make its contribution. When expanding upon this viewpoint, technologies still maintain a central role: for example infrastructure is an aspect that permeates all the areas: smart grid, smart lighting, ports, fiber optics. New technologies play a key role, as well as the most important renewable technologies and IoT (Internet of Things) solutions, they represent a new paradigm able to eliminate global and local pollution emitted by current technologies and improve the quality of life of citizens.\n\nEnel has contributed to this design not only in terms of business solutions and services, but also with a more holistic thinking, for creating awareness and for sharing ideas on this topic. Three years ago, Enel published its first position paper on circular cities, with the study reaching its third edition in 2020, which has placed emphasis on a key topic for the effective and organic implementation of the circular economy: public-private collaboration (https://www.enel.com/content/dam/enel-com/documenti/media/paper-circular-cities-2020.pdf).\n\n### The involvement of the ecosystem\n\nA circularity-based business model implies the utmost collaboration between all actors involved; that\u2019s why we consider it essential to open up to dialogue with parties who share this vision, involving the supply chains and promoting common initiatives to safeguard natural resources and boost competitiveness of the ecosystem.\n\nIt is not possible to search for a circular solution only within a company or its business sectors, rather it is necessary...\nto also explore synergies with other sectors with which the company never worked together historically. For example, for this purpose Enel is committed to a global initiative after joining the Capital Equipment Coalition, which is a coalition of leading companies on the topic of the circular economy.\n\nFurthermore, for this purpose, in 2017 Enel, together with many other \u2018Made in Italy\u2019 companies in various sectors, launched the Circular Economy Alliance. Another key element for supporting the creation of a circular ecosystem is the participation in international networks in order to contribute toward the discussion regarding how to accelerate the transition toward a circular economy, sharing the best practices and identifying possible synergies and collaborations. With this objective, Enel is part of various networks, such as:\n\n- Ellen MacArthur Foundation;\n- World Business Council for Sustainable Development;\n- European Remanufacturing Council;\n- Italian Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform.\n\nThe active participation in these networks, in combination with a collaborative approach with the external world and with a focus on co-innovation with our suppliers and customers, is of fundamental importance in order to create an innovative ecosystem with the objective of making the various value chains more circular.\n\nA new circular culture\n\nA transformation like the one represented by the transition toward a circular economy model requires a commitment also in terms of skills, work methods, integration. Enel has made a strong commitment to promoting the culture of circularity, both within the Company and externally. Therefore, we make use of our experience and our knowledge on this topic to create informational and educational content to share with stakeholders both inside and outside the Company. Inside the Company, Enel educates its employees and spreads the circular economy through instructional and training activities, such as the online course on the circular economy as well as ad hoc training sessions for specific functions that play a role in key activities related to the circular economy. For this purpose, a Group Circular Economy School was established, which involved approximately 180 Enel people during 2020 in Europe and Latin America over a period of two weeks per edition. The participation and topics faced were intentionally transversal with respect to the professional areas in order to promote comparison and rethinking in as broad a manner as possible. All business areas and staff Functions participated in addressing technological, process, business model, contractual, regulatory, institutional topics, etc. Furthermore, various communities were created to support the activities and promote the culture and best practices of circular economy across all areas.\n\nAn additional important element was the launch of the e-circular platform, which is an in-house company platform with the objective of supporting the development of the \u2018circular\u2019 behavior of people, therefore also projecting what the Group is facing in business onto a personal level. Colleagues can use the platform to make their skills available (for example for language exchange), offer goods or search for items. Furthermore, the platform represents a focal point for all the circular culture initiatives promoted in Enel through information, news and multimedia content regarding the circular economy.\n\nAn additional innovative element was the creation of a Business Simulation Game session, in which Enel people in the various countries tested their knowledge about transforming a business from linear to circular by acquiring new levers. Circular is Cool is the name of the project that Enel X has created for schools, together with Humans to Humans. Contributing toward the creation of a culture of sustainability and circularity means, in fact, also teaching the new generations to respect the planet, our home. The educational project involves approximately 1,000 students from ten middle schools in seven Italian regions, and includes a cycle of three online tutorials, thanks to which the participants will be able to learn about the principles that are at the basis of the circular economy model and its concrete applications, for example in the mobility sector. Listening directly to the managers themselves. Finally, Enel puts young talents to the test regarding the circular economy and innovation with two programs, PlayEnergy and We are Energy, which have the objective of developing and enhancing young talents.\n\nPlayEnergy is directed outside the Company, involving young innovators between the ages of 7 and 18 in the search for solutions for a better future, using their creativity and their imagination. The 2020 edition actively involved more than 7,500 young people from Italy, Brazil and Greece. We are Energy is instead a program intended exclusively for the children of colleagues in all the countries where we operate between ages of 7 and 18. The 2020 edition, which was called Reci-proCity, focused on the circular, inclusive and sustainable city, with the participation of more than two thousand young people from 16 countries.\n### At a Glance\n\n#### Trend Topic\n\n- **Economic and financial value creation**\n- **Sustainable supply chain**\n\n#### Priorities\n\n- **Plan**\n- **SDG**\n\n#### Target\n\n- **Sustainable supply chain**\n\n### Activities 2020-2022 targets 2020 results Status 2021-2023 targets Tag SDG\n\n| Activities                                                                 | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Qualified suppliers\\(^1\\) assessed for health and safety aspects for all product groups (% qualified suppliers) | 100%              | 98%          | ON-PLAN| 100%              |     |     |\n| Qualified suppliers\\(^1\\) assessed for environmental aspects for all product groups (% qualified suppliers) | 100%              | 98%          | ON-PLAN| 100%              |     |     |\n| Qualified suppliers\\(^1\\) assessed in relation to aspects of human rights or business ethics for all product groups (% qualified suppliers) | 100%              | 98%          | ON-PLAN| 100%              |     |     |\n| Development of a new control system for real time recognition and monitoring of suppliers' performances | Internal communication campaign on the \u2018Track and Rate\u2019 system launched in June | Establishment of the system for reducing risk and improving resilience in the supply chain (e.g. \u2018Risk Methods\u2019 \u2013 Global Power Generation and Global Infrastructure and Networks) | ON-PLAN |     |     |\n| Training and awareness raising campaigns in relation to the use of applications developed for the new Supplier Performance Management, with a focus on the new evaluation category dedicated to human rights | Over 1,300 people trained | Training and awareness raising campaigns in relation to the use of applications developed for the new Supplier Performance Management, with a focus on the new evaluation category | ON-PLAN |     |     |\n\n### Goals\n\n- **Industrial**\n- **Environmental**\n- **Social**\n- **Governance**\n- **Technological**\n\n### Activities 2020-2022 targets 2020 results Status 2021-2023 targets Tag SDG\n\n| Activities                                                                 | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Integration of the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and launch of co-innovation projects | Integration of the EPD qualification requirement and subsequent launch of co-innovation projects | ON-PLAN |     |     |     |\n| Increase and strengthening of tender strategies in which assessment of the K technical factor includes sustainability aspects | Published the OP 1684 procedure \u2018K Sustainability and other commitments process management\u2019 | ON-PLAN |     |     |     |\n| Start of actions aimed at sharing best practices throughout the entire perimeter of Enel | SharePoint created for data collection |     |     |     |     |\n| | Integrated the automatic tool on the WeBuy platform |     |     |     |     |\n| | Published the \u201cSustainability K Library\u201d on the shared portal and launched training between Procurement and Business Lines |     |     |     |     |\n| Promotion of activities of information and benchmarking with suppliers | Promotion of activities of information and benchmarking with suppliers | ON-PLAN |     |     |     |\n| Development of projects in line with the principles of the circular economy in order to achieve a \u201czero waste\u201d approach and then extend it to the business activities | Vendor Days and remote workshops held |     |     |     |     |\n| | Launch of the \u201cCircular Procurement\u201d strategy (including the K factor: EPD and co-innovation) |     |     |     |     |\n| | Circular economy sessions held;

Our purchasing processes are based on pre-contractual and contractual conduct geared towards mutual loyalty, transparency and collaboration. In addition to ensuring the necessary quality standards, supplier performance must go hand in hand with the commitment to adopt best practices in terms of human rights, working conditions, occupational health and safety, and environmental responsibility.

The traditional measure of supply chain effectiveness, namely cost savings, is now accompanied by other metrics that seek to maximize value creation in its various forms (safety, time, quality, performance, revenue, flexibility, risk reduction).\n\nThe strategy is essentially based on three cornerstones:\n\n- expanding the professionalism of buyers, through user-friendly technologies and by recognizing everyone\u2019s contribution in a multicultural, trust-based working environment driven by passion;\n- enhancing integration and communications with internal customers, setting out together solutions to fulfill the business\u2019 needs;\n- involving suppliers from the moment the need arises, listening to their proposals and developing innovative approaches together.\n\nProcurement processes are carried out in compliance with the applicable local laws, ensuring the quality of service in full compliance with the principles of economy, efficiency, timeliness and fairness.\n\nEvery procurement procedure seeks to apply the principles of free competition, equal treatment, non-discrimination, transparency, proportionality, rotation, and public access. Moreover, the economic principle may be subordinated to tendering criteria inspired by social demands, as well as to the protection of health and the environment and the promotion of sustainable development and social stability.\n\nIn terms of environmental sustainability and reducing paper usage, the Group promotes digital processes for the qualification/registration of suppliers, tender management and the issue of contracts.\n\nSupplier management and assessment processes\n\nWe adopt a structured approach to analyzing and monitoring the procurement process, in order to ensure that the best partners are selected and that contracts are executed to the highest sustainability standards.\n\nIn particular, risk assessments are carried out for all categories of purchased products. The main risks identified relate to economic, environmental and social aspects as well as to integrity.\n\n83% of Tier 1 suppliers (approximately 12 thousand) are deemed critical, considering their strategic importance to the business, purchase volumes and potential economic,\nsocial and environmental impacts. **Sustainability criteria** are applied right from the initial phases of supplier qualification and selection, with a strict focus on health, safety, the environment and human rights. In addition, at the tender stage, specific sustainability Ks are applied in a mechanism that rewards and invests in suppliers committed to enhancing their sustainability. These suppliers go beyond the traditional concept of cost savings, by covering any price premium with the extra value contributed by the more sustainable purchases made. Throughout the life of each contract, we check compliance with our requirements and the commitments made in relation to these Ks, applying the Supplier Performance Management program. A key element of this model is the development of a circular economy approach that reviews production processes and/or changes purchasing methods in that context. Application of this approach involves the definition of metrics and indicators, collaboration with suppliers and the promotion of co-innovation projects with them. In particular, the \u201cCircular Economy Initiative for Supplier Engagement\u201d involves about 200 suppliers globally in 12 product categories, which currently account for more than 60% of spending on materials. The initiative is based on adopting the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD), with the aim of quantifying, certifying and objectively communicating the impacts generated throughout the life cycle of each supply (water consumption, CO2 emissions, impact on the soil, etc.). Lastly, by adopting a dedicated IT tool (the Circular Supplier Tool), it is possible to aggregate data and set sector benchmarks and improvement targets. For further details, see the \u201cCircular economy\u201d chapter of this document. A number of Communities will be launched during 2021, with the involvement of various Staff Functions and Business Lines that will be tasked with the constant, proactive monitoring of topics relating to the sustainable supply chain and the circular economy. The ultimate objective is to further integrate the principles of sustainability and circular economy within the overall process of supply chain management, measuring the value generated in a manner that takes account of the sustainable development goals.\n\n**Supplier qualification system**\n\nOur supplier qualification system ensures the careful selection and assessment of companies wishing to participate in procurement procedures. The system assesses their satisfaction of the technical, financial, legal, environmental, health and safety, human rights and ethical integrity requirements, to ensure the proper level of quality and reliability of any awarded contracts. All suppliers, based on their businesses, can participate in a qualification process for one or more Product Groups (PGs): suppliers are only deemed suitable when they meet all the requirements specified for each PG. Careful and comprehensive analysis of the PG tree is carried out constantly. Our Global Procurement units, business units and competent HSEQ areas map the activities included in each PG and assign a risk level to each topic (safety, environment, human rights, spending, replaceable supplier, etc.). Following this risk assessment, PGs are grouped into different families associated with their respective assessed risk. Qualification requirements vary depending on the implications and specific impacts associated with each Group: for example, for a PG with a high environmental risk, Environmental Management System ISO 14001 certification is usually required, while PGs with a high safety risk must also have Occupational Health and Safety Management System OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 certification.\n\nThe qualification system, governed by an internal procedure, was established in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations and has various qualification paths that take account of the above-mentioned risk classes. The system requires compliance with the principles set out in the Code of Ethics, the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan and the 231 Model, the Policy on Human Rights and the UN Global Compact, with specific reference to the absence of conflicts of interest (even potential conflicts) and \u2013 depending on the risk class \u2013 also requires the presentation of specific certificates/self-declarations, or on-site visits, to verify satisfaction of the above requirements. Compliance with the requirements must be assured for the entire duration of the qualification and, as such, those already included in the Enel Register of Qualified Suppliers are constantly monitored, partly by reference to external databases, for events that may affect their company and its main representatives.\n\nThe qualification system serves as:\n\n- a guarantee for Enel, providing an updated list of entities with proven reliability (in legal, financial, technical and organizational, ethical, health and safety, and environmental aspects) on which we can draw;\n- an opportunity, in compliance with the relevant current regulations, for suppliers to be invited to participate in the procurement procedures announced by Group companies.\n\nThere are three main areas of analysis:\n\n- **Health and Safety**: the \u201cSafety Self-Assessment\u201d survey enables us to inform suppliers easily about the key requirements for mutual development, and is an integral part of the sustainability requirements for qualifying PGs with a Health and Safety risk;\n- **Environment**: environmental assessment criteria vary depending on the product category and level of risk associated with each PG, on a scale from 1 to 3. For PGs considered to have a high environmental risk, ISO 14001 certification or equivalent is absolutely necessary. Moreover, for these product categories, an on-site audit at the contractor\u2019s premises/sites is always required. As part of the qualification process, we have introduced a specific assessment of environmental requirements, in addition to the usual checks, for the inclusion of suppliers on the Supplier Register;\n- **Human Rights**: prudently we assess suppliers in relation to human rights, regardless of the level of risk, through a dedicated survey which analyzes the characteristics of potential suppliers in terms of inclusion and diversity, protection of workers\u2019 privacy, verification of their supply chain, forced or child labor, freedom of association and collective bargaining and the application of fair working conditions (including adequate wages and hours worked).\n\nIndividual suppliers can only be added to the Supplier Register or remain on it if they previously qualified and are invited to participate in the Group\u2019s procurement procedures if they receive an overall positive assessment. If an adverse opinion is expressed, the qualification request will be rejected and the contractor may not be invited to participate in Group tenders. The evaluation of individual sustainability requirements contributes to the overall assessment of the company\u2019s suitability for inclusion on the Supplier Register. If exclusion from the Enel Register follows an adverse assessment of one or more sustainability requirements, the supplier may present a new qualification request at a later time.\n\nIn 2020, 100% of qualified suppliers were assessed according to social, environmental and safety criteria. The number of qualified suppliers with a contract still active in 2020 was 1,342 (3,748 in 2019).\nat the end of 2020 is approximately 5,100 (around 38% of active suppliers as of December 31), while the total number of active qualified companies is 16,124.\n\nThe following table shows the trend in the qualified suppliers percentage for the three aspects analyzed by process.\n\n| % suppliers qualified at December 31 |\n|-------------------------------------|\n| HUMAN RIGHTS (%) | ENVIRONMENT (%) | SAFETY (%) |\n| 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |\n| 98 | 85 | 74 | 98 | 85 | 74 | 98 | 85 | 74 |\n\n**Tendering and contracting processes**\n\nConsistent with our commitment to introduce sustainability aspects into the tendering processes, in 2020 we adopted a structured process governed by a specific procedure designed to monitor the tendering commitments made by the supplier throughout the entire life of the contract. This process is based on a \u201cLibrary\u201d listing the \u201csustainability Ks\u201d that may be used in tender processes by the different purchasing units, depending on the PG concerned. There are three main categories:\n\n- **environmental Ks** for example, possession of ISO 14001 certification, waste management, carbon footprint assessment according to UNI EN ISO 14067:2018; circular economy projects;\n- **safety Ks** for example, possession of OHSAS 18001 certification, monitoring of the main safety indicators;\n- **social Ks** for example, training to develop the skills of local communities, or action to ensure respect for gender diversity.\n\nIn a context of continuous improvement, the Library is being updated and a dedicated agile room has been created.\n\nWe include specific clauses in all contracts for works, services and supplies, which are updated periodically to take account of the various regulatory changes and align with international best practices. The General Terms and Conditions comprise a general section containing provisions applicable to all countries, as well as Country Annexes which contain the clauses specific to each country. In terms of supply chain sustainability, we require contractors/suppliers and subcontractors \u2013 among other matters \u2013 to respect and protect internationally recognized human rights, as well as ethical and social obligations in terms of: child and female labor, equal treatment, non-discrimination, freedom to unionize, freedom of association and representation, forced labor, health, safety and environmental protection, sanitary conditions and regulations on wages, social security and pension contributions, insurance and tax. We also expressly require suppliers to commit to adopt and implement the principles of the Global Compact and to guarantee that they will be respected by their employees and subcontractors when carrying out all activities. Moreover, suppliers must agree to respect the principles contained in the Enel Code of Ethics, or at least take inspiration from equivalent principles in managing their businesses. Lastly, suppliers are required to apply the \u2018International Labour Organization\u2019 conventions or, if more restrictive, the applicable regulations in the country where their activities are carried out.\n\nIn these areas, we reserve the right to carry out checks and monitoring of any type to verify compliance with the above obligations by the contractor and its subcontractors, or entities under its responsibility which are assigned to execute the contract, and to terminate it immediately in the event of proven infringement of those obligations.\n\n**Integrity requirements**\n\nThe Group has adopted specific operating practices to check on \u201cintegrity requirements\u201d, with the aim of consolidating the existing control system through more rigorous action to tackle corruption. In particular by setting out specific documentary check criteria for legal and integrity requirements that are homogeneous and applicable to the procurement process (from the qualification phase through to awarding individual contracts), identifying operational checks to enhance the preventive tools available to tackle in a rational, organic and specific manner any cases of corruption or the factors that contribute to its spread; promoting a widespread culture of compliance and ethical conduct. An AI system has been added to the above process, as a tool to analyze and mitigate reputational, environmental and social risks, etc., in order to select and constantly monitor suppliers by checking open-source information.\nSupplier Performance Management\n\nWe assess and monitor the performance of our suppliers \u2013 during both the procurement process and the execution of contracts \u2013 through the Supplier Performance Management (SPM) process. This aims not only to take corrective actions when necessary, but also to encourage suppliers to improve by incentivizing best practices through reward schemes. The Supplier Performance Management process, governed by a dedicated procedure, is based on the objective and systematic disclosure of data and information on the execution of the contracted work. This data is used to develop specific indicators, also called categories (Quality, Punctuality, Health and Safety, Environment, Human Rights & Fairness and Innovation & Collaboration), which are combined to form a weighted average and produce the Supplier Performance Index (SPI). The categories and SPI can be used as assessment elements for participation in tenders and for continuation of the contractual relationship in accordance with the applicable local requirements. Monitoring activities are conducted by the various Business Lines with support from the relevant HSE units, where applicable, and the Qualification & Vendor Rating unit. In addition, all individuals who interact with suppliers have the opportunity to express their own assessment using the dedicated \u201cTrack & Rate\u201d app. For suppliers with poor performance, we take specific action that can have an impact on:\n\n- the qualification system (for example suspending the qualification, reviewing the application class, placement on the blacklist, exclusion from the list of qualified suppliers etc.) and/or\n- the contract (for example further investigations, improvement action plan, contract termination, reduction in volumes, etc.).\n\nIn the event of issues with the conduct of a supplier, an action plan may be drawn up jointly, the execution of which is constantly monitored by Enel. The SPM process monitored 612 PGs and 7,050 contractors last year (450 PGs and around 2,282 contractors in 2019).\n\nMonitoring systems\n\nAt each stage of the procurement process, specific committees comprising representatives from both the purchasing area and the Business Lines assess and monitor supplier performance. In particular, the following committees have been established:\n\n- Qualification committee:\n- Integrity committee: this includes representatives from Global Procurement, the Legal Function and the Security Function; meetings are held every time an issue arises, such as investigations or proceedings relating to offenses committed by a supplier, and also periodically (usually monthly) to share and analyze situations which require specific actions/sanctions to be applied to suppliers.\n\nMoreover, individual country-specific units (\u201cContract Controls Area\u201d) have been set up to carry out checks on the responsible management of the supply chain and assess and manage risks relating to joint and several liability (contractually applicable to successful tenderers and any sub-contractors). The checks include an initial mass document analysis to check that suppliers have made timely social security contributions and complied with their contractual obligations. A subsequent, second-level check on a sample of tenders involves targeted and thorough verifications with on-site inspections.\n\nTraining and information\n\nWe have organized many meetings with contractors on sustainability matters in recent years, with a view to exchanging ideas and approaches. In addition, articles are published periodically on the Enel Global Procurement website that highlight the commitment made by the Group to these topics (https://globalprocurement.enel.com). We have also implemented numerous initiatives to engage contractors with regard to protection and awareness, particularly on health and safety matters. Due to these initiatives, there has been a significant decrease in accidents at work in recent years.\n\nDifferent initiatives have been launched to make the supply chain ever more resilient, and the concept of supplier centrality ever more concrete and tangible. As an example, the Supplier Development Program started in July 2020 supports the growth of suppliers and, at the same time, contributes to the achievement of our strategic objectives. The program addresses all small- and medium-sized suppliers active in strategic areas seeking to ensure excellent performance, maintained over time, in such areas as safety, timeliness, quality, environment, human rights and fairness, innovativeness (ability to innovate sustainably) and collaboration. By signing agreements with the principal market players, we make our networking ability and skills available to the supply chain, guaranteeing better than market conditions and making a partial contribution to the services offered in the context of the program.\n\nIn addition to dimensional growth, the development objectives promoted involve:\n\n- increased awareness about sustainability and digitalization matters;\n- differentiation of the business and consequent reduction in supplier dependence on us;\n- increased financial strength;\n- internationalization, which helps grow our business outside of Italy and Europe.\n\nOn the other hand, the Supplier Journey project seeks to improve efficiency and maximize the value of our relations with suppliers, throughout the entire process. Here too, we actively analyze our processes, systems and the approach followed when working with suppliers on a daily basis, thus facilitating the improvement actions identified by listening to the principal actors involved: buyers, contract managers, administrative colleagues and suppliers.\nBettercoal\n\nTogether with major European electric utilities, we are actively engaged in Bettercoal \u2013 a global initiative to promote the continuous improvement of corporate responsibility in the international coal industry. Bettercoal has released a code of conduct based on existing and agreed standards of social responsibility in the mining sector. This details guidelines which mining companies can refer to when drawing up their own social, environment and ethical policies. The Bettercoal Code tells suppliers what members expect from their practices in relation to four main categories: management; commitment to ethics and transparency; human and labor rights; and environmental performance, while promoting ongoing improvement. In 2020, a new version of the Code was finalized to align it with the latest best practices in sustainability, thereby contributing to achievement of the applicable Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nIn addition to Bettercoal\u2019s growing presence in various forums in the area of coal and supply chain sustainability, the initiative has become an example of collaboration among the various stakeholders, geared towards improving socially responsible practices within the supply chain. During 2020, the mining companies committed to the Bettercoal initiative produced more than 400 mil t of coal. Although the global pandemic linked to Covid-19 prevented the inspections planned in Russia, Colombia and South Africa, 14 improvement plans were monitored actively throughout the year, three new reports were published on the assessments made of mining sites, and the two working parties dedicated specifically to Russia and Colombia continued their work.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the website: www.bettercoal.org.\n\nFuel procurement\n\nSuppliers of solid and liquid fuel are selected through the \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d process that, for each counterpart, evaluates the reputational and economic-financial aspects and their satisfaction of the appropriate technical and commercial requirements. Checks also ensure that suppliers are not on any specific UN, EU or OFAC blacklists. These lists identify individuals or organizations associated with terrorist associations, organizations under EU financial sanctions, and so-called Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) who are subject to US sanctions on terrorism or drug trafficking charges, among others.\n\nTo assess the sustainability aspects of coal sources, an internal process has been established to ensure that Group requirements for occupational safety, environment and human rights have been satisfied.\n\nPurchase contracts entered into with each supplier are subject to the Group principles embedded in the Code of Ethics and the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan, with which suppliers must comply. We reserve the right to terminate contracts in severe cases of non-compliance with those principles.\n\nLastly, to mitigate the risks arising from the maritime shipment of fuel, we have adopted a tool to vet and select the carriers used. Vetting is a recognized industry standard for oil transportation; but, for a few years now, Enel and an increasing number of operators have also begun to apply this methodology to the transportation of bulk cargoes.\nEach plant is a home. More than 16 thousand people in the Global Power Generation Business Line are committed to making the 1,300 homes (plants) distributed in the world increasingly safer.\n\nWhat is Intrinsic Safety? Intrinsic safety is an ethical and moral duty towards the people working for the Company and everyone who works together with Enel. It is also the latest ambitious initiative, which was launched in March 2020 by Global Power Generation in three separate waves, each divided into streams, which concentrate on sharing best practices, improving the Health & Safety processes at all the plants and reviewing the elements that make them up.\n\nThis project is active in all 31 countries where GPG operates as well as in the plants that will be put into service over the upcoming months and years as additional capacity. It will be carried out over the 2020-2022 three-year period and intends to make the Group\u2019s fleet increasingly safe by analyzing processes and components: from electrical panels to switches, from moving parts to the walkway gratings, with particular focus on the activities connected to the job sites involved with coal phase-out.\n\nThanks to the data-driven approach, an in-depth analysis was carried out on tens of thousands of safety observations arriving from the plants that, together with the improvement programs that were launched over recent years with various technologies, has made it possible for us to identify the main sectors of intervention. Each wave will be comprised of precise phases: preparing guidelines for identifying the components to be analyzed, mapped and assessed at the plant; defining actions for improvement and technical solutions to be implemented, and finally executing and concretely adopting the action plans that were identified for each plant.\n\nThis innovation starts with the hardware aspects, but it would not be able to exist without the most important software of all, people. Our colleagues working at the power plants are in fact the eyes and ears of the Group for everyone who works together with Enel. It would not be able to exist without the most important software of all, people. Our colleagues working at the power plants are in fact the eyes and ears of the Group for everyone who works together with Enel.\n\nThis project is active in all 31 countries where GPG operates as well as in the plants that will be put into service over the upcoming months and years as additional capacity. It will be carried out over the 2020-2022 three-year period and intends to make the Group\u2019s fleet increasingly safe by analyzing processes and components: from electrical panels to switches, from moving parts to the walkway gratings, with particular focus on the activities connected to the job sites involved with coal phase-out.\nEnel considers the health, safety and psychological and physical well-being of individuals the most precious asset to be protected at all times of life, at work, at home and during leisure time, and is committed to developing and disseminating a robust safety culture throughout the entire perimeter of the Company in order to guarantee a workplace that is free from health and safety hazards. The Group is committed to promoting a culture of health and safety in every country in which it operates. Its objective is to increase awareness of risks and promote responsible behaviors in order to ensure that the activities will be performed with a high level of quality and without injuries, while protecting the health of persons. Enel is also involving contractor companies in the development and awareness programs: each person must feel that they are responsible for their own health and safety as well as for the health and safety of others.\n\nThe constant commitment of all, integration of safety in processes and in training activities, disclosure and analysis of near miss accidents, rigorous selection and management of contractor companies, continuous quality controls, sharing of experience and benchmarking with the top international players are the foundational elements of our safety culture.\n\nSince the start of the Covid-19 emergency in February 2020, we have taken action in order to protect the health of our colleagues and guarantee a continuous supply of electrical energy to the communities where we operate, which is an aspect that is even more crucial at a moment like this one.\n\nConsidering the rapid evolution of the pandemic and its progressive spreading, we have created a global task force as well as local task forces, one for each country where we operate, which has made it possible to monitor the progression of the epidemic, using dedicated indicators, and immediately adopt all the measures necessary to protect the health and safety of our colleagues and guarantee the continuity of the supply of essential services.\n\nWe have implemented new operating models to minimize the risk of infection, also defining specific prevention protocols, by dynamically re-adapting the activity plan and the defined measures related to the development of the pandemic on a global level.\n\nFor all the colleagues whose work can be performed \u201cremotely\u201d, since the beginning of the emergency we have made smart working possible.\n\nFor operating units (approximately 13 thousand colleagues) that had to remain in the field, we have applied strict infection containment measures that go far beyond regulatory compliance. In particular, the operating units have been divided into smaller nuclei (elementary cells), that include the smallest number of people technically possible, who are separated by space and/or time. We have performed a stress test on the critical infrastructures on a global scale with the purpose of verifying the possible operation based on different possible infection scenarios and testing the response system defined for the emergency. We have started information and training initiatives targeted towards reminding employees of the main preventive measures to adopt during their work day (safety journey), starting from the moment they leave their home.\n\nSince the start of the epidemic, we have requested our suppliers on a global scale to undertake all the actions considered appropriate, with a standard at least equivalent to what has been adopted by the Enel Group, in order to guarantee the health of their employees and to limit infection, both when executing the contracts in force with Group companies as well as during any other occasion when meeting. For this reason, we have sent periodic communications to companies to inform them about the safety protocols and procedures we have defined at our sites and to request all our contractors and service providers working at these sites to implement the measures they contain.\n\nIn all the main countries where Enel is present, flu vaccination programs were carried out as a health preventive measure and in particular to be able to help quickly identify cases of Covid-19 at an early stage.\n\nWe have also supported the communities where we are present with donations and solidarity initiatives for the health-care structures and the organizations working on the front line to manage the emergency.\n\nWe measure our success by ensuring protection for people who work with us: there is no creation of value without safety for people.\nadoption of working methods inspired by quality and their dissemination by means of incisive and effective training that aims to create a lasting connection between technical aspects and safety aspects;\n> direct commitment of the persons in charge aimed at strengthening a robust culture of leadership in relation to safety;\n> adoption of safe and responsible conduct throughout all levels of the organization;\n> design of workplaces and supply of suitable equipment and tools for the execution of operating activities, guaranteeing optimal and the safest conditions;\n> rigorous selection and management of contractors and vendors, promoting their involvement in safety performance continual improvement programs;\n> constant attention towards communities and towards all those who work with or come into contact with the Group\u2019s activities by sharing a culture of health and safety protection;\n> annual definition of specific and measurable goals and continual monitoring to check their effective implementation through the involvement of top management.\n\nBased on the Stop Work Policy, Enel people are required to promptly report and/or stop any risky situation or unsafe behavior by internal or external personnel.\n\nIn line with the Code of Ethics, the Statement and the Stop Work Policy, Enel has defined a specific Health & Safety Policy that requires every Group Business Line to have its own Health & Safety Management System in compliance with international standard ISO 45001.\n\nThe Management System is based on the identification of hazards, the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the risks, the planning and implementation of the preventive and protective measures, the check of the effectiveness of the preventive and protective measures, and any corrective measures. In particular, it involves both Enel people and personnel from contractor companies who work at Enel\u2019s plants and sites, and is based on the following shared principles:\n> prior evaluation, elimination and/or reduction of risks through application of the latest technical know-how;\n> identification of the necessary preventive measures and the associated implementation program;\n> adoption of residual risk mitigation measures, awarding priority to collective rather than personal solutions;\n> active, responsible, and integrated intervention of all parties concerned with safety, involving workers and/or workers\u2019 representatives, starting from the identification of risk situations up to the choice of solutions to prevent and/or reduce them;\n> appointment of a medical officer, when required, and setting up health surveillance for workers responsible for specific high-risk processes;\n> preparation of a program of information and training of workers in order to increase awareness when dealing with situations of risk;\n> regular upkeep and cleaning of workplaces.\n\nFrom an organizational perspective, the Holding Health, Safety, Environment and Quality unit (HSEQ) assumes the roles of supervision, guidance and coordination, promoting the dissemination and sharing of best practices within the Group and external health and safety benchmarking with top international players in order to identify improvement opportunities and ensure constant commitment in the area of risk reduction.\n\nAlongside the Holding Function, the Global Business Lines HSEQ structures orient and support the business in relation to health and safety issues, define improvement plans and monitor their execution.\n\n2020 performance\n\nThe combined injury Frequency Rate (FR) for Enel people and contractors in 2020 confirmed the downward trend already recorded in prior years, with a total of 0.52 injuries per million hours worked, a figure that is 28% lower than that of 2019.\n\nIn detail, the FR of Enel people decreased, totaling 0.60 injuries per one million hours worked (-33% versus 2019), and also that of contractor personnel, totaling 0.49 injuries per one million hours worked (-28% versus 2019), thus confirming the Group\u2019s effectiveness of the strategies adopted and of the safety policies implemented in the Group.\n\nIn 2020 there was 1 fatality involving an employee of the Enel Group, in Brazil, and 8 fatalities involving contractors (5 in Brazil, 1 each in Italy, Spain and Colombia). The causes of these 9 fatalities are mainly of electrical type.\n\nIn 2020 there were 3 High Consequence Injuries involving Enel Group employees and 20 involving contractors, mainly of mechanical type.\n\nEnel has a specific injuries management policy (Policy 106 \u201cClassification, communication, analysis and reporting of incidents\u201d) that defines roles and methods employed to guarantee prompt communication of incidents, ensuring the related causes analysis process, definition of improvement plans, and monitoring of the associated actions depending on the event type. The criteria prescribed by Policy 106 are applicable not only to injuries of high industrial significance but also to minor events, including those not involving personal injuries (near misses). Therefore, all fatalities or severe injuries (or events that could have potentially caused a fatality or severe injury) involving Enel people or the personnel of contractor companies, are analyzed by a group of experts. The improvement actions identified are constantly monitored and followed until the time of completion. If the event analysis reveals serious safety breaches by contractor companies, suitable provisions are adopted (contract termination, suspension of qualification, etc.).\n\nIn 2020 the Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) activities also continued with 184 ECoS that were performed with the aid of digital remote control solutions, in spite of the emergency context determined by the Covid-19 pandemic. The purpose of the ECoS is to assess adequacy of the organization and processes implemented in a specific operational area. These checks are carried out by expert HSEQ personnel external to the operating units affected by the investigation, assisted by technical profiles specialized in the specific field of activity.\nA specific \u201cHSE Terms\u201d document has been prepared and attached to all contracts since last year; the document in question must be signed by contractors when the works are awarded. The document, which is the same throughout the entire Group, defines the obligations in relation to health, safety and environmental aspects that the contractor must respect, placing the same obligation on its subcontractors. Any violation of the contractual conditions in question will produce specific penalties up to termination of the contract and/or suspension of qualification.\n\nThe Contractor Assessments also continued in 2020, which are specific assessments regarding safety issues carried out on the premises of the suppliers as well as at their job sites. In spite of the Covid-19 emergency, 1,185 Contractor Assessments were carried out in total for the different Enel Business Lines and Countries and Regions. The assessments are carried out during the qualification phase for each new vendor, or in cases in which criticalities emerge (severe injuries or fatalities) or low SMP rating scores. 2020 was also the year for additional extension and development of a structured and \u2018data-driven\u2019 approach for supplier assessment, also thanks to the safety metric that was defined for measuring the managerial and operational performance of companies. The Contractors Safety Index (CSI), which is an indicator based on the detection in the field of non-conformities, the number of injuries and their relative severity, has been applied extensively as an indicator used to detect faint signs and operational criticalities of contractors, so prevention can be selectively focused on the most critical companies and to make it possible to perform an objective assessment and implement consequent management for our suppliers. Periodic multidisciplinary meetings (Evaluation Groups), with the purpose of evaluating the safety performance of suppliers, were held in all the Business Lines and Countries and Regions in order to define targeted actions and customized accompaniment and support plans for companies to ensure that the desired safety standards will be reached.\n\nSafety in contract processes\n\nSafety is integrated in tender processes and the performance of companies is monitored both on a preliminary level, by means of the qualification system, and during contract execution through a large number of control processes and tools such as the Supplier Performance Management tool (SPM).\n\nInfrastructure safety and technological innovation\n\nEnel views technological innovation as a valid tool capable of improving a large number of processes from the H&S perspective. Several innovation projects on safety proceeded and various new projects were launched in 2020 in order to improve processes, starting from personnel training, continuing with the implementation of preventive and protective measures, up to the execution and analysis of corrective checks.\n\nPersonal voltage detectors, i.e. portable devices designed to identify electrical voltage on low- and medium-voltage power lines located at operationally significant distances from the worker but not necessarily involved in the activity in progress, have been adopted in the Infrastructure and Networks area. Promoted initiatives include an application that uses uploaded confirmation photos to guarantee that all activities calling for preparatory electrical disconnection of live parts have been carried out in full compliance with the globally adopted rules to ensure complete safety. Within the scope of the \u201cIntrinsic Safety\u201d program, which was implemented with synergy and co-design between various Enel Global Business Lines and Holding Functions, many innovative projects were created in 2020, such as:\n\n- \u201cAI4Lifting\u201d, which uses Artificial Intelligence to detect any potential situations of danger when handling loads;\n- \u201cSmart Access\u201d, a hardware and software system for managing accesses to work areas in order to provide access only to authorized personnel, while also offering support to guarantee the correct fulfilment of the safety standards and procedures during the various work phases;\n- \u201cHop Safe\u201d, a system that allows personnel to use a ladder when working at a height only when they are properly connected to the life line.\n\nInnovative solutions are currently being developed in the area of HMI (Human-Machine Interaction) to prevent the risk of accidental impacts with moving work equipment or with underground service lines, and for the monitoring of health conditions during work activities, in order to prevent and/or quickly manage potential situations of danger and/or emergency.\n\nHealth\n\nThe Enel Group has defined a structured health management system based on preventive measures, to develop a corporate culture oriented towards the promotion of mental-physical health, organizational well-being and balance between the professional and personal spheres. In this context, the Group carries out global and local awareness raising campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles, sponsors screening program aimed at preventing the onset of illnesses and guarantees the availability of medical services. An initiative for strengthening the digitalization of the employee health surveillance process was started in Italy during the year, which involves the introduction of an IT tool.\nthat manages medical records. This will provide benefits in terms of efficiency and document archiving, and will make it possible to monitor health parameters in an aggregated and anonymous manner.\n\nFurthermore, a policy is planned on a global level for the prevention of local diseases and to provide support in the case of illness or injuries while abroad. There is also a smartphone application that provides indications about travel information, vaccination guidelines and a global insurance policy for all personnel travelling abroad, which also includes health coverage in the case of epidemics and pandemics. In relation to the injury phenomenon, apart from implementing plans designed to reduce the frequency to zero, it is planned to adopt a psychological support program for employees who have suffered severe injuries, together with their families, in order to assist them from the time of the event up to the return to normality.\n\nConstant monitoring of epidemiological and health trends is carried out within the perimeter of the Enel Group, with the aim of implementing plans composed of preventive measures and measures to protect the health of employees and anyone working for the Group, on both a local and global level. A listening and psychological support service was started during this year which will remain active independently of the health emergency, the purpose of which is to provide employees with a customized help program in an anonymous, free and confidential manner.\n\nMoreover, the Enel Group implements a systematic and continuous process for identifying and evaluating correlated work stress risks, in compliance with the \u201cStress at Work Prevention and Well-being at Work Promotion\u201d Policy. This allows prevention, identification and management of stress in work situations that can affect individuals and more extensive areas of the organization, supplying also a series of indications aimed at promoting a culture of organizational well-being.\n\nThe Group provides its people with specific conventions that provide ready access to: medical and healthcare services, assistance actions for persons with disabilities or in emergency situations, and specific preventive medicine initiatives.\n\nFinally, with regard to the Covid emergency, a new Covid-19 Global Insurance Group policy was published since March 2020, which provides compensation to Group employees who had to be hospitalized for at least two nights or who required hospitalization in intensive care after testing positive for Covid-19.\n\nDevelopment of safety culture: training and information\n\nSeveral health and safety communication campaigns were carried out in the year concerning areas of specific attention for the Company, based both on the publication of information on the company intranet, and on specific services on Enel TV and Enel Radio.\n\nOverall, 49,307 Enel employees received approximately 980 thousand training hours in 2020, in addition to information and training activities on safety, with the purpose of increasing the know-how and specific skills of workers throughout the Group.\n\nThe SHE project was further implemented in 2020, what started as an initiative shared among all the countries has become a real company process that Enel intends to promote in four dimensions, as illustrated below.\n\nFirst of all \u2018HSE without borders\u2019, a true example of integration. Reducing distances to share topics, solutions and good practices, promoting integration and co-design on all levels through feasible collaboration.\n\nRethinking our assets and processes from a safety point of view. \u201cIntrinsic safety equipment, tools and processes\u201d. Mapping and adapting plants, equipment and work methods to limit or eliminate the possibility of errors, thereby increasing the level of safety.\n\nParticular attention is also placed on Enel suppliers with the \u2018Partnership for safety, health and the environment\u2019, which focuses on assisting Enel partners in adapting their company standards regarding HSE with assessments and collaboration opportunities in the field. Furthermore, informational meetings are planned for all employees of the contracting companies who access Group plants before carrying out their work.\n\nThe purpose of these meetings is to inform the workers of the specific risks connected with the work environment and of any additional risks related to other activities carried out in the same environments. These meetings, which only provide information, involve construction work sites and operation and maintenance activities, and are included among the consolidated risk prevention and protection activities.\n\nFinally, SHE Factory, created with the precise objective of promoting a way to work that is safer for (and between) Enel people, also including suppliers, and more sustainable as regards the environment. It is a model that aims to spread a different cultural approach to HSE topics by everyone, and at all professional levels, also by using training projects and learning processes not only based on technical aspects, but also so-called soft skills.\n\nCommunications on the global level in relation to health and safety were focused on topics concerning personal health and the most common pathologies.\n\nSafety of communities and third parties\n\nEnel\u2019s installed plants are built in compliance with legislative prescriptions and the rules of best technical practice. Plants, machines and work equipment are subject to systematic and periodic checks and maintenance activities to guarantee correct operation in compliance with regulations and in accordance with the adoption of the best standards.\n\nIn order to guarantee health and safety of the community and reduce the impact of the typical activities of the Company\u2019s generation process on the external environment, the Company carries out monitoring campaigns such as measurement of the electromagnetic fields of power networks, noise levels, vibration and dust created by the electrical machines of power plants and distribution and transformer substations. Also the following environmentally significant factors are monitored: atmospheric emissions and air quality, effluent discharge into surface waters, water quality, production, reuse and disposal of wastes, soil quality, biodiversity impacts.\n\nConsiderable attention has been devoted to preventing harmful events involving members of the public who accidentally come into contact with electricity networks due to activities such as job sites near transmission lines or sports and leisure pursuits (fishing, flying kites, etc.). A large number of awareness campaigns have been conducted, addressed both to the general public and to specific categories (construction companies, sports associations, etc.).\nEmergencies management\n\nEnel has a common crisis and critical events management system across the various countries in which the Group is present. This global management system involves evaluation of the impact caused by critical events by means of a standard reference scale with three levels. High-impact crises are managed centrally, while medium- or low-impact crisis situations are managed within the specific organization in the individual countries.\n\nHigh-impact crises (\u2018Group Red Code\u2019) are addressed by creating a central crisis committee in the Security Control Room at the Vela Regina Margherita headquarters in Rome, supplying support 24/7 for communication and coordination of information flows. Moreover, the crisis committee defines strategies and actions to deal with critical events and coordinates all actions designed to restrict damage to the Enel Group\u2019s property, profitability and reputation.\n\nEnel Spa has a Security unit in the Holding\u2019s People and Organization Function, aimed at defining strategies and guidelines on matters of security, reporting to top management and promoting sharing of best practices. Also, a travel safety process has been set up in order to protect Enel people travelling in different countries, supplying information and communications on destination countries, indicating conditions that can constitute health and safety risks of travelers (e.g. political turmoil, terror attacks, crime, health threats, etc.), the guidelines and conduct to follow, and activation of the necessary safety measures with regard to the level of risk identified for the destination country.\n\nAt the end of 2020, in the area of the Holding\u2019s HSEQ Function, the HSE Emergency Management unit was created, which focuses on Health, Safety and Environment emergencies in order to ensure integration and continuous alignment when defining strategies and when managing emergency events on a Business Line and Country level. In fact, the progression of the pandemic and its spreading all over the world has raised awareness that the emergency will be continuing for a long period of time and that it is therefore necessary to pass from a management approach based on global and local task forces to the definition of an HSE emergency management process that is integrated in the company organization, through the establishment of a dedicated unit.\n\nNuclear policy\n\nIn the context of its operations in the field of nuclear technologies, Enel has made a public commitment, in the role of shareholder, to guarantee that a clear nuclear safety policy is adopted in its atomic energy plants and that the plants are managed in accordance with criteria capable of assuring the absolute priority of safety and protection of workers, the community and the environment.\n\nFurther details are available on the Enel website (https://www.enel.com/investors/sustainability-performance/enel-and-nuclear).\n\nIndustrial relations on health and safety issues\n\nIn order to consolidate the culture of safety and promote the adoption of behaviors that are consistent with company policies, Enel supports social dialogue and participation of workers\u2019 representatives. Joint committees have been set up for this purpose in the main countries in which Enel is present, dedicated to monitoring the issues and projects concerning workers\u2019 health and safety on the national level and also in terms of Business Lines. In Italy, in implementation of the matters provided for by the national trade union agreement on the \u201cItalian model of Enel Italia industrial relations\u201d, there has been a bilateral commission on workplace safety and protection policies in force since 2012. The commission examines the main projects aimed at improving safety standards, training projects, and preventive initiatives. In 2013, the Enel Global Framework Agreement created an analogous bilateral commission at the Group level, which defined a \u201cjoint recommendation\u201d concerning health and safety standards applicable in all Enel countries. Negotiations are in progress to renew the Enel Global Framework Agreement.\n\nThe following details concern the commissions that operate in the main countries on the national and/or local levels.\n\n| Country | Joint committees for health and safety |\n|---------|---------------------------------------|\n| Italy   | Apart from the bilateral commission on safety policies and workplace protection set up in 2012, there are two committees working for Infrastructure and Networks and for Generation. Periodic meetings are also organized, involving the employer, the prevention and protection service manager, the medical officer and the workers\u2019 safety representatives. The meetings are held at least once a year. |\n| Russia  | Every power plant in Russia has a health and safety committee. Each organizational unit has a worker representative for issues concerning occupational health and safety, with a total of 33 representatives reporting to company managers and union organizations. |\n| Romania | In compliance with legislative provisions, there is an Occupational Safety and Health Committee (COSHH) comprised of representatives appointed by the trade organizations who represent the workers for each company (worker representatives) on the one hand, and, on the other, a number of people representing the employer equal to the number of worker representatives. The occupational health physician is required to participate in the COSHH meetings. |\n| Spain   | The Comisi\u00f3n de participaci\u00f3n y control has been set up on the national level, while the local level is handled by Comit\u00e9s de seguridad y salud territoriales. |\n| Argentina | The power plants have bilateral committees responsible for health and hygiene issues, which meet once a month or once every two months. The agreement does not specify the frequency with which the meetings are held. |\n| Chile   | All generation centers with more than 25 workers have Comit\u00e9s paritarios de higiene y seguridad, which make decisions concerning occupational health and safety by means of an annual operating plan. These committees meet once a month. |\n| Peru    | We have bilateral committees (workers and company representatives) that approve occupational health and safety policies according to law. |\n| Brazil  | The Comisi\u00f3n Interna de prevenci\u00f3n de accidentes has been established at all sites, which is comprised of company representatives and worker representatives; the committee focuses on the creation of accident prevention initiatives. |\n| Colombia | Two joint committees have been set up (COPASST), one for networks and one for generation, with the role of promoting the application of occupational medicine legislation. |\n### At a Glance\n\n#### Trend Topic\n\n**Our ESG performance**\n\n#### Appendix\n\n**Appendix**\n\n---\n\n### Our ESG performance\n\n#### Economic and financial value creation\n\n#### Environmental sustainability\n\n#### Environmental management\n\n---\n\n### Priorities\n\n#### Plan\n\n#### SDG\n\n---\n\n### Target\n\n#### Activities\n\n| Activities | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Reduction of specific SO2 emissions | -85% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | -88% compared to 2017 (0.10 g/kWh) | ACHIEVED | -94% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | E | 10 |\n| Reduction of specific NOx emissions | -50% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | -54% compared to 2017 (0.36 g/kWh) | ACHIEVED | -70% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | E | 10 |\n| Reduction of specific dust emissions | -95% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | -96% compared to 2017 (0.05 g/kWh) | ACHIEVED | -98% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | E | 10 |\n| Reduction of specific water extraction | -50% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | -55% compared to 2017 (0.20 l/kWh) | ACHIEVED | -65% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | E | 10 |\n| Reduction of waste products | -40% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | -87% compared to 2017 (1.2 Mt) | ACHIEVED | -87% in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2017 | E | 10 |\n\n---\n\n### \u201cZERO Plastic\u201d project\n\n- Launch of the programme to reduce single-use plastics across all Countries and Regions and definition of an overall target by 2022\n- Enel sites in Italy: -91% by 2021\n- Enel sites in Spain: -65% by 2021\n\n#### ON-PLAN\n\n- Analysis of the solutions developed in the new scenario impacted by the current pandemic, and assessment of the potential for reducing the use of single-use plastics\n- Definition of the integration programme in all of the Group\u2019s countries and regions with a focus on offices\n- Enel sites in Italy: -79% by 2023\n- Enel sites in Spain: -75% by 2023\n\n---\n\n### Minimising the impact of Enel sites on habitats and species included on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)\n\n- Improving company processes for risk assessment and biodiversity management on plants and assets\n- Establishing Group indicators and adopting biodiversity performance monitoring\n- Internal awareness-raising initiatives on biodiversity protection, reaching 100% of the Enel population\n- Increasing the partnership framework and stakeholder engagement\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n1.

Reduction calculated based on office occupancy and pandemic contingencies.\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\n\nThe protection of the environment and of natural resources, as well as the need to combat climate change are, for us, strategic factors in the planning, operation and development of our activities for promoting sustainable economic development in the communities where we work, as well as key factors for consolidating the Company\u2019s leadership in the energy markets.\n\nFor this reason, as early as 1996 we adopted a Group environmental policy, updated in 2018, that is applied throughout the Company\u2019s structure and in the entire value chain. The full policy content is shown below in the present chapter.\n\nEnvironmental governance\n\nTo ensure constant oversight and monitoring, activities of environmental relevance are managed through a widespread and harmonized organization, as regards the general guidelines for environmental policy, from a central Holding unit, which, in the Business Lines and Global Service Functions, is flanked by structures, dedicated personnel and managers who ensure adoption of the common strategic lines and guidelines. In particular, Staff Functions coordinate the management of relevant environmental issues, ensuring the necessary specialist support in line with Holding guidelines, whilst the operating units manage specific aspects related to the various industrial sites. To support the environmental performance monitoring activities and the definition of improvement plans for the operating units of the Business Lines, in 2019 the Group environmental reporting system, Enel Data on Environment (EDEN), was renewed and was further updated in 2020.\n\nEnvironmental Management Systems\n\nApplication of the ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management Systems (EMS) is one of the strategic tools defined by the environmental policy. At the end of 2020, EMSs were activated and certified on almost all operating assets, while for the new plants and installations preparatory activities for certification are progressively planned. Given the complexity and variety of activities carried out in the Group, an ISO 14001:2015 certified modular approach, with the definition of a management system at Holding level, and which provides direction and coordination to the Business Lines on environmental themes, has been adopted. Each Business Line has launched its own EMS focused on specific activities. Furthermore, the main thermal and geothermal production sites in Europe also have EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) registration. In compliance with the four fundamental pillars underpinning our environmental policy, specifically in terms of our commitment towards \u201cprotecting the environment by preventing adverse effects\u201d, the Group \u201cStop Work Policy\u201d asks all people who work for us to intervene promptly and stop working when risks arise that affect not only their own health and safety but also the environment.\n\nTraining is one of the strategic objectives of the Group\u2019s policy and forms an integral part of the EMS. In 2020, around 48,000 hours were dedicated to training, an increase of 46% approximately compared to 2019, especially in Italy and South America, and which concerned, for example, topics on water and waste management, environmental restoration and prevention activities. Moreover in 2020, an environmental training program commenced targeted at increasing the expertise and responsibility for operations of technical personnel, in order to ensure the same skills and operational standards in all countries where the Group operates. The program will continue throughout 2021. Awareness raising days were also held on the topics of the energy transition, environmental risk management, and the value of correct management of environmental data.\n\nWhy is it important for our stakeholders?\n\nBecause every power generation plant is the guest of a local area. Protecting its biodiversity and its natural capital means respecting the community with which it cohabits.\n\nWhy is it important for Enel?\n\nBecause only an electric power plant that sits harmoniously in the natural context in which it is located is truly sustainable and capable of generating value in the long term.\nENVIRONMENT POLICY\n\nStrategic factors in the planning, implementation and development of Enel\u2019s operations include protecting the environment and natural resources, tackling climate change, and contributing towards sustainable economic development. These are also key factors in consolidating the Company\u2019s position as leader in the energy market.\n\nEnel has had a Group environmental policy in place since 1996, which is based on four fundamental principles mental:\n\n1. Protecting the environment by preventing impacts;\n2. Improving and promoting the environmental sustainability of products and services;\n3. Creating shared value for the Company and stakeholders;\n4.

Assessing further voluntary environmental actions and practices, including where not legally required.\nEnvironmental risk analysis\n\nIn order to identify and minimize environmental risks related to our activities, we also apply a series of important assessment and intervention tools at Group level working in synergy to protect the environment.\n\n- **Group Policy for the classification and analysis of environmental accidents**. Environmental accidents are classified according to their type and relevance. This classification is based on their possible impact on the environmental matrices and on any potentially sensitive targets (ecosystems and protected areas), in addition to their negative impact on the organization itself. The policy sets out the communication procedures for such events, analyzing their causes, and monitoring subsequent corrective actions and improvements in accordance with their classification and relevance.\n\n- **Policy for assessing environmental risks and opportunities**. The policy applies to all operating sites and to the staff functions in all geographical areas in which we operate, with a unique model of shared, organic and homogeneous analysis. The analysis ensures efficient identification, classification and management of risks and opportunities for the environment and for the organization, with an approach progressively encompassing the entire life cycle, and which involves the assessment of the interactions with environmental matrices and of the checks adopted for regulatory compliance of more stringent voluntary targets of continuous improvement, as well as environmental aspects linked to governance and strategic guidelines carried out by the central Functions of the organization.\n\n- **Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) Policy**. The ECoS is a tool for the planning and carrying out of on-site visits by teams of inter-divisional experts to support operating plants and facilities. This initiative aims to set out an initiative targeted at the definition of improvement plans and the sharing of best practices. In 2020, the different Business Lines across all the Countries in which the Group operates realized over 60 ECoS with a focus on the environment. See also the chapter \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d.\n\n- **Environmental assessment of suppliers**. In consideration of the importance that suppliers have in determining the overall environmental performances of the Company, we have adopted an environmental assessment procedure of suppliers that is structured and homogeneous for the entire Group, and that can be activated in the supplier qualification phase, specifically for those providing environmentally critical risk activities, or following important environmental events, for the identification of improvements under the responsibility of the supplier itself.\n\n**ERA \u2013 Environmental Risk Assessment**\n\nDuring 2020 the process of environmental risk analysis was completely digitalized through the realization and adoption at Group level of an IT tool named ERA (Environmental Risk Assessment).\n\nOn the one hand, ERA facilitates the application of a common taxonomy and methodology in the entire Enel Group for the classification and assessment of environmental risks (and opportunities) and, on the other, the integration of the risk control process and that of continuous improvement of environmental performances between the different levels of the organization.\n\nThe model means that risk analysis can be carried out at single unit level (plant, local district or workplace), through the assessment of the interaction of operating assets and of processes with environmental matrices, and to assess, therefore, the robustness of the controls adopted (both mandatory and voluntary), in line with the provisions of the Environmental Management Systems. At global and Country level, the analysis is propaedeutic to the detection of the most significant risks, as well as to the aggregate assessment using synthetic risk indicators, thanks to which it is possible to define a prioritization of interventions and of resources for the definition of specific plans. Thanks to the evidence emerging from the analysis of any possible environmental accidents and from periodical environmental visits to the different sites (ECoS), it is possible to monitor and update the assessments made and the efficiency of the actions adopted.\n\n**Emissions**\n\nThe reduction of the environmental impacts associated with the operation of our plants is a strategic objective for us, through the application of the best available technologies and of best international practices. Specifically, with reference to CO\u2082 emissions and to the main pollutants, during 2020 there was a net reduction both of total and specific values, was mainly due to lower thermal production, in particular coal, compared to 2019: this was on account of the sale of the Russian coal-fired plant at Retinskaya on October 1, 2019 and its ensuing exit from the scope of consolidation, and to the shutdown of the Tarapac\u00e1 group in Chile on December 31, 2019, as well as a decrease in production of the plants still active. Furthermore, in 2020, in line with Company\u2019s process of decarbonization, the coal-fired plants of Compostilla and Teruel in Spain were shut down, as were unit 2 of the Brindisi plant in Italy and unit 1 of the Bocamina plant in Chile.\n\n**Greenhouse gas emissions**\n\nThe reduction of greenhouse gases is one of the priority objectives indicated in our environmental policy as well as in the Group strategy, through the progressive growth of renewable energy sources generation capacity and improvement of the efficiency of infrastructures. In particular, greenhouse gases from industrial activities can be mainly traced back to carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) emissions from thermal plants and to a lesser extent to sulfur hexafluoride (SF\u2086) losses across the distribution network. Specific CO\u2082 emissions (Scope 1) in 2020 amounted to 214 t/kWh (-28% compared to 2019), in line with the target certified by the Science Based Targets initiative which the Group has set for 2030. For further details on greenhouse gas emissions, please refer to the chapter \u201cNet-zero ambition\u201d.\n\n**SO\u2082, NO\u2093 and dust**\n\nOur commitment to improving the air quality in areas where we operate is testified by the great care we pay to the constant reduction of the main atmospheric pollutants associated with thermal production: sulfur oxides (SO\u2082), nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093) and dust. To this end, over the years various measures have been taken to improve environmental performances on specific thermal plants, resulting from an analysis, beginning from best technologies and international practices, then taking into consideration factors such as context and local priorities, the plant\u2019s operation mode, seen as annual operating hours, current plant configuration and the prospects of productive life. During 2020, total interventions amounted to 54 million euros, of which 6.5 million euros on coal-fired plants. The reduction of investments on coal-fired plants, compared to previous years, is linked to the progressive strategy of abandoning this technology.\n\nWith respect to actual data in 2017, beginning last year the Group set further targets related to the reduction of specific emissions of atmospheric pollutants by 2030, further strengthened this year. These new targets see specific emissions in 2030 of 0.05 g/kWh for SO\u2082 (-94% compared to 2017), 0.24 g/kWh for NO\u2093 (-70% compared to 2017) and 0.005 g/kWh for dusts (-98% compared to 2017). Pollutant reduction trends and targets are consistent with Group decarbonization targets, in as much as they are linked to the same industrial plans.\n\nEmission measurements are carried out in compliance with each country\u2019s regulatory framework and, in the majority of large plants, a measurement system is used that can assess compliance with the limits in real time. Its reliability is guaranteed by accredited certifying entities and through assessments carried out by inspection authorities.\n\nIn 2020 emissions were down compared to 2019 for all the main pollutants in both absolute and specific terms, due to the already mentioned lower production from fossil fuels and the performance of multiple efficiency enhancing measures implemented on all plants in operation. Specifically, SO\u2082 emissions totaled 0.10 g/kWh (-88% compared to 2017), NO\u2093 emissions 0.36 g/kWh (-54% compared to 2017) and dust 0.01 g/kWh (-96% compared to 2017).\nEnergy efficiency in production processes\n\nUsing energy in an efficient manner is, for us, a constant commitment in the entire value chain, from generation to distribution; in particular, the strategy of reduction of consumption entails investments to increase the energy efficiency of our activities, from actions to maximize the efficiency of generation plants (thermal, nuclear and renewables) to the operational improvement of the distribution grid, but also through the diffusion of greater awareness in behaviors (see also the chapter \u201cNet-zero ambition\u201d).\n\n2020 saw the continuation of process efficiency activities, followed by the implementation of operational excellence programs across the various Business Lines. Energy consumption is mainly related to fossil fuels to operate thermal power plants and by uranium to operate nuclear power plants. A limited amount of energy consumption is related to the operation of renewable energy power plants (biomass and geothermal).\n\nThe overall direct consumption of fuels for the production of electricity is 1,004,052 TJ (23.9 Mtoe). During the year there was a 21% reduction compared to 2019 of energy consumption of fuel, a difference that reflects the important decrease of generation from coal with the consequent lower contribution of this fuel. The Group\u2019s energy intensity, which provides a measure of its operational efficiency, in 2020 was 4.7 MJ/kWh, down approximately 13% compared to the previous year.\n\nReduction of our main emissions\n\n- **SO\u2082**: -94%\n- **NO\u2093**: -70%\n- **DUST**: -98%\n\n### SPECIFIC EMISSIONS OF SO\u2082 (g/kWh)\n\n| Year | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2023 | 2030 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 0.84 | 0.75 | 0.59 | 0.10 | 0.08 | 0.05 |\n| Reduction | -94% | -94% | -94% | -94% | -94% | -94% |\n\n### SPECIFIC EMISSIONS OF NO\u2093 (g/kWh)\n\n| Year | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2023 | 2030 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 0.79 | 0.72 | 0.60 | 0.36 | 0.28 | 0.24 |\n| Reduction | -70% | -70% | -70% | -70% | -70% | -70% |\n\n### DUST (g/kWh)\n\n| Year | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2023 | 2030 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 0.27 | 0.17 | 0.12 | 0.01 | 0.01 | 0.005 |\n| Reduction | -98% | -98% | -98% | -98% | -98% | -98% |\n\n### FUEL CONSUMPTION BY PRIMARY SOURCE (,000 TJ)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 1,488 | 1,204 | 949 |\n\n### ENERGY INTENSITY (MJ/kWh)\n\n| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 6.0 | 5.4 | 4.7 |\n\nAs per last year, again in 2020 a variety of initiatives were undertaken in terms of energy efficiency in all Business Lines, both for operating assets and in buildings.\nEnergy efficiency in the management of buildings\n\nFor us, the strategy of energy efficiency is not limited to operating sites, but also extends to the environmental sustainability of Company administrative offices. For this reason, we have equipped ourselves with a workplace handbook that collects the measures and technical references considered useful and necessary for the construction of workplaces. The fundamental principle that guides the creation of a workplace environment is, for us, care for people and for the broadest ecosystem in which they work, including also the environmental, social and economic context. Indeed, sustainability represents a fundamental driver for the design of our plants and offices, as well as for their use and end-of-life management and, through models such as that of the circular economy, sustainability also contributes to an improvement in the quality of the external ecosystem by reducing environmental impacts and creating both economic and social value. For the purposes of ensuring the environmental sustainability of a building over its entire life cycle, the following criteria are adopted:\n\n- use of circular materials and products that have low and sustainable emissions, and that come with environmental certifications, among which Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and Cradle to Cradle (C2C);\n- minimization of environmental impacts through the reduction of waste production and its reuse, sustainable management of water resources, containment and control of atmospheric emissions, air quality and noise;\n- identification of methods for the extension of the useful life of buildings and plants, through the modular design of spaces, which allows their reconfiguration to meet new needs;\n- an increase of the use factor of the building and of equipment present, through mechanisms of sharing and product as a service;\n- achievement, for the realization of new buildings or the restructuring of our existing buildings, of LEED and WELL certifications. In the case of leased buildings, LEED certification is required of the property owner.\n\nWith particular reference to energy efficiency, where possible the following criteria are adopted:\n\n- installation of all the renewable energy sources available (photovoltaic, solar thermal, groundwater, cogeneration/intercalorisation) and the possibility of connecting to district heating and district cooling systems;\n- use of technologies that facilitate qualification of the building as a \u201cNearly Zero Energy Building\u201d, or better;\n- adoption of technologies with high energy efficiency (for example, Energy Star certification), favoring, where possible, technologies and equipment that ensure outputs which are over 25% higher than the market standard;\n- reduction of energy consumption for the production of domestic hot water with the use of renewables such as to ensure at least 50% of demand, favoring, where convenient, centralized production systems;\n- adoption of Energy Management Systems that facilitate continuous control of energy consumption.\n\nEnergy efficient products for customers\n\nIn 2020, thanks to interventions of Enel X in relation to efficiency and technological innovation on public lighting systems, in Italy around 58 GWh were saved and in Spain about 29 GWh, corresponding to a total of over 22,000 t of CO\u2082 saved. Again in 2020, around 25,000 high energy efficiency products were installed in Italy, among which condensing boilers, air conditioners and photovoltaic plants with storage systems, and about 55,000 globally between Europe and Latin America, thus avoiding atmospheric emissions of approximately 10,000 t of CO\u2082 in Italy and 15,000 t globally.\n\nWater\n\nThe responsible use of water resources and their protection is vital for the safeguarding of natural ecosystems and for the wellbeing of people that live in them, as well as for the success of our activities. For this reason, it is one of the strategic objectives of our environmental policy, which pursues the adoption of an integrated approach for its optimal management.\n\nThe Group withdraws water primarily for industrial needs and uses it largely for thermal and nuclear generation, for the cooling of thermal cycles, or for atmospheric emission abatement systems. Overall water needs for production are covered through withdrawal from what is referred to as non-scarce sources (seawater) and scarce sources (surface freshwaters, groundwater and water for civil use). Where locally permitted, we use, as incoming water resources for our own processes, treated waste waters, typically supplied by water management consortia. In the international context, since 2014 Enel has been among the endorsing companies of the CEO Water Mandate, an initiative of the UN Global Compact devised to support companies in the development, implementation and disclosure of practices and policies concerning the sustainable management of water.\n\nEfficient use of water resources\n\nIn 2020 the overall withdrawal of process and closed-cycle cooling water was 51.5 Mm\u00b3, a reduction of around 54% compared to 2017, while specific water withdrawal were 0.20 l/kWh (down 55% compared to 2017 and in line with the Group\u2019s water requirement reduction target). This reduction is mainly due to lower thermal production, in particular coal-fired.\n\nWe have energetically pursued the objective of reducing our specific water withdrawals as early as 2010, a commitment renewed in 2020, reducing further the previously set objective up to a reduction of 65% in 2030 compared to the value in 2017. This renewed commitment is based on the results reached and on the Industrial Plan, which provides for efficiency in the use of water in existing thermal plants, the evolution of the energy mix towards renewables, and the progressive reduction of generation from fossil fuels.\n\nThe project for redevelopment of the Enel office in Viale Regina Margherita (Rome, Italy)\n\nThe redevelopment of our Headquarters, which will last some 40 months, involves an overall surface of around 80,000 m\u00b2, with a project based on innovative and sustainable principles and which aims to reduce consumption and increase the wellbeing of our people, through modern and comfortable workplaces. The objective is to design a new \u201cwork space\u201d where people can find the environments and technical solutions to carry out their work to the best of their abilities. Lighting and air conditioning systems, for example, will mean more comfortable conditions, and the quality of the air will be ensured through the realization of bioclimatic glasshouses. The distribution of spaces will ensure alternation of workplace environments with indoor and outdoor green spaces and areas dedicated to psycho-physical wellbeing. The rationalization of layouts will lead to a more space for services for people, including a gym, that will be added to already existing facilities (kindergarten, refreshment areas, auditorium). The level of sustainability and comfort of the building will be submitted for verification to external international certification bodies, with the objective, in particular, of obtaining LEED and WELL certifications respectively for the objectives of sustainability and wellbeing promoted, achieved and perceived.\nThe Group is committed to the progressive reduction of its water needs in all of its production processes, where possible promoting its internal reuse. Among the optimization interventions realized, in some coal-fired power stations the blowdown from the closed-circuit cooling towers is reused in desulphurization plants, whereas the use of crystalizers downstream of the desulphurizers allows for the total recovery of the wastewater. Furthermore, in other plants the storage tanks have been destined to the collection of rainwater, in this way making it available for process needs. Further, we are constantly monitoring all our production sites located in zones at risk of water scarcity (water stressed area) in order to ensure that water resources can be managed as efficiently as possible. Mapping of production sites falling within water stressed areas is done in line with the criteria of GRI 303 (2018) with reference to the conditions of \u201cbaseline\u201d Water Stress indicated by the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Among the sites identified, those defined as \u201ccritical\u201d are those positioned in water stressed areas and which withdraw fresh water for process needs; for these sites, therefore, methods for managing water resources are analyzed for the purposes of reducing consumption. For the periodical washing of the panels, a dry technology was therefore chosen, which uses mechanized brushing systems, thus reducing washing with water to just once a year. Finally, in order to satisfy this latter need, a device was installed that is capable of condensing atmospheric moisture, from which the necessary water is obtained. The adoption of these solutions, with the envisaged execution during the year of five dry washing cycles and only one with water condensed from the air, ensures, on the one hand, the energy efficiency of the plant and, on the other, its complete autonomy from the scarce water resources available, which in this way are reserved for the priority needs of the local population. An equally important challenge is the one we have undertaken on the solar plants in Pampa Norte, Llallakam, Finis Terrae and Cha\u00f1ares (358 MW overall), situated on the Atacama plateau in Chile, a desert zone at a height ranging from 2,400 to 4,200 meters. Here, in 2020, an innovation project was launched for the recovery of water contained in night mists, typical of the area, identifying the most suitable areas for this type of recovery and testing the performances of diverse capture technology solutions. The final objective, even in this case, is to reduce to zero the procurement from natural sources of the water needed for the solar panel washing and to achieve an overproduction to destine towards other uses, to the benefit of the local community. Another simple and brilliant technological solution implemented on all solar plants in Chile has concerned changing their night positioning (solar night parking). Having changed their inclination during the day to maximize exposure to the sun, the solar tracking plants are normally made park in a horizontal position during the night. This is a configuration assigned by international manufacturers in order to reduce exposure to the wind, considered the main risk factor for the plant. But in the Atacama desert, where the main danger is the dust that deposits on the panels, and which reduces their output, this rest position has been set at 45\u00b0; a simple solution, that has significantly reduced the deposit of material and favored the self-washing phenomena that exploit the noteworthy night mist.\n\n\u201cReuse water\u201d, is the watchword in thermal plants\n\nTo search constantly for new solutions to increase the internal reuse of process waters is the renewed commitment requested by the WaVE project from all thermal plants with a view to reducing their water requirements. The Santa Barbara Plant (392 MW) in Italy uses water mainly from the operation of evaporative cooling towers. The availability of water is, however, reduced, depending on the level of the overlying basin of the San Cipriano dam, and the restitution of water to the valley water body is often limited by the need to contain its thermal rise, especially in periods of low flow. The plant has managed to change the functioning of the cooling towers by means of new treatment of the evaporative cycle water and an advanced system of checking and regulation capable of monitoring and controlling the chemical-physical parameters of the recirculated water in real time. These interventions have facilitated an increase in the number of concentration cycles of the evaporative towers, leading to a 15% reduction of make-up water, as well as the flowrate of the water discharged. Similar initiatives are planned for the Pietrafitta (Italy) and Ventania (Peru) plants.\n\nThe Mah\u00f3n plant operates on the island of Minorca, in the Balearic Islands, an area classified as of high water stress due to the scarce availability of the natural resource, together with high demographic pressure. The recent installation on the plant of nitrogen oxide (NO) abatement systems, requiring water to operate, could have increased the impact. The solution adopted, therefore, was that of utilizing the wastewater coming from the nearby municipal wastewater treatment plant to feed the emission abatement system, in this way avoiding withdrawal from scarce water sources and recovering wastewater that would otherwise have been discharged into the sea.\nWastewater treatment optimization and water quality conservation of the destination environment\n\nDownstream of internal recoveries and reuses, wastewater discharged from the plants is returned to the surface water body. Discharge always takes place downstream of a treatment process that removes any pollutants present to a level where they will not have a negative impact on the receiving water body, in compliance with the limits provided for under national regulations and by operating permits.\n\nResponsible and integrated management of the hydro-geological basins to preserve multiple uses of the area and water quality\n\nHydroelectric power plants activities are an important element of water management. These plants, which do not contribute to the Group\u2019s water consumption due to the fact that water withdrawn is completely returned to its source, provide a series of additional services for society compared to the sole generation of renewable energies. In fact, several plants, with a joint management in collaboration with public stakeholders and private entities, manage the water resource for multi-purpose services ranging from flood control, drinking water and irrigation, fire prevention services, to the management of river waste held by retention works, also including numerous cultural, leisure and nature-based initiatives, made possible thanks to the presence of the plants. The reservoirs of hydroelectric plants carry out a vital role in the response to the effects of climate change, increasing the level of protection of the communities subject to increasingly frequent severe flooding and to prolonged periods of drought. Management of the outflows from hydroelectric plants is done through specific programs to ensure the volumes of water required to preserve the ecological state of rivers (minimum vital flows).\n\nInnovative HYDRO projects\n\nWater as an economic and social engine\n\nThe Noguera Pallaresa is a river in north-eastern Spain. It has its source in the Pyrenees and joins the Segre, a tributary of the Ebro. The river flows into the county of Pallars Sobir\u00e0 in the province of Lleida (Catalonia), a region with a strong vocation for tourism, in particular active tourism, water and adventure sports. The success of these sports is made possible thanks to the excellent regulation of the water flow released from the basis of the hydroelectric plants (Torrassa and Llavors\u00ed). 10 and 52 MW respectively) managed by Enel-Endesa on these rivers, ensuring the continuous and safe practice of these activities over the entire tourist season, and the organization of sports events, including national ones.\n\nThe regulation of water for leisure-social uses requires constant supervision of the hydroelectric plants and their hydraulic infrastructures, together with a reliable system of communication between the plants on the Noguera Pallaresa and the Control Centre situated in Lleida. The latter in particular constantly processes evaluation models for the water flowrate required, taking into account the orography and the current flow conditions of the river, the levels of accumulation in the basin that depend on seasonal weather conditions, as well as electricity production needs and the further services guaranteed, such as irrigation and supply of water to the population. From this complex evaluation one can determine, in an entirely automated and remote controlled manner, the volume of water released through the hydroelectric plant turbines, which makes possible the leisure-social use of the river with the contemporaneous generation of 100% renewable electricity.\n\nWaste\n\nOptimal waste management is a strategic objective of our environmental policy, which results in a constant commitment to the reduction of waste production, as well as to the definition of new methods of reuse, recycling and recovery in the perspective of a circular economy.\n\nWith the aim of further strengthening this commitment, we have equipped ourselves with a Group Guideline for Waste Management, which collects the best Company practices deemed fundamental for optimal waste management. In particular, we have set key objectives for the reduction of waste produced, which were further reduced last year (-87% of waste produced in 2030 compared to 2017), equal to 1.2 mil t produced in 2030 (excluded from this target is waste produced from the demolition of decommissioned thermal plants). The reduction method takes into account the results already obtained and of the envisaged evolution of the production mix towards renewable energies, as indicated in the three-year Industrial Plan. The target value includes the technological upgrading of renewables plants, especially wind farms, that will reach end-of-life over the next few years.\n\nDuring 2020, waste production was reduced notably due to the reduction of the contribution of coal ash and desulfurization gypsum: the overall production of which went from 5.0 mil t in 2019 to 0.8 mil t in 2020, with a reduction of 84% (-87% compared to 2017).\n\nWaste sent for recovery within the entire scope of the Company was equal to 65.7%, a strong improvement compared to data for the previous year (24% in 2019), also thanks to the adoption of management measures.\n\nThe commitment to a continuous increase in the percentage recovery of waste products is fundamental to ensure an efficient transition towards a circular economy in order to minimize the exploitation of natural resources in accordance with sustainable objectives and in combating climate change. A fundamental role in this area is played by process waste recovery deriving from thermal power generation. This is significant in terms of both quantities produced and their characteristics. These mainly include coal ash and desulfurization gypsum, reused in building works to produce cement, concrete and bricks according to specific technical and environmental control requirements. In particular, the percentage sent for recovery is, respectively, 74% for coal ash (from 22% in 2019) and 63% for desulfurization gypsum (from 33% in 2019).\n\nMany other maintenance wastes are sent for complete recovery from the thermal plants such as waste oils, a large number of metal waste products, iron, copper, aluminum as well as waste from primary filtration processes in the hydroelectric plants. An important commitment was further undertaken last year to focus on ensuring the recovery of waste produced from demolition and dismantling of end-of-life power plants by using selective demolition techniques of the structures, as well as solutions to make the best use of the materials produced.\n\nIn order to improve further the Group\u2019s performances over the next few years in terms of reduction of waste produced and to increase the rate of recovery, in 2020 Global Power Generation Division launched the project \u201cZERO WASTE\u201d. This project, which has been extended to all the countries in which the Group is present and for each technology and plant, has set the objective of analyzing waste production and management processes, classification and final destination on the basis of regulatory and market conditions in each country, in order to identify points for improvement, and also share and promote the diffusion of best practices and the definition of specific objectives and intervention programs.\n\n| Year | Waste Produced (mil t) |\n|------|------------------------|\n| 2017 | 9.4                    |\n| 2018 | 9.0                    |\n| 2019 | 5.7                    |\n| 2020 | 1.2                    |\n| 2030 | 1.2                    |\n\n[1] These targets exclude waste produced from the decommissioning of thermal plants.\n\n[2] The variations in the percentages of recovery compared to the previous year are due to plants sold or shut down in the period.\nAn increasingly greater effort has in particular been made to acquire, in a life cycle perspective, transparent and comparable information on the environmental impact of the substances and of products procured. Similarly, increasing focus was also placed on the adoption of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) models, including in relation to the post-use phases of the products and services provided. Of particular interest in relation to this was the Enel X commitment using a model integrated with the e-mobility services which ensured a rigorous and efficient end-of-life management of electric car recharging infrastructures (box stations, pole stations, fast-recharge) and their recovery through membership, in Europe, of WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) and battery recovery consortia.\n\nAs regards the waste generated by management of the electricity distribution grid, recovery programs have been reinforced, in particular for dielectric mineral oils, used as insulation in electric equipment, and accumulators, utilized as energy reserve in transformer stations. These oils are sent to companies registered/authorized for regeneration and waste-to-energy treatment, where regeneration is not possible, whereas the end-of-life accumulators are sent to registered/authorized companies that can recover secondary raw materials. Particularly relevant within the scope of the Infrastructure & Networks Business Line are the results obtained by the projects launched across various countries for the sustainable replacement of intelligent first-generation meters and the recovery of their constituent materials.\n\nFor further initiatives, see the chapters \u201cCircular economy\u201d and \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d in the present document. Furthermore, during 2020 we proceeded with our commitment for the elimination of disposable plastic in the Group, initiated with launch of the \u201cZero Plastic\u201d project in June 2019. In parallel with World Environment Day, as of today, the project has involved the main offices (with over 20 employees) in Italy and Spain, and will be extended progressively to all the countries and operating offices, involving, for its success, tens of thousands of people, and placing us in the front line in the global commitment to ensure a better planet. In 2020, the reduction of disposable plastic in offices (including caf\u00e9s, canteens and beverage and food dispensers) can be estimated at 75% in Italy and 64% in Spain compared to the year of reference (2018), thanks to interventions for the replacement of the products supplied. Following the almost exclusive recourse to home working in the large offices, as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not, however, possible to carry out actual measurements. Furthermore, precisely in view of possible specific health security requirements to be adopted as precautionary measures on the return to work of staff, however partial, the targets previously set for the following years have been appropriately updated, while awaiting a complete return to working normality.\n\nThe pandemic linked to Covid has also introduced a new type of waste generated by operating offices kept active for electricity service continuity needs. This new type of waste is made up of mandatory personal protection devices (face masks and disposable gloves) distributed by the Company in all workplaces in order to prevent the spread of the contagion. Management of this waste was based everywhere on principles of maximum precaution, in line with the development of provisions and health requirements issued in the different countries.\n\nSoil, subsoils and subterranean waters\n\nThe protection, monitoring and remediation of the soil, the subsoil and of groundwater in areas where our plants and production and service facilities are, for us, a priority, to ensure the safeguarding of ecosystems and the health of people. The protection of these environment matrices guides all the phases of a plant\u2019s life, from design choices to construction, operation and end-of-life management. Both active and passive protection and safety measures will be used in project phase to prevent any possible form of uncontrolled or accidental contact of potentially polluting substances (fuels, reagents, liquid and waste flows) with soils and subterranean waters. During plant operations, every process will undergo compliance controls as well as ongoing upgrades as required by the Environmental Management Systems to prevent and minimize the risks of any potential environmental contamination. At the same time, control plans are executed to monitor the conditions of the environmental matrices. In the event of an accident, for example the accidental spillage of polluting substances, the timely application of the Stop Work and Emergency Management Policies allows elimination of any possible environmental impact, rigorously complying with the provisions and the legal obligations of the various countries.\n\nAs regards the end of life of power plants, once they have been secured and prior to their being dismantled and the area reassigned to new development projects, we proceed, according to the authorized provisions and legal requirements of the various countries, to verify further the environmental quality of the soil, subsoil and groundwater in the areas where the plant is located. In the case of potential contamination, on the basis of intervention plans shared with the competent authority and supervisory bodies, and turning to specialist and qualified companies, a characterization of environmental matrices in the areas of potential interest is carried out, and, if necessary, securing and subsequent remediation measures capable of quickly restoring a suitable quality status for the planned use of the area (industrial/commercial, residential) are realized. Particular focus is on power plants falling within the large industrial hubs.\n\nIn order to mitigate further the risk connected to the detention and consequent potential release of substances that can have an impact on the environment, numerous projects have commenced for their progressive substitution, for example, verifications on the possible use of vegetable (hence biodegradable) oil, replacing the traditional dielectric oil of mineral origin, as insulation in electric equipment.\n## BIODIVERSITY\n\n| Country | No. of projects | % of projects | Of which voluntary | Monitoring | Restoration (habitat) | Conservation (species) | Species concerned | Ecosystems | No. of species at risk |\n|---------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------|----------------------|\n| Italy   | 25             | 68%           | 5                 | 1          | 19                   |                       |                  |            | 2                    |\n| Spain   | 28             | 89%           | 10                | 8          | 10                   |                       |                  |            | 1                    |\n| Romania | 11             | 91%           | 1                 | -          | 10                   |                       |                  |            | 1                    |\n| Greece  | 3              | -             | 3                 | -          | -                    |                       |                  |            | 2                    |\n| Brazil  | 72             | 14%           | 52                | 16         | 4                    |                       |                  |            | 6                    |\n| Chile   | 16             | 25%           | 11                | 4          | 1                    |                       |                  |            | 2                    |\n| Colombia| 12             | 25%           | 3                 | 5          | 4                    |                       |                  |            | 3                    |\n| Argentina| 1              | -             | -                 | 1          | -                    |                       |                  |            | -                    |\n| Peru    | 3              | -             | 3                 | -          | -                    |                       |                  |            | 1                    |\n| South Africa | 4 | - | 2 | 2 | - | | | | 2 |\n| North America | 5 | 20% | 4 | 1 | - | | | | 2 |\n| Panama  | 2              | -             | -                 | 2          | -                    |                       |                  |            | -                    |\n| Guatemala| 1              | -             | 1                 | -          | -                    |                       |                  |            | -                    |\n| Mexico  | 3              | -             | 2                 | 1          | -                    |                       |                  |            | 1                    |\n| Russia  | 1              | -             | -                 | -          | 1                    |                       |                  |            | -                    |\n| TOT     | 187            | 37%           | 97                | 41         | 49                   |                       |                  |            | 6                    |\n\nThe Red List, compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), provides information on the conservation status of various species. Near Least (LC)\nProtection of biodiversity is one of the strategic objectives of our environmental policy and is regulated by a specific policy adopted since 2015 and which defines the guidelines in the entire Group.\n\nWe have consolidated experience in the management and protection of biodiversity on our production sites, an activity which over the past few years has been focused on the renewables segment and on grids in an increasingly large number of countries. In the Group\u2019s plants and installations, with a long-term presence in the area, vast scale monitoring continues in order to prevent impacts on ecosystems. In relation to new plants, and in particular renewable ones, the potential exposure to a biodiversity risk is highlighted during the feasibility analysis phase, taking into account the geographic closeness of the sites to protected or important biodiversity areas, and the potential presence of endangered species. This evaluation is part of a more extensive analysis for the application of the \u201cCreating Shared Value\u201d model through which the Company engages with the socio-economic and environmental requirements of the territory, defining the project to create long-term values for itself and for the local communities. Once in operation, protection of biodiversity becomes an integral part of environmental management, through periodical management for the checking of impacts highlighted in authorization phase. This is also the phase in which the plant consolidates its relationship with the local area and where initiatives are developed, such as voluntary projects, to safeguard local species based on the knowledge of the environment surrounding the site.\n\nIn addition, the Group brings forward a series of innovative activities targeted at improving the integration of renewable energy plants with the environment and the landscape, for example through the use of natural solutions based on mixes of deep rooting seeds easily integrated in different climates, aimed at improvement of the quality of soils where the plants are situated and hence to the reduction of hydro erosion and desertification.\n\nFurthermore, we are committed to maintaining the management of biodiversity aligned with the best practices in the sector and, in this perspective, we have equipped ourselves with the Group Guideline that delineates the principles and key procedures for the management of impacts on biodiversity during the entire life cycle of the plants, from the development of new ones to operations and decommissioning.\n\nFurthermore, with the aim of involving and raising awareness among all workers on the topics of protection and conservation of biodiversity, a program of specialist training was launched with the involvement of over 300 people, with different technical profiles and expertise, involved in the management and conservation of the biodiversity in local areas.\n\nIn 2020 we continued with 187 projects for the protection of species and natural habitats over 4 thousand hectares of habitat recovered.\n\nIn particular, Enel is committed to:\n\n- planning for activities that may interfere with species and natural habitats, while respecting the principle of mitigation hierarchy, which is a commitment to avoid and prevent negative impacts on biodiversity through the following actions:\n  - reducing the damage and remedying its effects;\n  - offsetting residual negative impacts;\n  - carrying out work to offset residual impacts while respecting the principle of \u201cno net loss\u201d of biodiversity and where applicable, achieving a positive net balance;\n  - performing Environmental Impact Studies for each new plant, including an assessment of the effects on biotopes, animal and plant species, in order to avoid operating in areas of high natural value, and adopting the best solutions to limit the impact on biodiversity;\n  - collaborating with local communities, research centres and environmental and territorial associations to identify the biodiversity value and develop studies and projects to protect and enhance it;\n  - monitoring the effectiveness of the measures taken to protect and conserve biodiversity, regularly reporting on its biodiversity performance.\n\nThe policy is also available at the following link: https://www.enel.com/investors/sustainability/topics-performance-sustainability/biodiversity.\nRomania: LIFE DANUBE FREE SKY\n\nThe main objective of the LIFE Danube Free Sky project is to reduce the risk from electric lines for birdlife through monitoring and awareness raising, and by means of direct interventions of the electric lines in the areas with the highest environmental value. The project is part of a broad transnational cooperation along one of the most migratory corridors, stopover sites and places for wintering for many bird species in Europe: the Danube Delta. The project commenced in September 2020 and has received funding from the LIFE Program of the EU, involving 14 partners from 7 countries of the Balkans area and Central Eastern Europe, among which research institutes, electricity distribution companies, local administrations and protected natural areas. Through our Romanian Company E-Distributie Dobrogea, we participate in the partnership with activities in the region of Dobrogea, Romania. In particular there will be interventions on 40 km of lines with the insertion of insulating sheaths and other elements to reduce collision with electric lines, in a multi-year program the conclusion of which is predicted for 2026.\n\nBrazil (Rio Grande do Sul): REFORESTATION INDIGENOUS LAND \u2013 IL\n\nOperating the grids at high and medium voltage requires the maintenance of the surrounding areas, with the need to thin vegetation to ensure the safety and accessibility to said areas. For this reason, authorizations in areas of particular environmental value always have more stringent requirements in order to protect habitats and species. This is the case in the Rio Grande do Sul region in Brazil, in which Enel Cien, in line with the requirements set by the Ministry of the Environment, carries out compensation works in the areas of relevance of transmission and distribution lines. Specifically, the interventions envisage forestation with native forest species to protect plant biodiversity in areas protected and inhabited by indigenous populations. Current projects entail the insertion of more than 100,000 specimens to compensate for the activities carried out over the previous five years (from April 2015 to March 2020). In 2020 reforestation projects were already under way on the Rio Grande do Sul with more than 80,000 trees planted to recreate forest habitats for transition between the Mata Atl\u00e2ntica habitat and the biome Pampa (IL Serrinha, Erval Grande, S\u00e3o Luiz Gonzagai. In 2021 further interventions are planned in order to complete the forestation objectives set.\n\nSpain, Italy and Greece: AGRI-VOLTAIC SYSTEMS\n\nIn the area of developing innovative solutions that unite the growth of largescale photovoltaic plants (PV) with the sustainable use of the soil and the protection of biodiversity, the Global Power Generation Division, through Open Innovation, in 2020 launched a parallel experimentation program in Spain, Italy and Greece which involves the best global partners in the world of research, industry, non profit associations and start-ups. It commenced in January 2021. With agri-voltaic systems, we have set ourselves the objective of mitigating the impact of photovoltaic plants in terms of taking up soil, promoting its use with the fine-tuning of agro-livestock solutions that use the free spaces between the lines of panels without any variations to the layout of the plant and to build shared value for local communities in a circular economy perspective. With a multi-stakeholder collaborative approach, better crops are being studied in relation to solar technologies, to environmental conditions and to the method of harvesting agricultural products, involving local farms and strategic players. The final objective is to define optimal models for the integrated and sustainable management of operations and maintenance of PV and agricultural plants. The massive data collection will form the basis of a database to support decision-making for the adoption of the best business model, in relation to solar technology, the climate area and the analysis of the social, economic and environmental context.\n\nBrazil CONSERVATION OF THE JAGUAR (DELFINA WIND FARM)\n\nThe Delfina wind farm in Brazil is set within a priority area for the conservation of biodiversity in the Caatinga biome. Since 2016 a research project has been carried out with our patronage in partnership with federal and state public authorities and with the rural communities to ensure the long-term survival of jaguars of two different species (Panthera onca and Puma concolor) recognized to be at risk of extinction. The aim of the project is to map the areas suitable for the presence of these species and of the critical areas of conflict with human activities that put their conservation at risk. One of the main threats, indeed, is death induced by man due to the depredation of cattle. Through the use of technologies via satellite and GPS collars, the movements of the felines are monitored and interference is mitigated. The project also aims to improve understanding of the behavior in nature of these wild animals; to this end, an environmental education program with 24 seminars and the involvement of six rural communities has made it possible to raise the awareness of over 200 locals of the importance of protecting these species.\n\nOther activities\n\nGreen hydrogen\n\nHydrogen is becoming of renewed importance as a possible energy carrier for the decarbonization of those sectors of the economy that cannot be technically or economically electrified, or what are referred to as the \u2018hard to abate\u2019 sectors, such as the chemical industry, which uses hydrogen as a raw material, industry that needs high temperature heat, or maritime transport or aviation. Green hydrogen is a support for achieving full decarbonization of end-user consumption, and not an alternative to this. Indeed, electrification remains the cheapest and simplest way to decarbonize large portions of total consumption of final energy. The processes of hydrogen production are not, however, all equal in terms of emissions, since they are linked to the use or otherwise of fossil fuels. Only the use of \u2018green hydrogen\u2019, produced using electricity deriving exclusively from renewable energy sources through the process of electrolysis of water, does not entail emissions and is an ideal complement to decarbonization. Heading in this direction are the new industrial strategy for Europe presented by the European Commission in March 2020, followed by the EU communication Hydrogen Strategy, and the creation of the Clean Hydrogen Alliance of July 2020, both communications assign a central role to hydrogen in the energy transition. Beginning from our position of leadership in the production of zero emissions green hydrogen. The green hydrogen produced can then be sold to industrial clients who can thus abate the CO\u2082 emissions of their production processes. A further advantage of this business model is that hydrogen cannot only be used as fuel or as a clean raw material, but can also facilitate a further penetration of renewable energy. Indeed, a solar plant or wind farm coupled with an electrolyzer can provide grid services similar to those of a renewable plant combined with a battery, thus offering greater flexibility to the electric system. There are two possible models of integration under examination: in the first, the electrolyzers are realized at a renewable energy production plant, in a fully integrated system which, however, requires localization in the vicinity of a point of use to make transport less expensive; in the second, the electrolyzer is realized directly by the user of the hydrogen, supplying renewable energy through the electric grid, with the advantage of having lower localization restrictions. The choice of the most suitable model is linked to the conditions of each specific project. With the objective of exploiting the potential for growth of this new sector, we envisage in our development plans the installation of over 2 GW of electrolyzers by 2030, of which 120 MW already in 2023. To achieve these ambitious targets, we have begun to develop projects in different Countries where we are present, including through collaboration with several of the main players active in the field of hydrogen.\nGreen hydrogen: the business value chain\n\nOperative renewable plants or plants in the development phase\n\nAdding an electrolyzer that uses renewable energy to separate water (H\u2082O) into its constituent parts: hydrogen and oxygen\n\nProduction of green hydrogen and, at the same time, a more flexible plant that can provide ancillary services to the grid\n\nSale of the commodity to an industrial off-taker, thereby making production more sustainable\n\nIn Chile, the Group participates in the High Innovative Fuels (HIF) partnership with the Chilean groups AME and ENAP (Empresa Nacional del Petr\u00f3leo), together with Siemens Energy and Porsche. The Group will contribute to the innovative pilot project of HIF for the production of sustainable fuels, focusing on wind energy and on the installation of an electrolyzer for the production of green hydrogen. The electrolyzer powered by wind energy and that feeds the pilot project with green hydrogen will be situated in Cabo Negro, north of Punta Arenas, in the region of Magallanes. The plant should enter into operation in 2022 and will be the largest plant of its type for producing green hydrogen in Latin America.\n\nIn the United States, we and the NextChem branch of the industrial group Maire Tecnimont have signed a memorandum of understanding to sustain the development of green hydrogen in the country. The project, which should be operative by 2023, will convert the renewable energy of one of the solar plants of the Enel Group in the United States into green hydrogen that will power a bioethanol refinery.\n\nIn Italy the Enel Group and the Eni Group are planning to produce green hydrogen by means of electrolyzers powered by renewable energy. The electrolyzers will be located near two Eni refineries that will use them to decarbonize the process. Both projects will be characterized by an electrolyzer of about 10 MW and it is hoped that green hydrogen will begin to be generated by 2022-2023. Again in Italy, we intend also to work with the energy infrastructure company Snam and other players to explore other applications for green hydrogen.\n\nIn Spain, the Enel Group is assessing numerous development projects, including on several existing plants. The most advanced project is that of As Pontes, which will have an electrolyzer of 100 MW and six associated wind farms, with an overall capacity of 611 MW, the construction of which will see the creation of 1,600 jobs during the 18 months of construction. We have also joined the Clean Hydrogen Alliance, promoted by the European Commission, with the aim of promoting green hydrogen and stimulating the realization of projects in order to be able to reach the targets set in the EU Hydrogen Strategy. The organization has seen the adhesion of numerous participants, both public and private, and its division into 6 topic based round tables: we take part in particular in the round table on \u2018hydrogen production\u2019, which aims to identify the types of projects to promote and the current regulatory and economic barriers present.\n\nTo highlight the profuse commitment for the sustainability of mobility through electrification of the vehicle fleet, Enel X has updated the e-mobility Emission Saving tool, the algorithm capable of calculating the quantity of CO\u2082 saved in the use of an electric or electrified vehicle, compared to one powered by a traditional endothermic engine, adding also the calculation of nitrogen oxide (NO\u2093) and particulate matter (PM) avoided. The e-mobility Emission Saving tool is the first algorithm validated by an internationally recognized certifying body (RINA) for this purpose according to principles recognized in regulation UNI EN ISO 14064-2:2019. The need to broaden the algorithm\u2019s calculation perimeter emerged following collaboration with the pharmaceutical company Novartis, which with Enel X has presented a new study on the relationship between pollution and its impact on the health of people.\n\nJanuary 2018 to December 2020 saw over 1.6 million recharges at Enel X stations across Italy, approximately 130 million km were traveled by electric vehicle owners. The kWh delivered from the charging stations is calculated by the EMM system (Electro Mobility Management Platform), the Enel X digital platform that continuously manages information related to the recharging of electric vehicles across Italy, accessible to both public and private parties. The data is transmitted from the fast (JuicePump) and quick (JuicePole and Pole Station) infrastructures equipped with an internal measuring device and from the connected Juiceboxes installed at home. The calculation of CO\u2082 saved and of the other main pollutants linked to mobility (PM, NO\u2093) is a combination of the mean consumptions of vehicles (BEV) or plug-in hybrids (PHEV) only using electric-\nDistribution\n\nIn order to protect the landscape and the local area, Global Infrastructure and Networks has adopted specific strategies to mitigate the environmental impacts of construction activities relating to new grids in addition to upgrades to existing ones. The cabling ratio is the relationship (in percentage terms) between the length of the cable lines and the total length of the lines, showing immediately the mitigation of the environmental impacts of the electric lines. The increase in this index over time is due to an increase in the length of overhead and underground cable lines, reducing the quota of bare conductors, with benefits in terms of the resilience of the grid, curtailing plant-cutting activities and a drastic reduction in the risk of electrocution for birdlife. In 2020, the cabling ratio showed an increase of three decimal points compared to the previous year, attesting itself at 60.4%, thanks also to the noteworthy contribution from the South American companies. As regards the reduction of grid losses, on the other hand, this is guaranteed through interventions which also contribute towards the reduction of CO\u2082 emissions. These actions focus on infrastructures, and aim, for example, at the progressive reduction of single-phase electric lines as well as the construction of new electric lines to lighten the load on the pre-existing ones in addition to the use of low-loss transformers. Other actions include boosting the grid by using conductors with a greater cross-section and re-phasing primary transformer. Finally, the realization of new transformer cabins will help reduce the length of the low-voltage lines which are characterized by higher levels of loss. More broadly, optimizing the grid set-up will allow a significant reduction of its losses. Furthermore, in 2020 the Global Infrastructure and Networks division launched an ambitious environment improvement program, implemented in each country where we are present and which, beginning from an analysis of the most significant aspects on both a global scale and in the context of each country, aims to identify concrete action plans for the purpose of improving environmental performances and increasing environmental sustainability.\n\nEnvironmental legal disputes\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the number of legal proceedings pending was 255 across the whole Group. The main environmental disputes related to Italy, Latin America and Iberia. The total amount of fines issued to Group Companies in 2020 was about 85 million euros. The sum is due to fines received in Spain, mainly related to the distribution activities of Edistribuci\u00f3n Redes Digitales and secondarily to those of Endesa Generaci\u00f3n, and in Brazil for production related activities.\n### Activities\n\n| Activities | 2020-2022 targets | 2020 results | Status | 2021-2023 targets | Tag | SDG |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----|\n| Diversity Policy -

Notably, the shareholder structure at December 2020 is as follows: 62.3% institutional investors, 14.1% retail investors, 23.6% Ministry of the Economy and Finance. Enel\u2019s corporate structure includes the main international investment funds, insurance companies, pension funds and ethical funds, thanks also to the adoption, by the Company and the Group, of the best international practices on transparency and corporate governance. Moreover, at the date of this Sustainability Report, the Enel Group includes other 14 companies issuing shares listed on the Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Peruvian, Russian, Spanish, and US Stock Exchanges.\n\nCorporate governance model\n\nDuring 2020, Enel\u2019s corporate governance system proved to be in compliance with the principles set down in the 2018 edition of the Corporate Governance Code of listed companies, adopted by the Company, and with international best practices. The Company\u2019s process of adopting the new Italian Corporate Governance Code, published on January 31, 2020, was completed in March 2021. The corporate governance system adopted by Enel and the Group is oriented towards the goal of sustainable success, given that it is aimed at creating value for shareholders over the long term, taking into account the social importance of the Group\u2019s business operations and the consequent need, in conducting such operations, to adequately consider all the interests involved.\n\nFor a detailed illustration of Enel\u2019s corporate governance we invite you to refer to the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure for 2020, which is available on the Company\u2019s website (www.enel.com); we further refer you to the specific sections of this Sustainability Report for an illustration of the governance of sustainability and the management of climate change.\n\nRelations with shareholders and the financial community\n\nSince the listing of its shares on the Stock Exchange, Enel has deemed it appropriate to set up corporate structures dedicated to dialogue with institutional investors and with the broader category of shareholders. We therefore set up the following within boundary of the Company: (i) the Investor Relations unit, currently in the Administration, Finance and Control Function; (ii) an area in the Corporate Affairs Unit, which is in turn part of the Legal and Corporate Affairs Function. In this context, Enel maintains dialogue with investors based on principles of fairness and transparency, in compliance with EU and national regulations on market abuse, as well as in line with international best practices. Among other matters, the Investor Relations unit drafts Enel\u2019s equity story and organizes meetings between the Company\u2019s top management, institutional investors, and financial analysts. It also oversees the documentation to be submitted to the latter when disclosing periodic financial data to the market and in updating the Group\u2019s Strategic Plan in the context of Capital Markets Day. This is accompanied by ordinary activities, which include group or one-on-one meetings, conference calls, and interaction with financial analysts, with the aim of supporting them in their analysis and ultimately facilitating the correct assessment of the Company by the financial community. With the support of the Innovability\u00ae Function, the Investor Relations unit also discusses environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues with investors, topics which can have major financial repercussions in the medium and long term. In view of the health emergency connected with the Covid-19 pandemic, starting in March 2020 dialogue with the financial community has been conducted solely in virtual mode. During the initial months of 2021, a policy was adopted to manage communications with institutional investors and with Enel\u2019s other shareholders and bondholders.\n\nFor more details, refer to the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure. Also, Enel\u2019s website (www.enel.com, \u201cInvestors\u201d section) provides access to economic, financial, environmental, social and governance information and updated data and documents of particular interest, providing a multidisciplinary and integrated vision.\nThe Board of Directors in office was appointed by the Ordinary Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of May 14, 2020 and consists of nine members.\n\nEnel applies diversity criteria, also in relation to gender, in the composition of the Board of Directors, in line with the priority goal of ensuring adequate competence and professionalism of its members. Specifically, in January 2018 the Board of Directors approved a diversity policy, which describes the optimal characteristics of the Board\u2019s composition to ensure it can fulfil its duties as effectively as possible, making decisions that can tangibly benefit from the contribution of a plurality of qualified point of views able to examine the issues under discussion from diverse perspectives.\n\nThe Board of Directors held 16 meetings in 2020, of which 12 addressed climate-related matters, reflected in the strategies and related implementation methods. Moreover, a broad ranging and articulated induction program was defined in 2020, with 17 initiatives aimed at providing the Directors with adequate knowledge of the Group\u2019s business sectors, as well as its corporate dynamics and their evolution, market trends, and the legal framework; also the Statutory Auditors participated in this program. The induction initiatives carried out in 2020 concerned all Business Lines and the main Countries and Regions in which the Group is present, and also the Global Service Functions (\u201cDigital Solutions\u201d and \u201cProcurement\u201d) and the principal staff Functions (\u201cAdministration, Finance and Control\u201d, \u201cCommunications\u201d, \u201cInnovability\u201d and \u201cPeople and Organization\u201d), plus a session on \u201cDigital Transformation\u201d, conducted with the participation of an external expert. In this context, one of the induction activities also concerned the Enel Group\u2019s 2021-2023 Sustainability Plan and the positioning of the Group companies in the main sustainability indexes. In February 2020, the Board of Directors updated the specific corporate policy on the maximum number of offices Enel Directors may hold in administrative and/or control bodies of other companies of significant size, so as to adapt its contents to reflect the relevant best practices developed by the main proxy advisors and by significant institutional investors. In February and March 2021, the Board of Directors also adopted several measures aimed to ensure the implementation in Enel of the new Italian Corporate Governance Code, published on January 31, 2020. The measures in question include the adoption of a policy for the management of the dialogue with institutional investors and with the generality of shareholders and bondholders of Enel (\u2018engagement policy\u2019), that takes into account the best practices adopted in this area by institutional investors and reflected in Stewardship codes. In relation to the topic of succession plans for executive directors, in September 2016 the Board of Directors shared the contents of a specific \u2018contingency plan\u2019 aimed at regulating the actions to be taken to ensure proper management of the Company in case of early cessation of the Chief Executive Officer before the expiry of the ordinary term of office (defined as \u201ccrisis management\u201d case).\n\nFinally, in the closing months of 2020 and during the initial months of 2021, with the assistance of the independent consultant, Spencer Stuart the Board of Directors carried out an assessment of the size, composition, and functioning of the Board itself and its committees (\u201cboard review\u201d), in line with the most advanced corporate governance practices followed internationally and adopted under the Corporate Governance Code. The board review, which was extended also to include the Board of Statutory Auditors, was conducted in accordance with the peer-to-peer review method, i.e. through assessment not merely of the functioning of each body considered as a whole, but also of the style and contents of the contribution supplied by each director and statutory auditor. In the context of the board review of the Board of Directors, the questionnaires and interviews also concerned inter alia the implementation of the principles of sustainability in the strategies and business model of the Company and the Group, together with the attention devoted to sustainability topics by the Board of Directors.\n\nRemuneration policy\n\nThe Enel remuneration policy for 2020, adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of May 14, 2020, was defined taking account of national and international best practices, the indications that emerged from the favorable vote of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting of May 16, 2019 concerning the remuneration policy for 2019, and the results of a benchmark analysis concerning the remuneration treatment of the Chair of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and the non-executive Directors of Enel for the 2017/2019 mandate, prepared by the independent consultant Willis Towers Watson.\n\nIn line with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies (2018 edition), the 2020 remuneration policy is designed to attract, motivate and retain talent with the most suitable professional qual-\nLTI PLANS (Long-Term Incentive Plans)\n\n| Vesting period | Payout of 30% | Payout of 70% |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| YEAR 1         |              |              |\n| YEAR 2         |              |              |\n| YEAR 3         |              |              |\n| YEAR 4         |              |              |\n| YEAR 5         |              |              |\n\n3-year performance period\nVerify achievement\nDeferred payment\n\n(1) In case of achievement of performance goals.\n\nIn consideration of its operations, Enel adopts a classification of the risks to which it is exposed, composed of six categories: strategic, financial, operative, governance & culture, digital technology, and compliance. The risks are defined in a catalogue to be referred to in all Group areas and for all the structures involved in management and monitoring processes. Adoption of a common language facilitates mapping and organic representation of risks within the Group, thus aiding identification of risks that affect Group processes and of the roles of the organizational units involved in their management. The Group also adopts a Risk Appetite Framework in order to enable, for each risk and in accordance with an integrated approach, the appropriate management and control measures, plus development and updating (metrics and models for measurement of risks). For the effective management of such risks, Enel set up an Internal Control and Risk Management System (\"SCIGR\").\n\nInternal Control and Risk Management System\n\n1. SEPARATION of roles between management and control and their complementarity and independence (3 lines of defense)\n2. RISK CONTROL UNIT overseeing second-level defense and economic-financial impact of risks\n3. SYSTEM OF RISK COMMITTEES focused on business or geographical areas, coordinated among themselves, with a Group Risk Committee at the top\n4. SYSTEM OF ORGANIZATIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES setting out processes, tools and responsibilities\n5. SPECIFICATION OF EXPLICIT RISK LIMITS and control processes to ensure compliance\n6. A RISK REPORTING SYSTEM that ensures management remains informed and enables corrective and mitigation action\n\nFinally, we draw your attention to the fact that the table below gives both for 2019 and 2020 the ratio between the total remuneration accrued by Enel\u2019s Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and average gross annual remuneration of the Group\u2019s employees (\u2018pay ratio\u2019).\n\n| Year | Pay ratio \u2013 Ratio between total remuneration of the Enel CEO/GM and average gross annual remuneration of Group employees |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020 | 146x (35x fixed compensation)                                                                                     |\n| 2019 | 143x (36x fixed compensation)                                                                                     |\n\nFor the sake of full disclosure, the same ratio is shown also with reference exclusively to the fixed component of the remunerations in question. For more information on pay ratio calculation methods, see Enel\u2019s Report on the remuneration policy for 2021 and compensations paid in 2020, available on the Company website (www.enel.com).\nically, that strengthens risk profile awareness, picking up the related opportunities, and supports management in decision-making processes aimed at value creation in a constantly evolving external context. The system is composed of the set of rules, procedures, and organizational structures designed to allow identification, measurement, management, and monitoring of the main corporate risks within the Group. In this context, the Board of Directors performs a policy making and coordination role for risk management, which assures the adoption of aware, structured decisions that are consistent with the nature and level of risk at all levels of the Group. More details are provided in the Report on Corporate Governance, available on the Company website (www.enel.com, \u201cInvestors\u201d section).\n\nDue to the nature of its business and its geographical distribution, the Group is exposed to different types of ESG risk (environmental, social, and governance), identified within the reference framework of risk categories adopted by Enel. In the identification of potential ESG risks the following were considered:\n\n- results of the materiality analysis (see the section \u201cAt a Glance\u201d - \u201cDefinition of priorities\u201d and the Methodological note in this document);\n- the 2021 Global Risk Report of the World Economic Forum (WEF), involving more than 1,000 experts and leaders from all over the world;\n- the risk assessments carried out as part of Enel\u2019s due diligence process on human rights, which involved numerous experts from different sectors, including civil society, academic institutions, local communities, customers and suppliers, in the various countries in which the Group operates;\n- the analysis of some of the most highly internationally accredited ESG rating agencies, which use specific risk assessment systems to rate the level of company performance in relation to sustainability.\n\nIn the risk identification and assessment stage, the \u201cPrecautionary Principle\u201d was applied, particularly in relation to risks relating to the environment, health, and safety. For each type of risk, specific actions have been identified to mitigate effects and ensure correct management. Enel also applies this principle to risk management, especially with regard to the development and introduction of new products/technologies, planning of operating assets and the development and construction of new plants/assets. The following is a description of the main ESG risk types, the actions intended to mitigate the effects and assure their correct management.\n\nMain ESG risk types\n\n- Operational\n- Digital technology\n- Governance & Culture\n- Compliance\n\nREFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK\n\nThe markets and the businesses where the Group operates are subject to a gradual and increasing competition and evolution, both from a technological and regulatory standpoint, with different timing from Country to Country. As a result, the Group faces an increasing competitive pressure. Furthermore, the Group operates in regulated markets or regimes. Thus, changes in the rules of functioning of those markets and regimes, as well as their provisions and obligations, along with fluctuations in macroeconomic variables, can influence the management\u2019s evolution and the Group\u2019s results.\n\nMITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\n\nThe business risks stemming from the Group\u2019s natural presence in competitive markets are faced with a strategy of integration through the value chain, with a greater drive for technological innovation, diversification and geographical expansion. Specifically, the actions enacted have produced the evolution of the customer portfolio on the free market, in a downstream integration logic on the final markets, the optimization of the productive mix, by improving the competitiveness of the plants on the basis of a cost leadership, as well as the search for new markets with a high growth potential and the development of renewable sources through adequate investment plans in different Countries.\n\nIn view of the risks deriving from regulatory factors, the Company has intensified the relations with local government and regulatory bodies, by adopting a transparent, collaborative and proactive approach to face and remove the sources of instability in the regulatory framework.\n\nREFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK\n\nPhysical risks arising from climate change can be classified as acute (i.e. extreme events) and chronic: the former are linked to extremely intense weather-climatic conditions, while the latter refers to gradual but structural changes in climatic conditions. Extreme events may expose the Group to a potential unavailability of assets and infrastructures, restoration costs, and inconvenience for customers, etc. Chronic changes in climatic conditions, on the other hand, may expose the Group to other physical risks or opportunities (depending on the geographical location): for example, structural rainfall or wind changes could impact the Group\u2019s business in terms of generation, while structural temperature changes could have an impact on electricity demand.\n\nWith regard to the energy transition process moving towards a more sustainable model with a progressive electrification and reduction in CO\u2082 emissions, in line with the Group\u2019s decarbonization strategy, there are risks, but above all opportunities, tied to both, the changing regulatory context and the technological and electrification trends, and resulting market developments, with potential effects also on commodities and energy prices.\n\nFurther information is given in the \u201cNet-Zero Ambition\u201d chapter.\n\nMITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\n\nThe Group is committed to making continuous improvements to the environmental impact of its activities. It has constantly improved its emissions reduction targets, certifying a new target with the SBTi in 2020 for 62 g/kWh of CO\u2082 by 2030, heading for \u201czero emission generation\u201d by 2050. The Group\u2019s strategic actions make it possible to mitigate the potential risks and grasp the opportunities provided by transition variables. The use of capital is indeed focused on decarbonisation, through the development of generation assets from renewable sources, on enabling infrastructures linked to the development of networks and on the implementation of platform models, taking advantage of technological and digital evolution, which will favour consumption electrification, as well as the development of new services for end customers. Overall, the Group...\nis dedicating more than 90% of the total investments planned for the 2021-2023 timeframe to the fight against climate change. Enel participates in the entire electricity value chain and has a diversified portfolio of activities, both in terms of generation technologies and the geographical areas and markets where it operates, mitigating climate change risks and their economic and financial impacts.\n\nThe management of weather and climate phenomena adopts the best strategies for prevention, protection and boosting resilience, while also carrying out weather forecasting activities. Moreover, best practices are implemented on physical events to ensure a prompt recovery of operating conditions in the event of adverse events. In terms of insurance risk assessment activities, the Group manages loss prevention global programmes for property and liability risks, aimed at covering losses relating to damages to assets, business interruptions and damages to third parties; such activities also include the assessment of the main exposures linked to natural events. All areas of the Group are subject to the ISO 14001 certification and, by applying internationally recognised Environmental Management Systems (EMSs), potential sources of risk are monitored so that any critical issue may be promptly identified. The Group develops short-, medium- and long-term scenarios in the energy and the financial macroeconomic sectors in order to support its strategic and industrial planning, investment valuation, scenario planning and extraordinary transactions. By gradually integrating climate and transition scenarios, combined with the development of energy system models at country level, it is possible to intercept the effects on variables such as electricity demand, the system energy mix and the electrification of consumption. These activities make it possible to identify and assess related risks and opportunities. Further information is given in the \u2018Net-Zero Ambition\u2019 chapter.\n\n**ENVIRONMENT**\n\n**CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\nOver the last years, there has been a growing public awareness of the risks connected with development models that generate impacts on environmental quality and on ecosystems through the exploitation of scarce natural resources (including raw materials and water). In some cases, the synergistic effects between these impacts \u2013 such as global warming and the growing exploitation and degradation of water resources \u2013 increase the risk of environmental emergencies arising in the most sensitive areas of the planet, with the risk of various water resource uses having to compete, such as industrial, agricultural and civil uses.\n\nIn response to these needs, governments have imposed increasingly restrictive environmental regulations, placing ever more stringent constraints on the development of new industrial initiatives in the most impactful industries, incentivizing or requiring the elimination of technologies no longer considered sustainable.\n\nIn this context, companies in every sector, and above all industry leaders, are ever more aware that environmental risks are increasingly economic risks. As a result, they are called upon to increase their commitment and accountability for developing and adopting innovative and sustainable technical solutions and development models.\n\n**REFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK**\n\nOver the last years, there has been a growing public awareness of the risks connected with development models that generate impacts on environmental quality and on ecosystems through the exploitation of scarce natural resources (including raw materials and water). In some cases, the synergistic effects between these impacts \u2013 such as global warming and the growing exploitation and degradation of water resources \u2013 increase the risk of environmental emergencies arising in the most sensitive areas of the planet, with the risk of various water resource uses having to compete, such as industrial, agricultural and civil uses.\n\nIn response to these needs, governments have imposed increasingly restrictive environmental regulations, placing ever more stringent constraints on the development of new industrial initiatives in the most impactful industries, incentivizing or requiring the elimination of technologies no longer considered sustainable.\n\nIn this context, companies in every sector, and above all industry leaders, are ever more aware that environmental risks are increasingly economic risks. As a result, they are called upon to increase their commitment and accountability for developing and adopting innovative and sustainable technical solutions and development models.\n\n**MITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES**\n\nEnel has made the effective prevention and minimization of environmental impacts and risks a foundational element of each project across its entire life cycle.\n\nThe adoption of ISO 14001-certified environmental management systems certified within the Group ensures the implementation of structured policies and procedures to identify and manage the environmental risks and opportunities associated with all corporate activities.\n\nA structured control plan combined with actions and improvement objectives inspired by the best environmental practices, with requirements higher than those linked to simple environmental regulatory compliance, mitigates the risk of impacts on the environmental matrix, reputational damage and legal disputes.\n\nAlso contributing are the multitude of actions to achieve the challenging environmental improvement objectives set by Enel, such as, for example, those regarding atmospheric emissions, waste production and water consumption, especially in areas with high water stress.\n\nThe risk of water scarcity is directly mitigated by Enel\u2019s development strategy, which is based on the growth of generation from renewable sources that are essentially not dependent on the availability of water for their operation. Special attention is also devoted to assets in areas with a high level of water stress, in order to develop technological solutions to reduce consumption.\n\nOngoing collaboration with local river basin management authorities enables us to adopt the most effective shared strategies for the sustainable management of hydroelectric generation assets.\n\nLastly, appropriate terrestrial, marine and river monitoring of ecosystems is carried out to verify the effectiveness of measures adopted in order to protect, restore and preserve biodiversity.\n\nFurther information is given in the \u2018Environmental Sustainability\u2019 chapter.\n\n**HEALTH AND SAFETY**\n\n**REFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK**\n\nThe main health and safety risks to which Enel personnel and contractors are exposed are associated with operations at the Group\u2019s sites and assets. The violation of the laws, regulations and procedures governing health and safety, work environment, management of corporate structures, assets and processes, which could have an adverse impact on the health of employees, workers or stakeholders, can give rise to the risk of incurring administrative or judicial penalties and related economic, financial and reputational impacts.\n\nThese risks were identified through an analysis of the main events that have occurred in the last three years. In particular, in terms of probability of occurrence, mechanical incidents (falls, collisions, crushing and cuts) are the most common, while the most severe in terms of potential associated impact are electrical incidents (fatalities).\n\nIn addition, in relation to the presence of the Group in different areas of the world, employees and contractors could be exposed to health risks connected with potential emerging infectious diseases of a pandemic and potentially pandemic nature, which could have an impact on good health and well-being.\n\n**MITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES**\n\nEnel has adopted a Declaration of Commitment to Health and Safety, signed by the Group\u2019s top management.\n\nIn implementing the policy, each Group Business Line has its own Occupational Health and Safety Management System compliant with the international standard BS OHSAS 18001, which is based on the identification of hazards, the qualitative and quantitative assessment of risks, the planning and implementation of prevention and protection measures, the verification of the effectiveness of the prevention and protection measures and any corrective actions. This system also considers the rigor employed in the selection and management of contractors and suppliers and the promotion of their involvement in programs for continuous improvement of safety performance.\n\nThe Enel Group has defined a structured health management system, based on prevention and protection measures, which also plays a role in the development of a corporate culture aimed at promoting the psycho-physical health and organizational well-being of workers, as well as helping to balance personal and professional life.\n\nFurthermore, with regard to emergencies relating to health, safety and the environment, a unit\nhas been set up within the HSEQ department of the Parent with liaisons in each Business Line and Country in order to ensure the definition of the global strategy and policies for emergency management and their adoption in every Group organization. In particular, this organizational structure and the related management processes make it possible to direct, integrate and monitor, both at Group level and in the individual countries in which it operates, all the prevention, protection and intervention actions aimed at protecting the health of employees and contractors, also in relation to exogenous health risk factors that may not be strictly related to work activities. Further information on risk management is given in the \u201cOccupational health and safety\u201d chapter.\n\nREFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK\nEnel may be exposed to the risk of reputational, economic, or financial losses further to ineffective procurement activities or contracts management, inadequate supplier qualification processes, excessive recourse to direct awards, deficiencies in scouting activities, insufficient monitoring of compliance with contractual obligations, and failure to apply.\n\nMITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\nGroup procurement processes and the related governance documents constitute a structured system of standards and checkpoints that make it possible to combine the achievement of economic business goals with full compliance with the fundamental principles set down in the Code of Ethics, in the Enel Global Compliance Program, in the Zero Tolerance Plan, and in the Policy on Human Rights, while continuing to promote initiatives aimed at sustainable economic development.\n\nThe procedures that govern procurement processes are all aimed at guaranteeing behaviors oriented towards the utmost respect the key values of loyalty, professionalism, collaboration, transparency, and traceability of decisional processes. These principles are expressed in the processes and organizational measures that Enel has decided to adopt in a self-regulation regime in order to establish relationships of trust with all its stakeholders and to define stable and constructive relations that are not limited to guaranteeing economic competitiveness but that take account of the best practices in essential areas for the Group, i.e. opposition to child labor, promotion of occupational health and safety conditions, and environmental responsibility. In this sense, the Group adopts a procedural system for the routine operation of the various Procurement units that, adopting the practice of tenders almost by default, guarantee the maximum competition and equal opportunity of access to all operators having the necessary technical, economic-financial, environmental, safety, human rights, legal and ethical characteristics.\n\nThe supplier qualification system is the same across the entire Enel Group, and it monitors verification of the aforementioned requirements. In fact, through the qualification system \u2013 even before the procurement process starts \u2013 Enel checks that potential suppliers are in line with its strategic vision and expectations in relation to all the mentioned profiles and that they hold the same values. The global supplier qualification system allows accurate assessment of companies that intend to participate in the procurement procedures and represents a guarantee for Enel, because it constitutes an updated list of entities of proven reliability from which to draw, and the possibility, in compliance with the relevant rules in force, for suppliers to be engaged by means of the procurement tenders called by the Group companies. The Supplier Performance Management process, which completes the qualification procedure, is designed to monitor performance in relation to the integrity of conduct in tender procedures, quality, punctuality, and sustainability in execution of the contract. Procurement by direct award and without a competitive procedure can occur only in exceptional suitably motivated circumstances in compliance with the relevant statutory legislation.\n\nSupply chain risk management effectiveness is constantly monitored in order to guide procurement strategies.\n\nThe actions taken to counter the impacts of the Covid-19 emergency were centered around differentiation of procurement sources to prevent interruptions in the supply chain and in remote management of activities that would normally require physical interaction between Enel and the supplier (e.g. company on-site inspections).\n\nREFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK\nEnel may be exposed to the risk of judicial or administrative sanctions, economic or financial losses, and reputational damage as a result of partial or total interruption of commercial operations and of electricity supplies to customers, caused by technical faults, malfunctions of assets and plants, human error, sabotage, unavailability of raw materials or adverse weather events, or infectious diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential that may limit the normal functioning of the Group\u2019s activities or of its supply chain.\n\nMITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\nEnel has systems and mechanisms to guarantee a continuous and safe energy supply to the national electrical systems of the countries in which it operates. The Company is therefore constantly at work to develop and improve the efficiency of the transport and distribution network, in coordination with the other entities operating on the network infrastructure in various capacities. Enel carries out actions of network development, modernization, and maintenance on the infrastructure existing in all Countries, with the primary aim of improving the quality of the service delivered and reducing the number and duration of outages. Enel also constantly takes operational efficiency and safety measures to guarantee correct functioning and availability of all its power plants. Lastly, the Group\u2019s assets are covered by adequate insurance mechanisms to protect the Company from potential negative economic consequences resulting from future and uncertain events.\n\nMoreover, with special reference to the management of critical events, Enel has drawn up Group, Business Line and Country policies to ensure effectiveness of the decision-making process in the management of any event that could impair continuity of the public service and the Company\u2019s business, including health emergencies with a local and/or global impact. Enel implements adequate protocols, plans and actions to ensure the smooth running of its business activity worldwide or, if necessary, its rapid recovery in the event of service interruptions. Especially in relation to the health emergency, Enel defines specific protocols designed to limit the spread of contagion among the people involved in operating assets and consequently guarantee the continuity of service.\n\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cElectrification, digital and platforms\u201d chapter.\n\nREFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK\nThe profound transformations of the energy sector, which has experienced sweeping technological developments, require the presence of new professional profiles and skills, as well as an important cultural and organizational change. Organizations must move to adopt new agile and flexible business models. Policies to enhance diversity and to manage and promote talent have become key factors for companies that are managing the transition and have a widespread geographical presence.\n\nMITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\nEnel places the people who work for it at the center of its business model: the management of human capital is a priority for which specific objectives have been established. The main goals include: the development of the digital capabilities and skills made necessary by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, as well as the promotion of reskilling and upskilling programs for employees in order to support the energy transition; the effective involvement of employees in the pursuit of the corporate purpose, which ensures the achievement of better results while offering greater satisfaction to our people; the development of systems for evaluating the working environment and performance; the dissemination of diversity and inclusion policies to all countries in which the Group operates, as well as instilling an inclusive organizational culture based on the principles of non-discrimination.\nand equal opportunity, a key driver in ensuring that everyone can make an effective contribution. In addition, Enel is developing specific initiatives to foster the diffusion of agile working methods in business processes. The Group is committed on enhancing the resilience and flexibility of organisational models through simplification and digitalisation in order to enable the effectiveness and autonomy of people working in the company within new smart working arrangements, already effectively tested in response to the Covid-19 pandemic emergency, which will be a key element of future working models.\n\nGovernance & Culture\n\nREFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK\nThe risk of ineffective engagement of key stakeholders in relation to the strategic positioning of Enel on sustainability and financial objectives, due to the lack of understanding, anticipation, or orientation of their expectations, could cause incomplete integration of such expectations within the Company\u2019s business strategy and sustainability planning processes, with a potential negative impact on its reputation and competitiveness.\n\nEnel currently operates in a vast geographical area, with a presence in more than 40 countries distributed in five continents, conducting business activities that call for the development of infrastructure in local areas, which can provoke criticism or potential disputes with communities in some cases. Such conditions could lead to delays in the execution of projects for new sites and impacts on operational continuity, with a potential negative economic-financial and reputational effect.\n\nOn the other hand, Enel\u2019s commitment to decarbonize its energy mix \u2013 with a particular focus on the coal mining phase \u2013 could have a potential negative impact in local areas that are heavily dependent on coal operations (mining and electricity generation) in terms of job losses and socio-economic development. This could ultimately expose Enel to reputational risks or even delay the Group\u2019s achievement of the decarbonization goals set out in its Strategic Plan.\n\nIn the meantime, the outlook of investors is shifting fast: the changes in progress and challenges presented by the modern world are also revolutionizing the method of investing.\n\nESG investors are growing constantly: at December 31, 2020, SRI funds constituted approximately 14.6% of the share capital (vs 10.8% at December 31, 2019), while PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment) signatory investors represent 47.8% of the share capital (vs 43% at December 31, 2019).\n\nPossible incorrect or incomplete disclosure by Enel of the results obtained, and likewise ineffective communications to the financial community of its strategy, which aims to create value for customers, society, and the environment, could have significant negative impacts on the assessment of Enel\u2019s actions and obligations.\n\nMITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\nSince 2015 the Company has had a Creating Shared Value (CSV) model that integrates social and environmental factors in corporate processes and throughout the entire value chain, especially in relation to business development, engineering and construction operations, asset management and maintenance, and disposals. By means of this model, the Group makes a proactive commitment with local communities to identify their main needs, which are then integrated into structured action plans, the implementation of which is constantly monitored.\n\nMoreover, Enel promotes inclusive energy transition by way of improvement actions both globally (including public commitments and awareness raising in construction) and at local level, such as the Futu-re program rolled out in Italy and Spain to find sustainable solutions (focused mainly on employment and the development of economic activities) for the areas affected by the abandonment of coal-fired plants.\n\nBy means of dialogue with shareholders and bondholders, the Investor Relations unit collects feedback on how to integrate and improve the Group\u2019s reporting process and make its communications as effective as possible.\n\nMoreover, since 2019 a proactive engagement activity with the main Enel shareholders has been organized on environmental, social, and governance issues.\n\nFurther information is given in the \u201cAt a Glance\u201d, \u201cCommunities and shared values\u201d and \u201cSound governance\u201d chapters.\n\nDigital Technology\n\nREFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK\nThe speed of technological developments that constantly generate new challenges, the ever increasing frequency and intensity of cyber attacks and the attraction of critical infrastructures and strategic industrial sectors as targets underscores the potential risk that, in extreme cases, the normal operations of companies could grind to a halt. Cyber attacks have evolved dramatically in recent years: their number has grown exponentially, as has their complexity and impact (theft of company and customer data), making it increasingly difficult to promptly identify the source of threats. This exposure reflects the many environments in which the Group operates (data, industry and people), a circumstance that accompanies the intrinsic complexity and interconnection of the resources that over the years have been increasingly integrated into the Group\u2019s daily operating processes (see also the \u201cDigital supports and cyber security\u201d chapter in this document).\n\nMITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\nThe Group has adopted a holistic governance approach to cyber security that is applied to all the sectors of IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology) and IoT (Internet of Things). The framework is based on the commitment of top management, on global strategic management, on the involvement of all business areas as well as on the units involved in the design and management of our systems. It seeks to use cutting edge technologies, to design ad hoc business processes, to strengthen people\u2019s IT awareness and to implement regulatory requirements for IT security.\n\nIn addition, the Group has developed an IT risk management methodology founded on \u201crisk-based\u201d and \u201ccyber security by design\u201d approaches, making business risk analysis the fundamental step in all strategic decisions. Enel has also created its own Cyber Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) in order to proactively respond to any IT security incidents.\n\nFinally, since 2019, the Group also took out an insurance policy for cyber security risks in order to mitigate IT threats. (see also the \u201cDigital supports and cyber security\u201d chapter in this document)\nCompliance\n\nREFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK\n\nIn the era of digitalization and markets globalization, Enel\u2019s business strategy focused on accelerating the transformation process towards a business model based on a digital platform, through a data-driven approach focused on the customer, which is being implemented along the entire value chain.\n\nThe Company, which is present in more than 40 countries, has the largest customer base in the public utilities sector (around 70 million customers), with a current workforce of approximately 67 thousand people; consequently, the Group\u2019s new business model requires the management of an increasingly relevant and growing volume of personal data in order to achieve the financial and business results envisaged in the 2021-2023 strategic plan. This naturally increases our exposure to the risks connected with the protection of personal data, also in view of the increasingly stringent privacy legislation in most of the countries where Enel operates. These risks may result in a loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data of customers, employees and third parties (e.g. suppliers), causing penalties proportionate to the overall turnover, interdiction from processes and consequent economic or financial losses, as well as reputational damages.\n\nMITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\n\nIn order to manage and mitigate this risk, Enel has adopted a global model of personal data governance through the assignment of privacy roles at all levels \u2013 including the appointment of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) both at a global and country level \u2013 as well as digital compliance instruments to map applications and processes and manage relevant risks to personal data protection, in compliance with the peculiarities of local sector regulations.\n\nEnel may be exposed to the risk of judicial measures, administrative sanctions, economic or financial losses and reputational damage as a result of:\n\n- illegal or illicit conduct, including active and passive acts of corruption, perpetrated by personnel inside or outside the Group in order to secure an unjust benefit for themselves or for others;\n- infringement of international, national, or local laws and regulations concerning: accounting, financial, or tax discipline, market disclosures, anti-trust and consumer rights issues or other applicable legislative provisions (e.g. rules concerning permitting or tenders, regulation of electricity markets, etc.).\n\nMITIGATION ACTIONS AND RELATED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\n\nEnel has adopted an Internal Control and Risk Management System expressed in company rules and procedures that all who work in Enel or on behalf of Enel are required to follow, by means of their respective contractual commitments. The Internal Control System also includes specific compliance programs, i.e.: the Code of Ethics, the Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan (\u2018ZTC Plan\u2019), the Policy on Human Rights, the Enel Global Compliance Program (\u2018EGCP\u2019), the Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01 and other national compliance programs adopted by Group companies in accordance with their national legislation. Furthermore, to further pursue its commitment to fighting corruption, Enel voluntarily decided to certify its Anti-Bribery Management System (SGPC) in compliance with the requirements of international standard ISO 37001:2016 (international certification of anti-bribery management systems). This certification process has involved the Group\u2019s main foreign subsidiaries.\n\nExternal staff, working for Enel Group company suppliers, undertake to comply with the ethical clauses set out in their respective contracts, which incorporate references to Enel\u2019s commitment in terms of business integrity in the pursuit of its activities.\n\nThe ongoing monitoring of legislative and regulatory developments at the local, national and international levels is guaranteed by the operations of specific company Functions with competence in relation to these matters.\n\nFurther information on risk management is given in the \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter.\nIn relation to the specific contexts pursuant to Italian Legis- lative Decree 254/16 concerning climate change, human rights, and the fight against corruption, we invite you to refer to the sections dedicated to these topics in this Sustainability Report.\n\nThe other types of risk to which the Enel Group is exposed are detailed in the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section of the Integrated Annual Report available on the website (www.enel.com, \u201cInvestors\u201d section).\n\nTransparency in institutional processes\n\nEnel constantly manages relations with institutions (local, national, European, and international) in line with the Enel Compliance Program, providing complete and transparent information with the aim of placing institutional counterparts in the best possible position to make the decisions within the sphere of their competence. Enel also contributes to the consultation processes regarding political and legislative dossiers on energy and environmental issues. In the context of relations with European institutions, Enel actively contributes to every phase of the consultation process on political and legislative dossiers of corporate interest through careful monitoring and analysis (see also the chapter \u201cNet zero-ambition\u201d).\n\nThe Enel Group has been enrolled in the EU voluntary transparency register since its creation in 2008. The register aims to provide citizens with a single and direct access point to information on who carries out activities aimed at influencing the EU decision-making process; the interests pursued, and the resources invested in these activities (http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/homePage.do). In line with the provisions of the Code of Ethics, paragraph 3.26, Enel does not finance political parties, their representatives, or candidates in Italy or abroad, nor does it sponsor conventions or events whose sole purpose is political propaganda. It refrains from any direct or indirect pressure on politicians (for example, by granting the use of its facilities, accepting recruiting recommendations, or awarding consultancy contracts). Enel and its subsidiaries are present in various trade and employer associations whose role in the institutional dialogue with the trade and employer associations in which Enel and its subsidiaries took part in 2020 concerned the support of regulatory and consultation processes, including also the following main issues:\n\n- development of energy policies: including, among other topics, the strategic outlook of the sector, energy efficiency, the growth of renewables, smart grid development and energy costs;\n- increasing business competitiveness: including, among other topics, tax regulation, labor law issues and environmental policies.\n\nValues and pillars of company ethics\n\nA solid and dynamic ethical system, constantly oriented towards implementing best practices on the national and international levels is the foundational element of the Enel system of values underpinning the Company\u2019s operating assets, and of relations entertained with all its key stakeholders. A system based on compliance programs, including the Code of Ethics, Policy on Human Rights, the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan (\u201cZTC Plan\u201d), Enel Global Compliance Program, the Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01, plus any other national compliance models adopted by Group companies in accordance with local regulations.\n\nIn 2020 a total of 151 reports were received concerning the Code of Ethics, representing a reduction with respect to 2019. Among the reports received there were 2 violation episodes connected to cases of \u201cconflict of interest/corruption\u201d, in relation to which Enel adopted specific measures against the employees concerned. As far as cases relating to labor practices are concerned, 79 reports were recorded, the analysis of which resulted in the identification of 9 violations: 5 cases for inappropriate conduct and/or conduct detrimental to personal dignity and 4 cases concerning health and safety issues.\n\nIn 2020, Enel adopted at Code of Ethics that expresses the commitments and ethical responsibilities to which it adheres in its operating assets, regulating and harmonizing corporate conduct according to standards based on the maximum transparency and integrity towards all stakeholders. The Code of Ethics is applicable to the entire Group, notwithstanding the cultural, social, and economic diversity between the various countries in which Enel operates. Enel also requires all its main suppliers and partners to adopt conduct in line with the Code\u2019s general principles.\n\nWe draw your attention to the fact that in February 2021, the Board of Directors approved a further update of the Code of Ethics in order to align the contents with the current situation, the changes that have occurred in the organizational structure and in the Group\u2019s procedural system, and with national and international best practices. More information is available on the website (www.enel.com/investors/sustainability/sustainability-topics-and-performances/principles-underpinning-our-work/code-of-ethics).\n\nStakeholder reports\n\nAny violation or suspected violation of the ethical system can be reported, also anonymously, through a single platform at Group level (\u201cEthics Point\u201d), which is accessible at www.enel.ethicspoint.com. The Audit Function receives and analyses these reports, performing the related checks and ensuring uniform treatment at Group level, in compliance with company policies and local regulations.\n\nThe reports management process is governed by the whistleblowing policy, \u201cManagement of anonymous and non-anonymous reports\u201d, which guarantees anonymity and protection against any form of retaliation and also ensures adequate protection against groundless reports made maliciously to harm or cause prejudice to individuals and/or companies.\n\nOrganizational and Management Model pursuant to Italian Legis- lative Decree 231/01\n\nItalian Legislative Decree 231 of June 8, 2001, introduced an administrative (essentially criminal) liability into the Italian legal system for companies in respect of certain types of offences committed by directors, managers, or employees in the interest of or for the benefit of the companies concerned. Already in 2002, Enel \u2013 the first in Italy \u2013 adopted an Organizational and Management Model that meets the requirements of Legislative Decree 231/01 (Model 231). Since then, it has been constantly updated in line with the reference regulatory framework and current organizational context.\nActive and passive fight against corruption\n\nIn compliance with the 10th Global Compact principle, according to which \u201ccompanies are committed to combating corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.\u201d Enel intends to pursue its commitment to fighting corruption in all its forms \u2013 whether direct or indirect \u2013 by applying the principles expressed in the pillars of its Anti-bribery Management System. Enel\u2019s Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) is based on the Group\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption by applying the criteria of transparency and conduct as set out in the Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan (ZTC Plan) and confirmed in the Anti-Bribery Policy adopted in compliance with international standard ISO 37001:2016 (anti-bribery management systems).\n\nTogether with the ZTC Plan, the pillars underpinning the ABMS are:\n\n- the Code of Ethics;\n- Models to prevent the main criminal risks (for example, bribery in relations with public administrations and among private individuals, environmental offences, corporate offences and, for Italian companies, manslaughter, serious personal injury or grievous bodily harm committed in violation of the rules on the protection of occupational health and safety), as described by the applicable regulations on corporate responsibility (the \u201cCompliance Program\u201d) in the various countries where the Group operates (for example, Organizational Model 231 for Italian companies, the \u201cRisk Prevention Model/Integrity Program\u201d for Group companies in Spain and South America);\n- the Enel Global Compliance Program (\u201cEGCP\u201d), a governance tool aimed at strengthening the Group\u2019s ethical and professional commitment to preventing illicit committed outside Italy that might result in corporate criminal liability and reputational risks. The EGCP applies to the Group\u2019s non-Italian companies and supplements any compliance programs adopted by the same companies, in compliance with local regulations.\n\nThe mentioned governance measures (in relation to which we refer you to the specific section of the website), together with the current body of procedures, outline an effective prevention system, which is an integral part of the Group\u2019s Internal Control System.\n\nIn 2017 Enel SpA was among the first companies in the world to obtain certification of the conformity of its anti-bribery management system to international standard ISO 37001:2016 (\u201cAnti-Bribery Management System\u201d). This certification was issued following an independent verification process, carried out by a primary accredited certification body, which was carried out in two separate phases, aimed primarily at certifying the adequacy of the design of the Enel anti-bribery management system (in terms of governance, roles, and responsibilities, control procedures, etc.), and secondarily at assessing the level of application and effectiveness.\n\nAfter Enel SpA obtained certification ISO 37001 for its anti-bribery management system, it gradually extended the 37001 certification plan to the Group\u2019s main Italian and foreign subsidiaries, guaranteeing maintenance of the certification already obtained.\n\nEnel for respect of human rights\n\nOur corporate strategy is articulated around the core concept of contributing to building a fairer and more inclusive society throughout the entire value chain, protecting the environment in which we live and creating opportunities for the future for the Company and for our stakeholders.\n\nOur commitment to respect for human rights is the common thread that guides our activities, fully integrated in our purpose and throughout our corporate values. Specifically, Enel promotes respect for all internationally recognized human rights in the area of its business relations and it requires adoption of the same principles by contractors, suppliers, and commercial partners, with special attention to high-risk contexts or conflict situations.\n\nTo ensure optimal respect for our commitments, in 2020 we launched a new due diligence phase in order to guarantee constant monitoring of operations related to the entire value chain through the revision of the existing procedures and processes. The areas of improvement and action plans were finalized in the initial months of 2021 and will be completed within 2022. A total of around 170 actions have been planned, covering 100% of operations and sites.\n\nA new specific methodology will be defined on the global level to apply the due diligence to human rights to single assets, and also integrations of the existing procedures will be assessed in order to extend the assessment to our financial partners.\n\nIn confirmation of our commitment, in 2020 approximately 1.5 million training hours were delivered on sustainability topics (up by 29.4% compared to the prior year), of which human rights are a fundamental part; specifically, the courses mainly addressed environmental and worker health and safety issues, with an average of 21.7 hours of training per capita, representing an increase with respect to the 2019 figure (16.5 hours). Also available is an online training course dedicated to the topic of human rights, with which Enel engages all people in the Company by sharing experiences and best practices that highlight the key role of human rights. In 2020 more than 5 thousand training hours were delivered on human rights topics, by means of a dedicated online course.\n\nTransparency and ethics are core elements for our Company, which is why we collect and analyze feedback received from our stakeholders. As stated in the stakeholder reports section, all violations or suspected violations can be reported, also anonymously, by means of a single platform at Group level (\u201cEthics Point\u201d), which is accessible at www.enel.ethicspoint.com.\n\nPROTECT: our commitment\n\nIn 2013 the Company adopted the Policy on Human Rights, approved by the Board of Directors of Enel SpA and of each of its subsidiaries. A commitment that strengthens and deepens the values and pillars of corporate ethics based on the Code of Ethics, on the Zero Tolerance for Corruption Plan and on the Model 231.\n\nThe policy references the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPR) approach \u2013 \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d \u2013 and the principles outlined by the OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises, designed to promote sustainable management of the business model, and by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Declaration of the International Labour Organization on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\n\nBy adopting these principles and standards, Enel promotes respect of all internationally recognized human rights, including opposition to human trafficking, equal remuneration, and the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Policy identifies eight principles, considered to be those of the greatest impact for the Group\u2019s operations, classifying them in two macro-issues \u2013 labor practices and community relations \u2013 that all Enel SpA people and those of its subsidiaries must respect in the pursuit of their activities. Enel also promotes respect for said principles in the context of all its business relations and compliance with the same standards by its contractors, suppliers, and commercial partners, paying special attention to high-risk or conflict-affected contexts.\n\nThe Policy also outlines a governance system which is entrusted with the tasks of implementing and monitoring the activities defined by the Group for the protection and respect of human rights. The tasks include the adoption of a process of due diligence on human rights.\nIn particular:\n> acting through the Control and Risks Committee and the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, the Board of Directors is responsible for examining the main company rules and procedures connected to the Internal Control and Risk Management System of relevance in relation to stakeholders \u2013 among which we mention in particular the Organizational and Management Model implemented pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01, the Code of Ethics, the \u2018Zero Tolerance for Corruption\u2019 Plan and the Policy on Human Rights \u2013 and submit the documents in question to the approval of the Board of Directors, assessing possible subsequent amendments or integrations;\n> the Innovability Function, and, in particular, the Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights unit, is responsible for managing the positioning on human rights and the associated internal and external communication activities concerning the actions taken, and integrating the Policy on Human Rights in corporate processes and guaranteeing the execution of due diligence activities. Moreover, on an annual basis it reports Enel\u2019s performance with respect to the commitments assumed in relation to human rights in the Group Sustainability Report;\n> the various company units are responsible for implementing the Policy on Human Rights in their respective areas of competence.\n\n**RESPECT: the due diligence process**\n\nAs required by the UN guidelines and based on the Policy principles, Enel has developed a specific process of due diligence of human rights across the entire value chain in the different countries in which it operates. In line with the international reference standards, the process is broken down into four phases:\n\n1. **Assessment of the perceived risk**\n   By consulting significant stakeholders and experts in the various sectors, namely civil society, and academic institutions, originating from the various contexts in which the Company operates, Enel has conducted a context analysis to better identify the issues concerning human rights and the most significant connected risks. Specifically, consultations were held with direct and indirect workers, representatives of indigenous populations and local communities, trade unions and local institutions.\n   The topics included in the Policy on Human Rights were then classified based on the perceived risk level, calculated taking into consideration the seriousness and probability of an effective violation.\n\n2. **Gap analysis**\n   A gap analysis was performed based on the perceived risk assessment aimed at evaluating the practices and policies adopted to protect human rights in all Group countries. In particular, interviews were conducted with top management and the various areas of the value chain were analyzed in relation to more than 100 indicators. The assessment considered the four parameters of the operative principles defined by the UNGP:\n   > issues relating to bribery and environmental impacts have a \u201chigh-priority risk\u201d score, requiring companies to implement advanced control and monitoring mechanisms;\n   > issues strictly connected to labor practices (freedom of association and collective bargaining, rejection of forced labor and child labor, dissemination of just and favorable working conditions, health and safety in the workplace, diversity, and inclusion) and to the mitigation of impacts on local communities are assessed as \u201crisk to control\u201d. Protection of local communities is more relevant in South American countries, in line with the results of the previous assessment cycle;\n   > the topic of health and safety in the workplace continues to be perceived as a critical area to control and monitor in all Group countries.\n\nThis analysis led to the following conclusions:\n> issues relating to bribery and environmental impacts have a \u201chigh-priority risk\u201d score, requiring companies to implement advanced control and monitoring mechanisms;\n> adoption of human rights due diligence process;\n> preparation of a plan of action to remedy any gaps identified by the due diligence process;\n> adaptation to match local context and regulations.\n\nFurthermore, the significant information of the due diligence process and the Group\u2019s commitment to respect human rights are provided in compliance with the UNGP Reporting Framework.\n\nBy means of the management system due diligence activity, the Company is in a position to evaluate 100% of the policies and operational procedures adopted for execution of its direct and indirect operations (e.g. operations concerning the entire value chain and those connected to the establishment of new business relations).\n\nThe analysis showed that Enel has a robust set of mechanisms and management systems to protect against possible human rights violations, so the identified risks can be adequately managed.\nValue for Disability: the achievement of sustainable development goals by, for, and with people with disabilities\n\nDevelopment inclusive of disability is an essential condition for a sustainable future. In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda, undertaking to make sure no one gets left behind. This therefore calls for a tangible action to include the one billion people with disabilities in the world, constituting 15% of the entire population, both as agents and beneficiaries of development.\n\nDisability and Policy on Human Rights\n\nDiversity in general and disability in particular are among the topics in the Enel Policy on Human Rights and they are subject to the related due diligence. In 2020, a detailed analysis was carried out on the topic of disability, engaging nine categories of stakeholders including employees, suppliers, customers, social partners, and institutions; through the administration of more than 2 thousand questionnaires in 15 countries. The results were subsequently examined with the support of external experts, categorized in four clusters (accessibility, governance, product & facility design, normative framework) and the risk perception of stakeholders was defined in relation to the topic in accordance with a scale of the perceived risk level (high risk, high-priority risk, medium risk, and low risk). The aspects linked to accessibility and governance were considered to be high priority, but they simultaneously reflected the effective adoption of best practices accompanied by a significant awareness raising campaign.\n\n\u201cValuable 500\u201d and \u201cValue for Disability\u201d\n\nParticipation in 2019 in the \u201cValuable 500\u201d initiative gave rise in 2020 to the global \u201cValue for Disability\u201d project aimed at promoting full inclusion of people with disabilities in Enel, in the communities in which we operate, and among our customers. Our strategy is aimed at freeing the potential of disability in terms of organizational development, business, and innovation opportunities of the context. Specifically, the project aim is to valorize the abilities of each individual, placing them in relation with the specific social, structural, and organizational factors of each area. This relational perspective also resulted in the creation of new analytical tools designed to highlight the needs of the individual and the possible inclusion actions available to the Company.\n\nThe project was organized and managed by an internal PMO that coordinated the work of multifunction teams, engaging people from the various countries in which the Group operates. The global team and local teams were set up by representatives of the Sustainability, People and Organization, and Global Digital Solutions Functions together with the Market and Enel X area. Communications and all the Business Lines. Furthermore, the Country focal points for disability already present in the Company and the creation of local Disability Communities were fundamental in relation to their role of collecting needs, developing and testing the proposed solutions.\n\nAssociations were consulted, the current proposals of existing businesses in the world were tested by means of scouting and a learning tour with other companies and, finally, an internal training initiative made it possible to create a common language for all the countries involved. The project considered the main results that emerged during the due diligence process of the human rights management system and, in particular, those related to the perceived risk analysis carried out in the single countries. This analysis made it possible to:\n\n- contextualize the different sensitivities of the main stakeholders interviewed in relation to the disability topic;\n- define analysis clusters (Governance, Product Design, Customer Care) to catalogue the best practices present internally and on the market.\n\nThe global disability action plan was presented to the Enel Board of Directors and the specific local action plans were presented to the various Country Managers.\n\nThe commitment on the disability topic was also valorized in the new version of the Code of Ethics, which introduced an explicit reference to the topic of accessibility (see Code of Ethics section) and also in the 2021-2023 Sustainability Plan. For further details, refer to the chapters: \u201cOur people\u201d, \u201cElectrification, digital and platforms\u201d and \u201cLocal and global community\u201d.\n\nBy means of the due diligence activity in relation to the management system, the Company can assess 100% of the policies and operational procedures adopted in order to identify the risks of its direct and indirect operations (e.g. new acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, etc.).\n\nREMEDY: Improvement plans\n\nThe perceived risk assessment, together with the gap analysis, makes it possible to assess the residual risk and define any improvement actions required. Specific action plans have therefore been developed for each country of presence, as well as a centrally managed improvement plan to harmonize and integrate, at the global level, processes and policies to be applied at the local level. A total of around 170 actions have been planned, covering 100% of operations and sites. The plans were launched at the start of 2021 and are scheduled for completion within 2022.\n\nBelow, we give several examples of targeted actions in the single countries in which the Group operates:\n\n- in Italy integration of Infrastructure and Networks business development policies;\n- in Russia: development of specific training activities;\n- in Argentina: internal awareness raising campaigns;\n- in Brazil: definition of an operating instruction in order to assess management of human rights of partners and sub-tier suppliers;\n- in Chile: campaigns for communication with external stakeholders and, especially, with local community representatives.\n\nLabor rights issues are generally perceived as lower risk and also the related control measures and processes are in compliance with both the principles of the main international guidelines and with the Group\u2019s internal policies. Notwithstanding, several minor areas of improvement were identified, as shown schematically in the table below:\n\n| Topics | Average perceived risk | System to protect human rights | Main policies and procedures to protect human rights | SDG |\n|--------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----|\n| Freedom of association and collective bargaining | to control | Robust | The contracts considered overall regulate labor conditions, clearly defining workers\u2019 rights (working hours, remuneration, overtime, indemnity, benefits). Each worker is guaranteed a translated employment contract in his/her native language. Human resources management systems and procedures guarantee the absence of minors in the workforce. Also apprenticeship projects and school-work experience models are carried out. | 8 |\n| Rejection of forced labor | to control | Robust | For details, consult the \u2018Our people\u2019 chapter. | 5, 10 |\n| Fair and favorable working conditions | to control | Robust | For details, consult the \u2018Occupational health and safety\u2019 chapter. | 3 |\n| Community relations | to control | Robust | For details, consult the \u2018Local and global communities\u2019 chapter. | 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 |\n| Environmental impacts | high priority | Robust | For details, consult the \u2018Environmental sustainability\u2019 chapter. | 13 |\n| Corruption | high priority | Robust | For details, consult the \u2018Active and passive anti-corruption\u2019 section. | 16 |\n\nAverage perceived risk: average perceived risk levels identified in the Countries under analysis.\nReference scale of risks: 1. High risk; 2. High-priority risk; 3. Risk to control; 4. Acceptable risk.\nReference scale of performance values: Robust (75%-100%); Good (50%-75%); Sufficient (25%-50%); To be improved (0%-25%).\nSecurity and human rights\n\nIn line with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, Enel is committed to ensuring that the private security forces working to protect Group personnel and property in the operating areas act in compliance with the applicable national laws and international rules and standards, while simultaneously encouraging public law enforcement agencies to act in the same manner (paragraph 2.2.1 of Enel\u2019s Policy on Human Rights). In general, according to national regulations, the security service can only be assigned to public forces, or to private forces in the absence of legislative provisions. Security management in Enel is entrusted to a dedicated Holding unit and to specific units in the various countries in which the Group operates. The action principles concern:\n\n- proactivity: continuous collection of data and information for the detection and interpretation of weak signals;\n- holistic vision: integrated assessment and management of security risks for all potentially exposed assets (people, infrastructure, and intangible assets);\n- Open Power: cooperation with the Business Lines, reference institutions and other critical infrastructure operators;\n- resilience: adoption of measures to ensure operating continuity of the system and not merely its passive protection.\n\nData Protection\n\nProtection and processing of personal data are an important challenge for Enel in the era of digitalization and market globalization and also a constant commitment to ensure continuous improvement of the services we supply to our customers.\n\nTo face this challenge, according to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in 2017 Enel set up a specific unit within the Legal Function (Data Protection Office) and appointed the \u201cData Protection Officers\u201d (DPO). The DPOs are appointed based on their professional skills and knowledge and their ability to carry out the assigned tasks in accordance with the principle of independence. The Data Protection Office is structured as follows:\n\n- Data Protection Governance: monitors the evolution of data protection legislation and defines the Group\u2019s compliance. The office also carries out the role of DPO in countries in which local legislation does not require a DPO;\n- Holding and Global Service Functions Data Protection: promotes privacy by design from phase of process planning at the global level and ensures its consistent development at the national level;\n- Global Business Lines Data Protection: supports the Global Business Lines compliance concerning data protection, and monitors the evolution of data protection certification mechanisms for products and services;\n- Country units: for the protection of national data with the task of monitoring the evolution of legislation at the local level. In 2020 DPOs office were set up in South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru), alongside the European area units already in place (Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain).\n\nInternal tools were developed based on the size and complexity of Enel, in order to guarantee compliance of protection of personal data and promotion of data to foster the presence of Enel in the European data economy, including the record of personal data processing activities and data protection impact assessment (DPIA - Data Protection Impact Assessment). The DPOs implement processes and activities in compliance with applicable data protection laws and are committed to drawing up data protection agreements and clauses, planning data governance and corporate policies, providing privacy consulting in the design phase, ensuring adequate risk management by making intensive use of the DPIA and monitoring the consistency of data protection policies within the organization, especially among European and non-European legal entities.\n\nIn 2020, the Group\u2019s European companies handled more than 24 thousand communications concerning personal data protection, and customers, and collaborated with the national authorities, receiving 100 requests for information and clarifications from which two penalties emerged against the Romanian company Enel Energie Muntenia.\n\nIn Italy, Servizio Elettrico Nazionale previously reported the Authority for the Protection of Personal Data in advance an incident concerning the personal data of several ex-employees with electricity supply that occurred following a cyber attack that occurred on October 19 (refer to the \u201cCyber security incident management\u201d section). On December 23, 2020, the Authority completed the investigation of the personal data breach that was the subject of the notification and closed the case. In addition, with regard to Enel Energia, the company notified the Authority for the Protection of Personal Data of three data breaches: the first in January 2020 concerning the theft from a store of several electrically supplied contracts; the second in March 2020, due to the publication of data (personal details, contact data and contractual data from 2013) of around 3,640 customers on a website (procedure dismissed by the Data Commissioner on July 28, 2020); the third in June 2020 originating from the theft, by four ex-employees of a partner agency of Enel Energia, of copies of the contracts they managed during their term of employment.\n\nWith regard to e-distribuzione, the company notified the Authority for the Protection of Personal Data of a data breach because, in June 2020 a contractor company accidentally disclosed a database on the Internet containing the details of 400 thousand customers (name and surname, P.O.D code and address) connected to the e-distribution network.\n\nIn Romania, E-Distribu\u021bie Banat, E-Distribu\u021bie Dobrogea, E-Distribu\u021bie Muntenia, together with Enel Energie and Enel Energie Muntenia, informed the competent authority of a presumed data breach concerning customers\u2019 personal data which occurred following a cyber attack experienced on October 19 (refer to the \u201cCyber security incident management\u201d section).\n\nIn Spain, Endesa Energ\u00eda SAU and Energ\u00eda XIX suffered a personal data breach that was reported to the competent authority on April 3, 2020. Also, in Brazil, Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo logged a data breach in November 2020 related to personal data of some customers. The company immediately activated its security protocols in order to mitigate the impact of the incident. In parallel, the above company informed the competent authorities of the data breach and has also adequately informed the customers involved.\nWe pay close attention to tax issues and their social role, as well as to transparency in general as a factor for promoting sustainable development.\n\nFor the first time, we have developed a process to analyse the applicability of the European taxonomy throughout the value chain.\n\nWe report annually on the allocation in our green bonds (2017, 2018, 2019).\nEnel is an industrial group whose main activity involves energy generation, distribution and sales. The choice of countries where the Group operates is guided by business assessments and not by tax reasons.\n\n**Tax strategy**\n\nSince 2017, the Enel Group has adopted a tax strategy, as a set of principles and guidelines inspired by values of transparency and legality, which is published on the website: www.enel.com. The Group\u2019s subsidiaries are required to adopt the tax strategy approved by the Parent Company, thereby assuming the responsibility of ensuring it is acknowledged and applied.\n\n**Tax strategy objectives**\n\nEnel SpA\u2019s Board of Directors sets out the tax strategy of the entire Group, with the aim of ensuring uniform tax management for all entities involved. The strategy is underpinned by the following approach:\n\n- correct and timely determination and settlement of taxes due under the law and implementation of the respective obligations;\n- correct management of the tax risk, which is the risk incurred for the violation of tax rules or abuse of the principles and purposes of the tax system.\n\n**Tax strategy principles**\n\nThe tax strategy principles are the guidelines for Group companies underpinning their business operations when managing the fiscal variable. The principles also require suitable processes to be adopted to ensure their effectiveness and application.\n\n**Values:** in line with its sustainability strategy, the Group acts in accordance with the values of honesty and integrity in its tax management, being well aware that tax revenue is one of the main sources of contribution to economic and social development of the countries where it operates.\n\n**Legality:** the Group pursues behavior geared towards compliance with the applicable tax rules and is committed to interpreting them in a way that respects both the substance and form.\n\n**Tone at the top:** the Board of Directors has the role and responsibility of leading the dissemination of a corporate culture based on the values of honesty and integrity and the principle of legality.\n\n**Transparency:** the Group maintains collaborative and transparent relations with tax authorities, enabling them \u2013 among other things \u2013 to gain a full understanding of the facts underlying the application of tax rules.\n\n**Shareholder value:** the Group considers tax to be a business cost and, as such, believes that it must be managed in compliance with the principle of legality, with the aim of safeguarding the Group\u2019s assets and pursuing the primary interest of creating value for shareholders in the medium to long term.\n\n**Governance**\n\nEnel SpA ensures that the tax strategy is acknowledged and applied within the Company through the governance bodies. Its interpretation is left to the Parent Company, through the Tax unit, which also manages its periodic updates.\n\n**Compliance**\n\nThe Group entities must respect the principle of legality, by swiftly applying the tax laws of the countries where the Group operates, to ensure that the wording, spirit and purpose of the applicable tax rule or system is respected. Moreover, the Enel Group does not undertake behaviors or domestic or cross-border operations that result in purely artificial constructions, that do not reflect the economic reality and from which it is reasonable to expect undue tax advantages, where they conflict with the purpose or spirit of tax provisions or system in question and give rise to double deduction, deduction/non-inclusion or double non-taxation, including as a result of any divergence between the tax systems of different jurisdictions.\n\n**Intercompany transactions**\n\nAll intercompany transactions follow a transfer pricing policy, which has been adopted by the Enel Group in line with the arm\u2019s length principle, an international standard established by the Model Tax Convention and referred to in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (hereinafter also referred to as the \u201cOECD Guidelines\u201d). Intercompany relations are structured at market prices and conditions, ensuring value creation in the places where the Group conducts its business. In order to minimize tax risks, and in line with the applicable regulations, the Enel Group encourages the signing of rulings (Advance Pricing Agreements \u2013 APAs) with local tax authorities on establishing transfer pricing determination methods, on attributing gains and losses to permanent establishments and on applying rules on cross-border flows between Group entities.\n\nFor **intercompany financial transactions**, the Enel Group has adopted a centralized financial model for its subsidiaries, which requires the Group\u2019s two financial companies, Enel Finance International (EFI) and Enel Finance America (EFA), to centralize part of the treasury activities and access to financial markets, and to act as the primary point of reference for the management of the financial or liquidity needs generated by operating entities. These intercompany payables may be recorded either at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method, or at fair value as required by IFRS 13.\n\nBased on the OECD Guidelines, the pricing method to be used to test the arm\u2019s length nature of a transaction between associated companies is one which is based on the facts and circumstances of the transaction under analysis and which is able to provide the most reliable measure in line with the market.\n\nWhere transactions with comparable characteristics can be identified on the open market (e.g. indexation, maturity, amortization schedule), the comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method is the most direct and reliable method for applying the arm\u2019s length principle. This method is therefore preferred over any other in such cases.\n\nAs such, the Group has put internal policies in place to support the methods set out in the OECD Guidelines, whereby the CUP method is applied in the first instance.\nLow-tax jurisdictions\n\nThe Group does not invest in or through countries considered to be tax havens for the sole purpose of reducing its tax burden. Such investments may only be proposed if they are supported by sound economic/strategic reasons and have the aim of developing the activities included in the Group\u2019s corporate purpose.\n\nIf, in circumstantial situations (for example, in the event of third-party purchases of a group of companies), structures were found to have been created for the sole purpose of reducing the tax burden or in areas deemed to be tax havens, the Group \u2013 failing any viable economic/strategic reasons other than mere tax savings \u2013 will commit to removing such structures as quickly as possible.\n\nTax incentives\n\nTax incentives are a key, development-oriented mechanism for economic policy, which countries use to stimulate growth and attract investment to support the national policy. The use of tax incentives generally results in a reduction of long-term tax liabilities. Some countries where the Enel Group operates offer various incentives. The Enel Group only uses widely applicable tax incentives for all operators, respecting all specific regulations, where the incentives are in line with its industrial and operational objectives and are consistent with the economic substance of its investments.\n\nTax governance, control and risk management\n\nGovernance body\n\nIn Enel\u2019s organizational model, the Holding Company\u2019s Tax Affairs unit is tasked \u2013 among other things \u2013 with developing the Group\u2019s tax strategy, identifying, analyzing and managing the various optimization initiatives, monitoring the key tax issues and providing its support to the various Business Lines. Alongside the Holding Function, the Tax Affairs units of the various countries \u2013 acting in accordance with the values and principles of the tax strategy set out by the Holding Company \u2013 are responsible for managing compliance, tax planning and tax monitoring at local level.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Enel Group has adopted a set of rules, procedures and standards which are part of the Group\u2019s wider organization and control system and which are considered key points of reference that all parties, depending on their type of relationship with the Group, are required to observe. The various policies and procedures applicable both at Group level and country level govern the activities, as well as their management procedures and Tax Affairs responsibilities including in relation to other corporate Functions. These documents are published on the company Intranet and are accessible to all Enel people; they form the general rules of conduct applicable within the Group when carrying out activities. Specifically in relation to taxation, in addition to the tax strategy there are specific organizational documents \u2013 both at global and local level \u2013 regarding the processes of tax compliance, tax planning, tax monitoring, transfer pricing and tax risk management.\n\nThe general principle is that the Tax units must be the appropriate size and equipped with the necessary skills to perform the role of a decision-making analysis centre within the governance and business processes, in addition to the role of overseeing performance. For this purpose, specific and ongoing training initiatives on tax issues at both country and global level are set up, with recurring meetings between all of the Group\u2019s Tax Managers in order to ensure the appropriate alignment.\n\nTax risks\n\nThe Group has a Tax Control Framework (TCF) whose main aim is to provide the Tax units with a single and consistent set of guidance for adopting a correct and effective approach to tax risk management within the Group. The framework sets out guidelines and methodological rules so as to consistently assess, monitor and manage the relevant tax risk for the Group companies, in accordance with the principles and guidelines set out by the tax strategy and Tax Risk Policy, and in the awareness that the Group companies operating in different jurisdictions must adopt the TCF with respect for the specific corporate context and domestic regulations of each individual country in question.\n\nIn this regard, the Group has adopted a Tax Risk Policy whose main objective is to provide unambiguous and consistent guidance to the tax units when implementing the TCF at local level. In accordance with the established principles and guidelines, the Enel Group aims to proactively manage the tax risk and believes that adopting a TCF can ensure the timely detection, correct measurement and control of the risk tax.\n\nThe task of the TCF is to identify the sources of tax risk for the purpose of compliance interpreting tax regulations, while mapping out the respective processes and activities in order to form a network of risk detectors, to be associated with the resulting control measures. In particular, as the set of detectors and control measures identify sources of risk, the TCF can perform a broad spectrum of control. As such, any materialization of the tax risk can be intercepted and managed by each Tax unit in question.\n\nThe effectiveness and ongoing updates of the TCF are ensured through periodic monitoring of the risk mapping, regular internal audit processes, as well as through the tax authority systems set out under cooperative compliance regimes (where implemented).\n\nThe results from the monitoring of tax risks are periodically brought to the attention of the competent Functions and corporate bodies, including to establish the most appropriate way to mitigate such risks. With regard to significant uncertain tax positions, reference should be made to the information and comments provided in the Integrated Annual Report 2020.\n\nMechanism for stakeholder reports\n\nFor the Enel Group, tax compliance is considered a key aspect of the Company\u2019s ethical and responsible management. As such, the violations that can be reported through the Company\u2019s internal channels also include those relating to tax. The Group\u2019s Code of Ethics is the framework of \u201cethical management\u201d in which Enel operates, also tying in fully with the tax strategy. There are appropriate provisions on Code of Ethics violations to ensure its effective implementation, and these requirements must also be considered to cover the provisions of the tax strategy.\n\nTransparent relationship with stakeholders\n\nThe Enel Group ensures transparency and integrity in its relations with tax authorities, in the event of audits on both the Group companies and third parties. To consolidate this transparency with tax authorities, the Enel Group promotes engagement in co-operative compliance schemes for companies that integrate the requirements of their respective domestic regulations in order to reinforce their relations. It also complies with the transfer pricing documentation provisions in accordance with OECD Guidelines, taking the \u201cthree-tiered approach\u201d which is divided into Master File, Local File and Country-by-Country Report. Moreover, to avoid double taxation, the Group promotes mutual agreement procedures for the settlement of international disputes (Mutual Agreement Procedure \u2013 MAP), which have the direct involvement of tax authorities from the contracting countries. Lastly, Enel consistently acts with a transparent and collaborative approach with institutions and associations to support the development of effective tax systems in the various countries where it operates.\n\nIn 2019, Enel joined the European Business Tax Forum (EBTF), an association operating since 2017 that aims to open up a public debate on taxation by providing a balanced and comprehensive perspective of the taxes paid by companies. In view of this objective, tax information is provided to the various stakeholders. The Forum has published two studies relating to the EU/EFTA Total Tax Contribution for the years 2018 and 2019, which are available on the association\u2019s website (https://ebtforum.org) and which report the aggregate data for the various types of taxes paid by the largest European multinational companies by turnover and/\nor by stock market capitalization, as well as for the year 2019, a dedicated section with Country-by-Country Reporting.\n\nReporting\n\nActing with honesty and integrity is one of the main cornerstones of our tax strategy, as is our commitment to transparency. The publication of Country-by-Country Reporting integrates with the detail of our overall tax contribution in the main economies in which the Group operates (hereafter also \u201cTax Transparency Report\u201d), underlines the importance that the Group attributes to tax related topics, to their social role and, in general, to transparency as a factor that facilitates sustainable development.\n\nThe approach followed also aims to eliminate potential ambiguities that may derive from complex accounting and tax treatments, while supporting and, at the same time, improving other annual financial information and continuing along a pathway targeted at supplying an increasingly in-depth and clear vision of our tax position.\n\nAs of 2018 (2018-2017), we have adopted a Total Tax Contribution model for the main countries where we operate, providing evidence of taxes paid and withheld.\n\nBeginning 2020, on the other hand, we adopted an integrated model, the Tax Transparency Report. This is prepared consistently with the rules provided for under OSCE Country-by-Country Reporting and includes information and data for Total Tax Contributions in the main countries where we are present.\n\nThe integrated model of the Tax Transparency Report is available on our site (https://www.enel.com/en/investors1/sustainability-performance). The Group believes that this model ensures a broad vision and a detailed measurement of the organization\u2019s contributions to economic and social development in the regions/countries in which it operates.\n\nTax Transparency Report \u2013 principles\n\nThe Tax Transparency Report adopts the cash criterion as a general principle for representing tax data, considering it to be the most adequate for disclosing the actual tax contribution.\n\nMore specifically, the total tax data, as defined and detailed in what follows, is determined through the various taxes paid by all the entities in the scope of each tax jurisdiction in the year subject to reporting, regardless of the tax year to which the taxes refer.\n\nAs anticipated previously, on applying an approach adopted by the OCSE, the Tax Transparency Report classifies the different taxes into categories and distinguishes them between those that constitute an expense for a company (taxes borne) and those that the company pays due to rebate mechanisms, substitution etc. (taxes collected) but, at any rate, are the result of the company\u2019s own economic activities.\n\nSpecifically, taxes, both borne and collected, are classified into the following five macro categories.\n\n- **Profit \u2013 Income taxes**: this category includes taxes on company profits that can be both borne (e.g. corporate income tax that may be levied on State or local level, trade tax on business profits, solidarity surcharge as well as taxes withheld at source and collected in the case where they are applied to a third party or to a physical person (e.g. withholding taxes on interest income, royalties, subcontractors and suppliers).\n- **Property \u2013 Property taxes**: taxes on the ownership, use or transfer of tangible or intangible property. This category includes both taxes borne (e.g. taxes on ownership and use of property; capital tax levied on share capital increase, transfer taxes on the acquisition or disposal of assets, net wealth and capital transactions; registration duties; stamp duties related to transfer of real estate; stamp duty on share transfers; tax on financial operation slevied on transactions involving foreign loans or financing, etc.) and taxes collected (e.g. rental of business duty collected by the lessor and paid to the government).\n- **Employment tax**: this category generally includes taxes on employment, including those on income tax and social security payments. Taxes levied on the employer are considered taxes borne (e.g. social security contributions, health insurance, pensions, disability contributions), while taxes levied on the employee are considered as taxes collected (e.g. personal income tax or social security contributions levied on the employee which are normally withheld by the employer).\n- **Products \u2013 Taxes on products and services**: indirect taxes levied on production, sale or use of goods and services, including taxes and duties levied on international trade and transactions. This category includes taxes that can be paid by businesses with reference to their own consumption of goods and services, notwithstanding that these may be paid to the supplier of the goods and services, rather than directly to the government. This category includes both taxes borne (e.g. consumption tax, turnover tax; excise duties; customs duties; import duties; taxes on insurance contracts; taxes on the use and ownership of motor vehicles; unrecoverable VAT) and taxes collected (e.g. net VAT paid).\n- **Planet \u2013 Environmental taxes**: taxes levied on the supply, use or consumption of goods and services considered harmful to the environment. Examples of taxes borne are: taxes on the value of the electricity production, taxes on the production of nuclear fuels and carbon tax and of taxes collected: tax on electricity and tax on hydrocarbons.\n\nFurthermore, the financial-equity data represented follow the accounting requirements below.\n\nSource of the data: the data represented in the report are expressed on the basis of IFRS-EU accounting principles adopted by the Group and are at stand-alone entity level. Subsequently, these are aggregated by tax jurisdiction. To take account of intercompany relations, the data are represented according to logic of aggregation by tax jurisdiction (that is, in the Country in which the entities are resident, which is also the country with fiscal autonomy) and not a logic of consolidation.\n\nEntities within the scope: falling within the scope of the report are all those companies consolidated using the full consolidation method or the proportional method (hereafter also \u201centity within the scope\u201d) on the basis of accounting principles used for the drafting of the Consolidated Financial Statements on the part of the Ultimate Parent Entity (Enel SpA).\n\nWith reference to the list of companies in the Group and their activities, please refer to the specific prospectus in the Integrated Annual Report 2020.\n\nCurrency: the report considers the euro as the currency of reference.\n\n(2) See the circular Assonime (Association of Italian Joint Stock Companies) no. 1/2021. Gli obblighi di trasparenza in materia di tassazione nelle dichiarazioni non finanziarie secondo GRI 207 (Transparency obligations in the matter of taxation in Non Financial Disclosures according to standard GRI 207), in which it is clarified that it is possible to make reference to Country-by-Country reports sent to the Agenzia delle Entrate (Italian Revenue Agency) made public voluntarily even if they are related to the preceding tax period with respect to the time period considered in the Non-Financial Disclosure. In this regard, the Group has decided to report the information for the current year prepared consistently with the rules provided for under OSCE Country-by-Country Reporting, actually anticipating by a year the activities required for tax reporting.\n\n(3) Beginning 2018, the Enel Group presented the Country-by-Country Reports for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. This was by way of transmission thereof to the Italian Agenzia delle Entrate which in turn supplied them to the other States with which an agreement is in force for the exchange of information. In compliance with the indications of Action 13 of the BEPS project, as amended, Action 13 is a project in which the OCSE and the countries of the G20 have participated to reply to the need for a more effective exchange of information in tax matters. The Group has decided to report the information for the current year prepared consistently with the rules provided for under OSCE Country-by-Country Reporting, actually anticipating by a year the activities required for tax reporting.\n\n(4) The data for taxes paid includes payments on account, taxes related for previous years, including after assessments, net of refunds obtained. Interest and penalties are not considered.\n\n(5) Working Paper no. 32. \u201cLegal tax liability: remittance responsibility and tax existence\u201d.\n\n(6) In line with the reporting criteria applied to Revenues and to Profit (listed before taxes explained below) the data only for income taxes paid excludes the portion of some concerning dividends paid by the companies within the scope, as also indicated by the OCSE in the report \u2018Towards multilateral implementation of Country-by-Country Reporting\u2019 published in December 2018, point 1.7.\n\n(7) However, the companies consolidated using the equity method are excluded. Furthermore, the data of Permanent Establishments are reported in the jurisdiction of their operations and not in the jurisdiction of residence of associated companies. Therefore, the data of the latter do not include the data of the Permanent Establishment. Finally, all Statelike companies of the Enel Group are flow-through entities incorporated in the same Country in which income is imputed and is effectively taxed in the partner company (e.g. the United States).\n\n(8) See Assonime circular no. 1/2021. Gli obblighi di trasparenza in materia di tassazione nelle dichiarazioni non finanziarie secondo standard GRI 207 (Transparency obligations in the matter of taxation in Non-Financial Disclosures according to standard GRI 207), where it is clarified that it is possible to make reference to other sources known as \u201ccorporate reporting\u201d such as the Directors\u2019 Report in the Consolidated Financial Statements on the part of the Group companies and their main activities, and the Directors\u2019 Report or other sections of the NPD with regard to information already contained therein on uncertain tax positions and on any other information relevant for the purposes of GRI 207.\nreference in that it is the one used by the Parent Company. Since IFRS-EU accounting data are extracted in local currencies, economic data (such as revenues, pre-tax profit, taxes accrued and taxes paid) have been converted into euro at the average exchange rate of the currency, while balance sheet data (tangible fixed assets) have been converted into the euro at the exchange rate in force at year\u2019s end.\n\nThird party revenues: the sum of revenues from third parties accounted for by the entities within the scope in the pertinent tax jurisdiction in the year of reference. The term \u201crevenues\u201d is understood in the broadest possible sense to include all revenues, including those from extraordinary operations.\n\nCross-border intercompany revenues: the sum of revenues from transactions carried out between entities within the scope resident in different jurisdictions in the tax year of reference, including income from extraordinary operations and excluding dividends(10).\n\nProfit (Loss) before income taxes: the sum of Profits (Losses) before income taxes generated in the year of reference and of all entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction. The Profits (Losses) before income taxes must include all items involving revenues and extraordinary expenses(11).\n\nCorporate income tax accrued (current taxes): the sum of current taxes (i.e. for the current year) on taxable income in the year of reference of all entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction, independent of whether they have been paid. The data for these does not take account of provisions for tax debts that are not yet certain as regards either their amount or existence, of adjustment of current taxes for previous years and of prepaid and deferred taxes.\n\nTangible assets: the sum of net accountable values of tangible fixed assets resulting from the balance sheet, of all entities within the scope in each tax jurisdiction(12).\n\nNumber of employees and remuneration: the number of employees at the end of the period considering all the entities within the scope; conversely, as regards their remuneration, please see the Sustainability Report as well as the Tax Transparency Report.\n\nTax Transparency Report \u2013 general analysis\n\nThe total tax contribution (TTC)(13) with respect to all the countries in which we operate in 2020 was 16,099.9 million euros, down 2,295.3 million euros (-12.5%) compared to 2019.\n\nThe distribution of the overall contribution in the various countries in which the Group operates is given in the following table, with 89% concentrated in Italy, Spain and Brazil, which represent about 80% of Group revenues.\n\n(10) Specifically, also included are: (i) other income, (ii) all extraordinary income/expense, (iii) capital gains from the sale of real estate, unrealized capital gains/capital losses and 3% financial income (with the exception of dividends from other companies within the scope) or any extraordinary item. Revenues from income taxes (deriving from deferred tax liabilities or from tax consolidation) are excluded.\n\n(11) Revenues do not include payments received from other entities within the scope that are considered dividends in the tax jurisdiction of the paying subject.\n\n(12) Consistent with the reporting criteria applied to Revenues, Profits (Losses) before income taxes are indicated net of dividends paid by the companies within the scope (as also indicated by the OCSE in the report \u201cGuidance on the Implementation of Country-by-Country Reporting\u201d published in 2018, point 1/7).\n\n(13) Tangible fixed assets do not include cash and cash equivalents, intangible assets or financial assets.\n\nThe total tax contribution (TTC) with respect to all the countries in which we operate in 2020 was 16,099.9 million euros, down 2,295.3 million euros (-12.5%) compared to 2019.\nThe effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have influenced the demand for electricity and gas and, consequently, the total tax contribution. Despite the difficult economic conditions, the results of the analysis show that the tax contribution of the Enel Group in the main countries in which it is present remain very significant. In this context, characterized by a slow-down in growth in economies the world over and by the increase in the rate of unemployment, taxes linked to revenues/profits go down before those linked to property and employment, the latter also due to unemployment benefits introduced by many governments. From the general analysis of the data of the total contribution of the Group divided into the five tax categories, the following can be highlighted: a tendential stability in property taxes and taxes on employment, the latter also underlying the stable approach that the Company has had towards its employees in this particular historical period; a reduction of income taxes and taxes on products and services, since these are linked to revenues and to production and consumption, all down in the same period. Environmental taxes remain stable despite the reduction in production and consumption of commodities due to increases decided upon by different governments in the context of their respective tax rates. In general, the significant value of taxes paid highlights once again the importance of the Group\u2019s tax contribution to the communities in which it operates as support for their stability and resilience, an element that is even more necessary to meet the new needs that have emerged due to Covid-19.\n\n### TAXES BORNE (mil euros)\n\n| Category                  | 2020       | 2019       | 2020 \u2260 2019 |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Income taxes              | 1,586.9    | 1,891.9    | -160.4      |\n| Property taxes            | 768.8      | 779.7      | -10.9       |\n| Taxes on labour           | 800.5      | 1,028.9    | -228.3      |\n| Taxes on products and services | 460.6    | 495.5      | -34.9       |\n| Environmental taxes       | 4,761.7    | 5,179.5    | -417.8      |\n\nIn 2020, the Total Taxes Borne\\(^{(14)}\\) amounted to 4,244.6\\(^{(15)}\\) million euros, down by 517.1 million euros (-10.9%) overall compared to 2019, essentially due to the reduction of income taxes and taxes on products and services, respectively 305.0 and 228.3 million euros in 2020. In contrast, an increase in environmental taxes is registered 32.3 million euros prevalently due to the introduction of new types of such taxes and to the increase in the rates of those already existing.\n\nThe payment of income taxes is down overall by 305.0 million euros. The most significant reductions are in Spain (348.7 million euros) and Chile (110.3 million euros) due to the effect of (i) refunds obtained for excess taxes prepaid in previous financial years, (ii) write-downs due mainly to the process of decarbonization not deducted fiscaally in 2019 in Spain\\(^{(16)}\\), and (iii) tax measures introduced by local authorities to support companies following Covid-19 in Chile; furthermore, there were reductions in Mexico (92.5 million euros), where in 2019 one-off taxes on extraordinary transactions were paid. There were further reductions in income taxes in Peru, Panama and Russia (for an overall total of 68.6 million euros) mainly due to the reduction in income due to Covid-19. This was partially offset by an increase in income taxes in Italy of 284.3 million euros, due mainly to greater advance taxes paid in 2020 compared to 2019\\(^{(17)}\\). The reduction in taxes on products and services amounts overall to 228.3 million euros. The main reductions are in Brazil (236.5 million euros) on account of the presence of tax credits due to greater payments\\(^{(18)}\\) made in previous years and in Spain (27.7 million euros) due to a fall in electricity and gas sales linked to the already mentioned slow-down in economic activity. This was partially offset by an increase of these taxes in Italy of 32.3 million euros, which can be explained exclusively by the significant increase in excise duty on coal destined for electricity production, partially offset by the decrease in the consumption of coal as a consequence of the Group\u2019s decarbonization program.\n\n### TAXES COLLECTED (mil euros)\n\n| Category                  | 2020       | 2019       | 2020 \u2260 2019 |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Income taxes              | 1,020.8    | 1,012.9    | +7.9        |\n| Property taxes            | 442.4      | 429.5      | +12.9       |\n| Taxes on labour           | 1,012.9    | 1,028.9    | -16.0       |\n| Taxes on products and services | 1,012.9    | 1,028.9    | -16.0       |\n| Environmental taxes       | 11,855.3   | 13,633.5   | -1,778.2    |\n\nTotal Taxes Collected amount to 11,855.3 million euros, down 1,778.2 million euros (-13.0%). This reduction is due essentially to lower indirect taxes paid on account of the drop in sales and consumption of electricity caused by Covid-19. More specifically, taxes are down on products and services in Italy, Brazil and Spain, respectively by 741.9, 622.1 and 316.1 million euros and environmental taxes in Spain of 103.2 million euros.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(14)}\\) Taxes Borne are taxes that constitute a cost for a company.\n\n\\(^{(15)}\\) Taxes Borne include taxes of 1,540.5 million euros paid on the income of companies in 2020 and 1,828.1 million euros in 2019.\n\n\\(^{(16)}\\) As a result of the strategy of progressive abandonment of coal production, Spain in 2019 saw significant write-downs to the value of plants, which, on the basis of the Country\u2019s tax regulations, were not deducted, but will be in subsequent years during the useful residual life of the plants.\n\n\\(^{(17)}\\) Prepaid taxes in 2020 were calculated using the historical method and are up due to the increase in taxable income between 2018 and 2019.\n\n\\(^{(18)}\\) These are taxes destined for the Program of Social Integration (PIS) and COFINS (Contribution for the Financing of Social Security) in Brazil.\nA representative global and concise index of the Group\u2019s tax contribution from a cash perspective is:\n\n**TTC Rate** 52.3%  \n\nThe Total Tax Contribution (TTC rate) index provides a concise and complete measurement of the burden for all taxes that the business has effectively paid and is calculated as a percentage of taxes borne in relation to profit before said taxes. The TTC rate went from 63.5% in 2019 to 52.3% in 2020; the difference of 11.1% is the result both of the reduction in 2020 of Total Taxes Borne of 6171 million euros and of the increase in the same year of EBT and Tax Borne of 608.6 million euros, the latter connected mainly to the effect of greater impairments due to the process of decarbonization carried out on plants in 2019.\n\nWith regard to the corporate income tax accrued on profits/losses and in line with the best practices indicated by the OSCE, in addition to the data for taxes paid in cash the following tables also provide the data for current taxes accrued on profits/losses (2.15 billion euros) and profit before income taxes (5.41 billion euros) is 39.7%, greater than the average rate of the member States of the OSCE (33.27%)\\(^1\\).\n\nAt Group level, in FY2020 the Current Income Tax Rate determined as the ratio between corporate income taxes accrued on profits/losses (2.15 billion euros) and profit before income taxes (5.41 billion euros) is 39.7%, greater than the average rate of the member States of the OSCE (33.27%)\\(^1\\).\n\n\\(^1\\) Source OECD Stat. \u201cTable II.1.

This reconciliation is necessary given the different methods for drafting the Tax Transparency Report \u2013 which have been changed by the OSCE rules for Country-by-Country Reporting \u2013 with respect to the principles adopted for the drafting of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n| Items subject to reconciliation | Tax Transparency Report | Consolidated Financial Statements | Difference to be reconciled |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Third party revenues            | 78,896                 | 64,985                           | 13,911                      |\n| Profit (Loss) before taxes      | 5,413                  | 5,462                            | -50                         |\n| Tangible assets                 | 80,941                 | 79,602                           | 1,339                       |\n| Taxes paid                      | 1,565                  | 1,575                            | -21                         |\n\nThird party revenues\n\nThe main deviations between the data given in the Tax Transparency Report and the data in the Integrated Annual Report 2020 are:\n\n(i) Commodity management without physical delivery (-4,980 billion euros): according to international accounting principles, derivatives on commodities without physical delivery are represented in the balance sheet on the basis of net movements (revenues/expenses), while for the purposes of the Tax Transparency Report they are represented in open items;\n\n(ii) Financial income (-4,607 billion euros): economic data for financial income is treated in a specific line of profit and loss and not among revenues, as required, consequently, the application of international accounting principles (156 million euros)\\(^{(2)}\\).\n\n(iii) Wheeling system charges (-4,409 billion euros): for the purposes of the Integrated Annual Report, system charges are the responsibility of the distributing companies (taken directly to the balance sheet) while in the individual financial statements of the countries that operate on the market they are recognized in profit and loss;\n\n(iv) Dividends from Companies accounted for using the equity method (70 million euros): for the purposes of the Integrated Annual Report, dividends received from companies consolidated using the full consolidation, proportional or equity method are eliminated;\n\n(v) Other consolidation adjustments made on the basis of the application of international accounting principles (-34 million euros)\\(^{(2)}\\).\n\nProfit (Loss) before income taxes\n\nThe main deviations between the data given in the Tax Transparency Report and the data in the Integrated Annual Report 2020 are:\n\n(i) for the purposes of the Integrated Annual Report the following items are subject to elimination/elision while they are considered at the level of individual financial statements:\n\n- Impairment on consolidated equity investments using the full consolidation method (1.3 billion euros);\n- Release of funds to profit and loss (-34 million euros);\n- Intercompany gains (-1.5 million euros);\n- Dividends from companies accounted for using the equity method (-70 million euros);\n- Result of companies accounted for using the equity method (-332 million euros): equity investments in joint ventures/associates accounted for using the equity method;\n- Other consolidation adjustments made on the basis of the application of international accounting principles (-836 million euros)\\(^{(2)}\\);\n- Other minor adjustments (2 million euros).\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) They include the following specific situations listed by way of non-exhaustive example only: (i) adjustments for adaptation of value following impairment tests and consequent adjustments of depreciation and amortization; (ii) elimination of gains from intercompany sales of assets and consequent adjustments of depreciation and amortization; and (iii) accounting records for management of derivatives, at the reversal of the Cash Flow Hedge reserve for a possibly different qualification of the transaction between the stand-alone view of the companies and that of the Group.\nTangible assets\nThe main deviations between the data given in the Tax Transparency Report and the data in the Integrated Annual Report 2020 are due to Adjustments from consolidation (1.3 billion euros)\\(^{(23)}\\).\n\n| Tangible assets Tax Transparency Report | 80,841 |\n| Adjustments from consolidation | 1,339 |\n| Tangible assets Integrated Annual Report | 79,602 |\n\nIncome taxes paid\nThe data of income taxes paid for the purposes of the Integrated Annual Report is determined through the method of indirect recognition, provided for under international accounting principle IAS 7. Contrarily, the Tax Transparency Report recognizes the data for income taxes paid on the basis of information collected from the individual companies in the different tax jurisdictions, consistent with the rules laid down by the OSCE for Country-by-Country Reporting. The deviation is due to the different methods of recognizing the data and to the principles to which they refer\\(^{(24)}\\).\n\n| Taxes paid Tax Transparency Report | 1,555 |\n| Difference due to the different methods of recognition | 21 |\n| Taxes paid Integrated Annual Report | 1,576 |\n\nTax Rate\nWith reference to the reconciliation between the theoretical and actual tax rate for financial year income taxes, please refer to the analysis contained in the Integrated Annual Report 2020.\n\n\\(^{(23)}\\) Adjustments due to the effects of (i) Purchase Price Allocations made during acquisition of controlling interests in companies, (ii) impairment of cash generating units, (iii) capitalizations of financial expenses of fixed assets realized internally, (iv) elimination of any gains during the sale of intercompany fixed assets.\n\n\\(^{(24)}\\) By way of non-exhaustive example only, the differences can be related to: (i) changes during the year in the scope of consolidation; (ii) conversion of the data from a local currency to the euro in countries subject to hyperinflation and (iii) inclusion in the data of the Integrated Annual Report of taxes on dividends (but excluded from the data of the Tax Transparency Report).\nTHE EUROPEAN TAXONOMY\n\nThe European Commission has established a specific classification system to identify environmentally sustainable economic activities, acting as an important enabler to support sustainable investment and to implement the European Green Deal.\n\nBy providing appropriate definitions of the economic activities that can be considered environmentally sustainable, it is intended to create security and transparency for investors, protect private investors from greenwashing, help companies plan the transition, mitigate market fragmentation and, ultimately, bridge the sustainable investment gap.\n\nThe European taxonomy established six environmental objectives to identify environmentally sustainable economic activities: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. An economic activity is defined as environmentally sustainable if:\n\n- it makes a substantive contribution to at least one of the six environmental objectives;\n- it does no significant harm (DNSH) to the other five environmental objectives;\n- it meets minimum safeguards.\n\nIn July 2018, the European Commission established a Technical Expert Group (TEG) on sustainable finance to develop recommendations for technical screening criteria for economic activities that can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation or adaptation while avoiding significant harm to the four other environmental objectives.\n\nBased on the contribution of the TEG and a wide range of stakeholders and institutions, the taxonomy regulation was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on June 22, 2020 and entered into force on July 12, 2020.\n\nStarting from January 2022, companies which are subject to the obligation to publish a Non-Financial Declaration (NFD) must make public the share of their turnover, capital expenditure and ordinary operating expenditure that qualify as environmentally sustainable.\n\nThe taxonomy regulation further grants the European Commission the power to adopt delegated acts and acts targeted at specifying the manner in which the Group participates actively in the various consultation processes, supply input both directly, through official channels of the European Commission, and indirectly, through the different sector associations in which the Group participates.\n\nAlthough the European taxonomy regulation establishes an obligation for companies to declare compliance with the taxonomy starting from January 2022, Enel has decided to highlight this in the 2020 Sustainability Report and in the 2020 Integrated Annual Report. Further, during Capital Markets Day 2020, held last November, we presented our consolidated Capex, included in the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan, aligned with the taxonomy for a value between 80% and 90%, thanks to our substantial contribution to mitigation of climate changes.\n\nIn particular, the main comments we provided in the process of consultation, launched in December 2020, on the draft of the delegated acts concerning mitigation of and adaptation to climate changes, are as follows:\n\n- support for the threshold of greenhouse gas emissions in the generation of energy: we welcome the specific emissions limit of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh (considering the entire life cycle) as a substantial contribution to the objective of mitigating climate changes, recommended by the TEG and based on a robust scientific base. The inclusion of the generation of energy with a carbon intensity over this limit could make it difficult for the European Union to achieve its ambition of \u201cnet zero\u201d in 2050;\n- hydroelectric technology contribution to climate change mitigation objective: we believe that this technology, which ranks amongst the best performing electricity generation technologies with respect to life-cycle emissions, should be treated in the same way as the other renewable electricity generation technologies, such as wind and solar power, for which a verification of the threshold is not requested, because they are well below the specific emissions threshold of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh;\n- geothermal technology contribution to climate change mitigation objective: we believe that this technology should be exempt from life cycle analysis, in as much as there is sufficient scientific proof to show how it has a specific emissions value well below the threshold value of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh. The CO\u2082 emitted by this technology...\nis of natural origin, it is mainly a substitute for natural emissions and does not imply the combustion of fossil fuels;\n\n- integrated business value chain non fully represented: currently, the draft of the delegated acts does not include specific criteria for the segment of the sale of energy which, on the contrary, constitutes an important element of the entire value chain, and which plays a vital role in the decarbonization pathway by supporting the electrification of consumption. We suggest to also consider the retail power activity among those with eligibility criteria by requesting retailers to apply either the criteria for the electricity generation activity or the criteria for the electricity distribution activities.\n\nHow Enel adopted the European taxonomy\n\nFollowing the TEG recommendations, we developed a five-phase process through which we analyzed the applicability of the taxonomy along the entire value chain in all the countries in which we operate. The process exclusively concerned the objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation since they are the only two for which the European Commission has published the draft of criteria. The final evaluation may even undergo substantial changes on the part of the European Commission downstream of the finalization of the criteria envisaged for 2021 and 2022. The economic activities along the entire value chain were divided into the following three categories.\n\n- Eligible: economic activity that meets both of the following two conditions:\n  - it was explicitly included in the European taxonomy regulation because it contributes substantially to climate change mitigation or adaptation;\n  - it satisfies the criteria set out in the European taxonomy regulation for the two environmental objectives.\n\n- Not eligible: economic activity that meets both of the following two conditions:\n  - it was explicitly included in the European taxonomy regulation because it contributes substantially to climate change mitigation or adaptation;\n  - it does not satisfy the criteria set out in the European taxonomy regulation for the two environmental objectives.\n\n- Not covered: economic activity that:\n  - was not included in the European taxonomy regulation because it does not contribute substantially to climate change mitigation or adaptation and therefore no specific technical criteria have been developed. The European Commission believes that this type of activity may not have a significant impact on climate change mitigation/adaptation or could be integrated into the European taxonomy regulation at a later stage.\n\nThe existence of this third category makes it impossible to achieve a business model that is fully compliant with the European taxonomy criteria, since currently some activities within the electric utilities value chain are not considered to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation.\n\nAt the time of the drafting of the present report, the activities not covered by the taxonomy fall under the following business types: nuclear power (the European Commission has not yet made a statement regarding its admissibility), wholesale trading, sale of energy to final customers and several business activities developed by Enel X.\n\nEnel\u2019s process for adopting European taxonomy\n\nEU environmental objective: climate change mitigation\n\n1. Identification of economic activities\n2. Assessment of substantial contribution\n3. DSNH (Do No Significant Harm) assessment\n4. Minimum safeguards\n5. Calculation of financial metrics\n\nEnel has adopted effective Environmental Management Systems for electricity generation and distribution activities to prevent significant damage to the other environmental goals. An activity/asset level analysis will be carried out over the course of 2021 to verify compliance with all DSNHs.\n\nEnel has adopted a human rights due diligence process throughout the value chain to comply with the minimum safeguards. Further verifications will be carried out in 2021, once the delegated acts have been approved.\n\n34.8% of revenues | 80.3% of Capex | 39.9% of Opex from economic activities that make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, based on the draft delegated acts (December 2020). More details in the \u201cStatement on the alignment of Enel\u2019s business to taxonomy\u201d section.\n\n(1) The European Commission has not yet made a decision as to the eligibility of nuclear power.\n(2) % referring to net installed capacity.\n(3) Currently considered ineligible as a precautionary measure. Further assessments will be carried out in the course of 2021.\n(4) Currently considered ineligible as a precautionary measure. Further analysis will be carried out in 2021.\n(5) As a precautionary measure, only Business Lines and product clusters that fully meet the criteria have been selected as eligible, while the others have been excluded (e.g. \u201ce-home\u201d and \u201cdistributed energy\u201d).\nStatement on the alignment of Enel\u2019s business to taxonomy in 2019 and 2020\n\nFor the purposes of processing the following declaration it is appropriate to highlight that:\n\n- the statement was prepared exclusively following the criteria established in the draft version of the delegated act of the European taxonomy concerning the climate change mitigation goal because at the time of the preparation of the 2020 annual reports the final version had not yet been published. Final publication could introduce important changes that might significantly affect the result presented in this statement;\n- one change that could significantly affect the final result concerns the manner in which the retail business segment will finally be represented in the European taxonomy. Enel, together with other utilities, has asked the European Commission to include this business activity because, similarly to electricity distribution, it contributes substantially to climate change mitigation as an enabler of the decarbonization of other industries by promoting the electrification of energy consumption;\n- Enel performed a detailed mapping of all its hydroelectric assets on the basis of the \u201cpower density\u201d metric required in the draft delegated acts. For plants with a power density lower than 5 W/m\u00b2, a further analysis was conducted to verify that the emissions (calculated over the entire life cycle) were below the specific emission limit of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh. The findings indicated that 99% of the installed hydroelectric capacity is eligible in accordance with the European taxonomy criteria for climate change mitigation only, while only 1% \u2013 for which it was not possible to conduct a timely assessment due to the lack of robust data \u2013 was ruled out on a conservative basis;\n- in order to maintain this conservative approach, the business activity relating to the generation of electricity from geothermal sources was considered almost entirely ineligible pending certification by an independent third party of compliance with the threshold for geothermal plants of 100 gCO\u2082eq/kWh for the entirety of Group\u2019s geothermal assets;\n- activities relating to the infrastructure and networks business in Chile, Colombia, Peru and Argentina were considered ineligible, again adopting a conservative approach. However, during 2021 an in-depth analysis will be performed for the distribution and transmission system, which could lead to a change in eligibility status;\n- the Enel X portfolio was analyzed at the Business Line and product cluster level, as it was not possible to associate all the financial metrics required by the European taxonomy with each individual product. However, as a precaution, only the Business Lines and product clusters that fully meet the criteria were designated as eligible, excluding the others (for example \u201ce-Home\u201d and \u201cdistributed energy\u201d);\n- the statement was prepared without performing an exhaustive review of the DNSH criteria, which will be carried out once the delegated acts are approved in the second quarter of 2021. Nonetheless, Enel is confident that it can demonstrate a high level of performance, as over the years it has implemented complete and comprehensive environmental management systems that go beyond legal requirements and are applied throughout the value chain. Additional information on Enel\u2019s environmental performance is available in the \u201cEnvironmental Sustainability\u201d chapter of the 2020 Sustainability Report;\n- the European Commission has not yet finished drafting the delegated acts for the other four environmental objectives. The latter could strengthen the compliance of Enel\u2019s business model with the European taxonomy, considering that the current statement only covers the climate change mitigation objective;\n- the aggregates being analyzed refer to the \u201csector\u201d level and only include items in respect of third parties. Accordingly, they do not include inter-sectoral exchange between sectors;\n- although not explicitly required, Enel has also performed an assessment in terms of the ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA), as it believes that this metric represents the effective financial performance of integrated utilities such as Enel. A metric that only considers revenue is strongly influenced by business activities with a high volume of revenue (such as the wholesale market) that do not contribute proportionately to the growth of the gross operating profit like other business activities;\n- the statement also gives a view that excludes \u201cnot covered\u201d activities to underscore the compliance of the Group for only the economic activities for which the European taxonomy has developed criteria and therefore the most significant from the point of view of the climate change mitigation objectives.\n\nMain results of our statement concerning alignment of economic activities with the taxonomy\n\n- In 2020, 63.9% of the ordinary gross operating profit was generated by business activities that meet climate change mitigation criteria, compared with 64.4% in 2019. Excluding activities that are currently not covered by the European taxonomy regulation, 83.3% of the ordinary gross operating profit was eligible.\nIn 2020, 34.8% of revenue was generated by business activities that meet climate change mitigation criteria, compared with 30.2% in 2019. Excluding activities that are currently not covered by the European taxonomy regulation, 72.1% of revenue was eligible.\n\nIn 2020, 39.9% of ordinary operating expenditure was eligible. By the European taxonomy regulation, 70.2% of ordinary operating expenditure was eligible.\n\nIn 2020, 80.3% of capital expenditure was generated by business activities that meet climate change mitigation criteria, compared with 76.8% in 2019. Excluding activities that are currently not covered by the European taxonomy regulation, 88.8% of capital expenditure was eligible.\n### Appendix\n\n#### Our ESG performance\n\n| Value Chain | Eligible activities (substantial contribution to mitigation of climate changes) | Revenue from third parties<sup>(1)</sup> | Ordinary gross operating profit (ordinary EBITDA) | Capital expenditure -

The green bonds are for institutional investors and are guaranteed by Enel SpA. The net issuance proceeds \u2013 carried out under the medium-term bond issue program of Enel and Enel Finance International (Euro Medium-Term Notes Program - EMTN) \u2013 were used to finance eligible projects according to the \u201cGreen Bond Principles\u201d categories, published by the ICMA (International Capital Market Association). In particular, the proceeds were used to finance:\n\n- new projects for the development, construction and repowering of generation plants from renewable sources (green bond emission in 2017 and 2019);\n- new projects for the development, construction, repowering and refinancing of generation plants from renewable sources as well as projects for transmission, networks and smart grids (green bond emission in 2018).\n\nIn order to facilitate the transparency and quality of the green bonds issued, the Enel Group has prepared and published specific \u201cGreen Bond Frameworks\u201d for each year of emission, whose compliance with the reference principles has been confirmed by an external advisor, Vigeo Eiris, who issued the so-called \u201csecond party opinion\u201d. Within the frameworks, the categories relating to eligible projects are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN SDGs, in particular Goals 7, 9, 11 and 13).\n\nThe reference documents for the three emissions are available on the Enel Group\u2019s website (https://www.enel.com/investors/investing/sustainable-finance/green-bonds). The Group is among the first companies in the world having set up a \u201cGreen Bond Committee\u201d with the aim of selecting projects and monitoring the progress of their development. The reporting document hereof, published for the fourth time in 2020, meets Enel\u2019s commitment undertaken at the time of the bond issuance to report annually on the use of proceeds, on the environmental benefits deriving from the projects financed and on further ESG metrics linked to these projects.\n\nThe indicators were determined in accordance with the \u201cGreen Bond Framework\u201d (December 2016, December 2017 and November 2018) and shown in the table based on the type of project and the year of emission of the green bonds. In order to facilitate transparency and facilitate understanding of reporting over the years, the report also describes the following information:\n\n- 2017 green bond reporting with evidence of projects relating to renewable plants. Seven plants also contributed toward the allocation of the proceeds of the 2019 green bond following new investments (Capex) that were made;\n- 2018 green bond reporting with evidence of projects related to:\n  - renewable plants, three of which that contribute toward the allocation of the proceeds of the 2019 green bond due to new investments (Capex) that were made;\n  - \u201crefinancing\u201d of renewable plants due to the replacement of previous credit lines;\n  - investment activities relating to the business area \u201cInfrastructure and Networks\u201d;\n- 2019 green bond reporting with evidence of the projects relating to renewable plants, 10 of which were also subject to reporting for the 2017 and 2018 green bonds, as described previously.\n\nIn accordance with the \u201cGreen Bond Framework\u201d, the report is structured as follows.\n\n- Summary table of 2017, 2018 and 2019 emissions with indication of the installed capacity and of the CO\u2082 avoided;\n- Table A \u201cFinancial indicators\u201d shows:\n  - the capacity and amount of the \u201cforeign currency investment\u201d approved by the Board of Directors and/or the Investment Committee, and communicated to the financial market through specific press releases;\n  - the value of the \u201cinvestment in euros\u201d, calculated by considering the average exchange rate for the years 2017-2019 (for projects defined in 2017), the average exchange rate for the years 2018-2020 (for projects defined in 2018) and/or the average exchange rate for the years 2019-2021 (for projects defined in 2019) of Enel\u2019s Industrial Plan;\n  - the share of the green bond proceeds allocated to the project as the difference between the total capitalized costs as at December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and/or December 31, 2019 and the amount of third-party financing associated to the specific project;\n- The amounts of proceeds allocated to the projects in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively were used in the same years;\n- the date of entry into operation corresponding to the time when the plant produced the first kWh;\n- Table B \u201cESG indicators\u201d shows the environmental benefit in terms of CO\u2082 avoided (actual or expected). In particular, with reference to renewable projects:\n  - the quantity of CO\u2082 avoided (both actual and expected) is determined by multiplying generation (actual or expected) by the emission factor linked to the specific thermoelectric energy generation of the country in which the plant is located (emission factors source: Enertdata - February 10, 2021 release);\n  - in consideration of the complete allocation of the three green bonds and the volatility of production due, for example, to exceptional events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, it was decided to no longer disclose the share of production (both effective and expected) and the relative quantity of CO\u2082 avoided attributable to the green bond, calculated as the share of green bond proceeds allocated to the project with respect to the total investment;\n  - for projects relating to generation plants from renewable sources, the cumulative value of actual generation and the relative CO\u2082 avoided for all years of reporting of the green bond report is also shown (with the exception of the repowering plants whose share of generation cannot be separated from the rest of the plant);\n- Infrastructure and Networks projects, the following indicators are also provided:\n  - the cabling ratio, determined by the ratio between the length of the cable lines and the total length of the lines. The increase in this index over time is due to an increase in the length of the overhead and underground cable line to the detriment of bare conductors; in particular, the main environmental benefits concern the containment of plant cutting activities and a drastic reduction in the risk of electrocution for birds;\n  - network automation, which corresponds to the ratio between RCP (Remote Controlled Point) and medium/low-voltage equipment;\n\nNOTES\n\n1. SDG 7 \u201cAffordable and clean energy\u201d; SDG 9 \u201cIndustry, innovation and infrastructure\u201d; SDG 11 \u201cSustainable cities and communities\u201d; SDG 13 \u201cClimate action\u201d.\n\n2. If the same company is involved in the implementation of several projects, proceeds are allocated to the specific project based on the capacity.\n\n3. The eliminated columns were \u201c2018 production attributable to GB (GWh)\u201d, \u201c2019 production attributable to GB (GWh)\u201d, \u201cExpected annual production attributable to GB (GWh)\u201d, \u201cExpected CO\u2082 avoided attributable to GB (t)\u201d.\n\n(3) The eliminated columns were \u201c2018 production attributable to GB (GWh)\u201d, \u201c2019 production attributable to GB (GWh)\u201d, \u201cExpected annual production attributable to GB (GWh)\u201d, \u201cExpected CO\u2082 avoided attributable to GB (t)\u201d.\n\n(2) If the same company is involved in the implementation of several projects, proceeds are allocated to the specific project based on the capacity.\ntechnical network losses, mainly related to the characteristics/functions of the network. These losses are usually calculated using statistical models or benchmarks. A reduction in technical network losses results in a reduction in the energy to be generated and a consequent reduction in emissions and consumption of raw materials;\n\n- the elimination of oil equipment with PCB reduces the risk of contamination of a compound no longer in production since the 1980s and classified as toxic and bioaccumulative;\n- the calculation of CO\u2082 avoided. The energy saving estimation model takes into account: the number of low-loss transformers replacing traditional transformers; operations on the MV network; network upgrading measures; the new transformer rooms, which involve optimizing the grid in terms of reducing low-voltage lines in favor of higher-voltage ones.\n\n> Table C \u201cFurther ESG indicators\u201d shows, where possible and appropriate, as envisaged in the \u201csecond party opinion\u201d the following indicators for the renewable projects:\n- water consumption related to the data reported in the period of construction of the plant or the period following its entry into operation. In the case of plants that started operating after September 30, 2020, the water consumption of the construction site is reported, in other cases (plants operating before September 30, 2020) the water consumption in operation;\n- projects for protecting biodiversity promoted by Enel in connection to the operation of the plant;\n- the cases in which the site stopped its operations (plant shutdown) due to environmental management issues and their impact;\n- fatal accidents or \u201cHigh Consequence\u201d injuries to Enel people;\n- activities and projects carried out to support local communities in the areas surrounding the plant. The indicator related to the number of beneficiaries of these projects refers to the people involved by such activity or project.\n\nThe above indicators in Table C, with the exception of water consumption and plant shutdown due to environmental issues, also refer to Infrastructure and Networks projects.\n\n> Table D \u201cOverall information\u201d refers to the criteria, indicators, overall information and approach chosen by Enel to develop the projects financed through the proceeds of the bond.\n\nThe data has been thoroughly calculated on the basis of the results of Enel\u2019s accounting, non-accounting and other information systems, and validated by the persons responsible in each case. The data determined through the use of estimates and related calculation method has been expressly indicated.\n\n### SUMMARY TABLE OF 2017, 2018 AND 2019 EMISSIONS WITH INDICATION OF THE INSTALLED CAPACITY AND OF THE CO\u2082 AVOIDED\n\n| GB emission | Area of investment | Allocated GB proceeds (mil euros) | Installed capacity (MW) | CO\u2082 avoided (t) |\n|-------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n| 2017        | Renewables         | 1,238                            | 3,354                   | 14,528,985     |\n|             |                    | 1,240                            |                         |                |\n|             | of which new renewable projects | Renewables | 575 | 1,878 | 4,676,669 |\n|             |                    | IBN                              | 665                     | n.a.           |\n|             |                    | 986                              | 638                     | 116,867        |\n|             | of which new projects identified in 2019 | Renewables | 65 | 638 | 116,867 |\n|             |                    | Renewables                       | 342                     | n.a.           |\n|             | of which new Capes for 2018 projects | Renewables | 579 | n.a. | n.a. |\n| 2019        | Renewables         | 1,238                            | 3,354                   | 14,528,985     |\n|             | of which new renewable projects | Renewables | 575 | 1,878 | 4,676,669 |\n|             |                    | IBN                              | 665                     | n.a.           |\n|             |                    | 986                              | 638                     | 116,867        |\n|             | of which new projects identified in 2019 | Renewables | 65 | 638 | 116,867 |\n|             |                    | Renewables                       | 342                     | n.a.           |\n|             | of which new Capes for 2018 projects | Renewables | 579 | n.a. | n.a. |\n\n(4) Projects relating to renewable plants with a capacity of more than 20 MW are considered to be relevant.\n\n(5) The indicator \u201cMaterial reused/recycled after reworking\u201d is not applicable, as the proceeds of the green bond were not used to finance reworking projects in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\n(6) Sum of: injuries that as of December 31, 2020 resulted in more than 6 months of absence from work;

(the \u201ccompany\u201d), which comprises the summary table of emissions, table A \u201cFinancial indicators\u201d, table B \u201cESG indicators\u201d, table C \u201cFurther ESG indicators\u201d, table D \u201cOverall information\u201d and notes thereto and has been prepared on the basis of the Enel Group\u2019s green bond framework (the \u201cframework\u201d). This report is included in the Enel Group\u2019s 2020 sustainability report.\n\nResponsibilities of the company\u2019s directors for the report\n\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation of the report in accordance with the framework described in the \u201cIntroduction and reporting criteria\u201d note to the report. They are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Moreover, the directors are responsible for identifying the content of the report, selecting and applying policies and making judgements and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nAuditors\u2019 independence and quality control\n\nWe are independent in compliance with the independence and all other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards, the IESBA Code) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\nOur company applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly, maintains a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nAuditors\u2019 responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion, based on the procedures performed, on the report. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established by \u201cInternational Standard on Assurance Engagements 2020 (revised) - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u201d (\u201cISAE 3000 revised\u201d), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board applicable to limited assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the NFS is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement carried out in accordance with ISAE 3000 revised, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nThe procedures we performed on the report are based on our professional judgement and include inquiries, primarily of the company\u2019s personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the report, documental analyses, recalculations and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate.\n\nSpecifically, we carried out the following main procedures:\n\n1. obtaining and reading the second party opinion;\n2. interviewing relevant staff at corporate and business level responsible for the 2020 Green Bond management and reporting;\n3. understanding the processes underlying the generation, recording and management of the qualitative and quantitative information disclosed in the report;\n4. holding interviews and discussions with the company\u2019s management personnel to obtain information on the processes and procedures used to gather, combine, process and transmit data and information to the office that prepares the report;\n5. performing sample-based documental analysis and analytical procedures to check the indicators included in the report.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 2020 Green Bond Report of Enel S.p.A. has been not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the framework described in the \u201cIntroduction and reporting criteria\u201d note to the report.\n\nOther matters\n\nOther auditors performed a limited assurance engagement on the 2017, 2018 and 2019 figures presented in the 2020 Green Bond Report and expressed their unqualified conclusions on 10 May 2018, 7 May 2019 and 8 April 2020, respectively.\n\nRome, 19 April 2021\n\nKPMG S.p.A.\n\n(signed on the original)\n\nMarco Maffei\nDirector of Audit\nAPPENDIX\n\n- Methodological note and independent auditors' report\n- Sustainability statement: performance indicator\n- GRI Content Index\n- SASB Content Index\n- TCFD Content Index\n- WEF Content Index\nMETHODOLOGICAL NOTE\n\nSince 2003 Enel has been publishing a Sustainability Report each year, at the same time as the Group Consolidated Annual Report. In compliance with the requirements of Italian Legislative Decree 254 of December 30, 2016, \u201cImplementation of Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 22, 2014, amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large companies and groups\u201d, Enel has been publishing a Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (NFS) since 2017. The Sustainability Report will constitute Enel\u2019s NFS with effect from the 2019 financial year. Accordingly, from that financial year on, the NFS is no longer published as a separate document. This Report of the Enel Group at December 31, 2020 was therefore drawn up in compliance with Legislative Decree 254/16 and the 2019 Budget Act and it is a separate document with respect to the Report on Operations. The document is published in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of Enel\u2019s website (www.enel.com).\n\nThe 2020 Sustainability Report is addressed to the Enel Group\u2019s stakeholders and is designed to present the actions taken in pursuit of the Group\u2019s sustainability goals and thus to respond to the legitimate expectations of all stakeholders. The document structure has been revised compared to previous years, with the inclusion in the appendix of reconciliation statements that consider the indicators proposed by the white paper \u201cToward Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation\u201d, issued by the World Economic Forum (WEF), and the indicators of the \u201cSASB\u201d, which gives an overview of the main indicators required by the aforementioned standard in relation to Enel\u2019s core business sector: \u201cElectric Utilities & Power Generators\u201d.\n\nTo the extent necessary to ensure an understanding of the Company\u2019s activities, performance, results and impact, this document covers environmental, social, labor, human rights and active and passive anti-corruption topics that are material to Enel, in view of the Company\u2019s activities and characteristics, according to the process described below (see the section \u201cThe 2020 materiality analysis\u201d). The following table shows the areas required by Legislative Decree 254/16, specifying the document chapter in which they are discussed.\n\n| Topic of the Report/ Legislative Decree 254/16 | Issue of the materiality analysis | Report chapter | Risks | Policies and management model | Activities and results |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|-------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Environment                                    | Decarbonization of the energy mix | Net-zero ambition | Net-zero ambition | Net-zero ambition | Net-zero ambition |\n| Environmental management                       | Environmental sustainability     | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cEnvironmental sustainability\u201d | \u201cEnvironmental sustainability\u201d | \u201cEnvironmental sustainability\u201d |\n| Social                                         | Engaging local communities       | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cLocal and global communities\u201d | \u201cLocal and global communities\u201d | \u201cLocal and global communities\u201d |\n| Sustainable supply chain                       | Sustainable supply chain         | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d | \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d | \u201cSustainable supply chain\u201d |\n| Employment and labor-related                   | People management, development and motivation | \u201cOur people\u201d | \u201cOur people\u201d | \u201cOur people\u201d | \u201cOur people\u201d |\n| Human rights                                   | Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d |\n| People management, development and motivation  | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter       | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d |\n| Engaging local communities                     | \u201cSound governance\u201d chapter       | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d |\n| Fight against corruption                       | \u201cSound governance\u201d and fair corporate conduct | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d | \u201cSound governance\u201d |\n\nHow this document has been constructed\n\nThe Sustainability Report was prepared in compliance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards set down by GRI in 2016 \u2013 in accordance with the Core option \u2013 and also considering the Electric Utilities Disclosure supplement dedicated to the sector issued in 2013, again by GRI and still applicable today, this document was also prepared in consideration of the following more recently issued GRI standards:\n\n- GRI 403 \u2013 Occupational Health and Safety (applied from 2018);\n- GRI 303 \u2013 Water and effluents (applied from 2018);\n- GRI 207 \u2013 Tax (applied from 2020);\n- GRI 306 \u2013 Waste (applied from 2020).\n\nMoreover, for comprehensive reporting in relation to the material topics identified following the materiality analysis, the directors deemed it necessary to include several additional disclosures, as more fully specified in this document. In compliance with standard GRI 101, the disclosures in question were subjected to the same technical rigor required by the reporting standard adopted.\n\nThe reporting standards adopted, as described above, comply with the disclosure obligations pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 art. 1 letter \u201cf\u201d and art. 3, par. 3, which the directors decided to adopt organically in order to fully represent the social and environmental topics \u2013 in compliance with the mentioned decree \u2013 of significance for the Enel Group in consideration of the Group structure, the specific business sectors, and the reference geographical areas.\n\nFurthermore, the appendix to the Sustainability Report contains specific tables of reconciliation with indicators proposed by the WEF white paper \u201cToward Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation\u201d and, starting from 2020, with the indicators proposed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB \u2013 in relation to Enel\u2019s core business area in the Electric Utilities & Power Generators Sector). The 2020 Sustainability Report also complies with the qualitative indicators of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and of the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. The Sustainability Report is part of the Enel corporate reporting system, and the information it provides is more detailed than and supplementary to the annexed documents cross referenced in the Report.\nThe non-financial information to be presented within the various corporate reporting system documents is selected based on the materiality analysis results and considering the approach set down in \u201cReporting on enterprise value\u201d, released in December 2020 by the main reference international organizations (CDP, CDSB, GRI and SASB). Specifically, the process of defining the contents of the Sustainability Report is based on materiality principles, stakeholder inclusivity, sustainability context, and completeness of data and information.\n\nEnel provides concise information on its sustainability performance in specific sections of the Sustainability Report (see \u201cAt a Glance\u201d and \u201cOur ESG performance\u201d); these chapters contain descriptions also of the goals and associated progress referred to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in order to provide full disclosure of all relevant information in the reporting period, together with reliable estimates for the future. The quality of information reported is assured by proceeding in compliance with the principles of balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity, and verifiability.\n\nThis Sustainability Report is also compliant with the principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness set out in AA1000APS (AccountAbility Principles Standard) issued in 2018 by AccountAbility, an international applied research institution focusing on sustainability issues. With regard to the materiality principle, in particular, the depth in which the various subjects are discussed in the Report has been determined according to their incidence in relation to the Group\u2019s goals and strategies and their relevance for stakeholders, established by means of a structured materiality analysis process.\n\nFinally, the main UN SDGs are referenced in the various chapters, in accordance with the instructions in \u201cLinking the SDGs and the GRI standards\u201d published by GRI in January 2021, and the SDGs Compass, the guide, published in November 2015, developed by GRI, UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to help companies align their strategies with the SDGs and measure and manage their contribution to the goals.\n\nIn line with the provisions of AccountAbility standard AA1000APS (2018) and with the principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness, and impact, Enel has defined a materiality analysis process made up of five main phases, as shown in the following chart.\n\nData collection, aggregation and processing of information are managed using a dedicated IT system in order to share best stakeholder engagement and monitoring practices and allow a level of coverage consistent with the Company\u2019s organizational model. The system allows specific views to be obtained, not only at the level of the Group and individual companies, but also by Business Line/Company Function and individual asset (i.e. potential or actual operating site).\n\nThe Holding Company\u2019s Sustainability Planning, Performance Management and Human Rights unit, in charge of the materiality analysis at Group level, plays a steering and coordination role, providing guidelines and methodological support for analysis at the country, company, and asset level, carried out by local managers with the involvement of stakeholders and key people at the Company level. The results achieved for individual companies and/or countries are then consolidated by the Holding Company to prepare the Group\u2019s materiality matrix (see \u201cAt a Glance\u201d chapter in the \u201cOur priorities\u201d section for detailed information on analysis results).\n\nThe scope of the 2020 materiality analysis has been further enhanced, notably through the inclusion of new assets in Colombia, Peru, Italy, and South Africa, and together with ever greater integration of results deriving from the application of CSV tools to Group assets.\nmanagement of all the Business Lines, which evaluated the relevance of the categories by means of a survey administered by the Holding Company\u2019s Sustainability unit, based on the following parameters:\n\n- **dependence** \u2013 importance of the relationship for the stakeholder \u2013 indicating groups or individuals that depend directly or indirectly on the activities, products or associated services and operations, or on which the organization relies in order to conduct its operations;\n- **influence** \u2013 importance of the relationship for the Company \u2013 indicating groups or individuals that can affect the organization or a stakeholder for the strategic or operational decisional process;\n- **urgency** \u2013 temporal dimension of the relationship \u2013 indicating groups or individuals requiring the immediate attention of the organization in relation to broader financial, economic, social, or environmental issues.\n\nSpecifically, from the analysis conducted at Group level, the \u2018Employees\u2019 stakeholder achieved a high rating in terms of significance, considering the contingent pandemic crisis. For further details concerning the analysis results, refer to the tables reported in the section \u201cOur priorities\u201d. In addition, the various units involved each year in the analysis process and those responsible for relations with stakeholders are tasked with engaging them according to the most appropriate methods in view of the communications channels (generic, specific and participatory), the type of relations with the group concerned, and the reference context.\n\nThe issues subject to the 2020 materiality analysis were defined on the basis of several aspects, including company policies and rules of conduct, stakeholder feedback initiatives, the issues of greatest interest for sustainability rating agencies, industry benchmarking studies and the Company\u2019s strategic orientation.\n\nThe various units responsible for relations with stakeholders involved in the analysis process each year, are tasked with identifying and updating the list of significant stakeholder categories to draw up a complete list of current and potential stakeholders and to ensure constant alignment with the sustainability context in which Enel operates.\n\nThe methodology adopted involves an annual update to the results achieved in the previous year and, every two years, an analysis to determine a possible revision of the issues and categories of stakeholders subject to analysis, to take account of any changes in the context in which the Company operates.\n\n### Assessment of the priorities assigned by the stakeholders to the issues\n\nThe aspects investigated within the context of the materiality analysis are, from the stakeholders\u2019 perspective, the relative importance of each issue in their perceptions and the direction of their expectations (expectations of engagement, rather than disengagement, by Enel), and, from the Company\u2019s perspective, the level of the impact of the issues on its business strategies.\n\nSince 2016, Enel has integrated the process of assessing the stakeholders\u2019 expectations with respect to the issues subject to analysis: the \u2018direction\u2019 of their expectations (expectations of engagement, rather than disengagement, by Enel), and, from the Company\u2019s perspective, the level of the impact of the issues on its business strategies.\n\nIn 2020, the stakeholders\u2019 categories identification and prioritization process benefited from the involvement of top managers, through one-on-one interviews, surveys and other tools. In 2020, the stakeholders categories identification and prioritization process benefited from the involvement of top managers, through one-on-one interviews, surveys and other tools.\n\n### Identification of issues and stakeholders\n\nThe issues subject to the 2020 materiality analysis were defined on the basis of several aspects, including company policies and rules of conduct, stakeholder feedback initiatives, the issues of greatest interest for sustainability rating agencies, industry benchmarking studies and the Company\u2019s strategic orientation.\n\nThe various units responsible for relations with stakeholders involved in the analysis process each year, are tasked with identifying and updating the list of significant stakeholder categories to draw up a complete list of current and potential stakeholders and to ensure constant alignment with the sustainability context in which Enel operates.\n\nThe methodology adopted involves an annual update to the results achieved in the previous year and, every two years, an analysis to determine a possible revision of the issues and categories of stakeholders subject to analysis, to take account of any changes in the context in which the Company operates.\n2020 Expectations matrix\n\n| Stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction | Improve | Maintain | Monitor | Act |\n|---------------------------|---------|----------|---------|-----|\n| HIGH                      |         |          |         |     |\n| LOW                       |         |          |         |     |\n\nPriorities assigned by stakeholders\n\nBUSINESS AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES\n- Energy distribution\n- Decarbonization of the energy mix\n- Customer focus\n- Ecosystems and platforms\n- Sound governance and fair corporate conduct\n- Economic and financial value creation\n- Innovation and digital transformation\n\nSOCIAL ISSUES\n- Engaging local communities\n- People management, development and motivation\n- Occupational health and safety\n- Sustainable supply chain\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n- Decarbonization of the energy mix\n- Environmental management\n\nThe materiality of the various issues in Enel\u2019s strategies was assessed through the involvement of the various company Functions and submitted to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer by means of a specific interview and administration of a dedicated online survey. This analysis reflects the guidelines set down in the 2001-2023 Strategic Plan, the goals of the Functions/Business Lines, and the commitments assumed by the Group through its policies and rules of conduct.\n\nFurther to the \u201cImpact Evaluation\u201d pilot project launched in 2019, in 2020 the analysis was completed in order to identify the impacts generated by the Company on the economy, the environment, and people, considering possible violations of human rights in relation to negative impacts, and assessing the contribution to sustainable development in relation to positive impacts. The project, which was rolled out in all the 18 countries that carry out the materiality analysis, was conducted by each local Sustainability unit which, in line with the requirements of the main reference standards (notably the \u201cExposure Draft\u201d document published by GRI in June 2020), identified the main positive and negative impacts generated by the Company in relation to the external context, the reference SDGs for impacts that create value for the community and/or the environment, and the strategies and performance adopted by the Group. We have included, by way of example, several cases that emerged from the analysis thanks to the contribution of the local Sustainability units. As regards the \u2018Energy distribution\u2019 issue, Romania identified a potential negative impact concerning the increase of noise and environmental pollution as a result of new investments in the network, which could generate repercussions in the short term in relation to various stakeholder categories, including employees, communities, and suppliers. Concerning the \u2018Decarbonization of the energy mix\u2019 issue, Russia too identified a potential negative impact associated with the increased local unemployment rate caused by the closure of conventional power plants, which could have short term effects from the economic and social perspectives in relation to the local communities surrounding the plants in question. Finally, in relation to the issue of \u2018Sound governance and fair corporate conduct\u2019, Argentina recorded a positive impact due to the Company\u2019s adoption of measures and standards (e.g. ISO 37001) designed to mitigate corruption problems at the local level, generating a direct and immediate effect on the community in question and also contributing to SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions).\nReconciliation of the issues of the materiality analysis and GRI Standards\n\nThanks to its representation in the materiality matrix in the \u201cAt a Glance\u201d chapter (with reference to the \u201cOur priorities\u201d section), joint analysis of stakeholder and Company aspects has made it possible to assess the degree of \u201calignment\u201d or \u201cmisalignment\u201d between the priority of action assigned by the stakeholders to the various issues and the degree of commitment assumed by the Group in relation to the same issues. The following table contains the codes for the issues included in the materiality analysis as established in the GRI Standards or the \u201cAspects\u201d of the GRI supplement dedicated to the electric utilities sector (\u201cElectric Utilities Sector Disclosures\u201d) of reference, along with an indication of the context internal and external to the organization and the limitations on the scope.\n\n| ESG category | 2020 materiality assessment issue | GRI Standard or Electric Utilities Sector Disclosures Aspect | Internal boundary | External boundary | Reporting limitations on internal boundary | Reporting limitations on external boundary |\n|--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Economic and financial value creation | GRI 201: Economic performance | Group | - | - | - |\n| Sound governance and fair corporate conduct | GRI 205: Anti-corruption | Group | - | - | - |\n| | GRI 206: Anti-competitive behavior | Group | - | - | - |\n| | GRI 207: Taxes | Group | - | - | - |\n| | GRI 406: Non-discrimination | Group | - | - | - |\n| | GRI 415: Public policy | Group | - | - | - |\n| Decarbonization of the energy mix | GRI 201: Economic performance | Group | - | - | - |\n| | GRI 305: Emissions | Group | - | - | - |\n| | System efficiency | Group | - | - | - |\n| Customer focus | GRI 417: Marketing and labelling | Group | - | - | - |\n| | GRI 418: Customer privacy | Group | - | - | - |\n| | Provision of information | Group | - | - | - |\n| Ecosystems and platforms | Research & Development | Group | - | - | - |\n| Energy distribution | Access | Group | - | - | - |\n| | System efficiency | Group | - | - | - |\n| | Demand management | Group | - | - | - |\n| Innovation and digital transformation | Research & Development | Group | - | - | - |\n\n(1) Includes the following issues: \u201cNew technologies and solutions for Homes and Condominiums\u201d; \u201cNew technologies and solutions for Cities\u201d; \u201cNew technologies and solutions for Industries\u201d; \u201cElectric mobility\u201d.\n\n### Materiality issues for stakeholders\n\n| Area of risk | Main impact incurred | Main impact generated | Impact classification | Reference SDG for positive impacts |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| ENERGY DISTRIBUTION | Service quality management | Potential reputation, economic or financial losses due to failure to achieve the required and agreed service levels | Reduction of network reliability due to delayed maintenance | \u201cElectrification, digital and platforms\u201d |\n| | | | Guarantee of access to electricity in rural areas thanks to service quality improvements | \u201cLocal and global communities\u201d |\n| SOUND GOVERNANCE AND FAIR CORPORATE CONDUCT | Compliance with laws and regulations | The practices adopted by the company do not comply with the internal procedures and/or policies and/or with the law and external regulations | Aid/fail to help reduce corruption at local level through the adoption of measures and standards by the Company (e.g. ISO 37001) | \u201cSound governance\u201d |\n| DECARBONIZATION OF THE ENERGY MIX | Climate change | Inadequate definition of the Group strategy due to errors in estimating the effect of ongoing climate change on Group operations and/or due to estimates based on unrealistic/unreliable data | Redeployment of local personnel due to closure of conventional power plants | \u201cOur people\u201d |\n| | | | Increase in installed renewable capacity in order to make the national energy mix more sustainable and reduce GHG emissions | \u201cNet-zero ambition\u201d |\n\nImpact classification: Positive, Negative\nThe reporting process\n\nThe structure of the 2020 Sustainability Report was developed in accordance with the materiality analysis, focusing more closely on the material issues, which are covered in detail in dedicated chapters. Likewise, the materiality level of the issues \u2013 divided into dedicated sub-issues \u2013 influenced the level of detail with which to treat each subject and report the associated GRI indicators (GRI Standards and Electric Utilities Sector Disclosure) in order to be in accordance (Core option), and also the choice of the most appropriate tools to represent them (2020 Consolidated Annual Report and appended reports), to which reference was made for the treatment or detailed investigation of more specific topics, respectively, of economic performance and governance. The materiality analysis also formed the basis for definition of Enel\u2019s sustainability goals for the 2021-2023 period, as illustrated by the Sustainability Plan (see \u201cOur sustainability strategy\u201d section of the \u201cAt a Glance\u201d chapter).\n\nThe GRI Context Index, included in the Appendix, contains references to the 2020 Sustainability Report and the Group\u2019s other reporting instruments. Please also consult the website www.enel.com for further information, for example regarding innovation projects or the activities of Enel\u2019s foundations and the 2020 Informe de Sostenibilidad by Endesa and Enel Am\u00e9ricas for additional details concerning initiatives dedicated to customers and local communities in Spain and South America.\n\nDrafting and assurance\n\nThe process of reporting and monitoring the Key Performance Indicators (\u201cKPIs\u201d) relevant to sustainability involves the Holding Company, with regard to transversal issues, and all Group Business Lines, Functions and companies for issues and indicators specific to the various sectors of activity. Those responsible for collecting, verifying and processing the relevant KPIs are identified within the units involved. The Sustainability Planning and Performance Management and Human Rights unit, which forms part of the Innovation Function, is responsible for consolidating information and coordinating the entire 2020 Sustainability Report drafting process. The Report was submitted for analysis and evaluation to the Enel Control and Risk Committee on April 12, 2021 and to the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee on April 14. It was approved by the Board of Directors on April 15. The document will then be presented to the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting together with the Group\u2019s Consolidated Annual Report.\n\nThis Report has been subjected to a limited audit by an independent auditing company, KPMG SpA, engaged also to audit the Enel Group\u2019s Consolidated Annual Report. The limited audit was conducted in accordance with international standard ISAE 3000 (Revised) and, accordingly, the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including professional independence and verification of the absence of conflicts of interest that may affect the ethical principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and diligence, confidentiality and professional conduct. The audit report, which contains a detailed description of the principles adopted, activities performed and conclusions reached, is attached hereto.\n\nIn addition, the report on the green bond, also subjected to limited assurance by KPMG SpA according to the criteria indicated in standard ISAE 3000, is annexed to this Report; the related audit report is supplied as an attachment to this Sustainability Report.\n\nThe GHG Inventory Statements were audited by DNV GL, with a reasonable level of certainty for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, restricted to natural gas sales activities, and with a limited level of certainty for the other Scope 3 emissions included in the scope of application of the inventory. The audit was conducted according to ISO 4064-3 for compliance of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories with the WBCSD/WRI Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol).\nThe information and data presented in the Report refer to Enel SpA and the companies within the scope of line-by-line consolidation at December 31, 2020, in accordance with the Group\u2019s financial consolidation scope. In addition to the line-by-line consolidation scope, the document also includes the data and information regarding the company Asociaci\u00f3n Nuclear Asc\u00f3-Vandell\u00f3s II AIE (ANA CNVII AIE), to which the two Spanish nuclear plants of Asc\u00f3 and Vandell\u00f3s are attributed. The company, considered to be a joint operation in line with the provisions of accounting standard IFRS 11, is included in the Group\u2019s financial scope of consolidation under the proportional method, and is included in this report using the same method to ensure the impacts are adequately represented, given that it is a significant Group entity. The sole exception to the line-by-line consolidation scope are the companies acquired in 2020, for which, on the basis of prevailing practice, as also represented in the Consob report of January 19, 2018, it was decided to begin consolidation, with regard to some of the areas covered in this document, with effect from 2021, in the light of the reduced acquisition period. The areas of exclusion have been indicated directly in the specific chapters.\n\nIn particular, the main organizational changes affecting the Enel Group in 2020 were:\n\n- acquisition by Enel Green Power Panama of 100% of Jaguito Solar and Progreso Solar;\n- disposal of several joint ventures held at 50%, included in the Enel North America hydroelectric portfolio.\n\nFor more detailed information on the changes, refer to the 2020 Consolidated Annual Report in the sections \u201cMain changes in the scope of consolidation\u201d and \u201cSignificant events in 2020.\u201d\n\nIf the associated companies (measured at equity in the Consolidated Annual Report) and other entities over which Enel exercises significant influence (including joint ventures) produce substantial impacts, they are included in the data calculation in proportion to Enel\u2019s holding, and referenced in the text. We invite you to refer to the 2020 Consolidated Annual Report for details of the companies included in the scope of consolidation.\n\nIn this Statement, the terms \u201cCorporate,\u201d \u201cHolding Company\u201d and \u201cParent Company\u201d refer to Enel SpA, whereas \u201cGroup,\u201d \u201cEnel\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d refer to Enel SpA and its subsidiaries.\n\nVarious deviations from the KPIs and information included in the 2019 Sustainability Report are the result of changes in the Group\u2019s scope of consolidation. The effects of changes in the scope of consolidation, together with any significant changes or limitations of the scope or methods of calculating individual indicators compared with 2019, are expressly indicated in the text and/or the Appendix, along with the effects on the related data. See the notes in the tables in the Appendix for all further details regarding adjustments with respect to already published data, calculation methods, assumptions or significant limitations of indicators.\n\nThe data have been thoroughly calculated on the basis of the results of Enel\u2019s accounting, non-accounting and other information systems, and validated by the persons responsible in each case. Data determined through the use of estimates and related calculation method have been expressly indicated. In the comparison of the data over time, it should be noted that differences between 2020 and 2019, in absolute and percent terms, have been calculated considering decimal places in some cases not visible in the printed document. In the tables containing quantitative data, percent changes in excess of 100% are indicated by \u201c>\u201d.\n\n(2) A \u201cjoint operation\u201d is a joint-control arrangement in which the parties that hold joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities associated with the arrangement.\n\n(3) Illustrative report on the results of the consultation and the consequences for regulation, the activities of companies and operators and the interests of investors and savers.\n\n(4) Corresponding to the sum of electrical energy and heat.\nThe Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by the Italian law, compliance with the decree\u2019s provisions.\n\nAuditors\u2019 independence and quality control\n\nWe are independent in compliance with the independence and all other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards, the IESBA Code) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our company applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly, maintains a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nAuditors\u2019 responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion, based on the procedures performed, about the compliance of the NFS with the requirements of the decree and the GRI Standards. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established by \u201cInternational Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u201d (\u201cISAE 3000 revised\u201d), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board applicable to limited assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the NFS is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement carried out in accordance with ISAE 3000 revised, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nThe procedures we performed on the NFS are based on our professional judgement and include inquiries of the parent\u2019s personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the NFS, documentary analyses, recalculations and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate.\n\nSpecifically, we carried out the following procedures:\n\n1. Analysing the material aspects based on the group\u2019s business and characteristics disclosed in the NFS, in order to assess the reasonableness of the identification process adopted on the basis of the provisions of article 3 of the decree and taking into account the reporting standards applied.\n2. Analysing and assessing the identification criteria for the reporting scope, in order to check their compliance with the decree.\n3. Comparing the financial disclosures presented in the NFS with those included in the group\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n4. Gaining an understanding of the following:\n   - the group\u2019s business management and organisational model, with reference to the aspects identified and disclosed in the NFS, the group\u2019s policies and the identification and management of the risks generated or borne.\n   - the entity\u2019s policies in connection with the aspects set out in article 3 of the decree, and the related key performance indicators;\n   - the main risks generated or borne in connection with the aspects set out in article 3 of the decree.\n\nResponsibilities of the directors and board of statutory auditors (\u201cCollegio Sindacale\u201d) of Enel S.p.A. (the \u201cparent\u201d) for the NFS\n\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation of an NFS in accordance with articles 3 and 4 of the decree and the \u201cGlobal Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards\u201d issued by GRI - Global Reporting Initiative (the \u201cGRI Standards\u201d), which they have identified as the reporting standards.\n\nThe directors are also responsible, within the terms established by the Italian law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of an NFS that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nMoreover, the directors are responsible for the identification of the content of the NFS, considering the aspects indicated in article 3.1 of the decree and the group\u2019s business and characteristics, to the extent necessary to enable an understanding of the group\u2019s business, performance, results and the impacts it generates.\n\nThe directors\u2019 responsibility also includes the design of an internal model for the management and organisation of the group\u2019s activities, as well as, with reference to the aspects identified and disclosed in the NFS, the group\u2019s policies and the identification and management of the risks generated or borne.\nMoreover, we checked the above against the disclosures presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described in point 5.a).\n\n5. Understanding the processes underlying the generation, recording and management of the significant qualitative and quantitative information disclosed in the NFS.\n\nSpecifically, we held interviews and discussions with the parent\u2019s management personnel and personnel of Enel Russia PJSC, Emgesa SA ESP, Enel Produzione S.p.A. and Endesa Generaci\u00f3n S.A.. We also performed selected procedures on documentation to gather information on the processes and procedures used to gather, combine, process and transmit non-financial data and information to the office that prepares the NFS.\n\nFurthermore, with respect to significant information, considering the group\u2019s business and characteristics:\n- at parent level,\n  a) we held interviews and obtained supporting documentation to check the qualitative information presented in the NFS and, specifically, the business model, the policies applied and main risks for consistency with available evidence,\n  b) we carried out analytical and limited procedures to check, on a sample basis, the correct aggregation of data in the quantitative information;\n- at subsidiaries level,\n  we held videoconferences with the management of Enel Russia PJSC, Emgesa SA ESP and Enel Produzione S.p.A., which we have selected on the basis of their business, contribution to the key performance indicators at consolidated level and location, to obtain documentary evidence supporting the correct application of the procedures and methods used to calculate the indicators.\n\nConclusion\nBased on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 2020 consolidated non-financial statement of the Enel Group has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of articles 3 and 4 of the decree and the GRI Standards.\n\nOther matters\nThe NFS presents the corresponding figures included in the 2018 and 2019 consolidated non-financial statements for comparative purposes, on which other auditors performed a limited assurance engagement and expressed their unqualified conclusions on 17 April 2019 and 8 April 2020, respectively.\n\nRome, 19 April 2021\n\nKPMG S.p.A.\n\n(signed on the original)\n\nMarco Maffei\nDirector of Audit\nDNV Business Assurance has verified, in accordance with the Standard ISO 14064-3, the Greenhouse Gas (hereinafter \"GHG\") emissions of the organization\n\n**ENEL SpA**\n\nViale Regina Margherita, 137\n00198 Rome\n\nreported in the GHG inventory descriptive document entitled \"Quantificazione e rendicontazione delle emissioni di gas a effetto serra secondo lo standard corporativo 'The Greenhouse Gas Protocol' del anno 2020\" (hereinafter \"the GHG Inventory Report\") issued the 15 April 2021 by ENEL SpA using a financial control consolidation approach and relative to the direct and the indirect activities below reported carried out worldwide by the Group companies described in the aforementioned GHG Inventory Report.\n\nBased on our verification process procedures, DNV GL states that:\n- the aforementioned GHG Inventory Report has been issued by ENEL SpA in compliance with the revised edition of \"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol\" corporate standard.

Scope 2 is calculated according to the \u201clocation based\u201d method based on the company\u2019s location. It is the result of the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from electricity generation in the area where the consumption takes place. This figure is obtained by multiplying a company\u2019s electricity consumption (expressed in kWh) within the borders of the country in question and the average CO\u2082 emissions per kWh at the specific country level. Scope 2 is calculated according to the \u201cmarket based\u201d method based on the market where the company operates. For companies operating in European countries, the reference market is the European one. In the event of supply of energy from renewable sources, the electricity\u2019s origin must be certified by \u201ccontractual instruments that meet the minimum quality criteria\u201d. In Europe, the only way to prove the electricity\u2019s origin is the Guarantee of Origin. Companies that use electricity whose origin is not certified by these Guarantees must perform the calculation by referring to the emissions associated with the residual mix (source: Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, 2020).\n\n(5) \u201cScope 2\u201d Emissions from energy losses from the distribution grid. With its business, the Group covers the entire generation and sales chain in Europe (Italy and Spain) and in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Peru). To calculate emissions, it has been assumed that the vertical chain of activities takes place within the country. The emissions caused by the losses were calculated based on the part of energy that exceeds the share produced in the country in question, so as to avoid any double counting of emissions already included in Scope 1. An additional division was made for the fraction distributed and sold by Enel in the retail market \u2013 a share for which transmission losses were also calculated \u2013 and for the share distributed on behalf of other market companies. Since 2020, the category includes the indirect emissions deriving from technical losses from Enel\u2019s distribution grid, calculated according to the market-based methodology for 2020-2018.\n\n(6) \u201cScope 3\u201d Indirect CO\u2082 emissions for the freighting of coal by sea is estimated on the basis of the actual routes taken by the ships. This value was also calculated for 2019. Since 2020, the estimate of the share of emissions for rail freight has no longer been reported as this form of transport is no longer used. Indirect CO\u2082 emissions from the transportation of consumable materials, fuel oil, diesel, solid biomass, WDF and waste are estimated based on the quantities of raw materials transported, taking into consideration the distance travelled with a capacity of 28 tons, which is the average found trip distance of 70 km with a consumption of 1 liter of diesel for every 3 km travelled and an emission coefficient of 3 kg of CO\u2082 for each liter of diesel consumed. The figure is a rough estimate of the fugitive methane emissions (CH\u2084) from coal imported and used by the Enel Group for thermoelectric generation. The figure does not take into account emissions due to the transportation of lignite. In terms of the use of the product sold by end customers for the gas market, the figure for emissions from the combustion of natural gas is calculated based on the energy amount (GWh) of gas sold multiplied by its emission factor source (IPCC for CO\u2082, N\u2082O and CH\u2084) to calculate emissions from the use of the electricity sold. It has been assumed that the vertical chain of activities takes place within the same country. The emissions of the share sold and produced by the company have not been included in the calculation since they already fall under Scope 1. The share for the fraction sold but not produced by country was calculated by multiplying the energy amount by the specific country-level emission source. Emissions from network losses are not included in the calculation since they are reported under Scope 2.\n\n(7) Mercury emissions in 2020 amounted to 53 kg, associated with thermoelectric generation for Italy, Spain, Russia and Chile, which account for almost 100% of coal-fired thermoelectric generation throughout the Group. This is in addition to the mercury emissions from the geothermal sector, amounting to 336 kg. In Europe, mercury emissions are decided to the competent authorities for registration in the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) in accordance with EU Regulation No 166/2006 and are subject to the relevant checks in terms of completeness, consistency and credibility (Article 2 of Regulation No 166/2006).\n\n(8) The figure for 2012 has been recalculated with methodology in line with 2020.\n\n(9) The extraction that contributes to specific water withdrawal is constituted by all the water withdrawal quotas from surface (including recovered rainwater and groundwater sources, by third parties, from the sea and from wastewater lagoons for third party procurements) used for processes and for closed-cycle cooling, except the quota of seawater discharged back into sea after the desalination process (brine). This latter item (brine) contributes to the quota of total withdrawals.\n\n(10) Following the adoption of standard GRI 303, since 2019 the figures relating to the withdrawal classes by water source are divided into fresh water (>1,000 mg/l total dissolved solids) and other water (\u22641,000 mg/l total dissolved solids) and other water (\u22641,000 mg/l total dissolved solids). This division is not available for 2018.\n\n(11) GRI 303 has defined as \u2018water stressed\u2019 areas those in which, on the basis of the classification provided by the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, the ratio between the total annual withdrawal of surface water or groundwater for different uses (industrial, agricultural and livestock) and the total annual renewable water supply available (\u2018base water stress\u2019, understood, therefore, as the level of competition between all users, is high (H20-40%) or extremely high (H40+)). By way of greater environmental protection, we have also considered as located in water stressed areas those plants falling in zones classified by the WRI as \u2018end\u2019.\n### ELECTRIFICATION, DIGITAL AND PLATFORMS\n\n#### KPIs\n\n| KPI | UM | December 2020 | December 2019 | December 2018 | 2020-2019 % | Scope |\n|-----|----|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n| Customers Chile | (no) | 8 | 8 | -

The 2020 figures include a more specific determination thereof.\n2. The park efficiency was calculated assuming the operation of the plants at load level, where there is maximum efficiency for those plants; for these, the load curve is available. This assumption has not been applied to the heat component since it is already high efficiency; the availability was calculated by reducing the causes of internal unavailability.\n3. Some 2019 figures have been updated.\n4. The value is calculated on a 1-100 scale basis.\n5. In 2020, the value calculation has changed: from a 100 point scale to a 10 point scale.\n6.

The institutional investor is an entity that, under a specific mandate or on its own account, undertakes equity and/or property investment on a continuous and professional basis. The category includes: mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, investment and merchant banks, insurance companies.\n2. Calculated comparing the number of shares held by identified Socially Responsible Investors (SRI) with the number of shares held by identified institutional investors.\n3. SRI are investors who state that they include environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their traditional financial analyses in order to guide their investment decisions (inclusion of at least one ESG criterion and adhesion to the main international principles approved by organizations such as UNPRI, UKEF, EUSIF, are among the key factors in order to classify an investor as an SRI).\n4. Calculated as the difference between the valuation on the last open market day of the year and the valuation of the previous year.\n5. Only requests received have been considered, not the responses provided.\n6. The number of independent directors pursuant to the Consolidated Law on Finance (LRF) is 8 (including the Chairman). The number of independent directors pursuant to the Corporate Governance Code is 7 because the Code does not allow the Chairman to be considered independent since he/she is a \u2018senior representative\u2019 of the company.\n7. In 2020, the analysis of reports received in 2019 was completed, hence the number of confirmed violations for 2019 was revised from 35 to 38. The two additional violations are to be accredited to minor cases of private interest in Brazil.\n8. Corruption consists of the abuse of power with the goal of private gain and can be instigated by individuals in the public or private sector. It is interpreted here as including corrupt practices such as bribery, fraud, extortion, collusion, conflicts of interest and money laundering.\n9. No agreement significant for this reporting was entered into in 2020.\n10. Non-repayable loans do not have a linear or foreseeable trend while a significant grant was given in 2018, this did not occur in 2020 as only minor projects were set out.\n11. The 2019 figures have been updated. Specifically, in Chile and Colombia, projects not previously considered in the scope of reference have been included. In terms of Italy, the decrease is due to an adjustment on several projects.\n12. The 2019 figures have been updated. Specifically, in Italy, a deviation occurred, which mainly includes adjustments and projects not mapped in a residual manner. Brazil shows a reduction due to the exchange rate applied.\n| GRI Standards | Disclosure | Omission | Page number(s) and/or URL(s) | Part Omitted | Reason | Explanation |\n|---------------|------------|----------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------|-------------|\n| GRI 101: Foundation 2016 | General Disclosures | | | | | |\n| | Organizational profile | | | | | |\n| 102-1 Name of the organization | | | 312 | | | |\n| 102-2 Activities, brands, products, and services | | | 10-11 | | | |\n| 102-3 Location of headquarters | | | 312 | | | |\n| 102-4 Location of operations | | | 10-11 | | | |\n| 102-5 Ownership and legal form | | | 10-11, 236, 312, Sustainability Statement, sec.
