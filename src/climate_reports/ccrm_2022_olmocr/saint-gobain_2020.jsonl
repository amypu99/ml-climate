In 2003, we did materialize our ongoing improvement approach as we became signatories of the UN Global Compact. We also formalized our Principles of Conduct and Action, which define our code of ethics and permeate our corporate culture. In 2015, we set ourselves ambitious environmental objectives for 2025. In 2020, we designed and published our roadmap to becoming carbon-neutral in 2050, and we defined new mid-term environmental objectives for 2030.\n\nMaking sustainability part of our global strategy echoes one strong belief: value creation can only occur if it is shared with all our stakeholders. With our staff and their families, of course, but also with all those we interact with all through our value creation chain, from suppliers to final users, from corporate clients to investors and public authorities, from our research and academic partners to start-uppers and innovators, and from media to opinion leaders and NGOs.\n\nAs our Group announced both exceptional results for the second half of 2020 and changes in our governance, we publish this first Integrated Report with one clear ambition: to help our stakeholders better understand how we bring together the various dimensions of our strategy, and how Saint-Gobain creates short, middle and long-term value, taking our stakeholders\u2019 interests into account. With this report, we aim to be transparent and didactic. We see it as additional proof of our dedication to integration, openness and proximity.\n\n\u201cWe do believe the major economic, environmental, social and societal challenges of our times will only be answered thanks to the full contribution of businesses, understanding the necessary association of profitable growth and sustainable performance. This is precisely what is at stake, as we decide to make CSR an integral part of Saint-Gobain\u2019s business model and overall strategy.\u201d\nSAINT-GOBAIN\u2019S DNA\n\nTHE GROUP\u2019S HISTORY\nFounded in 1665, Saint-Gobain keeps building its future.

This unprecedented crisis has profound implications for Saint-Gobain, not only on its day-to-day operations but also on its business model and future development strategy. It has been a test of the Group\u2019s ability to react to adversity.\n\nTHE PRIORITY: TAKING CARE OF THE GROUP\u2019S STAKEHOLDERS\n\nFrom the first weeks of the crisis, Saint-Gobain demonstrated unprecedented agility in adapting its operating methods. The overriding priority has been to protect the health of the Group\u2019s employees, customers, suppliers and their families. Beyond necessary sanitary measures, the emphasis has been put on maintaining contact, social dialogue, and employees\u2019 work-life balance.\n\nSTRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS VALIDATED BY THE CRISIS\n\nThe new link between global and local, resulting from the Transform & Grow strategic plan, has proven its strength and relevance during the pandemic and has allowed for crisis management that is both highly coordinated and decentralized. Beyond the management of the crisis, this dynamic unique to the Group is clearly relevant in the context of a trend toward regionalization of the global economy and aspirations to relocate value chains.\nRESPONDING TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS: A STEADFAST COMMITMENT\n\nBOUNCE BACK AND PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE\n\nFor a group such as Saint-Gobain, the ability to face a crisis of exceptional magnitude in the short term necessarily goes hand in hand with preparing for the future: coming out of the crisis and the more or less rapid recovery of markets and their transformation. It is also a matter of understanding the long term impacts of the crisis on the world in which Saint-Gobain operates, first by anticipating the future needs of its customers and their logistical, technical and financial challenges, then the solutions that will be a priority for them, and finally the emerging markets.\n\nA COMMITMENT TO SERVING SOCIETY AS A WHOLE\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Life Sciences Business Unit has made an exceptional effort to produce and supply the components (tubes, connectors, filters, membranes) necessary for the equipment used to diagnose, treat and care for Covid-19 patients. More specifically, it has increased by 15 times the production of parts essential to the manufacturing of ventilators.\n\nSaint-Gobain\u2019s teams in Spain have converted plastic packaging from gypsum pallets into protective aprons for caregivers at hospitals.\n\nSaint-Gobain Ecophon France has delivered acoustic solutions as part of a sponsorship agreement with the hospital group AP-HP Sorbonne Universit\u00e9.\n\nEmployee at the Life Sciences plant in Charny, France, which manufactures components for respirators.\nSaint-Gobain Weber solutions were used in the construction of the world\u2019s longest cross-sea bridge, spanning 55 km between Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao.\nTRENDS SHAPING A VOLATILE, UNCERTAIN AND UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT\n\nSaint-Gobain operates in a constantly changing world. However, three major trends have been emerging for several years now, and they are being accelerated by the health crisis: the world demands more sustainable development, and it is more local and more digital.\n\nThe combination of the challenges (climate and the environment, demography and urbanization, digitization) and crises of various kinds (health, economic, migration, political) that we are witnessing creates a picture of a world that is volatile, uncertain and complex all at once. Saint-Gobain\u2019s positioning is based on taking into account in the short and long term these underlying trends, which represent both opportunities and challenges for the construction of the world of tomorrow, and on an in-depth understanding of the ecosystem comprised by all its stakeholders.\n\nThe Group must fully integrate climate and the environment into its strategic vision, thanks to its commitments and its active involvement in exerting a virtuous influence over its entire value chain. In 2020, Saint-Gobain unveiled its roadmap toward carbon neutrality by 2050, with new objectives for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (cf. page 42).\nIn addition to the Group\u2019s responsibility as a leading economic player, the requirements of sustainable development and the transition to a low-carbon economy are accelerating the transformation of business models and offering many opportunities for Saint-Gobain, some of which have already materialized in terms of new products, new services and new ways of working with customers and partners.\n\nThe Group faces a challenge: profoundly transforming itself so that it is able to constantly adapt to an environment that has become structurally unstable, by building and implementing strategies that take into account an uncertain world. The model that Saint-Gobain has built combines the strength of a global group and a structure that gives the local level the autonomy necessary to adapt to a changing environment; this model is a performance lever necessary to achieve profitable and sustainable growth.\nA CONTINUOUS GROWTH TREND\n\nThe world population in 2020 was estimated at 7.8 billion. In total, the total human population has grown by an average of 1.1% per year over the last five years. The various factors influencing global demographic trends resulted in a projection of 9.7 billion inhabitants in 2050 and 11 billion inhabitants in 2100.\n\nA POPULATION THAT IS MORE AND MORE URBAN\n\nIn 2007, the urban population has exceeded the rural population for the first time in human history; today, more than 80% of global GNP is generated in cities, which absorb more than 60% of the natural resources used worldwide. At the local level, urban areas already directly or indirectly consume between 60% and 80% of the energy consumed by a country. According to projections, the percentage of the urban population will continue to grow rapidly. In 2015, nearly 55% of the world\u2019s population lived in cities, whereas this proportion will reach 68% by 2050, representing an additional 2.7 billion urban dwellers.\n\nIn developed countries, the ageing population creates a need for adapting housing units and renovating older buildings.\nVULNERABLE AREAS, HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS\n\nUrban areas, which are dense and largely devoid of vegetation and have waterproofed soil, are particularly vulnerable to the increase in average temperatures and the higher frequency of heat peaks. The rapid expansion of cities in turn increases waste production, which already represents an annual volume of 720 billion tons worldwide.\n\nCONSEQUENCES OVER NEW CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION MARKETS\n\nUrbanization leads to an increase in the need for housing, transport, energy, water and waste treatment. As to construction and renovation, issues are many: in low-income countries, access to decent housing and affordable energy costs are major socio-economic topics; in middle-income countries, a large middle class with high purchasing power is developing, with ever-increasing demands for comfort, requiring adapted solutions. In developed countries, the ageing population means a need for adapting housing units and renovating older buildings.\n\nbillion inhabitants on Earth by 2050, according to United Nations projections\nThe year 2020 is symbolic as it marks the thirtieth anniversary of the first report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which served as the basis for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). Since then, year after year, the scientific consensus has continued to confirm and clarify the reality of multiple, mutually reinforcing phenomena.\n\nThe first of these is direct impacts on the environment, ranging from ecosystem integrity to biodiversity.\n\nIn 2015, via the Paris Agreement, states agreed upon the binding ambition to keep the rise in temperatures below 2\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial era, which means reducing GHG emissions by 2.7% per year from 2020 to 2030. However, data shows that the current trajectory is not in line with this objective: in 2019, greenhouse gas emissions reached a record high of 59 billion tons of CO\u2082 equivalent, signaling a continued rapid increase in emissions.\nAFTER THE PANDEMIC, A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY\n\nThe stimulus plans announced by the major powers and by regional organizations, which are measured in the trillions of euros, are potentially part of the solution. Their unprecedented scale (\u20ac750 billion for the European Union only) may make it possible to achieve the temperature increase targets. Almost half of the \u20ac100 billion French stimulus program is earmarked for investments supporting the ecological transition, including \u20ac5.8 billion for energy renovation and \u20ac6.5 billion for transport infrastructure and green mobility.\n\n59 billion tons of CO\u2082 equivalent emitted*\n\n* Human emissions, 2019 data\nDEPLETION OF NATURAL RESOURCES\n\nAN EVER-INCREASING PRESSURE ON RESOURCES\n\nOn a global scale, the consumption of natural resources is accelerating, with 92 billion tons extracted in 2017 compared to 27 in 1970, a threefold increase, while the population has only doubled in the same period of time. The construction sector, which uses materials such as steel or concrete, plays a decisive role in this area.\n\nTHE URGENT NEED FOR SOLUTIONS\n\nTo limit the consumption of raw materials, solutions exist for optimizing the quantity of materials used for a given worksite, as well as through the adoption of a circular economy approach. In fact, public policies increasingly adopt a \u201clife cycle\u201d approach that takes into account the environmental impact of a building as a whole, from the extraction of raw materials to its dismantling and to the recycling of its materials.\nA MAJOR IMPACT ON THE VALUE CHAIN OF THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR\n\nThe recovery of materials makes it possible to limit the use of resources and emissions while generating additional economic growth, especially because it stimulates the search for technological innovation. In the construction sector in particular, which is responsible for 40% of global waste production and 50% of resource consumption, the transition to the circular economy is the source of profound renewal at different levels of the value chain: production processes, product formulation, product end-of-life management, recycling, reuse, development of the economy of functionality, etc. The rise of prefabrication and the development of lightweight construction solutions are some of the responses to these major challenges.\n\nDEPLETION OF NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n92 billion tons extracted in 2017 compared to 27 in 1970\nA MEGATREND THAT CHANGES BUSINESS ECOSYSTEMS\n\nDigital technology is opening new trade opportunities, with a very high annual growth rate for e-commerce throughout the world since the early 2000s. Businesses must now be closer to their end customers to avoid new intermediations. In addition, to differentiate themselves, services play an essential role. This means that digital technology is globally reshaping the competitive balance and the way that businesses interact with their stakeholders (customers, employees and suppliers).\n\nINDUSTRY 4.0: AN ARRAY OF INNOVATIONS FOR A NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\n\nDigital technology is also revolutionizing the way that factories are organized. It is producing a major, gradual change in production methods, by providing real-time access to a wealth of information on industrial facilities that are now interconnected, and enabling extensive data analysis and correlation of these data. The concept of \u201cIndustry 4.0\u201d is an integral part of the reality of companies today, thanks to the combination of intelligent data analysis, automation and augmented operators. This breakthrough progress enables an increase in productivity and flexibility, mass customization, and optimization of industrial sites\u2019 environmental footprint.\nCONSTRUCTION: AN INDUSTRY RESHAPED BY DIGITAL INNOVATION\n\nDigital integration of buildings is leading to technical changes in construction, particularly the increasing use of Building Information Modeling (BIM), which provides an integrated view of a building throughout all the stages of its life cycle thanks to a \u201cdigital twin\u201d. Prefab or off-site construction are also rising thanks to new technologies allowing for data collection and analysis. Domotics, which helps reducing energy consumption in buildings and improving security, allows for an increasingly comprehensive integration of smart equipment into daily life.\n\nTHE DATA REVOLUTION AND ITS IMPACT ON CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS\n\nContinuous growth of e-commerce, diversification of digital channels, data collection and analysis thanks to artificial intelligence solutions are all factors that have a deep impact on client relationship management. Businesses can tap into this opportunity so as to optimize their sales, develop cross-selling and get to know better the various participants in their value chain.\n\n3 billion users should have internet access by 2022 in fast-growing countries\nSTRATEGY\n\nHow Saint-Gobain organizes itself to create value with its stakeholders.\n\nSaint-Gobain provides solutions that make buildings more efficient in terms of their energy consumption, and which help contribute to the end user\u2019s well-being as well as to saving the planet.\nIn an ever-changing world, Saint-Gobain integrates environmental, social and societal challenges in its strategy and operations thanks to its unique value creation model, working as close as possible with markets and customers.\n\nIn addition to these opportunities and risks, sorted out by megatrends, Saint-Gobain analyzed CSR-related opportunities and risks, taking into account its contribution to the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe methodology used, the risks identified and the strategies implemented to mitigate the latter are described in the Group\u2019s 2020 Universal Registration Document (pp. 391 to 393).\n\nManagement of risks that involve significant financial impact is described in the Chapter 6 of the 2020 Universal Registration Document.\n\nOptimera\u2019s LeanWorks service in Norway allows for optimized on-site delivery, positioning materials at the right place and waste collection.\nSAINT-GOBAIN - 2020 INTEGRATED REPORT\n\nRISKS & OPPORTUNITIES\n\nDEMOGRAPHICS & URBANIZATION\n- New housing needs\n- Lightweight construction solutions, prefabrication, performance of Saint-Gobain\u2019s solutions\n- Solutions for sustainable mobility\n- Waste collection and recycling processes\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n- Solutions for energy efficient buildings\n- Solutions for sustainable mobility\n- Innovation relating to low carbon industrial processes and products\n- Citizen mobilization on climate change in many countries: positive effect on brand reputation and talent attraction for companies involved\n\nDEPLETION OF NATURAL RESOURCES\n- Circular economy: waste collection and recycling\n- Solutions taking into account the whole products\u2019 life cycle, including deconstruction\n- Innovation for new product formulation and the adaptation of industrial processes\n\nDIGITIZATION\n- Optimization of industrial processes and supply chains\n- Client experience and new services\n- E-commerce and distribution\n\nRISKS\n- Increasing pollution and waste generation\n- Extension of slum-type areas\n- Increasing inequality\n- Health-related risks and cost of healthcare services\n\nOPPORTUNITIES\n- Rise in the number of extreme climate events\n- Cost and availability of energy and raw materials\n- Regulation change and cost of compliance\n- Reputational risk in case of default on the promise\n\n- Cost and availability of raw materials\n- Supply chain disruption\n- Loss of biodiversity\n\n- Cybersecurity and data protection\n- Legal risks relating to data protection regulation\n- Employees\u2019 skillset adaptation\nCSR AS A SOURCE OF VALUE CREATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS\n\nThe Group understands its social and environmental responsibility not as an obligation or a threat, but rather as an opportunity to create shared value together with its stakeholders, whose interests are taken into account within Saint-Gobain\u2019s strategy thanks to active listening as well as an open, transparent dialogue.\n\nTHE ALLIANCE OF LOCAL EXPERTISE AND A GLOBAL FOOTPRINT\n\nSaint-Gobain has reinvented its organization by giving a high level of decision-making autonomy to the local level, allowing for fast response to market demands. At the global level, the strength of an international Group makes it possible to build up strong pool of expertise in areas such as research and development or industrial performance.\n\nA FOCUS ON SYNERGIES IN OPERATIONS AND INTERNAL ORGANIZATION\n\nThe Group\u2019s new organizational structure fosters synergies between support functions \u2013 with applications such as unique customer services and common logistics \u2013 and are also helpful to develop cross-selling to better answer customers\u2019 demands.\n\nA SOLUTION-BASED APPROACH\n\nThe Group aims at enriching and widening its offering so as to provide more and more often a comprehensive answer to its clients\u2019 challenges, be it for renovation projects, new construction, or mobility systems.\n\nVISION\n\nTO BE THE LEADER IN SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION, IMPROVING EVERYDAY LIFE THROUGH HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLUTIONS\nMISSION\n\nDESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE MATERIALS AND SOLUTIONS WHICH ARE KEY INGREDIENTS IN THE WELL-BEING OF EACH OF US AND THE FUTURE OF ALL\n\nENHANCED CLIENT EXPERIENCE\n\nSaint-Gobain aims to reinvent customer experience thanks to a focus on digital technologies, revamped logistics, customization and data analysis. The Group also develops new, innovative business models.\n\nINNOVATION, A KEY DIFFERENTIATING FACTOR\n\nResearch and innovation are at the heart of Saint-Gobain\u2019s strategy. The Group\u2019s ongoing actions enabled it to be listed in the tenth time in a row among the world\u2019s top 100 most innovative organizations in the \u201cTop 100 Global Innovators\u2122\u201d.\n\nACCELERATED DIGITIZATION\n\nDigital has strong impacts on Saint-Gobain\u2019s managerial culture, but also on careers, thanks to an easier access to continuing training. As to industrial performance, the Group is investing in industry 4.0 as part of its operational excellence goals to maintain its industrial tool at the cutting edge of the sector.\n\nEFFICIENTLY ALLOCATING THE GROUP\u2019S RESOURCES\n\nIn terms of allocating financial resources, Saint-Gobain\u2019s approach aims both to target investments in order to stimulate growth and to manage a portfolio that is both agile and value-creating.\nConsistent with its purpose, \u201cMaking the world a better home\u201d, Saint-Gobain\u2019s mission is to design, manufacture and distribute materials and solutions which are key ingredients in the well-being of each of us and the future of all. To this end, the Group is not content with designing, manufacturing and distributing products: it brings to the market an array of solutions that meet both Saint-Gobain customers\u2019 demands for performance and sustainable development challenges. This drive toward comprehensive solutions, relying on powerful digital tools, applies throughout the whole Group\u2019s value chain, and lies at the heart of its strategic plan.\n\nThe Group aims at enriching and widening its offering so as to provide more and more often a comprehensive answer to its client\u2019s challenges, delivering the right solutions in terms of thermal or acoustic comfort, air quality, or productivity.\n\nThe following pages describe a few examples of this approach, which is meant to help Saint-Gobain\u2019s customers successfully manage their own energy and ecological transition, a topic that is the overarching issue at stake today, as shown by its integration in the stimulus packages announced by several countries.\nEnsuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\n\nOffering sustainable and affordable solutions that are adapted to the lifestyle changes associated with increasing urbanization\n\nChanging the way we design, produce and distribute our products and solutions to support the development of the circular economy\n\nContributing to the emergence of low-carbon economies capable of preserving the common good\n\nFOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS\n\n- Prefabricated roof trusses\n- Mechanized solutions, bringing comfort and productivity for the installers\n- Glass panels bringing light and thermal comfort\n- End-to-end service, from inspiration to professional advisory and intermediation with the end customer\n- Distribution of ventilation solutions, for better air quality\n- Thermo-acoustic and noise-absorbing insulation solutions for combustion engine vehicles\n- Local services by distribution agencies: delivery, professional training, etc.\nFOR NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS\n\n- Insulated air conditioning ducts\n- Shock resistance in circulation spaces\n- Prefabrication services\n- Components for medical equipment: scintillators for the medical imaging industry\n- Complete offering of partition and ceiling solutions for acoustic and cleaning purposes\n- Formaldehyde absorption for better air quality\n- X-ray shielding plasterboard for radiology rooms\n- Solutions for modular spaces\n- Glazed walls to control the input of natural light and optimize thermal efficiency\n- Components for wearable, connected glucose monitoring systems and portable insulin pumps\n- Upstream project assistance: prescription so as to recommend the most adequate solutions, BIM so as to ensure better project management\n\nPromoting healthy lives and support the well-being of all at all ages\nContributing to the emergence of low-carbon economies capable of preserving the common good\n\nEND USER PRODUCTIVITY\nHEALTH AND WELL-BEING\nSOLUTIONS FOR THE PLANET\nFOR MOBILITY\n\nA SOLUTION-BASED APPROACH\n\nPromoting healthy lives and support the well-being of all at all ages\n\nContributing to the emergence of low-carbon economies capable of preserving the common good\n\nSAINT-GOBAIN - 2020 INTEGRATED REPORT\n\nFOR MOBILITY\n\n1.

Factors such as the size of the Group, its global dimension and the variety of its business lines mean that this interaction must, above all, be organized in a decentralized manner, with each operational entity being responsible for conducting it within its own scope. Saint-Gobain has mapped its ecosystem, identifying and grouping its stakeholders by category, and describing how dialogue is conducted.\nSaint-Gobain has defined a Corporate Social Responsibility roadmap to address the priority issues identified through the Group\u2019s stakeholder mapping (see page 37) and its materiality analysis (see page 63). It guides the Group\u2019s actions to reduce the negative impact of its operations and solutions on the environment, individuals and society, and to contribute to more responsible and fairer sustainable development.\n\nIt takes into account the Group\u2019s strategic intent, the specific expectations of its stakeholders, and the common imperative of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations.\n\nIt has a pedagogical value, and is designed to encourage the search for synergies with stakeholders.\n\nThe CSR roadmap was updated in 2020. For each one of the Group\u2019s priority issues, an ambition has been stated, policies and operational action plans including monitoring indicators and objectives have been put in place (see page 64).\n\n**BUSINESS ETHICS**\n- Ethical practices with employees: to support our employees in the fair and responsible practice of their profession.\n- Responsible purchasing: to work fairly and ethically with suppliers across the supply chain.\n\n**EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND DIVERSITY**\n- Employee engagement: to create a motivating and engaging work environment for all our employees.\n- Diversity and inclusion: to foster inclusion and promote diversity.\n\n**HEALTH AND SAFETY ACROSS THE ENTIRE VALUE CHAIN**\n- With our employees, temporary workers and subcontractors: to ensure health and safety on our sites.\n- For our suppliers, customers, end users and local communities: to ensure the health and safety of our external stakeholders.\n\n**CLIMATE CHANGE**\n- Carbon impact: to propose solutions that promote energy efficiency and reduce CO\u2082 emissions and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n- Other environmental impacts: to fight against the effects of climate change, in particular to preserve biodiversity and deal with the increase in the number of water-stressed areas.\n\n**CIRCULAR ECONOMY**\n- Organizing the circular economy: to manage resources responsibly and avoid the use of non-recyclable raw materials.\n- Organizing circular economy: waste collection and recycling.\n\n**INCLUSIVE GROWTH**\nTo make a contribution to local communities in synergy with our country markets, sites and structures, our philanthropic actions and the engagement of our employees.\nFor stakeholders, a long-term partner must share values such as respect for human rights and ethical business practices. This involves building trusting relationships through constant dialogue and transparent communication.\n\nOur code of ethics is the foundation of our commitments. It applies to all our employees and partners. Policies complement or clarify certain subjects, in particular the human rights policy and the data privacy policy. Compliance programs are deployed throughout the world.\n\nWhen choosing suppliers and subcontractors, the focus must be based on businesses that share our values, ensure decent work for their employees, respect human rights and limit their impact on the environment.\n\nOur \u201cResponsible Purchasing\u201d program is based on four principles: the signature of the purchasers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 charter, the analysis of CSR risks, the evaluation of CSR performance and the implementation of corrective action plans. We also implement policies related to the control of specific risks such as wood or minerals at risk.\n\n- Updated the alert system, now open to all stakeholders;\n- Strengthened our anti-corruption policy.\n\n- Acceleration of the responsible purchasing program, with new objectives for 2025;\n- Strengthening our timber policy.\nEmployee trust and commitment are essential to the success of a company and its attractiveness, performance and ability to adapt to crises, technical changes and new social expectations. The quality of social dialogue, training programs for the development of skills as well as personal development, a wage policy that ensures a decent standard of living and reflects individual and collective performance, and the well-being of employees are all examples of the means deployed to ensure employee satisfaction or attract and retain talent.\n\nFostering inclusion and diversity demonstrates a company\u2019s capacity for openness. Actions to promote a fairer society are evidence expected by all stakeholders of a company\u2019s commitment. Promoting diversity, encouraging inclusion and fighting discrimination are at the heart of our human resources policy. In addition to encouraging recruitment and internal promotions, the daily fight against stereotypes and the identification of unconscious bias are essential.\n\n- Renewal of our inclusion in the Top Employer Global ranking for the sixth consecutive year and in 36 countries representing over 90% of employees;\n- CARE by Saint-Gobain: parenthood pillar established for 100% of employees worldwide.\n\n- Objective of more than 25% female managers reached by the end of 2020;\n- New training programs on stereotypes.\nCreating a safe working environment is an essential expectation to establishing a climate of trust with stakeholders, especially employees.\n\nEnsuring health and safety at our sites means protecting all potential employees, temporary workers, on-site subcontractors and visitors.\n\nWe are making progress by identifying and controlling risks on our sites and complying with the procedures and standards set out in the WCM (World Class Management) operational excellence program.\n\nThe health crisis reminded us that health and safety are absolute priorities. In addition to direct operations, the consideration of health and safety risks must include the entire value chain.\n\nOur health policy sets the guidelines for our actions to protect the health of our suppliers, customers, end users and local communities.\n\nThe design of our solutions and the quality of our products are at the heart of our commitment. Site quality certification, chemical risk management, and programs to reduce the use of chemicals in our products are all key elements of our commitment.\n\n\u2022 Responsible and committed management of the Covid-19 health crisis;\n\u2022 Safety training course for the management of subcontractors on site.\n\n\u2022 Publication of the HICE (Health indicator for occupational exposure) indicator on the management of risks related to noise\n\u2022 Update of our chemical inventory tool.\nThe climate emergency is a reality. Beyond commitments, stakeholders expect an effective reduction in the carbon footprint of production and consumption. This requires actions, innovation, investments and a range of solutions with a lower carbon impact.\n\nTo manage our impact and increase the contribution of our solutions, we have:\n\n- Operational excellence - including WCM - for sites or supply chain optimization;\n- Solutions for Growth, for the design and evaluation of our solutions, enabling carbon avoidance in the use phases;\n- Innovation in processes and products to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nThe effects of climate change are already visible in the increase in areas under water stress, violent storms, flooding and the loss of biodiversity...\n\nLimiting the effects of climate change on the environment is essential for the future of the planet.\n\nOur water management policy supports our commitment to minimizing water withdrawal and moving towards \u201czero discharge\u201d of industrial water in liquid form.\n\nOur biodiversity policy, supported by our charter for the environment and biodiversity in quarries and mines, guarantees our commitment to the preservation of biodiversity.\n\n- Biodiversity commitment as part of our partnership with Act4nature International;\n- Update of impacts on high and very high water stress areas, following the evolution published by the WRI.\nThe planet\u2019s resources are not infinite. Not wasting them is therefore a priority. Products must be designed to limit the use of natural resources and promote recycling.\n\nWhile resources are limited and the preservation of the planet is essential, waste is not acceptable for production and consumption. Limiting waste and recovering and recycling it for a true circular economy means that everyone must be involved.\n\nContributing to the circular economy starts with our sites, our products and our solutions by reducing non-recycled waste, collecting waste from our customers or integrating deconstruction and end-of-life of products right from the design stage.\n\nIn addition, we are working to create channels and transformation of waste into recycled raw materials that are integrated into our products or recovered by partners.\n\n\u2022 New 2030 objectives for recyclable materials and recyclability.\n\n\u2022 New window dismantling services in Europe to recycle glass in our factories: services available in Finland, France, UK, Norway and Sweden.\nExpectations of greater comfort and well-being, and improvement of living conditions in general, are closely linked to the local culture in countries and regions. The adaptation of the offering integrates the expectations of local stakeholders.\n\nThrough the Solutions for Growth program, we provide sustainable and comfortable solutions to foster local and inclusive economic development. Our new organization - implemented as part of the Transform and Grow program - gives local teams responsibility for managing and creating value in the territories.\n\nTo stand in solidarity with local stakeholders so as to tackle societal challenges of communities and participate in collective efforts to improve living conditions, fight against inequality and include vulnerable populations.\n\nThe Group maintains relationships with local partners in order to stimulate local employment and support disadvantaged populations in the professional world. We contribute to local social issues through the Saint-Gobain Foundation, local foundations and corporate philanthropy initiatives. Solidarity is one of our values. In emergency situations, to help people who are discriminated against, excluded or in difficulty, or to promote decent housing, we mobilize by relying on the commitment of our employees and the local community.\n\n\u2022 Development of training programs for craftsmen to accelerate the deployment of sustainable solutions;\n\u2022 Training center for apprentices in France.\n\n\u2022 Nearly 10 million euros in favor of communities;\n\u2022 Solidarity in the face of the health crisis through donations to local communities.\nIN A MACROECONOMIC AND HEALTH ENVIRONMENT WHICH REMAINS AFFECTED BY UNCERTAINTIES, SAINT-GOBAIN EXPECTS THE FOLLOWING TRENDS:\n\n**AMERICAS**\nMarket growth, particularly new residential construction.\n\n**NORTHERN EUROPE**\nContinued outperformance in construction and support from stimulus programs.\n\n**SOUTHERN EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA**\nContinued outperformance in construction thanks to strong residential renovation markets and support from national and European stimulus plans.\n\n**ASIA-PACIFIC**\nMarket growth, with continued good momentum in China and a sharp rebound expected in India.\n\n**HIGH PERFORMANCE SOLUTIONS**\nContinued sequential improvement in most industrial markets.\nFor 2021, the Group is targeting a significant like-for-like increase in operating income, with an improvement of more than 100 basis points in the operating margin compared to the 7.7% margin in 2018 (assuming that volumes return to their 2018 levels), confirming the success of \u201cTransform & Grow\u201d.\n\n**2021 PRIORITIES**\n\n**RISE OF MORE THAN 100 BASIS POINTS IN THE OPERATING MARGIN COMPARED TO THE 2018 MARGIN OF 7.7%, AND ONGOING STRONG DISCIPLINE IN TERMS OF FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION:**\n\n- Constant focus on the price-cost spread amid inflation in raw material and energy costs\n- Reduction in costs as part of additional post-coronavirus adaptation measures\n- Continuation of the operational excellence program\n- Maintaining the structural drivers for improvement in operating working capital requirement\n- Capital expenditure\n  - of around \u20ac1.5 billion\n  - ongoing digital transformation\n- Continued reduction in non-operating costs\n\n**IMPROVEMENT IN THE GROUP\u2019S PROFITABLE GROWTH PROFILE, DRIVEN BY:**\n\n- The continuation of its portfolio optimization (divestments and acquisitions)\n- Outperformance versus the markets thanks to its range of integrated solutions\n- Strategy of differentiation and innovation to develop solutions for sustainability and performance\nTaking into account the challenges of sustainable development means giving priority to long-lasting materials that are recyclable or reusable, with a lower carbon footprint throughout their whole life cycle.\nINTEGRATION OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\nOBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE FOR SAINT-GOBAIN\n\nCREATING INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE WE OPERATE\n\n\u2022 For employees: ensuring quality employment for its employees.
