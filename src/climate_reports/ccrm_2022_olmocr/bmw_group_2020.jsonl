For the reporting year 2020, the BMW Group has combined its Annual Report and its Sustainability Report (formerly the Sustainable Value Report) in a single document. It is therefore important for us to begin by briefly explaining the structure and rationale behind the new approach so that you, as a stakeholder in the company, can make the best possible use of the report. Above all, this means being able to find and categorise the information you are looking for both quickly and reliably. Integrated reporting is a dynamic process for the BMW Group that works in both directions. For this reason, we are not only seeking a dialogue based on assertions underpinned by content, we are equally convinced that it enables us to report in the most effective way.\n\nThis version of the Annual Report is a translation from the German version. Only the original German version is binding.\n\nSYMBOLS AND OTHER INFORMATION\n\nThe contents of these sections were subjected to a separate limited assurance engagement by the independent auditor. All other audited sections of the report underwent a reasonable assurance audit engagement by the independent auditor.\n\nThe following symbols help the reader to navigate through the report:\n\n- Return to previous page\n- Go to table of contents\n- Continued on next page\n- Cross reference\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nAs a premium manufacturer, the BMW Group aspires to lead the way in terms of sustainability. It is therefore taking responsibility and placing this topic at the core of its corporate strategy moving forward. This change has involved taking a major step, as the BMW Group is including sustainability as a prime factor in its corporate decision-making processes. This integrated approach obviates the need to pursue a separate sustainability strategy. Sustainability principles \u2013 such as the prudent use of resources \u2013 are increasingly playing a key role in shaping the BMW Group\u2019s corporate strategy and serving as key parameters for an integrated and multidimensional approach.\n\nAs it embraces this process, the BMW Group is building on a solid foundation, given that it has repeatedly set itself ambitious sustainability targets and assumed a pioneering role in this area over decades. For example, the BMW Group was the first company in the automotive sector to appoint an environmental protection officer back in 1973. Under the umbrella of Efficient Dynamics, the BMW Group proceeded to innovate in the field of electrified drivetrains, while at the same time developing highly efficient combustion engines, and has systematically continued to take this dual approach ever since. With a trial fleet of around 600 fully electric MINI E vehicles made available to customers, the BMW Group demonstrated as long ago as 2009 that electric mobility can be a source of great driving pleasure as well as being suitable for everyday use. The all-electric BMW i3 followed in 2013, effectively setting the benchmark for sustainable mobility going forward. In 2020, the Group also achieved its carbon emissions targets for the new vehicle fleet, thanks to the growing size of its fleet of electrified vehicles.\nThe BMW Group has long considered it both its obligation and its mission to take a pioneering role within the automotive industry.\n\nThe logical consequence, starting with this report, is to inform stakeholders about the BMW Group\u2019s business performance in a single integrated report. The objective is to provide a clear insight into the BMW Group as a whole with the aim of making its activities transparent, accountable and measurable. At the same time, the intention is to make it as easy as possible for readers to familiarise themselves with the contents of the report. For this reason, key information is deliberately repeated at various points in the document, providing a general overview for readers focusing on specific chapters and sections who do not intend to read the entire report.\n\nThis approach not only underlines the BMW Group\u2019s determination to spearhead the transformation towards sustainability, but also its desire to shape the process and report on it in a transparent manner. This report combines the Sustainability Report and the Annual Report in a single Integrated Report, based on the framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). It replaces the two previously separate publications and will be published each year on the date of the Annual Conference. The BMW Group is keen to demonstrate to shareholders, customers, employees and, last but not least, the general public how economic, ecological and social issues can complement one another. In fact, they are often mutually dependent and the pursuit of sustainability is the driving force of the Group. The report also includes descriptions of corporate strategy, future development and internal management processes and how the BMW Group, as part of society, creates value in economic, ecological and social terms. Join the conversation with the BMW Group Dialogue.\n\n**CONTENT AND STRUCTURE**\n\nOn 9 March 2021, the Financial Statements of BMW AG were authorised for issue by the Board of Management and the Group Financial Statements approved for publication.\n\nSimilar to annual reports in previous years, the new BMW Group Report combines the management reports of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG) and the BMW Group in a Combined Management Report.\n\nIn accordance with \u00a7 289b and \u00a7 315b of the German Commercial Code (HGB), BMW AG is required to issue a non-financial statement (NFS) at both Company and Group level. This statement is published jointly for BMW AG and the BMW Group as a non-financial report within the Combined Management Report. In order to identify this content more easily, an NFS index is included as an appendix that summarises the references for the reader. As in previous years, the NFS has been reviewed. Contents that have been subjected to a limited assurance standard are marked with graphic symbols [ ]. All other parts of the Management Report and the Group Financial Statements have been audited to a reasonable assurance standard, unchanged from the previous year. Further information is provided in the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the Independent Practitioner\u2019s Report.\n\nThis report also contains information on the attainment of targets relating to the now completed sustainability strategy for the period from 2012 to 2020.\n\nThe BMW Group has published sustainable value reports since 2001, initially every two years and annually since 2012. Prior to this period, the Group had a long tradition of publishing environmental reports, in which it reported transparently on the impact of its operations on the environment, including mitigating measures.\n\nSince 2005, the BMW Group has applied Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards to report on sustainability matters. Since 2008, it has voluntarily complied with the highest GRI application level (\u201ccomprehensive option\u201d). Additional GRI-relevant information is provided in the chapter Further GRI Information and in the GRI Content Index. This information was also subjected to a limited assurance review.\n\nIn 2015, the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) announced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are at the core of the 2030 Agenda, a global action plan aiming to ensure that economic progress is environmentally friendly and socially equitable. The BMW Group has identified the SDGs to which it can make a direct and thus the greatest possible contribution with its own sustainability goals. Reference is made to these SDGs at the beginning of the Combined Management Report.\nThe report is structured to ensure that essential content is easily accessible, even at a glance. With this point in mind, the key information is presented in summarised form at the beginning of each section of the Management Report and subsequently discussed in detail. In addition, information provided in graphical form has been highlighted to enable key facts to be identified more easily.\n\n**Connection to Figures in the Group Financial Statements**\n\nFor each topic, an assessment was carried out to identify figures reported in the financial statements that enable a better understanding of the NFS, and which therefore require to be explained. Where necessary, these figures have been disclosed and explained in the relevant chapters.\n\n**CURRENT AND FUTURE REPORTING**\n\nIn light of the announcement that the major standards institutions (GRI, SASB, CDSB, CDP/TCFD and IIRC) intend to collaborate, alongside regulatory developments relating to non-financial reporting (including the revision of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive), the reporting environment is likely to continue gaining momentum. At the same time, the BMW Group sees the development of business strategy as an ongoing task, in order to remain flexible within an increasingly dynamic environment. Both aspects will play a key role in future reporting. For this reason, the BMW Group plans to review its non-financial performance indicators in 2021.\n\nThe figures for fuel consumption, CO\u2082 emissions and power consumption are calculated based on the measurement methods stipulated in the current version of Regulation (EU) 715/2007. This information is based on a vehicle with basic equipment in Germany; ranges take into account differences in wheel and tyre size selected as well as optional equipment and can change based on configuration. For further details of the official fuel consumption figures and official specific CO\u2082 emissions of new cars, please refer to the \"Manual on fuel consumption, CO\u2082 emissions and power consumption of new cars\", available at www.dat.de/co2/.\nTO OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\n8  BMW Group in Figures\n13  Report of the Supervisory Board\n23  Statement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\n29  Dialogue with Stakeholders\n33  BMW Stock and Capital Markets in 2020\n## BMW GROUP IN FIGURES\n\n### KEY NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n|                      | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | Change in % |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| **GROUP**            |        |        |        |        |        |             |\n| Workforce at year-end | 124,729| 129,932| 134,682| 126,016| 120,726| \u2013 4.2       |\n| Share of women in management positions in the BMW Group | 15.3   | 16.0   | 17.2   | 17.2   | 17.8   | 3.5         |\n| **AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT** |        |        |        |        |        |             |\n| Deliveries           | 2,349,962| 2,465,021| 2,486,149| 2,537,504| 2,325,179| \u2013 8.4       |\n| Share of electrified vehicles in deliveries | 2.6    | 4.2    | 5.7    | 5.8    | 8.3    | 43.1        |\n| CO\u2082 emissions EU New Vehicle Fleet (in g CO\u2082/km) | 124    | 128    | 128    | 127    | 99     | \u201322.0       |\n| CO\u2082 emissions per vehicle produced (in tons) | 0.54   | 0.41   | 0.40   | 0.30   | 0.23   | \u201323.3       |\n| **MOTORCYCLES SEGMENT** |        |        |        |        |        |             |\n| Deliveries           | 145,032| 164,153| 165,566| 175,162| 169,272| \u2013 3.4       |\n\n1 Since the reporting year 2020, a new definition for workforce size has been applied (see Glossary). To enable better comparability, the value for 2019 was adjusted accordingly (2019 before adjustment: 133,778 employees).\n2 For the timeframe including and prior to 2018, the share of the employees that are no longer reflected in reporting is about 7.5-8%.\n3 The new definition of the term \u201cemployee\u201d (see footnote 1) also has an impact on the proportion of women in management positions.

The year unfolded very differently from the way we had anticipated at the end of 2019. Nevertheless, despite the challenging conditions, the BMW Group remained focused on its targets and pressed ahead with its future-oriented projects. Thanks to resolute crisis management and rigorous digital teamwork at all levels, the BMW Group achieved a respectable result for the year, with deliveries to customers in the fourth quarter at their highest level to date. This excellent collective performance gives us confidence as we go into 2021. Sustainable, digitalised mobility, combined with an outstanding overall customer experience, are the key supporting pillars of the BMW Group\u2019s corporate strategy. As a pioneer of new technologies and champion of sustainability in economic, social and ecological terms, the BMW Group will continue on its transformational journey to becoming a tech company, thereby strengthening its position in the premium segment in the process.\n\nFocus of Supervisory Board activities during the past financial year\n\nThe Supervisory Board performed the duties incumbent upon it with the utmost diligence in 2020, rigorously monitoring the management of the BMW Group in a conscientious manner. It also advised the Board of Management on matters relating to the leadership and strategic evolution of the company. In five meetings of the full Supervisory Board \u2013 all lasting significantly longer than usual due to the circumstances and including one two-day meeting \u2013 together with the Board of Management we deliberated in great detail on the operating performance of the BMW Group. The Board of Management also kept the Supervisory Board informed of any matters of significance outside the framework of formal meetings as the need arose. In addition, the Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management engaged in direct dialogue on current issues, as did the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Board of Management member responsible for Finance. Conference calls were also held between the Members of the Board of Management, the Board of Management member responsible for Finance, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Audit Committee as a supplementary measure.\n\nThe Board of Management\u2019s regular reports on the Group\u2019s current performance were dominated by pandemic-related matters during the year under report. In view of the rapid spread of coronavirus in the spring, additional meetings of the Audit\n\nThe SUPERVISORY BOARD is convinced that the BMW Group will continue to expand its position in the premium segment through its enduring commitment to sustainability in economic, social and ecological terms.\nCommittee and the Presiding Board were scheduled to facilitate the monitoring of production, sales and liquidity developments in a prompt manner. The Board of Management kept us constantly informed regarding the impact of the pandemic on the BMW Group\u2019s business performance, providing up-to-date status reports on sales, production, liquidity and the Financial Services segment. Information on vehicle deliveries to customers was separately analysed by market and model, focusing particularly on the electrified variants. The reports also dealt with the competitive situation in general and the development of new business and transaction volume as well as the risk situation in the Financial Services segment. The Board of Management pointed out deviations from the original forecast and presented measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. It also outlined potential developments based on a range of possible scenarios. The size of the workforce and the attainment of the decarbonisation targets set out by the EU Commission were also a subject of discussion.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Management provided us with information on a number of important current topics, including the opening of the Competence Centre for electric drivetrain production in Dingolfing and BMW Brilliance Automotive\u2019s second battery centre in China as well as the new communication concept for the futuristic technology showcase #NEXT Gen 2020, which was held virtually for the first time. The reports also addressed the topics of product quality and the progress of the HERE joint venture.\n\nThe Supervisory Board deliberated in depth on the BMW Group\u2019s evolving corporate strategy, which is now clearly focused on the progressive transformation of its drivetrain technology towards electric mobility. The Board of Management outlined to us the renewed production network strategy, which is based on converting the Munich plant to assemble the new vehicle architecture and the planned cluster architecture at the BMW Group plant in Hungary. As a core component of the BMW Group\u2019s overarching corporate strategy, we also took an in-depth look at the sustainability aspect, which is embedded at every stage along the supply chain, the production process and the entire life cycle of our products.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also deliberated at length on important issues arising within the Board of Management\u2019s various key areas of responsibility. Purchasing, for instance, reported on the status of the supply chain and the purchasing strategy regarding raw materials for electric mobility. The Board of Management member responsible for Finance gave a talk on the Group\u2019s financing system, focusing in particular on liquidity management and financial market risk management. When reporting on the Financial Services segment, the main focus was on strategy as well as business performance and the risk situation. We also analysed the BMW Group\u2019s strategic cooperations in great detail, particularly the further course of the \u201cYour Now\u201d joint venture strategy and the market situation in China.\n\nIn light of the coronavirus pandemic and the accompanying restrictions on events involving large numbers of people, in early April we agreed that the 2020 Annual General Meeting should be held as a virtual event without the physical presence of shareholders.\n\nAn important topic for the Supervisory Board in 2020 was the revision of the Board of Management\u2019s remuneration system for the financial years 2021 and beyond, in line with the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code. After the Personnel Committee had completed the initial groundwork, in the third quarter we intensively discussed proposals for a new remuneration concept with the help of an independent remuneration consultant. On this basis, in December we worked through the details of the revised remuneration system, focusing in particular on setting targets for the variable remuneration components. The Supervisory Board finally passed a resolution approving the new remuneration system, including a standardised service agreement, new target remuneration levels and total remuneration caps.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviewed the structure and level of Board of Management remuneration for the financial year 2020, whilst also taking into account the BMW Group\u2019s business performance in 2020. The salaries of senior executives and employees within Germany as a whole were also taken into account. After analysing comparative studies provided by an external remuneration consultant, we concluded that the remuneration of Board of Management members is appropriate. Detailed information on the remuneration of the Board of Management is provided in the Remuneration Report.\n\nThe change to the system of Board of Management remuneration was also the focus of one-on-one discussions between myself and investor representatives concerning Supervisory-Board-related issues, including the question of the independence of Supervisory Board members.\nIn the third quarter, the Supervisory Board devoted a great deal of time to examining the BMW Group\u2019s revised forecast for the period from 2021 to 2026. The Board of Management outlined the fundamental changes made to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic compared with the forecast presented one year earlier as well as the ambitious long-term targets in the forecast. It also pointed out the higher degree of volatility and uncertainty in terms of external framework conditions, whilst reiterating the aim of achieving continuous overall growth, particularly in the field of electric mobility. After thorough examination, the Supervisory Board approved the BMW Group\u2019s long-term corporate plan.\n\nAt the final meeting held in 2020, the Board of Management presented the annual budget for corporate development in the financial year 2021 and discussed it in exhaustive detail with the Supervisory Board.\n\nWith the advance of digitalisation, data protection and cybersecurity are becoming increasingly important issues. For this reason, we requested a report on the current status from the Board of Management.\n\nWe also discussed the topic of diversity at considerable length. The Board of Management reported on the current status of the diversity concepts developed by the Group and the target achievement at various levels as well as future targets. As its target for the proportion of women on the Board of Management from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2025, the Supervisory Board has stipulated that the Board of Management should continue to include at least one female member.\n\nThe Supervisory Board\u2019s agenda also included a number of internal issues during the year under report. For example, the Supervisory Board updated its rules of procedure and published them online in accordance with the recommendation of the revised German Corporate Governance Code. At the Supervisory Board meeting held in March, we also discussed the results of our annual efficiency self-assessment in detail. The Supervisory Board has also benefited from advances in digitalisation, a key element of our corporate strategy, by setting up a digital boardroom to improve the flow of information. Due to coronavirus-related restrictions, beginning in the spring, the meetings themselves were held as face-to-face events with digital participation offered to enable all members to attend.\nWe also discussed corporate governance standards at the BMW Group. Based on a self-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board at 31 December 2020 was in line with the targets stipulated in the diversity concept, the competency profile and other composition targets. We updated the competency profile and broadened the definition of the various areas of expertise. An overview showing each individual Supervisory Board member\u2019s areas of expertise is provided in the Statement of Corporate Governance on our website.\n\nIn December, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board issued their Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code. We will comply with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 16 December 2019 without exception. The wording of the Declaration of Compliance can be found in the Statement of Corporate Governance on our website.\n\nThe Supervisory Board took part in a variety of further training measures in 2020. In July, for instance, we visited the BMW Autonomous Driving Campus in Unter- schlei\u00dfheim near Munich and discussed the topic of automated driving at great length through several presentations. The presentation held by an external expert on artificial intelligence gave us additional food for thought on the importance of software for the future of the automotive industry, which we then explored in greater depth in a subsequent discussion. In September, the Supervisory Board attended a workshop on drivetrain technology at the BMW and MINI Driving Academy in Maisach near Munich, including a driving session.\n\nNo conflicts of interest arose on the part of members of the Supervisory Board during the year under report. Significant transactions involving Supervisory Board members and/or other related parties as defined by IAS 24, including close relatives and intermediary entities, were subject to review on a quarterly basis.\n\nWe reviewed the efficiency of our work in the Supervisory Board by completing a revised and expanded questionnaire as well as holding supplementary discussions with the Chairman. Overall, there is a high degree of satisfaction with the work of the Supervisory Board. Cooperation, both within the Supervisory Board itself and with the Board of Management, was unanimously assessed as being constructive and trusting. However, we intend to discuss suggestions for improving individual aspects of cooperation in the new financial year.\n\nSustainability is at the heart of the BMW Group\u2019s broader strategy, encompassing all relevant aspects, from the supply chain to production and the product life cycle.\nDescription of Presiding Board activities and committee work\n\nThe Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. The chairpersons of these two bodies reported in detail on the work of their committees at each subsequent Supervisory Board meeting. You can read more about the duties, the composition and the working methods of the Presiding Board and various other Supervisory Board committees in the Statement of Corporate Governance on our website.\n\nDue to the exceptional challenges of the past financial year caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the Presiding Board and the Audit Committee intensified their work in order to fulfil their duties in a suitable manner. Additional meetings were held to provide the Presiding Board with prompt information on the current status of sales and production and the Audit Committee with information on liquidity and the Financial Services business.\n\nThe Presiding Board held six meetings and one conference call during the financial year 2020. Together with the Board of Management and senior heads of department, we prepared the detailed agenda of full Supervisory Board meetings (unless a committee was responsible for doing so) and made suggestions for topics to be reported on at Supervisory Board meetings.\n\nThe Audit Committee held seven meetings and three conference calls during the year under report.\n\nThe meetings held in February and March 2020 focused primarily on preparing the Supervisory Board meeting at which the financial statements for the financial year 2019 were to be discussed and examined. After obtaining the auditor\u2019s Declaration of Independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the full Supervisory Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (\u201cPwC\u201d) be proposed for election as auditor at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. There were no indications of conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussed PwC\u2019s fee proposal for audits of the year-end Company and Group Financial Statements 2020 and the review of the Half-Year Financial Report and deemed it appropriate. Following approval by the Annual General Meeting held in May 2020, the Audit Committee appointed PwC for the relevant engagements and specified audit focus areas. It also approved the scope of non-audit services to be provided by PwC and subsequently received regular reports on the relevant matters. The quality of the audit was a subject of discussion at the Supervisory Board meetings held in February and June. The Board concluded that the audit was of good quality.\n\nThe Board of Management presented us with the Sustainable Value Report as well as the separate combined non-financial report of BMW AG and the BMW Group for the financial year 2019. Moreover, the representatives of PwC presented the findings of their review, which had been performed as a \u201climited assurance\u201d engagement.\n\nAt our meetings we also discussed preparations for the new Integrated Group Report and the procedural changes required with regard to reporting and the external audit. We decided that the non-financial (Group) statement should again be reviewed by PwC in the form of a \u201climited assurance\u201d engagement.\n\nWe also discussed the quarterly statement with the Board of Management prior to their publication. Representatives of the external auditors were present when the Half-Year Financial Report was discussed at the beginning of August 2020.\n\nThe Audit Committee again dealt intensively with the topic of compliance within the BMW Group during the year under report. In his regular report, the Chairman of the Compliance Committee provided a summary of ongoing compliance-related proceedings and presented a raft of measures aimed at promoting the continuous improvement of the compliance system. The Head of Corporate Quality also reported on the subject of technical compliance. The relevant head of department also presented the Supervisory Board a description of tax and customs compliance management.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit Committee regularly discussed the status of the EU Commission\u2019s investigation into the antitrust allegations connected with the former working groups of several German automobile manufacturers and was provided with updates from the Board of Management regarding the potential further course of proceedings.\n\nIn relation to proceedings initiated by the German Federal Cartel Office and terminated in 2019 with a fine of \u20ac28 million regarding the purchase of long steel by the BMW Group, the Supervisory Board addressed the question of whether it had a duty to act on this matter. The Supervisory Board sought counsel from external lawyers in order to obtain legal certainty. On the recommendation of the Audit Committee and after carefully considering the advantages and disadvantages for the BMW Group, based\non an expert legal opinion and oral explanations, the Supervisory Board decided not to assert any claims for damages against current or former members of the Board of Management of BMW AG in connection with the fine imposed by the German Federal Cartel Office on 21 November 2019.\n\nIn addition, the main findings of internal audits conducted by Corporate Audit as well as details of advance audit planning were reported to the Audit Committee. We discussed the effectiveness of the BMW Group\u2019s current risk profile and risk management system on several occasions, including ongoing measures to improve the internal control system on a continuous basis.\n\nThe Audit Committee was regularly provided with detailed information regarding major legal disputes and proceedings. These included, in particular, an investigation initiated in December 2019 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into possible violations of US securities laws in relation to the reporting of vehicle delivery figures in the USA. The case was concluded in September 2020 with a settlement of 18 million US dollars.\n\nOur agenda also included considering an audit report relating to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). In this context, the independent auditor confirmed the effectiveness of the system currently applied by BMW AG to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Audit Committee concurred with the decision of the Board of Management to raise the Company\u2019s share capital in accordance with Article 4 (5) of the Articles of Incorporation (Authorised Capital 2019) by \u20ac822,000 and issue a corresponding number of new non-voting bearer shares of preferred stock in conjunction with the Employee Share Programme.\n\nThe SUPERVISORY BOARD and the BOARD OF MANAGEMENT will comply with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code without exception.\nThe Personnel Committee focused primarily on the topic of Board of Management remuneration. In its five meetings during the year under report, the Personnel Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the Board of Management\u2019s remuneration for the financial year 2019, duly taking the impact of the coronavirus pandemic into account. During the second half of the year, the Committee focused on revising the remuneration system for Board of Management members. The Personnel Committee also performed the groundwork for the full Supervisory Board to appoint a Board of Management member responsible for Development and granted approval for members of the Board of Management to assume mandates outside the Group in exceptional cases.\n\nThe Nomination Committee convened twice during the financial year 2020. Taking into account the German Corporate Governance Code (DGCC) and the composition requirements adopted by the Supervisory Board, the Nomination Committee addressed the issue of potential replacements for shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board in the coming years.\n\nThe Mediation Committee, which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the financial year 2020.\n\nComposition of the Board of Management\n\nWith effect from 1 July 2020, Klaus Fr\u00f6hlich retired from his position as Board of Management member responsible for Development. We would like to thank Mr Fr\u00f6hlich for his many years of successful and effective work for BMW AG and particularly wish to express our appreciation for the momentum he generated over a 30-year period in advancing the BMW Group\u2019s role as a pioneer of new technologies.\n\nThe Supervisory Board appointed Frank Weber to the Board of Management as his successor with effect from 1 July 2020. Mr Weber joined the BMW Group in 2011 as Head of Total Vehicle Development and was most recently responsible for the Rolls-Royce product line as well as the BMW luxury class. In light of the various management positions he has previously held in development, Mr Weber is excellently qualified to assume responsibility for Development at the BMW Group and we certainly wish him all the best in his new role.\n\nThe Supervisory Board extended the mandate of one Board of Management member during the year under report.\n\nComposition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory Board\u2019s committees\n\nProf. Renate K\u00f6cher left the Supervisory Board with effect from the end of the Annual General Meeting 2020. We would like to thank Prof. K\u00f6cher for her many years of constructive work and faithful cooperation while serving on the Supervisory Board. The Annual General Meeting elected Anke Sch\u00e4ferkordt as a new member of the Supervisory Board. Ms Sch\u00e4ferkordt has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the field of communication and media, and, in her capacity as an independent financial expert, ideally complements the Supervisory Board\u2019s overall composition. The Annual General Meeting re-elected me as a member of the Supervisory Board and I was again elected Chairman at the subsequent meeting of the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn view of the considerable length of time he has been a member of the Supervisory Board and mindful of the Supervisory Board\u2019s efforts to appoint an independent chairperson to the Audit Committee as defined in the German Corporate Governance Code, Dr Karl-Ludwig Kley resigned his membership and chairmanship of the Audit Committee with effect from the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. We wish to thank Dr Kley for his many years of knowledgeable and committed leadership of the Audit Committee and are delighted that he will continue to contribute his expertise as a member of the Supervisory Board. Dr Kurt Bock was subsequently elected as member and Chairman of the Audit Committee. Dr Bock has been a member of the Supervisory Board since 2018 and, as a former long-serving Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE, has a great deal of expertise in the fields of accounting, financial reporting and auditing. An overview of the composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees is provided both in this report and in the separate Statement on Corporate Governance, which is available on our website together with the curricula vitae of Supervisory Board members.\nDisclosure of attendance at meetings by individual members\n\nThe attendance rate at the meetings of the Supervisory Board, its committees and the Presiding Board was over 99%.

PwC conducted a review of the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Management Report for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020 and presented its findings to the Audit Committee. No issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions in all material respects.\n\nPwC, for the second time, audited the Company and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2020 as well as the Combined Management Report, including the Statement on Corporate Governance for the financial year 2020 \u2013 in each case authorised for issue by the Board of Management on 9 March 2021 \u2013 and issued an unqualified audit opinion, signed for the second year in succession by the auditor Petra Justenhoven as independent auditor (Wirtschaftspr\u00fcferin) and by Andreas Fell as independent auditor (Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer) and auditor responsible for the performance of the engagement.\n\nAt its meeting held on 26 February 2021, the Audit Committee initially considered in detail the preliminary version of the Company and Group Financial Statements, the Combined Management Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement), the Statement of Corporate Governance, the draft versions of the auditor\u2019s reports and the Board of Management\u2019s proposal for the appropriation of profit.\n\nImmediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the Company and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2020 and the Combined Management Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement), the Statement of Corporate Governance and the proposal for the appropriation of profit to the Supervisory Board. The auditor\u2019s long-form audit reports were also made available to the Supervisory Board in a prompt manner.\n\nAt its meeting on 10 March 2021, the Audit Committee diligently examined and deliberated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of the Supervisory Board on 11 March 2021.\nAt the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board with detailed explanations of the financial reports presented. The representatives of the external auditor present at the meetings reported on the main findings of their audit and answered additional questions put by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. The focus of these meetings was on key audit matters as well as the related audit procedures, which were discussed at length by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe representatives of the external auditor confirmed that the risk management system established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying at an early stage any developments that might threaten the Company\u2019s going concern status. They also confirmed that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system were identified with regard to the financial reporting process. Similarly, in the course of their audit work they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the contents of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) issued by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nBased on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the conclusion reached by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board after the examination, no objections were raised. The Group and Company Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the financial year 2020 drawn by the Board of Management were subsequently approved at our meeting held on 11 March 2021. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 have therefore been adopted.\n\nWe also examined the proposal of the Board of Management to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of \u20ac1.90 per share of common stock and \u20ac1.92 per share of non-voting preferred stock, in each case on shares entitled to receive a dividend. We considered the proposal appropriate and therefore gave it our approval.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also considered at length the combined Non-financial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2020, which was drawn up by the Board of Management for the first time as part of the Integrated Group Report. The Board of Management provided an in-depth explanation of the statement during the relevant meetings. Representatives of the external auditor presented key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the members of the Supervisory Board. The \u201climited assurance\u201d audit performed by PwC received an unqualified opinion, which was duly signed by Andreas Fell as independent auditor (Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer) and by Nicolette Behncke as independent auditor (Wirtschaftspr\u00fcferin). The Supervisory Board acknowledged and approved the combined Non-financial (Group) Statement drawn up by the Board of Management.\n\nExpression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board\n\nWe would like to express our special thanks to the members of the Board of Management and the entire workforce of the BMW Group worldwide for their remarkable achievements in the financial year 2020. Their outstanding degree of motivation, adaptability and strong team spirit made this result possible, despite the extremely difficult conditions.\n\nWe are confident that the Board of Management and the employees of the BMW Group, with their courage and willingness to adapt, will ensure your company a leading position in the field of sustainable and digitalised mobility going forward.\n\nMunich, March 2021\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\nNORBERT REITHOFER\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\nSTATEMENT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nThis year we are launching our TECHNOLOGY OFFENSIVE with the NEW ALL-ELECTRIC BMW models iX and i4.\n\nOliver Zipse\nChairman of the Board of Management\nDEAR SHAREHOLDERS,\n\nClimate change demands responses. Rethinking our mobility as a task for society as a whole is one way of responding \u2013 with considerable impact and an important signalling effect. The BMW Group is a global, digitalised high-tech company for premium mobility. With this idea of ourselves, we are driving and shaping the transformation of our industry. To do so, we are relying on technological innovation in all relevant fields \u2013 sustainable drivetrains, autonomous driving and intelligent integration of hardware and software, as well as for the digitalised automotive production of the future, up to and including blockchain technology and artificial intelligence.\n\nSuch profound upheavals like the sustainable mobility that we are combining step by step with the principles of a circular economy require cooperation on a much larger scale. The BMW Group is involved as a partner and visionary through cross-industry technology alliances and platforms. We firmly believe that technological innovation, in combination with responsible action, contributes to progress for companies and the economy, as well as benefiting the environment. We all share the same goal of a climate-neutral society.\n\nFirst integrated BMW Group Report.\n\nWe are documenting our impact on the road to climate neutrality. With the transition to integrated reporting, we are documenting how we are managing the BMW Group systematically and in an integrated manner according to financial and sustainability targets. For you, dear shareholders, as well as for other stakeholders in this company, we want to verifiably show our progress. With this move, we are not just leading the way among our key competitors. The BMW Group has followed a broad stakeholder approach for years. We aim to set an example and are therefore comprehensively and systematically reducing our environmental footprint. Our aim is to achieve full transparency. We will naturally only be releasing the new Report online.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS through TECHNOLOGY \u2013 that is what the BMW Group stands for.\nRobust and flexible, adaptable and innovative \u2013 your company during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the globe struck while the BMW Group was in the midst of its multidimensional transformation. In hindsight, one thing is clear: in a difficult environment with unforeseeable developments, your company proved just how robust, flexible, adaptable and innovative it is. Our greatest strength was taking a realistic view of things, relying more than ever before on the flexibility of our people. Thanks to this, we were able to meet our adjusted targets, which we announced early in the pandemic. At the same time, the Board of Management made far-reaching decisions and significantly stepped up the pace of transformation at the BMW Group.\n\nGlobal market share increased during the pandemic.\n\nOur vehicles have given many people a sense of security during the pandemic. In fact, cars were more popular than ever. Our customers bought over 2.3 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles \u2013 a decrease of only 8.4 percent from our record-breaking 2019. Nonetheless, the BMW Group was able to increase its global market share in 2020. Additionally, BMW Motorrad posted the second-best sales figures in its history and BMW M GmbH had its most successful year ever.\n\nEU CO\u2082 limits for 2020 significantly overfulfilled.\n\nDespite the coronavirus pandemic, we delivered about a third more electrified BMW and MINI vehicles to customers than the previous year. Our plug-in hybrids were highly sought-after, as were our new fully electric models, the BMW iX3* and MINI Cooper SE*. Because we started our preparations early, we were able to significantly overfulfil our assigned CO\u2082 limit by about 5 g/km. This was never in any doubt for us. Our EU fleet emissions are currently at 99 g/km and we will also meet the 2021 requirements.\n\nAccepting things as they are and making the best of them.\n\nDuring lockdown, we had to shut down production across our global network for the first time in BMW history. Shortly afterwards, we ramped up again \u2013 in a phased, yet extremely timely manner. This enabled us to respond to different rates of development in the markets quite precisely.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nOur associates implemented the new requirements with commitment and discipline \u2013 and continue to do so. Every single vehicle launch went ahead as planned. Our supply chain stayed up and running at all times and mastered the stress test of the coronavirus year. We kept in touch with our customers \u2013 personally and digitally. Thanks to our new Mobile Sales Office, we are also offering contactless consultation and sales in more than 60 markets.\n\nThank you to all our customers; praise for our 120,726 associates.\n\nPersonally, and on behalf of the Board of Management team, I would like to thank all our customers for placing their trust in us. I would also explicitly like to thank our retail organisation and suppliers and extend an especially warm thank you to all our associates. 2020 was an extremely challenging year, full of emotion, hope and setbacks, but the BMW team spirit prevailed. The Company and employee representatives found solutions together \u2013 just as Herbert Quandt would have wanted.\n\nPhase I of our transformation \u2013 the e-mobility pioneer.\n\nAt major tipping points, BMW has often ushered in change with bold decisions. During the global economic and financial crisis of 2008/2009, your company paved the way for electric mobility. The ultra-sustainable BMW i3* was ahead of its time \u2013 and is still performing well in the marketplace to this day.\n\nPhase II of our transformation \u2013 strategic focus on electrification, digitalisation and developing expertise.\n\nWe are currently leveraging the full potential of global differences in demand with our wide range of products and drivetrains. The popular BMW X3 will be joined by the high-volume BMW 5 Series, X1 and 7 Series models, each with a choice of four drivetrain technologies. Our plants are capable of building different drivetrains on the same production line. By the end of 2022, each of our German vehicle plants will be producing at least one fully electric vehicle. This is what flexibility looks like at BMW! We are enabling our team by developing expertise and reallocating competences. We plan to take everyone along with us. This year alone, we will be training 75,000 participants in future areas of activity and new fields of expertise like robotics, data analytics, agile software development, AI, autonomous driving and, of course, e-mobility.\n\nElectrifying the BMW Group.\n\nWe are also stepping up electric mobility to keep pace with growing demand. Our roadmap is ambitious: Your company aims to have delivered more than a million vehicles with battery-electric or plug-in hybrid drive trains to customers by the end of this year. We will have 25 electrified models on the roads by 2023 \u2013 targeting our large high-volume models, in particular. By 2025, electrified vehicles will comprise at least a quarter of our sales volume. We also see potential in fuel cells and are supporting the creation of hydrogen infrastructure in Germany. A small series of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT is planned from 2022.\n\nBMW iX and i4 will revolutionise the market in 2021.\n\nMany customers are eagerly awaiting the new fully electric BMW iX* and i4 models. Both vehicles have a strong emotional appeal straight from the heart of the BMW brand. In the iX we have perfectly integrated hardware and software in the form of shy tech. Just as our customers would expect from us: in a simple, intuitive and precise manner. We want to excite people with innovations and at the same time inspire them. The new BMW iDrive transforms the iX*, just like every future BMW model, into a digital powerhouse.\n\nPhase III of our transformation \u2013 what will define a BMW in the year 2030?\n\nWe aim to deliver at least seven million electrified vehicles to customers by 2030. To coincide with the next surge in e-mobility, we will be launching our new cluster architecture, which is uncompromisingly centred on fully electric drivetrains, in the middle of the decade, starting at our new plant in Hungary. We believe the next dimension of digital connectivity is closely tied to this: in the vehicle, in production and throughout our company processes.\n\nSustainability is the common thread.\n\nAchieving consistent, sustainable development will also give us a competitive edge. In 2012, we set ourselves ten sustainability goals up to 2020. Today, we are able to say: mission accomplished. Let me give you three examples:\n\n1. We halved the CO\u2082 emissions of our European new vehicle fleet between 1995 and 2020.\n\n2. Our plants worldwide exclusively source green electricity. As of 2021, they will even produce completely CO\u2082-neutral on balance.\n\n3. The percentage of women in management functions at the BMW Group is above our target range.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nWe don\u2019t just do sustainability at BMW: We are making BMW sustainable.\n\nWe now find ourselves on the next stage of the journey \u2013 pursuing a verifiable and consistent path towards climate neutrality by 2050. In July 2020, we adopted our integrated sustainability strategy, with concrete science-based targets for the first stage up to 2030. How are we different from other companies? The answer to that is simple: we are substantially reducing our carbon footprint along the entire value chain. The aim is for life cycle CO\u2082 emissions per vehicle to be lowered by at least a third. This will be achieved through innovation, not offsets. In this way, we can drastically reduce the carbon footprint compared to 2019 per vehicle by 2030:\n\n\u2014 In production by 80 percent.\n\u2014 During the use phase by more than 40 percent.\n\u2014 In the supply chain by at least 20 percent.\n\nWithout countermeasures, growth in e-mobility would, in fact, increase supply chain CO\u2082 emissions by a third. Instead, we are reversing this trend and lowering emissions. Our aim is to create the most sustainable supply chain in our industry. We have already agreed with our suppliers that they will only use green power to produce battery cells. This measure alone adds up to about ten million tonnes less CO\u2082 over the next ten years.\n\nClimate-neutral business model spanning the entire value chain by 2050.\n\nWe are already looking ahead into the future and intend to close the material cycle further \u2013 for instance, by increasing the percentage of secondary material in our vehicles. This lowers CO\u2082 emissions significantly compared to using primary material. We will be sharing how we plan to drive towards a circular economy at the IAA MOBILITY 2021.\n\nOur clear claim is that the GREENEST ELECTRIC VEHICLE comes FROM BMW. We are reducing CO\u2082 emissions per vehicle over the entire value chain. This is what sets the BMW Group apart.\nDear Shareholders,\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has shown very clearly how important cars are to people. Demand should continue to increase overall. We aim to get sales back towards their pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. We always take a long-term perspective. All our decisions are geared towards adding value, profitability and growth in close combination with sustainability, climate protection and secure jobs. On this basis, your company will remain a safe and attractive investment, focused on added value creation.\n\nOur entrepreneurial independence is a valuable commodity for us. From this position, we can create a new mobility for our customers. We will be investing more than \u20ac30 billion in research and development \u2013 and the future of your company \u2013 by 2025. That alone shows how fully confident we are.\n\nJoin us in embarking on this promising decade!\n\nYours\n\nOLIVER ZIPSE\nChairman of the Board of Management\nDIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS\n\nSTAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\n\nThe BMW Group is an enterprise that operates on a global scale within a complex environment subject to crucial interdependencies. Business activities have an external impact and can affect the interests of many individual stakeholders as well as various categories of stakeholders. Conversely, developments occurring across society as a whole can influence the Group\u2019s business activities, both directly and indirectly. Against this backdrop, the BMW Group maintains a regular dialogue with its stakeholders in all key markets on a variety of topics. The aim at all times is to achieve a better understanding of the positions of stakeholders and in turn provide them with greater insight into the BMW Group\u2019s activities. In pursuing this aim, the BMW Group does not shy away from critical topics and debates, but endeavours to find solutions via a constructive dialogue with stakeholders in the best interests of all concerned.\n\nIn its interaction with stakeholders, the BMW Group uses its own dialogue formats as well as participating constructively in public debates. For example, the Group has been represented at UN climate conferences for many years.\n\nThe basis for the BMW Group\u2019s engagement with stakeholders is set out in its Stakeholder Engagement Policy. The document defines dialogue objectives, sets out the criteria for identifying and prioritising stakeholders, and specifies suitable dialogue formats as well as forms of communication.\n\nBMW GROUP DIALOGUES\n\nBMW Group Dialogues are among the main formats for interacting with stakeholders and have been held regularly since 2011. Above all, they provide an opportunity to sound out current and impending corporate strategic decisions compared with stakeholder expectations. Major topics covered in recent years have included electric mobility, the Group\u2019s energy strategy, corporate citizenship, urban mobility, and environmental and social standards in the supply chain.\n\nGenerally, BMW Group Dialogues are held annually in the BMW Group\u2019s key sales regions of North America, Europe and Asia. Stakeholder feedback is documented and incorporated in the Group\u2019s strategic considerations alongside other key factors.\n\nPARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND WORK IN ASSOCIATIONS\n\nThe BMW Group maintains an active, open and transparent dialogue with policy makers, union representatives, associations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The aim is to play a constructive and transparent role in helping shape the general political framework regarding the company\u2019s business activities. In this context, the BMW Group offers its expertise to promote fair competition for all those involved and find viable solutions.\n\nThe BMW Group has political offices in a number of major cities, including Berlin, Brussels, Washington DC and Beijing, giving it a worldwide presence for expressing its opinions on environmental, financial and social policy issues. The BMW Group always adopts a clear position, which it communicates in a transparent manner to external parties, regardless of the target audience it is addressing.\n\nApart from its own activities in terms of public policy development, the BMW Group is also a member of numerous associations in various countries. Membership is voluntary in the majority of cases, although there are some situations in which it is necessary to join associations in order to comply with legal requirements.\n\nThe BMW Group puts forward its own standpoints with a view to helping shape association policies. However, this does not mean that the Group\u2019s opinions always fully coincide with those of the associations. If there are any major differences, the Group considers the best options available for best dealing with the situation.\nAt the beginning of 2021, the BMW Group assumed the presidency of the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA). The Association collaborates with a wide range of institutional, non-governmental research and civil society organisations as well as with a number of industry associations. The year 2021 is seen as a crucial point for the automotive industry within the European Union in terms of transitioning to sustainable mobility. The current focus of the ACEA agenda is therefore on topics such as climate protection, emissions, connected and automated driving, sustainability, research and innovation, economy and safety.\n\nIn the interest of transparency, the BMW Group always discloses the most important association memberships on its website BMW Group Memberships. Furthermore, all topics that are discussed at EU level are publicly available in the EU Transparency Register.\n\nFINANCIAL MARKET PRESENCE WITH SUSTAINABILITY CREDENTIALS\n\nRegular in-depth dialogue with capital market participants has always been a high priority for the BMW Group. Within a short space of time, sustainability has become a key driver for the financial market. Investors and analysts are increasingly considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects in their investment recommendations and decision-making processes.\n\nFor many years now, its top rankings in prestigious capital market sustainability indexes have borne out the BMW Group\u2019s leading role among automobile manufacturers. In 2020, for instance, the BMW Group was ranked first in the automotive category of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices World and Europe. The Group also attaches particular importance to remaining in direct contact with investors and analysts. These dialogues are currently focused on the BMW Group\u2019s sustainability strategy, the related progress updates and the ambitious targets the Group has set itself to reduce carbon emissions across the entire value chain. These topics are discussed in face-to-face meetings and conversations as well as at (sometimes virtual) roadshows and conferences held at key international financial centres.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the Paris Climate Agreement, policymakers in Europe are also increasingly adopting a holistic approach to dealing with climate protection and sustainability issues. For example, the EU Action Plan for Sustainable Finance aims to redirect capital flows towards sustainable economic activities. Financial risks arising from factors such as climate change, resource scarcity and environmental degradation are set to be given greater prominence, and new approaches are being developed to manage these risks. There are also calls to promote greater transparency and long-termism regarding financial and economic activity.\n\nIn June 2020, as a key aspect of the EU Action Plan, the EU Parliament adopted a regulation to introduce a uniform classification system (taxonomy) for environmentally sustainable economic activities within the EU, with a view to achieving a sustainable allocation of capital. The Taxonomy Regulation also extends the relevant reporting requirements to companies covered by the EU CSR Directive. From the 2021 reporting year onwards, companies affected are required to disclose information on revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenses relating to economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable, based on the stipulated taxonomy.\n\nThe BMW Group attaches great importance to the EU Taxonomy Directive and is currently preparing for the new requirements in a Group-wide project.\n\nSustainability is also an important factor for the BMW Group when it comes to investing pension fund assets. At the end of 2019, the Group took a pivotal decision to apply sustainability criteria to investments held by its German pension fund. The current focus is on measuring the carbon footprint of significant parts of these assets on the one hand and the risks attached to their future performance on the other.\n\nConcurrently, numerous benchmarks for investing in liquid assets have been replaced by ESG-optimised indices. Regarding the non-liquid portion of pension assets, a fixed amount has been reserved for upcoming investments that are intended to have a measurable, positive impact on the environment or society in general that are not based on yield considerations alone (impact investments). In addition to climate protection, the investments made to date are largely based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the UN such as health, well-being, affordable clean energy, and sustainable consumption and production.\nKEY TOPICS IN 2020\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s interaction with stakeholders includes topics brought to its attention by stakeholders as well as those in which it proactively engages in dialogue.\n\nKey issues raised by BMW Group stakeholders in 2020 included:\n\n\u2014 Climate protection, particularly carbon emissions\n\u2014 Human rights in the supply chain, particularly regarding the procurement of raw materials for electric mobility applications\n\u2014 Illegal deforestation\n\u2014 Lobbying in associations\n\u2014 Sustainable finance\n\nKey topics raised by the BMW Group with stakeholders included:\n\n\u2014 The Group\u2019s new corporate strategy objectives\n\u2014 Environmental and social standards in the supply chain\n\u2014 Carbon emissions in the supply chain\n\u2014 Support for electric mobility and the comprehensive expansion of charging infrastructure\n\u2014 Political control over emissions limits without discriminating against individual drivetrain technologies and vehicle concepts\n\u2014 Continued development of the regulatory framework for automated driving and digital networks\n\u2014 Support for new efficiency-enhancing technologies\n\u2014 Realistic relationship between emissions targets and emission measurement methods\n\u2014 Consistency between supply-side and demand-side decarbonisation policies\n\u2014 Ensuring a sufficient supply of critical raw materials\n\u2014 Trade policy and free trade agreements\nTHE NEXT STEPS:\n\nThe BMW Group intends to continue interacting with its stakeholders throughout 2021. Apart from considering ways to develop and expand its own existing formats, it will also continue to participate constructively in public formats during the coming year.\n\nFurther plans include broadening the scope of internal dialogues with employees from 2021 onwards, building on the success of this format at the BMW Group Dialogues in 2020. The aim is to make employees aware of the expectations of external stakeholders on the one hand, while at the same time enabling employees to participate in ongoing discussions and developments on the other.\n\nThe BMW Group will also continue to engage in constructive dialogue with investors and analysts focused on Socially Responsible Investments (SRI). In addition to the daily discussions held on this subject, the BMW Group\u2019s participation in SRI roadshows and conferences in global financial centres is again scheduled for 2021.\n\nThe extent to which the coronavirus situation will continue to impact direct interaction with stakeholders in 2021 remains to be seen. However, the BMW Group has fared well with its digital formats so far and has developed a range of options for maintaining dialogue with stakeholders via alternative concepts and formats.\nBMW STOCK AND CAPITAL MARKETS IN 2020\n\nRATINGS REMAIN AT HIGH LEVEL\n\nThe BMW Group continues to be the best-rated automobile manufacturer in Europe.\n\nThe severe impact of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and the accompanying repercussions for the global economy resulted in a reassessment of ratings in some industries, including the automotive sector. For some time now, the rating agencies have highlighted the major challenges currently facing the entire automotive industry in general. In light of developments in 2020, the agencies took the opportunity to reassess the credit ratings of their entire portfolio of automobile manufacturers. The more rigorous assessment resulted in a significant number of negative outlooks and downgrades being announced in the course of recent months.\n\nIn this context, Moody\u2019s lowered its long-term rating for BMW AG from A1 to A2 in March 2020 and at the same time set the outlook to \u201cunder review for further downgrade\u201d, before changing it to negative two months later in May. Also in March, the rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) lowered its credit rating from A+ to A, while leaving the outlook at negative.\n\nBoth agencies cite the negative trend in profitability and free cash flow as the reason for the downgrade by one rating level. Furthermore, the transformation of the automotive industry and a deterioration of the market environment in general are seen as major challenges.\n\nThe negative outlook for the long-term ratings reflects the general uncertainty regarding future developments and the potentially adverse impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In light of the prevailing circumstances, the agencies see a potentially negative impact on automobile sales, profitability and free cash flow across the automotive sector.\n\nAt the same time, however, the short-term ratings for BMW AG were confirmed by both Moody\u2019s (P-1) and S&P (A-1) and therefore remain at a high level.\n\nThe BMW Group is already benefiting from its rigorous working capital and capital expenditure management. The Automotive segment\u2019s free cash flow, for instance, exceeded market expectations not only in the fourth quarter 2020, but also for the financial year as a whole, with the EBIT margin again nearing the strategic target range of between 8 and 10%.\n\nWith its above-average ratings overall, the BMW Group continues to enjoy good access to international capital markets and is also benefiting from highly attractive refinancing conditions.\n\n| Company rating | Moody\u2019s | Standard & Poor\u2019s |\n|----------------|---------|------------------|\n| Non-current financial liabilities | A2 | A |\n| Current financial liabilities | P-1 | A-1 |\n| Outlook | negative | negative |\n\nTOP RANKINGS IN SUSTAINABILITY RATINGS\n\nThe BMW Group again achieved top rankings in prestigious sustainability ratings in 2020, underlining its strong position in this area. In 2020, for instance, the BMW Group was named sector leader in the Automobiles category of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices World and Europe. It is also in the top grouping (Climate A List) of the CDP ratings list (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) for the transparency of its carbon emissions reporting. Furthermore, the Group was again listed in the British FTSE4Good Index in 2020, is also listed by MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS-Oekom and holds a leading position in its sector in each case.\nDIVIDEND BELOW PREVIOUS YEAR\u2019S LEVEL \u2013 PAYOUT RATIO REMAINS STABLE\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting that the unappropriated profit of BMW AG amounting to \u20ac1,253 million (2019: \u20ac1,646 million) be used to pay a dividend of \u20ac1.90 per share of common stock (2019: \u20ac2.50) and a dividend of \u20ac1.92 for each share of preferred stock (2019: \u20ac2.52). The payout ratio for 2020 therefore stands at 32.5% (2019: 32.8%).\n\nBMW AG STOCK\n\n| COMMON STOCK | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 |\n|--------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of shares in 1,000 | 601,995 | 601,995 | 601,995 | 601,995 | 601,995 |\n| Stock exchange price in \u20ac\u00b9 | | | | | |\n| Year-end closing price | 72.23 | 73.14 | 70.70 | 86.83 | 88.75 |\n| High | 76.68 | 77.75 | 96.26 | 90.83 | 92.25 |\n| Low | 37.66 | 58.70 | 69.86 | 77.71 | 65.10 |\n\n| PREFERRED STOCK | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 |\n|-----------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of shares in 1,000 | 57,689 | 56,867 | 56,127 | 55,605 | 55,114 |\n| Stock exchange price in \u20ac\u00b9 | | | | | |\n| Year-end closing price | 55.20 | 55.05 | 62.10 | 74.64 | 72.70 |\n| High | 57.60 | 67.85 | 85.50 | 78.89 | 74.15 |\n| Low | 32.50 | 47.54 | 60.70 | 67.29 | 56.53 |\n\n| KEY DATA PER SHARE IN \u20ac | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Dividend | | | | | |\n| Common stock | 1.90\u00b2 | 2.50 | 3.50 | 4.00 | 3.50 |\n| Preferred stock | 1.92\u00b2 | 2.50 | 3.52 | 4.02 | 3.52 |\n| Earnings per share of common stock\u00b3 | 5.73 | 7.47 | 10.60\u00b3 | 13.07 | 10.45 |\n| Earnings per share of preferred stock\u00b3 | 5.75 | 7.49 | 10.62\u00b3 | 13.09 | 10.47 |\n| Free cash flow Automotive segment | 5.15 | 3.90 | 4.12 | 6.78 | 17.45 |\n| Equity | 93.26 | 90.92 | 88.26\u00b3 | 82.95 | 72.08 |\n\n\u00b9 Xetra closing prices.\n\u00b2 Proposed by management.\n\u00b3 Weighted average number of shares for the year.\n\u2074 Stock weighted according to dividend entitlements.\n\u2075 The 2018 figures were adjusted due to the change in accounting policy in conjunction with the adoption of IFRS 16 (see Annual Report 2019, Note 6 to the Group Financial Statements).\n# COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT\n\n| Page | Section |\n|------|---------|\n| 36   | General Information and Group Profile |\n| 36   | Core Values and Guiding Principles |\n| 37   | Organisation and Business Model |\n| 41   | Strategy, Goals and Management System |\n| 56   | How the BMW Group creates value |\n| 58   | Compliance and Human Rights |\n| 62   | Innovation and Customer Orientation |\n| 69   | Products and Services |\n| 73   | Design and Product Safety |\n| 76   | Carbon Emissions and Pollutants |\n| 80   | Electric Mobility |\n| 84   | Mobility Patterns |\n| 87   | Production, Purchasing and Supplier Network |\n| 91   | Production Network |\n| 95   | Resource Consumption and Resource Efficiency |\n| 99   | Renewable Energy |\n| 100  | Purchasing and Supplier Network |\n| 105  | Employees and Society |\n| 109  | Long-term Employee Development and Employer Attractiveness |\n| 113  | Health and Performance |\n| 116  | Employee Diversity |\n| 119  | Corporate Citizenship |\n| 122  | Report on Economic Position |\n| 122  | General and Sector-specific Environment |\n| 126  | Overall Assessment by Management of the Financial Year |\n| 127  | Comparison of Forecasts with Actual Outcomes |\n| 142  | Review of Operations |\n| 142  | Automotive Segment |\n| 148  | Motorcycles Segment |\n| 150  | Financial Services Segment |\n| 153  | Other Entities Segment/Eliminations |\n| 154  | Comments on Financial Statements of BMW AG |\n| 159  | Report on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities |\n| 159  | Outlook |\n| 164  | Risks and Opportunities |\n| 179  | Internal Control System Relevant for Accounting and Financial Reporting Processes |\n| 180  | Disclosures Relevant for Takeovers and Explanatory Comments |\nGENERAL INFORMATION AND GROUP PROFILE\n\nCORE VALUES AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES\n\nLONG-TERM THINKING FORMS THE BASIS FOR OUR ECONOMIC SUCCESS.\n\nLong-term thinking and responsible action are an integral part of the BMW Group\u2019s corporate identity and continue to form the basis for our economic success. We strive constantly to meet the high expectations our customers have in our products. Our business model is intrinsically linked with the principle of sustainability and we see the two factors as an integral unit. We aspire to be not only the most successful, but also the most sustainable premium provider of individual mobility and always focus on the needs of our customers.\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s stance is unwavering: ecological and social sustainability, responsibility for our products and a clear commitment to conserving resources are at the heart of our corporate strategy. We think and manage our corporate affairs in a holistic manner. For instance, we do not limit our understanding of environmental sustainability to the emissions generated by our vehicles, but rather take the entire value chain into account \u2013 whether along the supply chain, in our production processes, during the use phase or at the end-of-life recycling stage. We have firmly embedded the principle of sustainability in every aspect of our business. Our primary aim is to balance the interests of economy, ecology and society and thereby contribute to ecological and societal improvement.\n\nGlobal challenges such as growing urbanisation and the finite nature of natural resources have inspired and motivated us to develop a range of innovative products and services. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and we are fully committed to the Paris Climate Agreement in order to mitigate its effects. As the BMW Group, we are making our contribution by focusing on developing and improving technologies and services that can effectively help bring about a viable reduction in the global carbon emissions caused by individual mobility. With this strategy we can create a clear competitive advantage by offering our customers emotional, trendsetting mobility solutions that are also made with sustainable principles in mind.\n\nOUR ACTIONS AS A COMPANY HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY.\n\nWe are a company operating on a global scale. As such, we acknowledge our responsibility to contribute to economic prosperity in the countries where we are located. For this reason, we not only aspire to achieve sustained profitable growth for the Group, but also to make a specific contribution towards economic development and improvement in the quality of life at the locations where we operate.\n\nThe growth of the BMW Group not only provides a reasonable return for investors, but also attractive salaries for its employees. We also make a positive contribution to society in general at the locations where we operate, firstly by paying the amounts due to public authorities (such as customs duties and taxes) and secondly in the form of social, cultural and corporate citizenship activities. Corporate Citizenship.\nTHE TRANSFORMATION OF MOBILITY AND THE ADVANCE OF DIGITALISATION ARE OPPORTUNITIES.\n\nMobility patterns worldwide, and hence the entire automotive industry, are currently undergoing profound change. We see this transformation as an opportunity to set new industry standards and innovate in the fields of electrification, connectivity and automated driving.\n\nDigitalisation provides us with an excellent opportunity to take a fundamentally new approach to developing products for the benefit of our customers. We not only react to customer wishes, but also anticipate them through a good understanding of their preferences. Moreover, digitalisation enables us to redesign processes throughout the entire organisation.\n\nWE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN OUR OWN INDEPENDENT WAY.\n\nAs societal values as well as demographic and technological conditions change, new demands on mobility solutions are constantly emerging. The ambition to fulfil those wishes and needs is the force that drives us forward. We are taking steps to ensure a viable future for our business by developing innovatively, sustainably and independently.\n\nORGANISATION AND BUSINESS MODEL\n\nGeneral information on the BMW Group is provided below. There have been no significant changes in the Group\u2019s structure compared to the previous year. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG), based in Munich, Germany, is the parent company of the BMW Group.\n\nThe starting point for the BMW Group\u2019s corporate strategy is to act in a consistent manner on a customer-oriented and sustainable basis. Products, brands and services are currently being developed with a clear focus on innovative technologies such as low-emissions drivetrains, digitalisation, connectivity and autonomous driving.\n\nThe BMW Group is one of the most successful manufacturers of automobiles and motorcycles in the premium segment worldwide. With BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, the BMW Group owns three of the best-known premium brands in the automotive industry. It also holds a strong market position in the premium segment of the motorcycle business. The Group sets itself clear goals in terms of sustainable, individual mobility, resource-efficient value creation, the continued development of its workforce potential and its contribution to society. Sustainability is an integral part of the Group\u2019s business model and plays a vital role in ensuring its viability going forward.\n\nOperating on a global scale, the BMW Group employed a workforce of 120,726 people at the end of the year under report. In 2020, the BMW Group consolidated its position as one of the world\u2019s most attractive employers. Its leading role in terms of sustainability also contributes to employee loyalty within the BMW Group.\n\nThe BMW Group comprises BMW AG itself and all subsidiaries over which BMW AG has either direct or indirect control. BMW AG is also responsible for managing the Group, which is sub-divided into the Automotive, Motorcycles and Financial Services operating segments. The Other Entities segment primarily comprises holding companies and Group financing companies.\nBMW GROUP LOCATIONS IN EUROPE\n\n- Norway\n- Germany\n- The Netherlands\n- UK\n- Ireland\n- Belgium/Luxembourg\n- France\n- Switzerland\n- Italy\n- Slovenia*\n- Spain\n- Portugal*\n- Greece\n- Sweden\n- Finland*\n- Denmark\n- Czech Republic\n- Poland\n- Austria\n- Slovakia\n- Hungary*\n- Romania*\n- Bulgaria*\n\n* Sales locations only.\n\n- Production in Europe\n  - BMW Group plant Berlin\n  - BMW Group plant Dingolfing\n  - BMW Group plant Eisenach\n  - BMW Group plant Landshut\n  - BMW Group plant Leipzig\n  - BMW Group plant Munich\n  - BMW Group plant Regensburg\n  - BMW Group plant Wackersdorf\n  - BMW Group plant Steyr, Austria\n  - BMW Group plant Hams Hall, UK\n  - BMW Group plant Oxford, UK\n  - BMW Group plant Swindon, UK\n  - Rolls-Royce Manufacturing Plant, Goodwood, UK\n\n- Partner plants in Europe\n  - Partner plant, Born, the Netherlands\n  - Partner plant, Graz, Austria\n  - Partner plant, Kaliningrad, Russia\n\n- Research and development network in Europe\n  - BMW Group Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ), Munich, Germany\n  - BMW Car IT, Munich, Germany\n  - BMW Group Autonomous Driving Campus, Unterschlei\u00dfheim, Germany\n  - BMW Group Designworks, Munich, Germany\n  - BMW Group Lightweight Construction and Technology Center, Landshut, Germany\n  - BMW Group Diesel Competence Centre, Steyr, Austria\n  - Critical TechWorks S.A., Porto, Portugal\n  - BMW France, S.

Its model portfolio comprises an extensive range of automobiles, including the premium compact class, the premium mid-size luxury class and the ultra-luxury class. Apart from fully electric models such as the BMW iX3*, which was launched in 2020, it also includes state-of-the-art plug-in hybrids and conventional models powered by highly efficient combustion engines. Together with the highly successful models of the BMW X family and the high-performance BMW M brand, the BMW Group meets the diverse expectations and needs of its customers worldwide.\n\nThe MINI brand promises driving pleasure in the premium small car segment and, apart from models powered by efficient combustion engines, also offers plug-in hybrid and fully electric variants. Rolls-Royce is the ultimate marque in the ultra-luxury segment, boasting a tradition that stretches back over more than 100 years. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars specialises in bespoke customer specifications and offers the very highest level of quality and service.\n\nThe global sales network of the BMW Group\u2019s automobile business currently comprises more than 3,500 BMW, over 1,600 MINI and some 140 Rolls-Royce dealerships.\n\nMOTORCYCLES SEGMENT\n\nThe Motorcycles business is also clearly focused on the premium segment. The model range currently comprises motorcycles in the Sport, Tour, Roadster, Heritage, Adventure and Urban Mobility categories. BMW Motorrad also offers a broad range of equipment options to enhance rider safety and comfort. The Motorcycles business sales network is organised similarly to that of the automobiles business. Currently, BMW motorcycles are sold by more than 1,200 dealerships and importers in over 90 countries.\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\n\nThe BMW Group is a leading provider of financial services in the automotive sector. It offers these services in around 60 countries worldwide via companies and cooperation arrangements with local financial services providers and importers. The Financial Services segment\u2019s main business is credit financing and the leasing of BMW Group brand automobiles and motorcycles to retail customers. Customers can also choose from an attractive array of insurance and banking products.\n\nOperating under the brand name Alphabet, the BMW Group\u2019s international multi-brand fleet business provides financing and comprehensive management services for corporate car fleets in more than 20 countries. These services also include helping customers to manage their fleets on a sustainable and climate-friendly basis.\n\nFinancing dealership vehicle fleets serves to support the dealership organisation and rounds off the segment\u2019s range of services.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nSTRATEGY, GOALS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nSTRATEGIC ORIENTATION OF THE BMW GROUP\n\nIndividual mobility, as the BMW Group understands it, is inextricably linked with conserving the world\u2019s natural resources. The BMW Group bases its contribution to the sustainable development of our planet on scientifically derived criteria. With this principle in mind, it combines ecological and social aspects with securing its long-term future in all its activities. The BMW Group views the combination of driving pleasure and responsibility for acting sustainably as a clear factor for differentiation. The outcome is that customers experience outstanding innovative products made by a company focused on sustainability.\n\nHowever, that is merely the starting point for the BMW Group, which intends to integrate sustainability more strongly than ever in its corporate strategy. The strategy establishes the necessary conditions to fulfill both customer expectations and regulatory requirements regarding emissions in the Group\u2019s various markets by offering a wide range of products. Its clear ambition is to ensure that all areas of the company think, manage and demonstrably act in a true spirit of sustainability.\n\nThis way of thinking has resulted in the BMW Group reaching the logical strategic decision to move away from pursuing a separate sustainability strategy and presenting a separate sustainable value report. Sustainability is the basic pattern that shapes the BMW Group\u2019s strategy. From beginning to end, activities and plans should comprehensively be examined with regard to their economic, ecological and social impacts and the corresponding decisions taken based on an integrated approach. With effect from the financial year 2020, the Group is therefore integrating its reporting. A Group Report of this nature covers a variety of key aspects and endeavours to highlight correlations in a transparent manner. The BMW Group is therefore consciously subjecting all of its activities to a comprehensive external audit, including its activities in the area of sustainability.\n\nTHE STRATEGY ARROW \u2013 POINTING THE WAY TO THE FUTURE\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s strategy comprises four key elements, which are summarised in a strategy arrow that points towards the future.\n\nPOSITION \u2013 WHAT DOES THE BMW GROUP STAND FOR?\n\nThe BMW Group stands for first-class individual mobility and sustained responsibility. These factors provide transparency and reliability for shareholders and investors as well as for partners in the supply chain and the production and sales system, but also for all other stakeholders, political decision makers, the media and the general public.\n\nThe BMW Group considers itself as a pioneer and sets standards for the individual mobility of tomorrow. It combines joy and responsibility without compromise and, together with its partners, leads the industry in terms of environmental, social and integrity standards. The BMW Group is committed to complying with the Paris Climate Agreement \u2013 with a verifiable track record of continuous improvement. It is promoting the principles of circular economy, both in its corporate philosophy and in close collaboration with its partners \u2013 from the supply chain to production, the use phase and the recycling of its products.\nDIRECTION \u2013 WHAT IS THE BMW GROUP\u2019S DRIVING FORCE?\n\nIts aspiration to manufacture products that will inspire its customers \u2013 both today and in the future. That is the force that drives the BMW Group. At the same time, the Group strives to achieve a high level of profitability in order to safeguard its corporate independence and distinctively shape the mobility trends of the future. The integration of ecological and social aspects throughout its entire value chain ensures the continued viability of the BMW Group going forward.\n\nThe Group is built on a firm foundation of strong brands and emotional products. In the face of increasingly fierce competition, the BMW Group continues to hone its brand profiles and express them, among other ways, in a unique, characteristic automotive design language. Design arouses emotions and emotion drives desire. At the BMW Group, outstanding design always follows function. The kidney-shaped grille of the new BMW iX, for example, takes on a new role as a smart surface that not only conceals new technologies, but has the ability to self-heal due to the use of innovative materials, so that slight scratches disappear by themselves. \n\nInnovation and Customer Orientation\n\nThe products must deliver what their design promises, i.e. sportiness, quality and emotionality, a fact that applies equally to all drivetrain technologies. The BMW Group is a leading supplier of electrified vehicles, the foundation for which was laid at an early stage by project i with the all-electric BMW i3 in 2013. Meanwhile, the Group is in the middle of its second phase: In order to keep pace with growing market demand, it is expanding its offering of electric drivetrains across all segments. With its flexible platforms and the fifth generation of in-house developed fully electric drivetrains, the BMW Group can offer its customers worldwide a broad and mature range of products. For example, the all-electric MINI Cooper SE* and the BMW iX3* were both launched in the course of 2020 and will be followed by the BMW i4 and the BMW iX* in 2021.\n\nIn future, models such as the high-volume BMW 5 Series and the X1 as well as the BMW 7 Series will be available with four different types of drivetrain \u2013 all-electric, plug-in hybrid, petrol and diesel. Moreover, the BMW Group is preparing for the third phase of its transformation with a new vehicle architecture starting in the mid-2020s. Over the next ten years, the Group intends to have more than seven million of its electrified vehicles on roads worldwide \u2013 at least two-thirds of them all-electric models.\n\nWith this aim in mind, the BMW Group is systematically expanding its product range and progressively enhancing both its technologies and its vehicle architectures, the latest of which are entirely centred on fully electric drivetrain systems. At the same time, the Group is taking another major step in terms of digitalised connectivity, not only within the vehicle itself, but also in its corporate processes.\n\nAs part of its Performance Programme, the BMW Group is also working to continuously raise its level of efficiency in order to compensate for the high upfront expenditures required for the technologies that will shape the world of tomorrow. Profitability and free cash flow have a high priority within the BMW Group\u2019s corporate management system. All the measures and initiatives it takes are therefore aimed at continually developing its strong economic base.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\nMoreover, to express the importance of its ability to perform in economic terms, the BMW Group has set itself ambitious financial targets in the course of realigning its strategy. In future, the key performance indicators (KPIs) already used in the annual outlook, namely\n\n1. Profit before financial result as a percentage of Automotive segment revenues (EBIT margin Automotive segment) and\n\n2. Return on capital employed for the Automotive segment (RoCE Automotive segment)\n\nwill also be integrated as KPIs at the strategic level. The aim is for the Automotive segment\u2019s EBIT margin to rise steadily again to between 8% and 10% and for the RoCE to reach a level of at least 40% in the future.\n\nThe two segment-related profitability indicators will be supplemented by the KPI\n\n3. Group profit before tax as a percentage of Group revenues (BMW Group EBT margin).\n\nWith regard to free cash flow, the BMW Group focuses particularly on capital expenditure and the systematic management of working capital.\n\nEven faster digitalised processes and lean structures are key prerequisites for consistently leveraging efficiencies. During the coronavirus pandemic year 2020, for example, advances in digitalisation enabled the BMW Group to maintain direct contact with its customers, despite lockdowns worldwide. Digitalisation is helping to shorten the process of developing new vehicle models by up to one-third. When the BMW Group transitions to the more advanced smart vehicle architectures in 2021, the conventional drivetrain variants will be largely phased out to make way for electrified drivetrains such as mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric systems. These results will already begin to take effect from 2022.\n\nMoreover, as one of its efficiency initiatives, the Group regularly assesses how complexity can be reasonably reduced. Complexity arises due to increasingly strict and globally heterogeneous regulatory requirements. The Group-wide Performance Programme also includes making the most of synergies and efficiencies in indirect purchasing as well as in terms of materials and production costs. And it goes without saying that the BMW Group is selectively bolstering its performance with attractive new models \u2013 especially in segments generating the highest returns.\n\nSTRATEGIC APPROACH \u2013 WHERE IS THE BMW GROUP HEADING?\n\nThe BMW Group places the strategic emphasis on its customers and their varying requirements worldwide. In the BMW Group, trendsetting technologies, emotional products and individualised customer service merge to create a unique overall experience for customers.\n\nIts strategy is therefore of a dynamic nature. On the one hand, the Group\u2019s market environment is characterised by stable trends. This includes people\u2019s need for individual mobility, which the BMW Group is convinced will remain strong and grow further in the years to come. On the other hand, however, it needs to be able to respond to uncertain developments both flexibly and with a sense of proportion. These developments can be of a (geo)political nature, but also come in the form of fully unexpected events such as the coronavirus pandemic. In 2020, the Board of Management realigned the core elements of the BMW Group\u2019s strategy and focused them on the key technology areas that are expected to shape the future.\n\nInnovative technologies are the key to the future of mobility going forward. By 2025, the BMW Group intends to invest more than \u20ac30 billion in research and development to reinforce its role as a leader of innovation. The Group\u2019s plans are also an expression of confidence in terms of the way it sees business developing going forward. Its ability to integrate a broad variety of technologies in an overall system is of crucial importance. Companies that succeed in mastering and combining both hardware and software in equal measure are those which will shape the future of the automobile in the long term.\nHOW DOES THE BMW GROUP ENSURE COOPERATION?\n\nTo achieve its strategic goals, the entire team of some 121,000 employees worldwide needs to work in a spirit of cooperation to implement the strategy, based on the principles of responsibility, appreciation, transparency, trust and openness. The BMW Group therefore works hand in glove with both internal and external partners with the twin aims of achieving maximum effectiveness and joint success.\n\nThe Group needs to tackle the entrepreneurial, ecological and social challenges in equal measure to accomplish these aims. Decisions need to be analysed with regard to their interactions and consequences in the overall context. Success is not something to be simply taken for granted, but has to be worked for every day anew. Everyone needs to work hard for \u201ctheir\u201d company and deliver maximum performance in order to reach the common goal. Success in corporate terms is always the joint success of all BMW Group employees together with their partners. For this reason, it is also a key aspiration of the BMW Group to be an attractive employer.\n\nSUSTAINABILITY PLACED AT CORE OF CORPORATE STRATEGY\n\nSustainability is intrinsic to the BMW Group\u2019s strategic orientation. At the end of July 2020, the Board of Management of BMW AG announced the first details of this strategy and presented targets to which the enterprise will remain committed for the period up to 2030. In this endeavour, the BMW Group is building on a solid foundation. In recent years and decades, it has also repeatedly set standards in sustainability that are acknowledged by external, independent bodies. In 2020, for example, the BMW Group took back industry leadership in the automotive sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices World and Europe. The BMW Group therefore occupies the top spot among automotive manufacturers Dialogue with Stakeholders. It is also in the top CDP grouping for its transparent disclosure of carbon emissions. The principle of continuous improvement has always been a key aspect of the BMW Group\u2019s strategy.\n\nThe Group has therefore given a commitment to achieve climate neutrality across the entire value chain by no later than 2050. In view of the long-term nature of its targets and the fact that, from today\u2019s perspective, the technological and economic route remains uncertain, the BMW Group sets its targets one decade at a time. In 2020, for example, the Group set itself specific goals for the year 2030 based on scientific information. New science-based targets have emerged from the initiative of the same name (SBTI). These targets are fully in line with the requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement and put the BMW Group on the path towards climate neutrality.\n\nCarbon emissions are to be reduced by at least one-third per vehicle over the entire life cycle, from the supply chain to production to the end-of-life phase. The BMW Group expects environmental and social standards to be upheld by all participants in the supply chain, including those delivering critical raw materials. The BMW Group aims to ensure the most sustainable supply chain in the industry.\nThe new target framework represents a systematic continuation of the ten strategic sustainability goals already announced in 2012, which have been rigorously pursued in the period from 2012 to 2020. These sustainability goals were divided into three main fields of action:\n\n1. **Products and services**\n   The increasing electrification of the BMW Group\u2019s fleet and the systematic further development of combustion engines made it possible to remain within the fleet CO\u2082 limit set by the EU in the 2020 reporting period, taking all regulatory requirements and regulations into account. As a result, the Group also achieved the target it set itself in 2012 of halving the carbon emissions generated by its European new vehicle fleet in the period from 1995 to 2020. [Carbon Emissions and Pollutants](#)\n\n2. **Production and value creation**\n   Since 2020, the BMW Group has obtained all of its production-related, externally generated electricity from renewable sources, in line with the target set by the Group. [Renewable Energy](#)\n\n3. **Employees and society**\n   Women accounted for 19.5% of the BMW Group\u2019s total workforce during the year under report (BMW AG: 15.9%) and therefore above the target range of 15% to 17% set for 2020. At 17.8%, the proportion of women in management positions at BMW Group (BMW AG: 16.2%) was also within the target range at the end of 2020. The high proportion of women in junior management programmes also forms the basis for a further increase in the number of women in management positions over time. [Employee Diversity](#)\n\n### NEW AND AMBITIOUS TARGET FRAMEWORK BY 2030\n\nThe BMW Group is firmly convinced that the fight against climate change and the responsible use of resources will determine the future of our society \u2013 and thus also that of the BMW Group. Particularly as a premium manufacturer, the BMW Group aspires to lead the way in promoting sustainability and is therefore also taking responsibility with regard to this key topic.\n\nThis also means facing up to the challenges of the future, but also making effective use of opportunities as they arise. With this in mind, the BMW Group focuses on the performance and diversity of its workforce, whereby the proportion of women in management positions at BMW Group is seen as a key performance indicator for the future.\n\nMoreover, the BMW Group is rigorously going one step further by setting itself new and ambitious sustainability targets for 2030. They are an inherent aspect of strategic management and include the upstream supply chain, the Group\u2019s own manufacturing operations as well as the customers\u2019 use phase.\n\nThe corresponding key non-financial performance indicators are:\n\n1. CO\u2082 emissions per vehicle produced\n2. CO\u2082 emissions of the new vehicle fleet*\n3. Proportion of electrified vehicles in total deliveries\n\nIn future, the key non-financial performance indicators will be supplemented to include CO\u2082 emissions generated in the supply chain. The corresponding strategic focus is firmly established in every area of the company.\n\n* EU including Norway and Iceland.\nStrategic targets 2020\n\n2020 TARGETS ACHIEVED\n\n- 53% CO\u2082 EMISSIONS IN THE EUROPEAN NEW VEHICLE FLEET IN THE PERIOD FROM 1995 TO 2020\n\n100% ELECTRICITY PURCHASED FOR THE BMW GROUP\u2019S PLANTS WORLDWIDE SINCE 2020 FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES\n\n17.8% PROPORTION OF WOMEN IN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS IN THE BMW GROUP\n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\nPRODUCTION, PURCHASING AND SUPPLIER NETWORK\n\nEMPLOYEES AND SOCIETY\n\nThis is a simplified depiction. Detailed explanations of KPIs and its corresponding assurance level are provided in the relevant chapters of the report.\nCARBON TARGETS FOR THE VEHICLE\u2019S USE PHASE\n\nBy 2030, the carbon emissions generated by BMW Group vehicles are to be reduced by more than 40% per kilometre driven. The BMW Group has been working successfully for many years to reduce the level of carbon emissions of its new vehicle fleet worldwide. As well as complying with its legal obligations, the Group has always remained true to its voluntary commitments. The early deployment of Efficient Dynamics technologies since 2007 and the ongoing electrification of its vehicle fleet form the dual basis for continued compliance with statutory carbon emissions and fuel consumption limits going forward.\n\nAs a pioneer of electric mobility, the BMW Group is in the process of significantly expanding its range. By the end of 2021, it aims to have over one million vehicles powered by either all-electric or plug-in hybrid drivetrains on the road. BMW Group customers will then be able to choose from a range of five fully electric series-produced models.\n\nThe BMW Group intends to have 25 electrified models on the road by 2023. The plan is based on flexible vehicle architectures and production systems that enable a model to be manufactured as an all-electric version, as a plug-in hybrid or powered by a conventional internal combustion engine. This approach gives the BMW Group the flexibility to take account of changes in market demand as well as differences in regulatory requirements and infrastructure in the various markets in which it operates. The BMW Group forecasts that demand for its electrified vehicles is set to double by 2021 compared to 2019. According to the BMW Group\u2019s forecasts, by 2021 the sale of electrified vehicles is expected to double compared to 2019 figures. By 2025, the proportion of electrified cars in total Group deliveries is expected to rise to at least 25%. However, Group decarbonisation targets are far more ambitious. By 2030, it aims to reduce carbon emissions per kilometre driven during a given vehicle\u2019s use phase by more than 40% compared to 2019 (Scope 3 downstream). The target is within the range defined by the SBTI\u2019s calculations to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 1.75 degrees Celsius.\n\nCARBON EMISSIONS IN PRODUCTION AND AT BUSINESS LOCATIONS BY 80%\n\nThe BMW Group has a direct influence on the carbon emissions generated at its own plants and locations and has therefore been a leader in terms of resource efficiency in this field for many years. Its underlying aspiration is even more ambitious than the international pursuing efforts of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Despite having already reduced the level of carbon emissions per vehicle produced by more than 70% since 2006, the BMW Group intends to additionally reduce carbon emissions per vehicle produced, which are generated directly by its own combustion processes (Scope 1) and indirectly by external energy sources (Scope 2), by a further 80% by 2030 (base year 2019). Accordingly, by 2030 carbon emissions are expected to have dropped by over 90% compared with 2006 levels.\n\nResource Consumption and Resource Efficiency\n\nAlongside the purchase of electricity, 100% of which has been obtained from green, renewable sources* since 2020, the BMW Group will continue to systematically invest in optimising its energy efficiency and also intends to exploit the opportunities offered by digitalisation in the process. Even today, the Group\u2019s production processes are already highly efficient \u2013 for example, by reducing the volume of rejects in car body construction to a minimum and by planning the ongoing maintenance of its machinery on a predictive basis. The BMW Group will also examine the potential for the broader deployment of renewable energy at its various locations worldwide. The use of green hydrogen to generate power can also play a key role.\n\n* Electricity generated from in-house renewable power plants, direct supply contracts for green electricity and certified guarantees of origin.\nCO\u2082 IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN: TREND REVERSAL AND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION\n\nIn view of the increasing number of electric vehicles on roads worldwide, far greater attention will also have to be paid to upstream value creation when it comes to reducing carbon emissions going forward \u2013 particularly in light of the energy-intensive production of high-voltage batteries. Due to the greater proportion of electrified vehicles, carbon emissions generated per vehicle in the BMW Group\u2019s supply chain are set to rise by more than one-third by 2030 if no countermeasures are taken. At the same time, as the volume of carbon emissions generated during the use phase decreases, the total percentage of emissions caused by the supply chain and attributable to the Group will increase. This situation requires the BMW Group to set its own strategic targets.\n\nThe Group not only aims to halt the rise in the level of carbon generated by the supply chain that would be expected without taking countermeasures (Scope 3 upstream), it also intends to reduce emissions per vehicle by at least 20%* by 2030 (base year 2019). In its efforts to achieve this aim, among other measures the BMW Group is establishing the carbon footprint of the supply chain as a decision-making criterion when awarding contracts. With this end in mind, the Group took the step of initiating a dialogue with its most important suppliers in terms of their carbon footprint during the period under report. The BMW Group is playing an exemplary role in working with well-documented and measurable carbon emission targets for its supply chain.\n\nAs a concrete example of the measures taken, the Group has already entered into contractual agreements with its cell manufacturers that only green electricity will be used to produce the fifth generation of battery cells, a move that should lead to a total saving of around ten million tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next ten years.\n\nMoreover, the BMW Group is currently in the process of creating the organisational conditions that enable it to reliably record and document the size of the carbon footprint generated via its supply chain. This, in turn, is the key prerequisite for taking subsequent measures to reduce and effectively manage it, fully in line with the BMW Group\u2019s declared strategy of continuous improvement.\n\nPurchasing and Supplier Network\n\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nIn its reporting procedures, the BMW Group also takes the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) into account in order to report transparently on climate risks and opportunities for operational and financial reporting purposes. Firstly, it reports on this topic in detail in its BMW Group Report and secondly in the CDP questionnaire, which has incorporated the TCFD recommendations since 2018. The BMW Group\u2019s 2020 CDP questionnaire is available on the BMW Group Website. The TCFD Index in the appendix provides a compact overview of the key statements contained in the four TCFD core elements as well as their location in the BMW Group Report and the CDP questionnaire.\n\n* Value rounded for simplification purposes. The target percentage validated in conjunction with SBTI is 22%.\nRESPONSIBLE USE OF RESOURCES \u2013 ENTERING THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nNot only decarbonisation but also the responsible use of resources plays a key part in the BMW Group\u2019s strategy. In practical terms, this means primarily avoiding waste or reducing it to an absolute minimum. However, as resources are scarce and many raw materials are only available in limited quantities, the reuse of materials and raw materials in the form of secondary materials is becoming increasingly key for manufacturing processes going forward.\n\nFor example, the growing popularity of electric mobility worldwide cannot be covered by primary materials alone in the long term. Furthermore, there is a strong synergy between the conservation of primary natural resources and carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, from a sustainability perspective, the underlying flows of resources require some rethinking. The BMW Group aims to obtain high-quality secondary materials through promoting a greater degree of transparency in the recycling chain and simultaneously tracing the reuse of (secondary) raw materials within the cycle.\n\nThe Group has the clear objective of promoting the circular economy principle by using raw materials even more efficiently in order to protect nature\u2019s finite resources.\n\nEven today, vehicles are already required to be 95% recyclable. However, the proportion of secondary raw materials used to manufacture new vehicles is still comparatively low. In view of this key point, the BMW Group plans to considerably increase this proportion in its vehicles by 2030 \u2013 and is already exploring some very far-reaching scenarios. The use of secondary materials again significantly reduces carbon emissions in comparison to primary materials \u2013 by as much as 80% in the case of aluminium, for example. Keeping the extraction of raw materials to a minimum is an ideal way of protecting existing resources. In the case of critical raw materials, for example, any political conflicts in the producing countries could also give rise to risks for the BMW Group\u2019s procurement activities, which can be mitigated through the use of secondary products.\n\nParticularly in view of the high-voltage batteries needed to power electrified vehicles, which can entail the use of critical raw materials, the circular economy has a decisive role to play. In close collaboration with the German recycling specialist Duesenfeld, the BMW Group has developed a process that can achieve a recycling rate of up to 96% \u2013 including the graphite and electrolytes these devices contain. The BMW Group already offers all customers who own a vehicle equipped with a high-voltage battery to take the devices back free of charge. The offer also applies to regions where it is not legally obliged to do so.\n\nIn order to monitor and verify flows of goods on a global basis, the BMW Group is also using digital tools in pilot processes, including blockchain technology. The PartChain project, for example, enables the Group to collect supply chain data using a method that is both verifiable and tamper-proof at all times. In the long term, this technology could enable critical raw materials in particular to be fully traceable from the mine to the smelter.\n\nSECURING LONG-TERM SUCCESS\n\nIn order to create value for the BMW Group, the environment and society in general, sustainability is integrated throughout the entire value chain and all its underlying processes. And the evidence of how this Group strategy is being implemented underlines its tangible impact. It sets out clear guidelines and points the way forward in terms of how the BMW Group intends to shape the individual premium mobility of tomorrow. The BMW Group will move forward in its own independent way and continue the long-term process of developing on a sustainable and profitable basis.\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s strategic goals up to the years 2025 and 2030 respectively are summarised in the presentation below:\nStrategic targets\n\n- **EBT Margin Group**: > 10%\n- **EBIT Margin Automotive Segment**: 8 - 10%\n- **Return on Capital Employed Automotive Segment**: \u2265 40%\n- **Reduction of CO\u2082 Emissions per Vehicle in Production (Base Year 2019)**: \u2265 20%\n- **Reduction of CO\u2082 Emissions in the Supply Chain (Base Year 2019)**: \u2265 40%\n- **Reduction of CO\u2082 Emissions in Vehicle Use Phase per Kilometre Driven (Base Year 2019)**: \u2265 25%\n- **Minimum Proportion of Electric Vehicles to Total Deliveries**: \u2265 25%\n- **Proportion of Women in Management Positions in the BMW Group**: \u2265 22%\n\nThis is a simplified depiction. Detailed explanations of KPIs and its corresponding assurance level are provided in the relevant chapters of the report.\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s business management system follows a value-based approach that focuses on profitability, consistent growth, value enhancement for capital providers, sustainability, climate protection and job security. Capital is considered to be employed profitably when the amount of profit generated sustainably exceeds the cost of equity and debt capital. This strategy also secures the desired degree of corporate autonomy in the long term.\n\nBMW GROUP \u2013 VALUE DRIVERS\n\nManaging sustainability\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s long-term strategic course is determined by the full Board of Management, which is therefore also responsible for implementing the Group\u2019s sustainability goals. In 2019, the separate format of the Board of Management\u2019s Sustainability Board was fully incorporated into the regular meetings of the Board of Management, enabling sustainability issues to be even more systematically integrated within the BMW Group\u2019s decision-making processes. Since then, sustainability has been treated like every other topic and discussed at Board of Management meetings as the need arises. Moreover, all requests for decisions referred to the Board of Management are required to be assessed beforehand in terms of their sustainability. A Strategy and Structure Circle, comprising the top management of the various company divisions, prepares the drafts of decisions to be taken for the Board of Management after also taking sustainability issues into account.\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s corporate governance principles are set out in detail in its Corporate Governance Statement. GRI 102-18, 102-19, 102-20, 102-25, 102-27, 102-31, 102-33\n\nThe Group\u2019s targets for sustainability are applied at business unit level and overall area of responsibility level. As a consequence, the individual targets set for managers include sustainability aspects and criteria that have an impact on performance-based compensation. GRI 102-19, 102-28\n\nThe Supervisory Board decides on the amounts awarded to members of the Board of Management Remuneration Report, basing its decisions on the sustainable development of the BMW Group as a whole. Bonuses are partially based on personal performance and assessed primarily according to qualitative criteria. These include ecological innovations (e.g. carbon emission reductions), leadership accomplishments and the ability to manage change processes. Additional criteria include enhancing the company\u2019s attractiveness as an employer, progress in implementing the diversity concept and activities that encourage corporate citizenship within the BMW Group. GRI 102-27, 102-28, 102-35\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s internal management system is based on a multilayered structure. Operating performance is managed primarily at segment level. In order to manage long-term corporate performance and assess strategic issues, additional key performance figures are taken into account within the management system at Group level. In this context, the value added serves as one of several indicators for the contribution made to enterprise value during the financial year. This approach is made operational at both Group and segment level through key financial and non-financial performance indicators (value drivers). The link between value added and the relevant value drivers is presented in a simplified form below.\nDue to the very high level of aggregation, it is impractical to manage the business on the basis of value added. This key indicator is, however, used for reporting purposes. In addition, relevant value drivers having a significant impact on business performance and therefore on enterprise value are defined for each controlling level. The financial and non-financial value drivers are reflected in the key performance indicators used to manage the business. In the case of project-related decisions, the target system follows a project-oriented management logic that is based on net present values and profitability performance indicators, thereby providing a fundamental basis for decision-making.\n\n**AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT**\n\nThe most comprehensive key performance indicator used for the Automotive segment is RoCE. This indicator provides information on the profitability of capital employed and the operational business. Value driver analyses can be used to interpret the causes of a change in RoCE and derive suitable measures to influence its development. RoCE is measured on the basis of segment profit before financial result and the average capital employed in the segment. The strategic target for the Automotive segment\u2019s RoCE is 40%.\n\n\\[\n\\text{RoCE Automotive} = \\frac{\\text{Profit before financial result}}{\\text{Average capital employed}}\n\\]\n\n**RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED**\n\n|                      | Profit before financial result in \u20ac million | Average capital employed in \u20ac million | Return on capital employed in % |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                      | 2020                                      | 2019                                | 2020                            | 2019                            | 2020                            | 2019                            |\n| Automotive           | 2,162                                     | 4,499                               | 17,026                          | 15,513                          | 12.7                            | 29.0                            |\n\nCapital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest (e.g. trade payables and other provisions).\n\nDue to its key importance for the Group as a whole, the Automotive segment is managed on the basis of additional key performance indicators that have a significant impact on RoCE and hence on segment performance. These value drivers are the number of vehicle deliveries and the operating return on sales (EBIT margin: segment profit before financial result as a percentage of segment revenues) as the key performance indicator for segment profitability.\n\nFurthermore, the segment manages its compliance with fleet CO\u2082 targets in regulated markets. This also includes the proportion of total deliveries accounted for by electrified vehicles. Since compliance with regulatory requirements has a significant impact on the company\u2019s success, business decisions relating to vehicle projects also take fleet CO\u2082 requirements into consideration. In order to take account of the increasing relevance of carbon emissions over the life cycle of a vehicle, in 2020 a control logic was agreed upon to measure this factor during the manufacturing phase (supplier network, logistics, production).\nMOTORCYCLES SEGMENT\n\nAs with the Automotive segment, the Motorcycles segment is managed on the basis of RoCE. Capital employed is determined on the same basis as in the Automotive segment. The strategic RoCE target for the Motorcycles segment is 40% as in the Automotive segment.\n\n\\[\n\\text{RoCE Motorcycles} = \\frac{\\text{Profit before financial result}}{\\text{Average capital employed}}\n\\]\n\nRETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED\n\n|                      | Profit before financial result in \u20ac million | Average capital employed in \u20ac million | Return on capital employed in % |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                      | 2020                                      | 2019                                | 2020                           | 2019                           |\n| Motorcycles          | 103                                       | 194                                 | 687                            | 660                            | 15.0                           | 29.4                           |\n\nThe main value drivers include the number of deliveries and the operating return on sales (EBIT margin: segment profit before financial result as a percentage of segment revenues) as the key performance indicator for segment profitability.\nFINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\n\nAs commonly practised in the banking sector, the Financial Services segment is managed on the basis of return on equity (RoE). RoE is defined as segment profit before tax, divided by the average amount of equity capital in the Financial Services segment. The target is a return on equity of at least 14%.\n\n\\[\n\\text{RoE} = \\frac{\\text{Profit before tax}}{\\text{Average equity capital}}\n\\]\n\nRETURN ON EQUITY\n\n|                      | Profit before tax in \u20ac million | Average equity capital in \u20ac million | Return on equity in % |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                      | 2020                          | 2019                               | 2020                  | 2019                  | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Financial Services   | 1,725                         | 2,272                              | 15,343                | 15,146                | 11.2                  | 15.0                  |\n\nSTRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AT GROUP LEVEL\n\nStrategic management and the quantification of financial implications based on long-term corporate planning are performed primarily at Group level. Key performance indicators in this context include Group profit before tax and the size of the workforce at the year end. Group profit before taxes provides a comprehensive measure of the Group\u2019s overall corporate performance after consolidation effects and a transparent basis for comparing performance over time.\n\nThe information provided by these non-financial performance indicators is complemented by the two financial key performance indicators of pre-tax return on sales and value added. Value added, as a highly aggregated performance indicator, also provides an insight into capital efficiency and the (opportunity) cost of capital required to generate Group profit. A positive added value means that a return on investment above the cost of capital has been achieved.\nVALUE ADDED GROUP\n\n|                      | Earnings amount | Cost of capital (equity + debt capital) | Value added Group |\n|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                      | 2020            | 2019                                   | 2020              | 2019              |\n| BMW Group            | 5,464           | 7,369                                  | 8,061             | 7,812             |\n\nValue added Group = earnings amount \u2013 cost of capital\n\n= earnings amount \u2013 (cost of capital rate \u00d7 capital employed)\n\nCapital employed comprises the average amount of Group equity and pension provisions as well as the financial liabilities of the Automotive and Motorcycles segments employed at the end of the last five quarters in each case. The earnings amount corresponds to Group profit before tax, adjusted for interest expense incurred in conjunction with the pension provision and the financial liabilities of the Automotive and Motorcycles segments (profit before interest expense and taxes). The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return expected by capital providers in return for the capital employed. Since capital employed comprises an equity capital (e.g. share capital) and a debt capital element (e.g. bonds), the overall cost of capital rate is determined on the basis of the weighted average rates for equity and debt capital, measured using standard market procedures. The pre-tax average weighted cost of capital for the BMW Group in 2020 was 12%, unchanged from the previous year.\n\nIn order to determine the internal rate of return, risk-adjusted cost of capital rates are based on the average of actual rates in recent years. In light of the long-term nature of product and investment decisions, the following internal rates of return are used in conjunction with segment management:\n\n|                      | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n| Automobile           | 12.0 | 12.0 |\n| Motorcycles          | 12.0 | 12.0 |\n| Financial Services   | 13.4 | 13.4 |\n\nVALUE-BASED MANAGEMENT FOR PROJECT DECISIONS\n\nOperational business in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is largely shaped by the life-cycle-dependent character of investment projects, which have a substantial influence on future business performance. Project-related decisions are therefore a crucial element of financial management in the BMW Group.\n\nProject decisions are based on calculations derived from the expected cash flows of each individual project. Calculations are made for the full term of a project, incorporating future years in which the project is expected to generate cash flows. Project decisions are taken on the basis of net present value and the internal rate of return calculated for the project.\n\nThe net present value indicates the extent to which the project will be able to generate future net cash inflows over and above the cost of capital. A project with a positive net present value enhances future value added and therefore results in an increase in enterprise value. The internal rate of return of the project shows the average return on the capital employed in the project. In this respect, there are conceptual links between the internal rate of return and the multi-year average RoCE.\n\nFor all project decisions, the project criteria and long-term periodic results impact are measured and incorporated in the long-term Group planning. This approach enables an analysis of the impact of project decisions on periodic earnings and rates of return for each year during the term of the project. The overall result is a cohesive management model.\nHOW THE BMW GROUP CREATES VALUE\n\nWithin the BMW Group, value creation is a comprehensive process involving a broad range of positive factors, some of which interact in complex ways. These factors may be of a financial or a non-financial nature and relate to both tangible and intangible values that are geared towards creating additional value using a minimum of resources. These input factors form the basis that drives the BMW Group\u2019s overall performance.\n\nAccording to the input-output model of the IIRC framework, the factors on both the input and the output side are divided into six different types of capital, which can be distinguished as follows:\n\n1. Financial capital\n2. Human capital\n3. Intellectual capital\n4. Relationship capital\n5. Produced capital\n6. Natural capital\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s financial capital is defined in terms of equity capital and total assets, the latter corresponding to the balance sheet total. An appropriately high equity ratio (i.e. equity as a percentage of total assets) makes a significant contribution to safeguarding the corporate independence of the BMW Group and forms a solid basis for high earnings and therefore stable dividends for the shareholders.\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s solid economic base is inextricably linked with its human and intellectual capital. These two precious assets constitute the greatest factor in the enduring success of the Group as a whole and play a key role in tackling the challenges of the future. They combine the knowledge, skills, abilities, strengths and talents of the BMW Group\u2019s workforce and are among the most important value factors for the Group.\n\nIn its international R&D network, the BMW Group offers its innovation-minded employees excellent conditions that enable them to create the solutions that will shape tomorrow\u2019s world. The high degree of motivation to innovate and the willingness to perform, both of which are firmly anchored throughout the entire workforce, are equally expressed in the lively participation in Group-wide ideas management as well as in the outstanding level of employee satisfaction. A key pillar of the BMW Group\u2019s personnel development strategy is to develop this success factor in a targeted manner. In addition to its many other levers, the Group attaches great importance to the personal advancement of each individual, which also includes providing opportunities for further training.\n\nFor the BMW Group, innovation means rigorously taking the next step. In this context, it also collaborates closely with its partners in the supplier network. The stable relationships, which have developed over a long period of time in many cases, have created a capital of inestimable value, a fact amply demonstrated not least in the 2020 pandemic year. Even under the challenging conditions of the global lockdown in 2020, the BMW Group\u2019s supply chains remained firm; a feat only possible when the partners share common standards and values and can truly depend on one another.\n\nThe backbone of the BMW Group\u2019s produced capital is formed by the 31 plants in its global production network, across which it manufactured a total of 2.26 million premium vehicles during the 2020 reporting period. Thirteen of these plants (over 40%) are already producing electrified vehicles alongside conventional models.\n\nNatural capital describes all the renewable and non-renewable resources deployed in the manufacturing process. The BMW Group is an efficiency-oriented company, and for that reason both the enterprise as a whole and its individual employees have always deployed natural resources sparingly as a matter of course. The consistently positive development of these capital indicators in recent years underscores this common corporate identity, a fact additionally confirmed by the assessments of independent rating agencies BMW Stock and Capital Markets in 2020.\n\nAll in all, these various aspects form the basis of the BMW Group\u2019s enduring success. Even minor changes in individual factors can directly influence the overall result. This holistic BMW Group approach is intended to ensure that all available resources are used in a responsible manner.\nHow the BMW Group creates value\n\nFinancial capital\n- Total assets: \u20ac216,658 million\n- Equity capital: \u20ac61,520 million\n\nHuman capital\n- Workforce at end of year: 120,726\n- Training and education expenditure: \u20ac279 million\n\nIntellectual capital\n- Employee ideas implemented in conjunction with CRE8 Ideas Management: 1,561\n- R&D expenditure: \u20ac6,279 million\n\nRelationship capital\n- Proportion of production-relevant purchasing volume within the CDP supply chain programme: 79\n- Purchase volume: \u20ac55.5 million\n\nProduced capital\n- Number of plants: 31\n- Plants producing electrified vehicles: 13\n\nNatural capital\n- Energy consumption per produced vehicle: 2.12 MWh\n- Proportion of electricity from renewable energy sources: 100\n\nOutput\n\nFinancial capital\n- Dividend total (proposal to the Annual General Meeting): \u20ac1,253 million\n- Profit before financial result (EBIT): \u20ac4,830 million\n\nHuman capital\n- Wages/salaries/social insurance contributions: \u20ac12,244 million\n- Employee satisfaction: 82%\n\nIntellectual capital\n- First-year benefits from implemented employee ideas (CRE8): \u20ac6.3 million\n- R&D ratio: 18.2%\n\nRelationship capital\n- Proportion of value creation from suppliers: 60%\n- Proportion of suppliers in the CDP Supply Chain programme with an assessment of at least B: 35%\n\nProduced capital\n- Deliveries to customers: 192,662 million units\n- Deliveries of electrified vehicles: 2.33 million units\n\nNatural capital\n- Improvement in resource consumption and emissions from vehicle production: -56.7% (average)\n- Development CO2 emissions EU new car fleet since 1995: -53%\nCOMPLIANCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nResponsible and lawful conduct is fundamental to the success of the BMW Group. Compliance is an integral part of our corporate culture and the reason why shareholders, customers, business partners and the general public place their trust in us. The Board of Management and the employees of the BMW Group are obliged to act responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The BMW Group also expects its business partners to conduct themselves in the same manner throughout the entire value chain. As an active corporate member of the German Institute for Compliance (DICO), the BMW Group provides practical support for compliance management in Germany and contributes to its further development.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AS A CORPORATE FUNCTION\n\nThe BMW Group Compliance Management System is designed to ensure that the BMW Group, its representative bodies, its managers and staff act in a lawful manner at all company locations. Particular emphasis is placed on measures to ensure compliance with antitrust legislation and avoid the risk of corruption or money laundering, as well as promoting respect for human rights. Activities to avoid non-compliance with the law are managed and monitored by the BMW Group Compliance Committee.\n\nThese activities include legal monitoring, internal compliance regulations, communications and training activities, complaint and case management, compliance reporting and compliance controls, as well as following through with sanctions in cases of non-compliance.\n\nREGULAR COMPLIANCE REPORTING TO BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\nThe BMW Group Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness and efficiency of the Compliance Management System on an ongoing basis. It reports regularly and on a case-by-case basis to the Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on all compliance-related issues, including the progress made in refining the BMW Group Compliance Management System, details of investigations performed, known infringements of the law, sanctions imposed and corrective/preventative measures implemented. This also ensures the Board of Management and Supervisory Board are immediately notified of any cases of particular significance. On the basis of this information, the Board of Management keeps track of and analyses developments and trends in the field of compliance and initiates the measures needed to improve the Compliance Management System. The following were among the measures implemented in 2020:\n\n\u2014 Board of Management decision of 15 December 2020 establishing a BMW Group Chief Compliance Officer, effective 1 January 2021, to further strengthen compliance management at the BMW Group.\n\n\u2014 Creation of six new compliance functions within the Board divisions of BMW AG, with a multi-day onboarding programme for the new Compliance Officers.\n\n\u2014 Stepping up antitrust compliance measures.\n\n\u2014 A company-wide tone-from-the-top communications initiative highlighting the compliance management culture at the BMW Group. GRI 102-33\n\nBMW GROUP COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nSupervisory Board BMW AG\nBoard of Management BMW AG\nBMW Group Compliance Committee\nBMW Group Compliance Committee Office\nBMW Group Compliance Network\n\nCompliance Instruments of the BMW Group\n\nCompliance Strategy\nLegal Compliance Monitoring and Trends\nCompliance Risks and Preventive Excellence\nCompliance Codes and Internal Regulations\nCompliance Communications\nCompliance Academy and Culture\nCompliance Processes and IT Systems\nCompliance Case Management\nCompliance Reporting\nCompliance Controls\nCOMPANY-WIDE COMPLIANCE NETWORK\n\nThe decisions taken by the BMW Group Compliance Committee are drafted in concept and implemented operationally by the BMW Group Compliance Committee Office. The BMW Group Compliance Committee Office has more than 20 employees and forms part of the organisation that reports to the Chairman of the Board of Management. For operational implementation of compliance topics, it is supported by a Group-wide compliance network of around 240 BMW Group Compliance Responsibles (heads of local units) and over 80 local Compliance Officers (heads of local compliance functions). The specific compliance activities required for financial services business are coordinated by a separate compliance department within the Financial Services segment. The BMW Group compliance organisation remained fully operational in 2020, despite the unique demands of the coronavirus situation.\n\nCOMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AIMED AT ENSURING LAWFUL CONDUCT THROUGHOUT THE GROUP\n\nThe various elements of the BMW Group Compliance Management System are shown in the diagram on the previous page and are applicable to all BMW Group organisational units worldwide. The BMW Group Legal Compliance Code and BMW Group Code on Human Rights, which form the core of the Group\u2019s Compliance Management System, are supplemented by an internal set of rules. The BMW Group Policy \u201cCompliance\u201d sets out binding strategic requirements for BMW Group compliance management, its premises and basic principles, as well as for implementation in the business departments. The BMW Group Policy \u201cAntitrust Compliance\u201d, which establishes binding rules of conduct for all employees across the BMW Group to prevent unlawful restriction of competition, was supplemented by several additional manuals in 2020 and deserves particular mention. The rules set out in the BMW Group Policy \u201cCorruption Prevention\u201d and the BMW Group Instruction \u201cCorporate Hospitality and Gifts\u201d deal with lawful handling of gifts and benefits and define appropriate assessment criteria and approval procedures. The BMW Group Instruction \u201cAnti-money-Laundering\u201d defines company-wide standards for anti-money-laundering for trade in goods and the financial services sector.\n\nCompliance measures are determined and prioritised on the basis of a regular group-wide compliance risk assessment that relies on data-based risk indicators and transaction validation, among other methods.\n\nVarious internal media and communications materials are used to raise awareness among staff across all compliance issues, including newsletters, employee newspapers and the compliance homepage in the BMW Group intranet, where employees can find all compliance-related information and training materials. A compliance tone-from-the-top initiative called \u201cWalk-the-Talk\u201d was organised for the first time in 2020 to boost employee awareness of the importance of creating a culture of transparency and trust. Senior managers gave keynote speeches on a wide range of compliance issues at forums and employee meetings.\n\nThe training opportunities offered by the BMW Group Compliance Academy are refined on an ongoing basis for specific target groups. As well as imparting knowledge, online and classroom training options with company-specific case studies play an important role in reinforcing compliance in the corporate culture. The online training modules must be repeated by the required target groups every two years and include a final test. Successful completion of the test is confirmed by a certificate. These courses are also offered on an optional basis to all other employees.\nMore than 42,800 managers and staff worldwide have so far received training in the basic principles of compliance, including the content of the Legal Compliance Code and the topic of corruption prevention, and hold a valid training certificate. Successful completion of the training programme is mandatory for all BMW Group managers. The company makes sure that newly recruited managers and promoted staff receive compliance training. Online training in antitrust compliance is mandatory for managers and staff exposed to the associated risks as a result of their functions or on specific occasions. A total of more than 38,300 managers and employees worldwide have so far completed antitrust compliance training and currently hold a valid certificate. Classroom and virtual training, as well as multi-day coaching sessions, are also held in local markets for all key compliance topics. One main emphasis here is on department-specific antitrust training \u2013 an area that was significantly expanded in 2020. \\[GRI 205-2\\]\n\nAny member of staff with questions or concerns relating to compliance is expected to discuss these matters with their managers and with the relevant departments within the BMW Group: in particular, with the BMW Group Compliance Committee Office, Legal Affairs and Corporate Audit. The BMW Group Compliance Contact also serves as a further point of contact and provides non-employees with a system for reporting concerns relating to compliance. Communication with the BMW Group Compliance Contact may remain anonymous, if preferred. BMW Group employees worldwide also have the opportunity to submit information about possible breaches of the law within the company anonymously and confidentially in several languages via the BMW Group SpeakUP Line. The BMW Group assures those providing information that no attempt will be made to determine their identity should they choose to remain anonymous. Unauthorised use is naturally excluded from this. All compliance-related queries and concerns are documented and followed up by the BMW Group Compliance Committee Office using an electronic Case Management System. If necessary, Corporate Audit, Corporate Security, the legal departments or the Works Council may be called upon to assist in the process and address any issues.\n\nVarious IT systems support BMW Group employees with the assessment, approval and documentation of compliance-relevant matters. For example, all exchange activities with competitors must be documented and approved in a special compliance IT system. The same applies to verifying legal admissibility and documenting benefits, especially in connection with corporate hospitality. The BMW Group also uses an IT-based Business Relations Compliance programme to ensure the reliability of its business relations. Relevant business partners are checked and evaluated for potential compliance risks. Appropriate measures are implemented to manage compliance risks based on the results of the evaluation. A further IT system is used to verify customer integrity as required under anti-money-laundering regulations. IT solutions for automated reporting of compliance training activities and documentation of all compliance activities conducted by the business units were also under development during the reporting year.\n\nThrough the Group-wide reporting system, compliance responsibles across all organisational units of the BMW Group report, on both an ongoing and adhoc basis, on the compliance status of their respective units, on any identified legal risks and incidences of non-compliance, as well as on sanctions and corrective/preventative measures implemented.\n\nCompliance with and implementation of compliance rules and processes are audited regularly by Corporate Audit and subjected to control checks by the BMW Group Compliance Committee Office. Corporate Audit carries out on-site audits as part of its regular activities. The BMW Group Compliance Committee also engages Corporate Audit to perform compliance-specific checks and, if necessary, brings in Corporate Security to investigate suspected cases. Two BMW Group Compliance Spot Checks, sample tests specifically designed to identify potential corruption risks, and an antitrust compliance validation (to identify and audit possible antitrust risks) were carried out in addition in 2020. The organisational units for audit are selected on the basis of a Group-wide compliance risk assessment. \\[GRI 205-1\\]\n\nIn an antitrust investigation, the EU Commission alleges that five German car manufacturers colluded with the aim of restricting competition for innovation with regard to certain exhaust treatment systems installed in diesel and petrol-driven passenger vehicles. The current investigation is solely concerned with possible infringements of competition law. For further details, please see the section on \\[Legal Risks\\] within the Report on risks and opportunities and \\[note 10\\] to the Group Financial Statements.\nMANAGERS HAVE UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITY AS COMPLIANCE ROLE MODELS\n\nManagers, in particular, bear a high degree of responsibility and must set a good example with regard to preventing infringements. Managers throughout the BMW Group acknowledge this principle by signing a written declaration, in which they also undertake to make staff working for them aware of legal risks. Managers must, at regular intervals and on their own initiative, verify compliance with the law. It is important to signal to employees that they take compliance risks seriously and that disclosing relevant information is extremely valuable. Managers should remain open to discussion and consider differing opinions. Any indication of non-compliance with the law must be rigorously investigated.\n\nSANCTIONS MANAGEMENT\n\nIt is essential for compliance at the BMW Group that employees are aware of and comply with applicable legal regulations. The BMW Group does not tolerate violations of the law. Culpable violations of the law result in employment-contract sanctions and may involve personal liability consequences for the employee involved.\n\nCOOPERATION BETWEEN COMPLIANCE AND EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES\n\nCompliance is also an important factor in safeguarding the future of the BMW Group workforce. With this in mind, the Board of Management and the national and international employee representative bodies of the BMW Group have agreed on a binding set of joint principles for lawful conduct. Employee representatives are regularly involved in the process of refining compliance management within the BMW Group.\n\nWORLDWIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF LABOUR STANDARDS AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nBMW Group models for ensuring compliance with environmental and social standards throughout its value chain are based on various internationally recognised guidelines. This especially applies to the Guidelines for Multinational Companies issued by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the content of the ICC Business Charter for Sustainable Development and the United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s (UNEP) Declaration on Cleaner Production. The BMW Group concentrates on topics and action areas where it can exert its influence as a commercial enterprise.\n\nWith the signing of the UN Global Compact by the Board of Management of BMW AG in 2001 and the \u201cJoint Declaration on Human Rights and Working Conditions in the BMW Group\u201d, which was adopted in 2005 and updated in 2010, the BMW Group has committed to abide by internationally recognised human rights and, specifically, the ILO core labour standards. The BMW Group Code on Human Rights and Working Conditions, which was published in 2018 to provide further clarification, was ratified by the Board of Management and employee representatives. This affirms the BMW Group\u2019s commitment to human rights and outlines how it promotes respect for human rights and, specifically, how it implements the ILO Core Labour Standards in its business operations worldwide. The Code was also part of the compliance communications initiative \u201cWalk-the-Talk\u201d. The BMW Group conducts specific training on the subject of human rights: for instance, training Purchasing staff to be aware of human rights issues.\n\nIn its annual compliance reporting, all organisational units of the BMW Group are also asked for a local risk assessment of potential for human rights abuses. Their responses form the basis for developing further measures for the department to minimise the risks.\nSpecific human rights risks arise in the supply chain due to the collaborative, cross-border and continent-spanning nature of value creation processes in the automotive industry. For this reason, the BMW Group has integrated respect for human rights into its Supplier Sustainability Policy and follows an appropriate risk management process. In addition to the company\u2019s international purchasing terms and conditions, BMW Group dealer and importer contracts also contain a clause on compliance and human rights. Human rights obligations are also considered in choosing sites and in important investment decisions. GRI 412-3\n\nIn order to meet increasing requirements in the area of human rights, the BMW Group discusses various legislative proposals at German and European level through associations and initiatives and participates in the Automotive Industry Dialogue as part of the German government\u2019s National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights. The German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs featured a practical example from the BMW Group on its CSR website. As part of its leadership of the CSR/Human Rights Working Group of the German Institute for Compliance (DICO), various aspects of human rights management in companies were discussed among members and presented at the DICO Forum in October 2020.\n\nINNOVATION AND CUSTOMER ORIENTATION\n\nA constant striving for innovation, for something new and better, is a concept deeply anchored in the corporate culture of the BMW Group \u2013 in the thinking of its employees, in its processes and also in the identity of its brands. The benchmark and the goal of the BMW Group\u2019s activities is to identify the wishes of customers worldwide in advance, in order to actively help shape trends and thereby drive transformation \u2013 a strategy discernible in production vehicles such as the BMW iX*. In its development work, the BMW Group focuses on two key areas. Firstly, innovative digital solutions that make people\u2019s everyday lives easier and at the same time protect the environment, and secondly, as a premium provider in its industry, the Group sees it as an obligation to offer customers a diverse range of customised, efficient drivetrain technologies ranging from all-electric drive systems, to plug-in hybrids and highly efficient internal combustion engines. This also includes hydrogen fuel cell technology, which the Group believes could become an additional option in the long term.\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s culture of innovation is most deeply rooted in its global research and development network. However, innovation is a lot more than that for the BMW Group: throughout the entire company it is both the basis and the driving force behind the quest to replace the good with the better. Innovative solutions benefit society in a number of ways: economically, ecologically and socially.\n\nFOCUS ON DRIVETRAIN TECHNOLOGIES\n\nThe dynamics of the markets in which the BMW Group operates are largely determined by customer expectations and therefore by demand. The BMW Group therefore focuses on the wishes and needs of its customers. Market expectations have a direct impact on the range of vehicles on offer. How big does the vehicle need to be? Which drivetrain variant fits your own lifestyle? For this reason, the BMW Group offers a broad range of drivetrain systems and aims to offer corresponding electrified models for all of its brands and for every series. Ultimately, a business model is successful and sustainable in the long term by offering tailor-made solutions and assuring customers who are confident in their purchasing decisions. Since 2020, the BMW X3 has been the benchmark in this regard. It is now available in all four drivetrain variants: as an iX3* with an all-electric drivetrain, as a plug-in hybrid or as a model powered by a highly efficient diesel or petrol engine.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nTHE FIFTH GENERATION OF ELECTRIC DRIVETRAINS: A MAJOR LEAP IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION AND SUSTAINABILITY\n\nCustomer-oriented innovations frequently begin with basic research. Built up over many years, the BMW Group\u2019s expertise makes sustainable solutions possible. The new, in-house-developed electric motor does not contain any rare earth elements. The latest generation of batteries requires two-thirds less cobalt than its predecessors. The BMW Group also considers the factor of sustainability when sourcing the cobalt it uses. The metal is acquired transparently via a certified process and supplied to the battery cell producers for further processing. Details are available in the chapter Purchasing and Supplier Network. The BMW Group has contractually agreed with the battery cell suppliers for the fifth generation of its eDrive electric drivetrain that only green electricity from renewable sources will be used in their production processes, which should reduce carbon emissions by some ten million tonnes over the next ten years. In this fifth generation of the BMW Group\u2019s electric drivetrain, the electric motor, transmission and power electronics are also installed within a compact space. The outstanding efficiency of the drivetrain components and the high energy density of the high-voltage battery enable ranges that conventional electric vehicles can only achieve with significantly larger and correspondingly heavier batteries and therefore lower efficiency. This electric drivetrain was deployed for the first time in the BMW iX3*, which was launched in 2020. From 2021 onwards, further all-electric models such as the BMW iX* or the BMW i4 will be powered by this state-of-the-art technology.\n\nTHE BMW GROUP COVERS THE ENTIRE PROCESS CHAIN FOR ELECTRIC DRIVETRAINS\n\nWhether electric motors, high-voltage batteries, charging equipment or power electronics \u2013 since 2011 the BMW Group has gained extensive experience with all the components used in eDrive technology and places its emphasis on in-house developments. By the end of 2022, all German vehicle plants will produce at least one fully electric vehicle. The production system is capable of manufacturing vehicles either with internal combustion engines or electric drivetrains on a single line and can therefore also respond flexibly in terms of the type of drivetrain required by the customer. This level of flexibility in production allows the BMW Group to meet customer expectations in an ideal way. At the BMW Group\u2019s Battery Research Centre, work on battery cells is currently focusing on features that provide a high degree of customer value, including energy density, peak power, longevity, charging properties, costs, behaviour at various temperatures and, last but not least, safety. At the same time, the BMW Group is building a pilot plant for lithium-ion battery cells near Munich, making the BMW Group the first automotive manufacturer to singlehandedly cover the entire process chain of electric driving and master it in technological terms.\n\nCAN THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL SERVE AS A BUILDING BLOCK GOING FORWARD?\n\nThe BMW Group is also investing in the enhanced development of hydrogen fuel cell technology. The BMW i Hydrogen NEXT, which is based on the X5, already awakened a great deal of interest among visitors at the IAA 2019. In the long term, hydrogen technology could become a further component in the BMW Group\u2019s drivetrain range. If the supply of renewably produced hydrogen can be ensured, this technology will provide an attractive option for combining emissions-free mobility with long-distance capability and short refuelling times. The BMW Group is convinced that different forms of drivetrain will continue to exist side by side in the future, as customer expectations cannot be met with a single solution on an international basis. Beginning in 2022, the BMW Group will present a low-volume series of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT featuring the second generation of its hydrogen fuel cell drive system. To make this aim a reality, the BMW Group has been collaborating successfully with Toyota Motor Corporation since 2013. The new drivetrain technology will be combined with the fifth generation of the eDrive, which will then generate its energy from a fuel cell instead of a high-voltage battery. The BMW Group has also developed this technology in-house as an overall system. However, the appropriate political and infrastructural framework conditions first need to be created if green hydrogen is to become widely available in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices. Hydrogen can also play a key role in powering heavy-duty and commercial vehicles with the aim of making logistics carbon-neutral going forward. The BMW Group\u2019s Leipzig and Spartanburg plants have already been using transport vehicles powered by renewably produced hydrogen for a number of years.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\nTHE BMW iX*: ELECTRIC FROM THE GROUND UP\n\nIn November 2020, the BMW Group gave the public its first preview of the BMW iX, the first of which are scheduled for delivery to customers in the course of 2021. Right from the start, the BMW iX was designed exclusively to provide electric mobility that is suitable for everyday use. The vehicle is powered by the fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology, which the BMW Group has developed in-house and consists of twin electric motors, power electronics, charging technology and a high-voltage battery produced without the use of rare earths. Fully electric and featuring four-wheel drive technology, it will enable ranges of over 600 km in the WLTP cycle. Equipped with innovative charging technology and a highly efficient drivetrain, the BMW iX can be charged to enable a range of over 120 km in a mere ten minutes. Thanks to the development of new technologies, the kidney-shaped grille of the BMW iX has now been given a new function as a smart surface where camera technology, radar and other sensor-based features are located behind a transparent exterior. Through the use of innovative materials, the surface of the grille also has a self-healing effect that makes light scratches disappear by themselves. Moreover, as the first 5G-capable model to be made by a premium manufacturer, the BMW iX will also be the BMW Group\u2019s technology flagship in terms of digitalisation going forward. In addition, gigabit Ethernet technology is being used for the first time in this innovative vehicle, enabling extremely large volumes of data from sensors and antennas, for example, to be transmitted through the vehicle within fractions of a second and then processed in the centralised high-performance computers of the vehicle\u2019s on-board system. Moreover, some of this data is also transmitted to the cloud, analysed and returned to the vehicle fleet, depending on the situation, creating new services for customers. For instance, information on danger spots detected by these vehicles, such as black ice, will be made available to the entire fleet, as well as tips on where a free parking space is most likely to be found upon arrival. When using all these digital technology innovations, the BMW Group places great emphasis on ensuring that drivers and passengers can perceive and operate new features intuitively, effortlessly and without distraction \u2013 regardless of how technically complex they may be. These functions are known as shy tech, i.e. technology that only becomes visible when needed.\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE \u2013 THE BASIS FOR AUTOMATED DRIVING AND INTERACTION WITH THE VEHICLE\n\nSince the end of 2020, over 400 data-driven and AI applications have been helping the BMW Group process and interpret big data throughout all relevant areas of the company. Artificial intelligence is also deployed when it comes to developing an algorithm that enables safe and predictive automated driving features, helping to analyse the approximately 250 million kilometres of \u201cexperience\u201d gained to date (as of October 2020). Even now, BMW Group customers are already experiencing the capabilities of AI technologies as they drive. Since the end of 2018, an Intelligent Personal Assistant has been offering them support upon request. Since the second half of 2020, more than 70% of BMW vehicles have been equipped with the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant as standard. For example, commands given in natural speech enable drivers to comfortably operate numerous vehicle functions without having to take their hands off the steering wheel.\n\nCUSTOMER-CENTRIC DEVELOPMENT\n\nVia the BMW Group\u2019s international development network, the varying regional needs and requirements of its customers worldwide are being incorporated into design, research and development. Group locations worldwide are in direct dialogue with their various regions. The BMW Group conducts an average of 70 customer studies per year in the area of display and operating concepts alone. The Group also researches dialogue formats and upcoming trends.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nIn a state-of-the-art innovation process, the BMW Group also uses its ability to change perspectives when required. In this respect, it is the first automotive manufacturer to collaborate with Epic Games, a computer games developer. The BMW Group has modified gaming technologies and adapted them for use in vehicle development as well as in production planning and customer presentation at the retail level. In the field of vehicle development, new components and systems can therefore be tested intensively at a very early stage so that they can later be used by the customer simply and intuitively to the greatest extent possible. Technologies originating from the computer games industry such as mixed reality and game engines are key elements that are making an important contribution in this respect. Internationally staffed teams of developers work simultaneously and interactively with one another before hardware prototypes are additionally made available. In a mixed reality environment, technical solutions can be analysed at an early stage on a virtual ride before the first samples are made physically available, effectively cutting testing costs and, last but not least, minimising development times.\n\nThe BMW Group operates an international network of research and development locations to ensure that ideas can swiftly and directly become innovations for customers in the form of ideas to offer. The network provides the ideal environment for experts to work creatively in internationally connected teams to promote knowledge transfer and even faster, integrated, flexible collaboration for effectively developing the major trends of the future. This combined network of research and development expertise is continuously being expanded and strengthened in a competence-oriented manner.\n\n**INNOVATION CULTURE IN THE MAKING: A NEW CENTRALISED HUB OF THE BMW GROUP\u2019S GLOBAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT NETWORK COMES INTO BEING.**\n\nThe Munich Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ) is the main hub of the Group\u2019s international network of 14 research and development locations. The first phase of construction completed in the course of enlarging the Munich FIZ went into operation in autumn 2020. On the FIZ campus, the focus is on transformation and the future-related topics of electrification, digitalisation and connectivity. With over 90 petabytes of storage capacity, 100 test benches, 200 laboratories and the directly adjacent prototype construction facility, the FIZ has grown to become one of the largest research and development centres in Europe.\n\n**BMW Operating System 7: new features in version 07/20**\n\nDigital key: in collaboration with Apple, the BMW Group is the first car manufacturer to offer its customers the option of using their iPhone as a fully fledged digital car key. It unlocks the vehicle at the door handle and the engine can be started when it is placed in the smartphone compartment. Access rights can be shared with other people and configured in the process and there is a specially designed mode for inexperienced drivers.\n\nNavigation/BMW Maps: the cloud-based system has a great many advantages. The route calculation feature combines real-time information with forecast models and therefore acts more dynamically and swiftly than ever. Additional context-based information such as ratings, business opening hours and pictures of interesting places provide BMW Group customers with excellent support. Entering a destination has now been made far more convenient due to the free text function, which uses a single search line and adds suggestions for relevant search terms.\n\nIntelligent Personal Assistant: the BMW Group has revamped the look of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant and made it more emotional. The Assistant is able to distinguish between the driver\u2019s and the passenger\u2019s speech, learns and even leans towards the respective conversation partner.\n\nApple Car Play allows navigation information from Apple Maps to be displayed on both the head-up display and the info display. Google Android Auto is also integrated: customers can use functions on their smartphones wirelessly within the vehicle and access their apps via touch control without having to directly operate their smartphone. Navigation instructions provided by Google Maps are shown on both the info display and the head-up display.\n\nBMW eDrive zones: plug-in hybrids can use geofencing to detect when they are entering an environmentally restricted zone or a city centre. They then automatically switch to electric mode after previously ensuring that the vehicle\u2019s battery is fully charged, enabling them to drive locally emissions-free and almost silently where it has the greatest impact.\n\nCharging management: electrified models are provided with additional information and services via the Connected Charging feature. Public charging stations and their availability are displayed and additional information is also shown, for example on providers, opening hours or suggestions for places of interest and cafes or restaurants nearby.\n\nFinding a parking space: customers can be assisted via various services when searching for a parking space. The on-street parking information, for example, calculates where a parking space is most likely to be free.\nALWAYS UP TO DATE VIA RADIO INTERFACE\n\nThe remote software upgrade function keeps BMW vehicles continuously up to date. The software updates can be conveniently downloaded to the vehicle whether at home or on the road and contain improvements or even fully new vehicle features. In autumn 2020, the BMW Group rolled out the most extensive remote software upgrade in its history. The free-of-charge improvements and new attractive features were made available over-the-air to more than 750,000 BMW Operating System 7 (version 07/20) vehicles worldwide.\n\nMoreover, Remote Software Upgrade allows drivers to purchase and activate additional optional features. For example, the Highbeam Assist or Active Cruise Control with the Stop&Go function can also be subsequently installed quickly and easily over the air, even on vehicles that have already been delivered to customers. Customers can therefore benefit from the latest technological developments and have the opportunity to test functions that were not yet needed at the time of purchase for a certain period of time with the option to purchase them.\n\nApps have been offering customers an effortless connection between their smartphones and the vehicle since 2013. A new generation of the My BMW app has been available on 30 European markets as well as in China and Korea since December 2020. My BMW is the new universal interface to the vehicle and, depending on how it is equipped, also enables selected features to be activated remotely, such as vehicle localisation.\n\nINNOVATION IN PRODUCTION\n\nIn production scenarios, innovations can act in two different ways: they serve the purpose of conserving resources and thus further boosting efficiency in Production, Purchasing and Supplier Network, but they can also help to implement new product ideas and design options. Digitalisation is thus also paving the way for completely new applications that enable owners to customise their vehicles, such as by adding individual equipment features for the MINI. Furthermore, the BMW Group opened the Additive Manufacturing Campus in summer 2020. Production, research and even further training on the subject of additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) are combined under one roof at the location. The Campus is also capable of manufacturing components for series production vehicles.\n\nINSPIRATION AND COOPERATION\n\nThe best ideas often come into being when different partners work together. Regional BMW Group Technology Offices are searching for promising young companies worldwide in fields of innovation such as sensor technology, artificial intelligence, battery technology, smart materials, natural user interfaces and smart logistics. Cooperations in which the strengths of the BMW Group complement those of established partners also help to enhance the innovative strength of the BMW Group.\n\nFor the BMW Group, maintaining its innovation network also includes intensive dialogue with selected colleges and universities. Every year, thousands of students come to the BMW Group to complete an internship or write a scientific thesis. Many Group employees also work as lecturers at universities and higher education institutions. The BMW Group maintains close partnerships with six universities and research institutions to conduct joint research projects that combine knowledge transfer with the training of highly qualified junior staff.\nCooperations and partnerships\n\nTo maintain its successful course in the long term, the BMW Group enters into targeted cooperations and partnerships not only with companies from the automotive industry, but also with technology leaders from other sectors. The aim of interacting with external partners is to combine expertise against the backdrop of rapid technological change and make innovations available to customers within the shortest time possible.\n\nBMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA)\n\nBMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. is a 50:50 joint venture between the BMW Group and Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd., which was founded in 2003. BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. produces BMW brand models in one engine plant and two automobile plants in Shenyang, China. Production of the BMW iX3* began there in 2020.\n\nThe BMW Group intends to increase its shareholding in BBA from 50% to 75%. The BMW Group already signed an agreement to that effect with its partner Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (CBA) in 2018. Following approval by the Annual General Meeting of CBA, completion of the agreement remains subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nSpotlight\n\nThe aim of Spotlight Automotive Limited (Spotlight), a joint venture between the BMW Group and the Chinese manufacturer Great Wall Motors, is to produce all-electric MINIs for the BMW Group as well as electric vehicles for Great Wall Motors. The joint venture also includes the joint development of battery-powered electric vehicles. Spotlight was established on 27 December 2019, following approval from the Chinese authorities and the first stage of construction has already begun.\n\nTogether with the intention to increase its shareholding in BBA, the BMW Group is significantly expanding its presence in China and underlining its commitment on that market.\n\nHERE\n\nSince BMW AG, Daimler AG and AUDI AG acquired the HERE mapping service in 2015, the partners have been working on high-precision digitalised maps that can be linked to real-time vehicle data. Digitalised maps create the basis for the next generation of location-related services, thereby marking the next key step in the evolution of individual mobility. They also form the basis for developing new assistance systems. As an independent platform, HERE has always remained accessible for the automotive industry as well as other partners. In 2020, Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation of Japan (NTT) jointly acquired 30% of the business. As a result, the location data and technology platform now has nine direct and indirect shareholders: Audi, Bosch, the BMW Group, Continental, Intel, MC, Mercedes-Benz, NTT and Pioneer.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (TMC)\n\nAs strong, independent companies, the BMW Group and TMC have been collaborating successfully in various fields since 2011, including fuel cell technology. The BMW Group was primarily responsible for developing a joint sports car platform, and series production of these brand-specific vehicles has been ongoing since the end of 2018.\n\nIONITY\n\nThe BMW Group is a founding partner of the IONITY joint venture, the aim of which is to establish a comprehensive, high-performance, high-power charging (HPC) network for electric vehicles. The joint venture represents a vital step towards ensuring that electric mobility also becomes a viable means of transport over long distances, thus establishing it on the market. All IONITY charging points are publicly accessible, brand-independent and designed in accordance with the European Combined Charging System (CCS) standard. The founding partners (the BMW Group, Daimler AG, the Ford Motor Company as well as the Volkswagen Group with Audi and Porsche) all participated in equal measure. In 2019, the Hyundai Motor Group with its Hyundai and Kia brands was accepted as an additional shareholder. The joint venture is, however, also open to further partners.\n\nYOUR NOW\n\nUnder the name YOUR NOW, the BMW Group and Daimler AG are offering innovative, customer-friendly solutions for business partners, cities and municipalities looking to make their mobility more efficient and sustainable. The cooperation includes the joint ventures FREE NOW (ride-sharing services) with REACH NOW (on-demand mobility and multimodality), PARK NOW (parking) with CHARGE NOW (charging) and SHARE NOW (car sharing). Further information is available in the chapter Mobility Patterns.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\n## BMW GROUP PERFORMANCE INDICATORS RELATING TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES\n\n|                                | 2020 | 2019 | Change in %-pts. |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|------------------|\n| Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues | 5.7  | 5.7  | 0.0              |\n| Research and development expenditure ratio\u00b9 | 6.3  | 6.2  | 0.1              |\n| Capitalisation rate\u00b2           | 36.6 | 33.2 | 3.4              |\n\n|                                | 2020 | 2019 | Change in % |\n|--------------------------------|------|------|-------------|\n| Research and development expenses | 5,689 | 5,952 | \u2013 4.4       |\n| New expenditure for capitalised development costs | 2,300 | 2,134 | 7.8         |\n| Amortisation                    | \u20131,710 | \u20131,667 | 2.6         |\n| Research and development expenditure\u00b3 | 6,279 | 6,419 | \u2013 2.2       |\n\n\u00b9 Research and development expenditure as a percentage of Group revenues.\n\u00b2 Capitalised development costs as a percentage of research and development expenditure.\n\u00b3 Research and development expenditure comprises the sum of research and non-capitalised development cost and capitalised development cost (not including the associated scheduled amortisation).\nWe aim to reduce the CO\u2082 EMISSIONS of our European new vehicle fleet BY HALF between 1995 and 2020.\nMission accomplished. MINUS 53 %.\n\u201cOur ambition: to provide the best premium customer experience in the industry.\n\nPremium is also defined in terms of sustainability.\n\nThat\u2019s why we support our customers in making not only the best, but also the most responsible vehicle choice \u2013 including a seamlessly integrated, convenient charging concept for our electric vehicles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the BMW Group, we are creating the digital, emission-free and dynamic driving of the future.\n\nAs a tech company, we master \u2018sheer driving pleasure\u2019, today and tomorrow.\n\nWe are the only ones to combine dynamic performance and quality with safety and security for customers and data.\u201d\n\nFrank Weber\nMember of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development\nWHY ARE THE CO\u2082 EMISSIONS OF THE NEW VEHICLE FLEET IN EUROPE THE BENCHMARK?\n\nThe EU requirements are among the strictest and most ambitious worldwide. Think of it this way: Once you\u2019ve met European requirements, it\u2019s a lot easier to fulfil those in other markets and regions. Aside from that, Europe is also our biggest sales region.\n\nHOW DID THE BMW GROUP MEET THE TARGETS FOR 2020?\n\nWe made the right decisions \u2013 important decisions \u2013 early on: We offer electrified vehicles in every segment \u2013 while continuing to make our conventional drive trains more efficient. We ultimately over-fulfilled the targets for 2020. And that\u2019s a good thing, because we\u2019re not interested in the goals themselves \u2013 it\u2019s about contributing to environmental responsibility.\n\nCAN YOU GIVE US A GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE?\n\nWe are right on track for the targets for 2021, but the goals for 2030 are a whole other dimension. I know that our product portfolio puts us in a very good position. But the conditions also have to be right \u2013 and that means significantly expanding charging infrastructure.\n\nChristian Miedaner is responsible for CO\u2082 strategy during the product use phase.\n\nFurther information is available at: report.bmwgroup.com\nDESIGN AND PRODUCT SAFETY\n\nBMW Group vehicles combine emotional and functional design with the highest of safety standards. Active and passive safety systems ensure greater safety on the road \u2013 not only for BMW Group customers, but for all other road users, too. When manufacturing its products, the BMW Group avoids the use of any substances that are hazardous to health. It also informs its customers about all the various safety aspects of its products and enables them to recognise and handle dangerous situations by providing driver safety training. The BMW Group ensures transparency, informational self-determination and data security when using its customers\u2019 data.\n\nFUTURE-ORIENTED DESIGN\n\nThe BMW Group is synonymous with future-oriented, emotional vehicle design that unites aesthetics with state-of-the-art technology. It strives to create experiences for its customers through the design of its vehicles. A successful design makes vehicles coveted products that cater to the individual needs of customers the world over. The BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad brands each have their own independent design language. Designs created by the BMW Group should not only meet the high design standards of a globally leading premium automotive manufacturer, but make technical innovations functional and intuitive to use at the same time.\n\nIn order to make future mobility trends perceptible at the earliest stage of design, the BMW Group develops various types of prototypes. Concept vehicles, such as the BMW Concept i4, which was first presented in March 2020, are specifically used to communicate in advance how future series-produced vehicles will look. Vision vehicles such as the MINI Vision Urbanaut, which was unveiled at the BMW Group #NEXTGen event in November 2020, provide the public with a glimpse of how the Group\u2019s future mobility concepts could be designed.\n\nUSING SAFETY TECHNOLOGY TO MINIMISE RISKS\n\nThe BMW Group not only strives to create an emotional connection between products and its customers via its design, it also designs and builds its vehicles to meet the highest safety standards, as it considers the safety of its vehicles an essential part of its product responsibility.\n\nBy including a raft of active and passive safety measures, the BMW Group is able to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries not only for vehicle occupants, but for other road users, too. Above all, these safety measures include optimised chassis tuning, highly effective braking systems, stable passenger compartments and airbags, but also digital driver assistance systems such as active cruise control, collision warning, lane guidance and emergency braking assistants.\nREDUCING POLLUTANTS\n\nRight from the design stage of its vehicles, the BMW Group consciously avoids the use of problematic materials and substances and takes active steps to keep emissions within the passenger compartment to a minimum. With this design strategy, the BMW Group seeks to ensure that legal requirements regarding product safety, human health protection and the environment are complied with worldwide for each phase of the product life cycle, including development, use, recycling and disposal. In addition, all BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are equipped with passenger compartment air filters as standard, which filter out pollutants and particles such as dust or pollen from the outside air.\n\nIn 2020, the BMW Group installed passenger compartment filters featuring nanofibre filter technology for the first time, which keep certain microbial particles and allergens as well as ultra-fine particulate matter from entering the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment. Also in 2020, nanofibre filters were installed for the first time in a Rolls-Royce as standard. From 2021, however, the innovative technology will gradually become available for numerous other BMW Group vehicle models.\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ON SAFETY ASPECTS\n\nThe BMW Group provides customers with comprehensive information on the correct use of its products and services. Information on health and safety as well as the proper use of its vehicles is provided in printed form in the integrated owner\u2019s manual and is also available electronically via a smartphone app or online. The information is supplemented by notes and additional background information on services, accessories and vehicle components.\n\nDRIVER TRAINING TO PROMOTE GREATER ROAD SAFETY\n\nThe BMW Group offers training for BMW and MINI brand automobiles as well as BMW motorcycles in over 30 countries. In the BMW and MINI Driving Experience, it raises awareness of potentially dangerous situations and thus also contributes to road safety in general. Despite global restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Driving Experience trained over 70,000 participants worldwide at various international locations in 2020.\n\nDATA PROTECTION IS A KEY TASK\n\nThe BMW Group views data protection as one of the most important tasks of digitalisation. It takes data protection into account at an early stage in the development of its functions and services in order to ensure transparency, informational self-determination and data security for its customers. In order to maintain this high level of data protection in the long term, the BMW Group\u2019s products and services are always developed according to security-by-design principles and continuously tested for security aspects (cybersecurity) throughout their entire life cycle.\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s product responsibility also includes the secure transfer of vehicle data to third parties. For this reason, BMW Group vehicles are not directly connected to the Internet, but communicate directly and exclusively with the BMW ConnectedDrive back-end service via a secure connection in a virtual private network. This precaution minimises the risk of unauthorised third parties gaining access to the vehicle or the driver\u2019s personal data. The point of access to the Internet is controlled via a gateway. The BMW Group considers the provision of vehicle data via a secured back end (extended vehicle approach in accordance with ISO 20078) the best solution for ensuring data security and thus a high level of data protection.\nIn May 2017, the BMW Group introduced BMW and MINI CarData for the secure transmission of data to third parties. CarData is already available to BMW and MINI customers across all European markets. Customers can adjust their privacy settings to suit their own personal needs, either within their vehicles or on the ConnectedDrive portal, thereby retaining their right to informational self-determination. They can decide at any time which data to share with service providers (such as workshops, insurance companies and fleet managers) in order to receive customised service offers. The BMW Group has also been offering this service in the USA since April 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the Group works closely with the relevant data protection supervisory authorities to clarify fundamental data protection issues that relate to the increasing connectedness of its vehicles with the environment. For example, as a member of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) and the European Association of the Automotive Industry (ACEA), the BMW Group supports the principles on data protection they have drawn up. These principles focus on transparency, the informational self-determination of customers and the technical protection of data in their vehicles.\n\nENSURING SAFETY WITH QUALITY MANAGEMENT\n\nAll BMW Group vehicles are subject to stringent safety tests during development and production, some of which are even stricter than those prescribed by law. The BMW Group\u2019s quality management does not end at the factory gate, but also extends to vehicles that customers are already using. If any deviations from the Group\u2019s strict quality standards are observed in their markets, it systematically follows up on these indications. If necessary, the Group informs the relevant authorities without delay and initiates any measures that may be required.\n\nThe BMW Group take voluntary technical action even if there is no immediate danger. Any vehicles potentially affected are checked, and if a fault is detected the corresponding components are replaced. If there is a safety risk of any kind, the BMW Group implements technical measures in collaboration with the relevant authorities. For this reason, the Group has established appropriate committees, processes and organisations that are managed by the Product Support, Technical Actions and Warranty Costs department. GRI 416-1\n\nCONTINUOUS FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF SAFETY SYSTEMS\n\nBy systematically developing and improving its safety systems, the BMW Group is helping to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries for all road users. An important indicator of this risk is the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP), a scheme for assessing the safety of vehicles in the event of a crash. The results of the most recently assessed vehicles (four top Euro NCAP ratings for the BMW 1 Series, BMW 2 Series Gran Coup\u00e9, BMW 3 Series and BMW Z4) once again demonstrate the BMW Group\u2019s premium standards in terms of vehicle safety.\n\nIn the years to come, the BMW Group will continue working to additionally enhance the safety of its vehicles. Apart from constantly optimising the passive safety of each individual vehicle, the Group is also focusing on improving road safety standards by means of connected and automated driving. This applies, for example, to the BMW iX*, which was unveiled during the year under report and will go into series production in 2021. With its even more efficient sensor technology, the vehicle will be equipped with new and improved automated driving and parking functions and set new standards for the BMW Group. GRI 416-1\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nCARBON EMISSIONS AND POLLUTANTS\n\nThe fight against climate change is crucial for the future of our society \u2013 and thus also for that of the BMW Group. For this reason, it is placing sustainability in the centre of its corporate strategy. In future, the BMW Group intends to be even more systematic in examining not only the economic, but also the ecological and social impact of its corporate decisions. The Group has therefore also committed to the requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement that are relevant to it and set itself the target of establishing a climate-neutral business model across its entire value chain by the year 2050.\n\nIn 2020, the BMW Group undercut the EU\u2019s manufacturer-specific fleet carbon emissions limit of 104 g/km by achieving a figure of 99 g/km according to internal calculations. At the same time, it also accomplished the goal it set itself in 2012 of halving the carbon emissions generated by its European new vehicle fleet by 2020 compared with 1995. Furthermore, the BMW Group will continue to work successfully on constantly reducing its carbon emissions going forward. The BMW Group aims to provide its customers with the best offers worldwide, also in terms of sustainability. For this reason, the BMW Group\u2019s drivetrain technology is based on two factors \u2013 highly efficient combustion engines and electric mobility.\n\nNEW TARGETS FOR DECARBONISATION BY 2030\n\nThe BMW Group is committed to achieving long-term carbon neutrality by 2050. Guided by this principle, it is taking extensive measures to substantially reduce the carbon and other pollutant emissions generated by its vehicles, as it has done in the past. In the year under report, the BMW Group therefore set itself specific new targets derived from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) in order to further cut its carbon emissions below the level already achieved and is taking a holistic approach to accomplishing this aim. In this context, the Group intends to achieve a mitigation corridor across all the activities for which it is responsible that corresponds to the defined target set out in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, i.e. to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 1.75 degrees Celsius. Within the value chain, this includes all three scopes defined under the umbrella of the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI). By 2030, the BMW Group therefore intends to reduce the average carbon emissions generated by its new car fleet in the use phase by 40% compared to 2019 (Scope 3 downstream). Furthermore, the BMW Group is scrutinising its entire value chain and striving to significantly reduce carbon emissions from the supply chain (Scope 3 upstream), its production processes (Scope 1 and 2) and the entire use phase. These targets have been notified to the SBTI and validated.\n\nFLEET CARBON EMISSIONS FURTHER REDUCED\n\nThe development of sustainable products and services has long been an integral part of the BMW Group\u2019s business model. The early fleet-wide use of Efficient Dynamics technologies (since 2007) and the electrification of vehicles (since 2013) are continuously reducing carbon emissions in the long term. These twin factors form the basis for complying with and even undercutting legally prescribed carbon emissions and fuel consumption limits.\nTaking all regulatory requirements\u00b9 into account, the average carbon emissions generated by the BMW Group\u2019s new car fleet within the EU (including Norway and Iceland) according to the NEDC\u00b2 in the year under report amounted to 99 g CO\u2082/km\u00b3. The BMW Group therefore reduced its fleet carbon emissions by 28 g CO\u2082/km compared to the previous year (2019: 127 g CO\u2082/km), approximately 5 g CO\u2082/km below the limit of 104 g CO\u2082/km applicable to the BMW Group. Between 1995 and 2020, the Group\u2019s carbon emissions were reduced by around 53 %. This success was achieved through the consistent electrification of the vehicle fleet and the continuous improvement in the efficiency of combustion engines.\n\nWorldwide, the BMW Group reduced its fleet average carbon emissions by 5 % compared to the previous year to 133 g CO\u2082/km\u00b2 in 2020 (simplified internal BMW Group calculation for its core markets EU, USA, China, Japan and Korea) (2019: 140 g CO\u2082/km).\n\n\u00b9 Flexibilities as defined in regulatory requirements: phase-in with 5 g/km, supercredits BEV/PHEV with 7.5 g/km and eco-innovations with 2.4 g/km.\n\u00b2 Since 2018, all vehicles in the EU must be licensed according to the new WLTP test cycle. However, the EU Commission will not start using WLTP to calculate fleet CO\u2082 emissions until 2021. As a result, WLTP fleet emissions must be retroactively calculated as NEDC values for the purposes of reporting until and in 2020.\n\u00b3 This is a preliminary internal calculation with a potential tolerance of +/- 0.5 g CO\u2082/km, as official registration figures have not been provided by all EU states. The EU Commission is not expected to publish official figures until November 2021.\nIn the USA, the average fleet emissions\u00b9 for the model year (MY) 2020 amounted to 156 g CO\u2082/km for passenger cars (MY 2019: 157 g CO\u2082/km) and 186 g CO\u2082/km for light trucks (MY 2019: 188 g CO\u2082/km). Fleet-weighted CO\u2082 emissions in the USA averaged 167 g CO\u2082/km (MY 2019: 167 g CO\u2082/km \u2013 BMW internal calculation).\n\nIn China, average carbon emissions\u00b2 rose slightly to 151 g CO\u2082/km (2019: 144 g CO\u2082/km). This is due to lower sales of electrified models in China, while overall sales are increasing.  \n\n**RANGE OF ELECTRIFIED VEHICLES FURTHER EXPANDED**\n\nThe BMW Group sees wide-ranging opportunities to further reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions in the electrification of power trains. This point is particularly relevant against the backdrop of global decarbonisation targets, for example in the EU, China or the USA (particularly California), and the sustainability targets the BMW Group has set itself for 2030. For this reason, the BMW Group again expanded its range of electrified vehicles during the 2020 reporting year. By 2030, the Group plans to have delivered at least seven million electrified vehicles to its customers.  \n\n**CONVENTIONAL DRIVETRAINS MORE EFFICIENT AND WITH LOWER EMISSIONS**\n\nThe BMW Group continues to work intensively on reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions in its conventionally powered vehicles. Since 2007, the BMW Group has been implementing its Efficient Dynamics package of technological measures throughout the fleet, comprising various coordinated measures to reduce fuel consumption. In this context, the Group continued to optimise the efficiency of its combustion engines throughout the year under report by deploying recuperation systems and continuous emissions reduction measures. Recuperation systems utilise the energy recovered from the braking process to supply the vehicle\u2019s electrical system and generate additional power for the drivetrain. For this reason they are often referred to as mild hybrid vehicles.  \n\nSince the early 1990s, the BMW Group has managed to significantly reduce the pollutant emissions generated by its vehicles by deploying new technologies and making improvements to existing ones. In Europe alone, it has reduced the relevant exhaust emissions of the new vehicle fleets for diesel passenger cars in accordance with the threshold values of the standards Euro 1 to Euro 6 from 1992 to 2019 by well over 90% compared to the level recorded prior to the introduction of the Euro emissions standards.  \n\nThe introduction of new models with even lower-emissions drivetrain technologies has made a significant contribution to this result. In the year under report, the BMW Group also converted all its remaining models to the Euro 6d emissions standard.  \n\nThe BMW Group expects modern, highly efficient diesel engines to continue playing an important role. As part of its Efficient Dynamics approach, the BMW Group will therefore continue to work on reducing the consumption of conventional drivetrain systems and boosting their efficiency in the foreseeable future. It intends to continue along this route, taking innovative approaches to the combustion engine, aerodynamics and lightweight design. The use of 48-volt technology is another key component in the BMW Group\u2019s efforts to reduce its carbon emissions.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can also contribute to cutting carbon emissions and vehicle fuel consumption. The BMW Group is conducting research into how AI could make energy management in vehicles adaptive, enabling energy consumption to be modified to suit the needs of the driver and further improve energy efficiency.\n\nNitrogen oxide levels are a crucial factor for the air quality in towns and cities. With this point in mind, since mid-2018 the BMW Group has installed a highly effective combination of an NOx storage catalytic converter (NSC) and an SCR system (SCR: selective catalytic reduction) with urea injection technology (AdBlue) in all BMW diesel models as well as in the larger MINI diesels. As part of its continuous further development strategy, the BMW Group has additionally improved the efficiency of its exhaust gas after-treatment technology by utilising an oxidation catalytic converter in conjunction with two SCR catalytic converters. In 2020, this new technique was launched and rolled out across the Group\u2019s product portfolio together with the revised generation of its diesel engines.  \n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Basis: USC (United States Combined).\n\u00b2 Basis: NEDC (New European Driving Cycle).\nWith the aim of spreading these innovations for improving air quality as swiftly as possible, the BMW Group offered a scrappage bonus in Germany in 2020. The move was intended to rejuvenate the passenger car fleet and thus contribute quickly and effectively to reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. In 2019 and 2020, there were already first signs of a noticeable reduction in NOx pollution in German cities, partially due to the progressive renewal of the fleets of all automotive manufacturers. GRI 416-2\n\nSUCCESSFUL REDUCTION SURPASSES LEGAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe BMW Group has the clear ambition to meet statutory carbon emissions requirements. Within the EU, the Group succeeded in improving on fleet carbon targets during the year under report. With respect to fleet carbon limits in other regulated markets, the BMW Group is also explicitly aiming to comply with the limits and keep its emissions as far below them as possible, which it again succeeded in doing in the year under report.\n\nThe BMW Group supports the development of harmonised national regulations, also on an international basis to the extent possible. Comparable regulations in major markets create reliable, predictable framework conditions that make a key contribution to combating climate change and improving air quality. In view of its commitment to complying with the climate goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement, during the year under report the BMW Group entered into a voluntary agreement with the US State of California to reduce fleet emissions over and above national requirements. The matters agreed therein are valid for every state in the USA \u2013 one of the BMW Group\u2019s largest sales markets. The commitments made enhance the Group\u2019s long-term planning security in the face of political change and are in line with increasingly stringent legislation worldwide designed to reduce vehicle emissions. In view of the growing popularity of electric mobility, for example, the BMW Group sees the rapid expansion and technical harmonisation of charging infrastructure as an urgent requirement. In the USA and Europe in particular, the slow pace of infrastructural expansion is still holding back the spread of electric mobility.\n\nMANAGEMENT OVER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE\n\nIn order to meet market-specific fleet requirements and its own even more ambitious decarbonisation targets, the BMW Group is taking an holistic approach to reducing emissions throughout the entire life cycle of its vehicles. This approach is particularly relevant, as \u2013 despite the expansion of electric mobility having an overall positive impact on carbon emissions in the use phase \u2013 emissions levels in the supply chain are increasing due to the use of more carbon-intensive components, especially those installed in high-voltage battery systems. For this reason, right from the product development stage of new vehicle projects, the BMW Group has defined specific targets for reducing carbon emissions across the entire life cycle. The strategy applies equally to the vehicle development, the supply chain, production, the use phase, and finally recycling at the end-of-life phase.\n\nWith this approach of taking the entire vehicle life cycle into account, the BMW Group intends to realise its ambition of achieving substantial improvement from one vehicle generation to the next. The Group implements its targets and assesses its progress during the development process based on a carbon footprint in accordance with the ISO 14040/44 standard.\nELECTRIC MOBILITY\n\nElectric mobility is one of the key topics of the future when it comes to making road travel sustainable and a more pleasant experience. In recent years, the BMW Group has significantly expanded its range of electrified vehicles and related services. It therefore sees itself as one of the leading providers of premium electric mobility, measured on the basis of its cumulative sales volume figures between 2013 and 2020 and in light of the holistic approach it is taking.\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s electrified vehicles combine the advantages of sustainable mobility with dynamic drive-train behaviour. Fully electric battery-powered models (BEVs) generate zero local emissions and can significantly reduce traffic noise levels in towns and cities.\n\nAMBITIOUS TARGETS FOR EXPANDING ELECTRIC MOBILITY\n\nThe BMW Group is pursuing the goal of substantially further decarbonising its vehicles and thereby achieving a worldwide reduction in carbon emissions in the use phase (Scope 3 downstream in accordance with SBTI Carbon Emissions and Pollutants and Paris Climate Agreement targets. A key part of its product strategy is therefore to systematically continue electrifying its model range. The BMW Group has set itself ambitious targets: by 2025, the proportion of electrified vehicles in its total deliveries is to rise to at least 25%. By 2030, the BMW Group plans to have delivered at least seven million electrified vehicles.\n\nTo ensure that it achieves its sales volume targets for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, the BMW Group plans to more than double its sales of electrified vehicles by the end of 2021 compared with 2019 figures (2019: 146,158 units). Based on its existing plans, the BMW Group will have 25 electrified models on the road by 2023.\n\nPRODUCT OFFERING EXPANDED AND SALES VOLUME INCREASED\n\nThe BMW Group is consciously focusing on battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrid technology (PHEV), enabling customers to select the form of drive-train that best suits their respective mobility needs. In order to serve regionally varying customer requirements, the BMW Group assembles a variety of drivetrain technologies on the same production line.\n\nDuring the year under report, the BMW Group launched further models with hybrid drivetrains: the BMW X1 xDrive25e, X2 xDrive25e, X3 xDrive 30e, 330e Touring, 330e xDrive Sedan, 330e xDrive Touring, 530e Sedan, 530e Touring, 530e xDrive Sedan, 530e xDrive Touring and 545e xDrive Sedan. These were joined by two additional all-electric models, the MINI Cooper SE and the BMW iX3, which has been available in Europe since the end of January 2021. The BMW iX3 is already equipped with the technology of the fifth, and thus latest, generation of BMW Group battery cells.\n\n1 See Glossary.\n2 Retail vehicle delivery data presented for 2020 is not directly comparable to such data presented for previous years. For further information on retail vehicle delivery data, please see Comparison of Forecast with Actual Outcomes.\n3 See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nIn November 2020, the Group presented the BMW iX\u00b9, featuring new electric drivetrain technology, substantially enhanced connectivity and innovative interior design. The BMW iX\u00b9 also features a range of over 600 km (WLTP) and shorter charging times. The vehicle can be charged for a range of over 120 km in roughly ten minutes.\n\nIn 2020, the BMW Group delivered 192,662 electrified vehicles (2019: 146,158 units\u00b2). Further information is available in the \u201cAutomotive segment\u201d section of the Business Report.\n\nRANGE INCREASED TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS\n\nTo enable customers to cover as much of their daily driving as possible emissions-free, the BMW Group is systematically increasing the electric range of its plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery-powered electric vehicles (BEV) by introducing new technologies. Hence, for PHEVs, the Group has increased the range of the BMW X5 PHEV\u00b9 from 31 km (2015: NEDC data) to 80 km\u00b3, the BMW 530e PHEV\u00b9 from 45 km (2017: NEDC data) to 60 km\u00b3 and the BMW 330e PHEV\u00b9 from 40 km (2016: NEDC data) to 60 km\u00b3. In the BEV segment, the range of the BMW i3 BEV\u00b9 increased from 300 km (2016: NEDC data) to 359 km\u00b3.\n\nTo further increase the range of its electrified vehicles, the BMW Group is improving both the energy density and the efficiency of its battery cells. For example, the high-voltage battery in the BMW iX3\u00b9 has a 20% higher energy density and the power density of the electric motor has also been increased by 30%.\n\nAs a matter of principle, the BMW Group takes a differentiated view to increasing the electric range and does not necessarily consider it expedient to aim for a maximum range for all electrified vehicles, and is rather of the opinion that it makes more sense to offer customers tailor-made solutions by producing a fleet of vehicles with varying ranges. Resource use and resource efficiency \u2013 advantages that also benefit the customer.\n\nFURTHER INVESTMENTS IN ELECTRIFICATION\n\nThe BMW Group invests on an ongoing basis in the planning and development of new vehicle models. The figure of 25 electrified models previous targeted to be on the roads by 2025 has now been brought forward to 2023.\n\nAround half of the 25 models will be offered as all-electric versions. The BMW Group also intends to offer its high-volume models as purely battery-powered versions. From today\u2019s perspective, the European Union\u2019s target of attaining climate neutrality by 2050, the interim targets discussed in the context of the Green Deal and the similarly ambitious climate policy targets of other countries can only be achieved with a variety of parallel technologies if customers are to continue being offered a range of mobility options that meet their specific and differing needs going forward. Even today, from a global viewpoint there are driving profiles that cannot yet be covered by an all-electric vehicle due to physical or technical restrictions or insufficient access to a viable charging infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\n\u00b2 Retail vehicle delivery data presented for 2020 is not directly comparable to such data presented for previous years. For further information on retail vehicle delivery data, please see Comparison of Forecast with Actual Outcomes.\n\u00b3 The range has already been determined in accordance with the new WLTP test cycle (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure) and recalculated to NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) for comparability. The actual range depends on various factors, including personal driving style, route characteristics, the outside temperature, heating, air conditioning, preheating and precooling. Provisional figure.\nPHEVs and highly efficient internal combustion engines are therefore a more likely choice in this environment. For these reasons, the BMW X3* is the first model series to be available in two variants, firstly with a combustion engine and secondly as a plug-in hybrid version, thanks to the BMW Group\u2019s scalable, modular construction system. The BMW iX3* is also available with its all-electric drivetrain.\n\nQuite apart from battery-powered electric drivetrain systems, the BMW Group also continues to see the potential of fuel cells, a technology embedded in the hydrogen strategy of various countries. The Group is planning to produce a small series of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT from 2022. Moreover, as an associated partner of H2 Mobility Deutschland GmbH, the BMW Group is interested in establishing the infrastructure required for hydrogen-powered vehicles.\n\nACHIEVING SUSTAINABILITY OVER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE\n\nThe BMW Group considers both decarbonisation targets and market-specific fleet requirements right from the product development stage. In doing so, it defines specific targets that ensure well-balanced optimisation over the entire life cycle.\n\nWith its project i, the BMW Group was among the first manufacturers to pursue the aim of reducing carbon and other pollutant emissions as well as the use of critical materials over the entire life cycle of its vehicles right from the very beginning. With the fifth generation of BMW eDrive, the Group reached an important milestone during the year under report. A special feature of the electric motor, which is being installed in the BMW iX3* for the first time (eDrive Gen5), has been designed so that it no longer requires the use of rare earth elements. For the fifth generation of its high-voltage storage system, the BMW Group obtains any critical raw materials it requires from sources outside the known conflict regions. Cobalt that is bought in directly by BMW Group and made available to suppliers is sourced from Morocco and Australia. The lithium used is also from Australia, where it is extracted by means of the so-called hard rock mining process. In addition, the BMW Group has successfully reduced the amount of cobalt required per kWh by two-thirds through the further chemical development of its battery cells.\n\nThe use of renewable energy in production processes \u2013 for example in the manufacture of energy-intensive materials such as carbon fibre reinforced plastic \u2013 or the choice of green electricity in the use phase \u2013 also help reduce the carbon footprint of the BMW Group\u2019s vehicles. Further information on how efficiently and therefore economically and sparingly the BMW Group uses resources in its production processes is provided in the section Resource Consumption and Resource Efficiency.\n\nThe BMW Group has entered into a contractual agreement with its battery cell manufacturers to ensure that they only use green electricity when producing the fifth generation of battery cells. In a joint technology consortium with battery manufacturer Northvolt, the Group also plans to configure the value chain for battery cells in Europe with sustainability as its top priority.\n\nOther approaches to handling resources in a responsible, sustainable manner include the reuse of batteries, such as in stationary storage systems with the aim of improving the use of renewable energy and promoting recycling. In collaboration with the recycling specialist Duesenfeld, for example, the BMW Group has developed the prototype of a process that enables 96% of the material from battery cells to be recovered for recycling. Furthermore, the option exists for all customers whose vehicle contains a high-voltage battery for the BMW Group to take the battery back free of charge. This also applies to regions where there is no legal obligation to do so.\n\nThe BMW Group manages the implementation of its targets and assesses progress in vehicle development via its Life Cycle Assessment in accordance with the ISO 14040/44 standard. The Group utilises these assessments to record the environmental impacts occurring over the life cycle of a vehicle right from the development stage and make comparisons with predecessor models. However, the BMW Group\u2019s approach goes one step further: it breaks down the targets by product and then implements the appropriate measures. These include, for example, the use of green electricity for energy-intensive processes in the supply chain or in production as well as the use of recycled materials such as aluminium or plastics instead of deploying primary resources.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nThe BMW Group aims to ensure that electric and electrified vehicles make an effective contribution to climate protection not only in the use phase, but also in their overall footprint, including the supply chain. As an example, the environmental report of the BMW iX3* indicates that the greenhouse gas potential values of an all-electric vehicle are around 30% lower than those of a conventional reference vehicle with a diesel drivetrain when the calculation is based on standard consumption and the European electricity mix. Furthermore, when the electricity used for charging is generated from renewable energy sources, the emissions values are around 60% lower.\n\n**Competence centre for battery cells**\n\nIn 2019, the BMW Group began pooling its wealth of experience and comprehensive knowledge of battery cell technology in a new competence centre based in Munich. With this strategy, the Group is pursuing the twin aims of further improving its battery cell technology and fully penetrating production processes. Based on the battery technology currently in use, the BMW Group intends to substantially increase the potential range of its electrified vehicles by 2030 by continuing to develop its battery cells, modules and systems. Looking to the future, the focus will be even more on cutting battery system costs in order to make electric mobility more profitable.\n\nThe competence centre replicates the entire value chain of battery cell technology, from research and development to the structure and the design of the battery cell to the production of the first prototypes. It takes the complete life cycle of a battery cell into account, from purchasing the raw materials to recycling. Particularly in view of the high-voltage batteries needed to power electrified vehicles, which can entail the use of critical raw materials, the circular economy has a decisive role to play. \n\n**EXPANDING THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENABLING FASTER CHARGING**\n\nA comprehensive charging infrastructure is a prerequisite for the rapid, widespread deployment of electric mobility. In order to promote this project, between 2015 and 2020 the BMW Group committed itself to improving the charging infrastructure in a total of over 50 projects and has initiated the installation of some 15,000 operational charging points. The BMW Group plans to install a total of 4,100 charging points at BMW Group properties in Germany by the end of 2021. Half of these charging points will be made accessible for public use. Together with other car manufacturers, charging station providers, charging service providers and energy suppliers, the BMW Group is working on simplifying not only access to charging stations, but also the charging process itself.\n\nAt European level, in close collaboration with the IONITY joint venture, the BMW Group is in the process of building a high-performance fast-charging network comprising some 400 charging stations along major transport routes by 2021. Fast-charging stations make charging up to seven times faster than standard 50 kW stations. Originally planned for completion by 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic and the lack of approvals, the BMW Group and its partners were compelled to postpone the construction of certain stations until 2021. To date, 325 of the 400 planned IONITY fast-charging stations have been installed and a further 44 are currently under construction. At powerful and increasingly widespread DC fast-charging points with outputs of at least 150 kW, the BMW iX3* can be charged to achieve a range of over 100 km (WLTP) in around ten minutes.\n\nThe BMW Group intends to offer electric mobility to both private customers and companies operating entire fleets and is additionally expanding the BMW Charging product and service portfolio for trendsetting charging solutions at home, on the road and at the workplace. Charging infrastructure for both private and commercial purposes is a key prerequisite for the further expansion of electric mobility. The BMW Group welcomes the support provided by government premiums, as charging options both at home and at the workplace make a key contribution to the overall infrastructure from the point of view of customers.\n\n**GREEN ELECTRICITY FOR E-MOBILITY**\n\nDuring the year under report, the BMW Group continued to pursue and expand its approaches to the holistic ecological optimisation of electric mobility both at home and on the road. In addition to BMW Charging and MINI Charging, the Group already offers electricity from renewable sources as well as attractive solar power packages for homes in both Germany and Austria. As part of its strategic investment in the IONITY joint venture, the BMW Group is preparing to broaden its range of services to enter other markets as well as the field of public charging.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nIMPROVING POLITICAL CONDITIONS\n\nIn the BMW Group\u2019s view, there is still a need for political support for electric mobility in many countries and cities. In the EU, for example, market research points to the close correlation between the density of charging infrastructure and the sale of electrified vehicles. This correlation applies not only at member state level, but also in a regional comparison. The BMW Group is therefore seeking dialogue with policymakers to call for measures to be taken to improve consistency on both the supply and the demand sides. In concrete terms, the aim is to improve framework conditions with the aim of stimulating demand for electrified vehicles not only nationally, but also at local level. The focus here is on increasing the number of public charging points and offering usage incentives in everyday life, such as parking spaces reserved for electric vehicles or discounts on parking fees. In Germany, for example, only a few cities have so far taken advantage of the funding opportunities offered by the Electric Mobility Act.\n\nTo advocate for improved conditions, the BMW Group is involved, for example, in the National Platform for the Future of Mobility (NFM), in the European initiative EIT Urban Mobility and within the framework of the World Economic Forum. Furthermore, the BMW Group is in dialogue with think tanks such as Agora Verkehrswende and is a member of the International Consultative Committee of China EV 100 as well as at VELOZ, a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting electric mobility in the US state of California.\n\nMOBILITY PATTERNS\n\nThe BMW Group wants to make mobility more sustainable and more convenient to use. In recent years, numerous urban mobility offers have been developed and introduced in cooperation with selected towns and cities. The BMW Group therefore sees its 2020 target of providing sustainable support for changing mobility behaviour by offering integrated mobility services in selected metropolitan regions as having been met.\n\nMoreover, the Group continues to work together with its subsidiaries and in dialogue with the respective cities to find solutions to the increasing density of road traffic and the corresponding rise in noise levels, air pollution and land use. The BMW Group is also meeting these challenges by developing connected vehicles. In view of the growing trend towards vehicle electrification, the Group is therefore making a significant contribution in particular to providing eco-friendlier modes of transport as well as promoting the better use of space in urban areas.\n\nMAKING URBAN MOBILITY SUSTAINABLE WITH SERVICES\n\nThe BMW Group is currently working together with three German cities to improve the traffic situation and explore new mobility solutions. The New Mobility Berlin project aims to improve the quality of life within the city. For this reason, the BMW Group is developing tailor-made multimodal solutions, i.e. approaches that incorporate the entire range of transport modes. In selected districts of the city, via its subsidiaries, the BMW Group offers shared fleets of rental cars and e-scooters as an alternative to privately used vehicles. The strategy is intended to encourage better use of the road space occupied by rarely used private vehicles for other purposes going forward.\n\nAt the same time, the BMW Group has reached agreements with the cities of Munich and Hamburg, where it has carried out the first pilot projects for making city centres more pleasant to live in. Specific examples of the development of new, sustainable mobility options include the City2Share research project, which focuses on measures to reduce traffic in project districts in Munich and Hamburg, and the \u201cumparken Schwabing-West\u201d project, in which the BMW Group is working to transform public space and enable it to be used more appropriately by offering mobility packages for local residents.\n\nThe BMW Group is also involved in various urban platforms via which municipalities exchange information and collaborate on projects, including the Urban Mobility Platform in Germany and the international EIT Urban Mobility Platform of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.\nVia its subsidiaries, the BMW Group promotes innovative service offerings in the fields of car sharing, driving services, parking and vehicle charging as well as multimodal transport. In 2019, the BMW Group therefore merged its own mobility services in a joint venture with those of Daimler Mobility Services GmbH to create the YOUR NOW service. The common goal of the two companies is to expand the use of on-demand mobility and offer new solutions for cities and municipalities looking to make road use more efficient and sustainable. In this context, the market development and the political-regulatory framework conditions in the cities are continuously being examined and the range of services further developed in collaboration with strategic partners.\n\nThe BMW Group has expanded its car-sharing service offering (SHARE NOW) to include a long-term rental of up to 30 days. It also continued to develop FREE NOW into a multimodal mobility platform by adding e-bikes and e-scooters. In 2020, FREE NOW had 46 million registered customers and offers ride services in 17 countries and 153 cities. In the year under report, around 2.9 million customers used the SHARE NOW car-sharing services, which are available in 16 cities and eight countries. The car-sharing fleet currently comprises around 9,500 vehicles, almost one-quarter of which are electrically powered. In 2020, the number of trips decreased due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe CHARGE NOW vehicle charging service currently provides access to around 246,000 public charging points operated by various providers in 32 countries. In addition to its CHARGE NOW services, the BMW Group is working with partners in other markets to provide customers with broad access to charging points. The PARK NOW digital parking service enabled around 45 million customers in around 1,200 cities to pay more quickly and easily for parking spaces on a contactless basis. However, PARK NOW\u2019s business performance was also impacted by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.\n\nThe BMW Group and its subsidiaries are working continuously on intelligently interconnecting vehicles, infrastructure and mobility services. The aim here is to make better use of the limited parking space available and reduce traffic congestion. The BMW Group is fully committed to complying with statutory limits for air quality, noise levels and carbon emissions as well as to restoring the quality of life for the residents of urban areas. For these reasons, the BMW Group intends to further intensify its dialogue with towns and cities and make an active contribution to the discussion on more sustainable mobility options as well as tailored traffic management measures. The Group also intends to transfer the results achieved in individual cities to other areas and adapt them on an international basis.\n\nFURTHER DEVELOPING AUTOMATED DRIVING\n\nAutomated functions and digitally connected vehicles can help reduce traffic congestion, minimise the risk of accidents and cut emissions levels. These technologies are therefore making a direct contribution to improving the quality of life in cities, and electric mobility in particular is becoming more and more popular at the same time.\n\nThe latest BMW models are equipped with state-of-the-art driver assistance systems. In 2021, the BMW Group is taking automated driving a decisive step further with the development of the BMW iX*. It will be the first BMW Group vehicle to offer both automated driving and parking functions via a new modular technology system. The BMW Group sees considerable potential in automated driving and will continue to develop this field intensively over the next few years.\n\nEmployee mobility\n\nAs the largest single employer in the Munich metropolitan region, the BMW Group has a special role to play in its hometown location and the surrounding urban areas by actively helping to reduce environmental pollution. The Group is planning to have one of the largest company charging networks in place by mid-2021, thereby helping to increase the popularity of electric mobility and reduce carbon dioxide as well as other pollutant emissions.\n\nThe BMW Group provides incentives for its employees to use public transport, including benefits such as a discounted monthly ticket within the Munich city area. Around 14,000 employees have chosen this option. The Group also operates a long-established shuttle bus service between its locations. It also provides its staff with rental bicycles and scooters for commuting. Last but not least, as a good example, with its BMW LeaseRad offer, the Group is actively supporting the growing number of employees who choose to ride to work by bicycle and also encourages travelling by bicycle and scooter in general.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nThe BMW Group is also leveraging vehicle connectivity with its new eDrive Zones technology, which automatically switches plug-in hybrids to fully electric driving mode when entering an environmental zone. The innovation makes it easier for customers to drive emissions-free to the greatest extent possible. The Group has already introduced this function in over 80 European cities.\n\nThe safety of its automated systems is a top priority for the BMW Group. For that reason, in 2019 it partnered with 11 leading companies in the field of automated driving to produce a Safety First for Automated Driving (SaFAD) white paper that highlights the importance of safety by design in the development of an industry standard for automated driving. The BMW Group sees this white paper as an important step towards defining industry-wide standards from the testing stage to the approval of highly and fully automated driving functions.\n\nSince 2018, BMW assistance systems have been utilising artificial intelligence to anticipate typically dangerous situations such as the swerving of other vehicles in order to react in good time. The BMW Group can further improve the performance of artificial intelligence in this field by analysing anonymised data taken from real-life activities. Therefore, as a founding member of the European Gaia-X project, it is committed to developing standards for organising data and cloud-based measures with the aim of making traffic management more efficient.\n\nIn order to incorporate highly mature new technologies in series production and further raise its level of expertise in the field of automated driving, the BMW Group is building a new development and testing ground in the Czech Republic, which is scheduled for completion in 2022. Complex everyday automated driving conditions can then be tested at the new facility in a realistic but controlled environment.\n\nPREVENTIVELY PROTECTING CUSTOMER DATA\n\nThe protection of data and information within the BMW Group is based on the relevant laws and standards, particularly in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the ISO/IEC 27001 international security standard. The personal data of customers is only collected, processed or utilised to the extent legally permitted and with the consent of the person in question. Any complaints can be reported to the Customer Interaction Centre, the Data Protection Officer or via the SpeakUP Line and will be dealt with promptly.\n\nIn order to protect its digital systems from tampering, the BMW Group systematically searches for possible weak points with a view to closing any potential gaps in good time before approving the respective component. The Group continuously translates any new insights into binding standards. Clear standards regarding data and information protection also apply to any collaborations and partner relationships.\n\nWith BMW CarData, the BMW Group introduced a secure, data-protection-compliant and transparent service for the non-discriminatory sharing of vehicle data, initially in Germany in 2017 and since 2018 across Europe. BMW CarData provides BMW Group customers with complete data sovereignty. Customers can decide independently which of their vehicle data are transmitted to other market participants for a specific purpose. The BMW Group has also been offering this service in the USA since June 2020.\n\nIDENTIFYING POTENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY AT AN EARLY STAGE\n\nThe BMW Group has combined the topics of sustainability and mobility in its corporate strategy. It analyses the opportunities and challenges arising from changes in mobility demand that result from new types of mobility on offer or regulatory framework conditions. The BMW Group then develops premises for its contribution to sustainable mobility on this basis. In corporate departments for both strategy and communication, the Group has established dedicated teams in a global network and provided them with funding to jointly define sustainability goals and monitor the extent to which they are being achieved. The BMW Group views developments in its main markets in a differentiated manner and engages in collaborative research projects in order to understand the changes, impacts and needs of urban mobility behaviour worldwide at an early stage. The Group is also in regular dialogue with its international stakeholders. One of the aims of these established events is to gain a better understanding of people\u2019s mobility needs worldwide and develop new products and services accordingly.\nPRODUCTION, PURCHASING AND SUPPLIER NETWORK\n\nWe aim to reduce CO\u2082 EMISSIONS per vehicle produced.\nSince 2020, the electricity for all BMW Group plants has been sourced from 100% RENEWABLE ENERGIES.\n\u201cOur expertise in integrating new technologies and products into our production system is unique worldwide. Through innovation and digitalisation, we are setting new benchmarks in terms of efficiency and sustainability. This leads into a new era of automotive production: The next level of our BMW Group production system will be lean, green and digital.\u201d\n\n\u201cA company is much more than just the sum of its individual employees. It is about sharing the same goals, working together as partners and taking responsibility beyond one\u2019s own area. This applies to us at the BMW Group, as well as in cooperation with our suppliers.\u201d\nWe know where TECHNOLOGY can still leverage POTENTIAL. That\u2019s why I\u2019m OPTIMISTIC we can reach the high goals we set ourselves.\n\nMR WITSCHNIG, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN PRODUCTION. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?\n\nOur goal is clean production. That means minimising our environmental impact in a targeted manner \u2013 with regard to water, waste, energy, solvents, etc. We have achieved a great deal in recent years \u2013 for instance, reducing the amount of waste by 80%. And all BMW Group plants worldwide have obtained their electricity from renewable energies since 2020.\n\nTHE GOAL IS TO REDUCE CO\u2082 EMISSIONS IN PRODUCTION BY ANOTHER 80% BY 2030. HOW WILL YOU DO THAT?\n\nWe have already achieved a great deal when it comes to energy efficiency and sourcing green power. And we know where technology can still leverage potential. Our next big topic will be gas consumption.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN CO\u2082 EMISSIONS ARE ALSO MEANT TO BE REDUCED BY 2030. MS PEREZ SZMAK, WHY BY ONLY 20%?\n\nWithout corrective measures, expanding electromobility would increase CO\u2082 emissions in the supplier network by at least a third. We don\u2019t just want to stop this increase; we want to reverse it. So, actually, a reduction of at least 20% is a very ambitious goal.\n\nRenewable energies will play a big part in this. A second topic is the reuse of materials \u2013 in other words, a circular economy. The best part is: Our suppliers are fully on board with this.\n\nFurther information is available at: report.bmwgroup.com\nPRODUCTION NETWORK\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s production system is efficient and flexible. It provides customers with a large number of customisation options when choosing their own vehicle. Moreover, during the reporting period the BMW Group\u2019s global production system once again demonstrated its ability to respond to highly volatile market developments, even under the demanding conditions of the 2020 pandemic year.\n\nThe production network leverages innovative technologies from the fields of digitalisation and Industry 4.0, including applications from the worlds of virtual reality, artificial intelligence, smart logistics and 3D printing.\n\nSYSTEMATIC TRANSFORMATION TOWARDS ELECTRIC MOBILITY\n\nThe BMW Group continues to accelerate towards electric mobility and is bolstering its international production network for the increased manufacturing of electrified vehicles. By the end of 2022, every production plant in Germany should have the capacity to produce at least one fully electric vehicle model. The BMW Group\u2019s production system is capable of manufacturing both conventional internal combustion and electrically powered vehicles on a single line, enabling it to respond flexibly to changing customer requirements for various drivetrain systems. In 2020, the Group simultaneously manufactured electrified models at 13 locations in its global production network. By the middle of the current decade it will be deploying a new cluster architecture geared to fully electric drivetrains. Initially, the technology will be launched at the future Debrecen plant in Hungary and then transferred to the global production network in a step-by-step process.\n\nElectrification is also becoming increasingly important in terms of drivetrain production. In the year under report, the BMW Group announced the construction of a pilot plant for the near-series production of battery cell prototypes. The aim is to further optimise the production of battery cells in terms of quality, performance and costs. The Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich already covers the entire value chain in terms of battery cell technology \u2013 from research and development to the structure and design of the battery cell as well as its manufacturability.\n\nThe Group\u2019s Dingolfing plant has assumed a leading role as a competence centre for e-drive systems in the production of electric drivetrain components. It produces battery modules, high-voltage batteries and fifth-generation electric motors for the BMW Group\u2019s electrified vehicles. E-motors are also manufactured at the Landshut plant. Production facilities for battery components and high-voltage batteries are also being established at the Group\u2019s Leipzig and Regensburg sites. Currently, high-voltage batteries are manufactured at three BMW Group plants, i.e. Dingolfing (Germany), Spartanburg (USA) and Shenyang (China). In Thailand, the BMW Group collaborates closely with a partner that manufactures high-voltage batteries for electrified vehicles that are produced locally. By 2024, the production of internal combustion engines in Europe will be concentrated at BMW Group locations in Steyr (Austria) and Hams Hall (UK).\nPRODUCTION SITES IN KEY MARKETS\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s production network comprises 31 locations in 15 countries. The Group aims to strike a balance between production and deliveries in the various regions of the world. 20 of the 31 sites are BMW Group plants.

Its own plants and locations have a direct influence on both carbon emissions levels and resource consumption. The BMW Group has been committed to resource-efficient production at its plants for many years. This includes checking and monitoring the consumption of resources across the BMW Group\u2019s production network. The principle of continuous improvement applies throughout the BMW Group. It invests in efficient technologies and also continually seeks to optimise its existing processes and procedures. This principle has been highly successful, as the Group clearly surpassed its target of reducing resource consumption per vehicle produced by an average of 45% by 2020 compared to 2006, achieving an overall reduction of 56.7%. Apart from continuously reducing energy consumption in general, the BMW Group is now focusing on converting its electricity supply to renewable energy sources. Any remaining production-related emissions that cannot yet be avoided will be offset from 2021 onwards.\n\nNEW PRODUCTION TARGETS UP TO 2030\n\nThe biggest lever for reducing the BMW Group\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions is at its production locations, which account for around 90% of these emissions. The BMW Group has had considerable success in this area and repeatedly set new standards in terms of sustainable production methods. Between 2006 and 2020, carbon emissions per vehicle produced fell by around 78% by continually improving energy efficiency, generating renewable electricity in-house and entering into direct supply contracts for green power (including guarantees of origin). Nevertheless, the BMW Group has already set itself the next target: compared to 2019, these emissions levels are to be reduced by a further 80% per vehicle by 2030. As from 2021, the Group will make the remaining carbon emissions from Scope 1 and Scope 2 completely carbon-neutral by using voluntary offset certificates.\n\nCARBON FOOTPRINT IN PRODUCTION REDUCED AGAIN\n\nCarbon emissions per vehicle produced fell by around 23% to 0.23 t compared with the previous year. The reduction is a result of completely switching the BMW Group\u2019s production network to green electricity generated from renewable sources. The BMW Group also managed to reduce the absolute level of carbon emissions generated by the production network to 486,630 t (2019: 697,025 t).\n\nCO\u2082 EMISSIONS PER VEHICLE PRODUCED\u00b9,\u00b2\n\n| Year | CO\u2082 Emissions (t) |\n|------|-------------------|\n| 2016 | 0.54              |\n| 2017 | 0.41              |\n| 2018 | 0.40              |\n| 2019 | 0.30              |\n| 2020 | 0.23              |\n\n\u00b9 Efficiency indicator calculated from Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO\u2082 emissions (market-based method according to GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.

BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. joint venture, Shenyang/CHN, not including the vehicles from the Magna Steyr and Nedcar contract production plants.\n\n\u00b2 The figures for 2016 to 2018 were examined by the external auditor on the basis of a limited assurance engagement.\nThe absolute volume of carbon emissions fell by 13% to around 66 million tonnes during the year under report. The main drivers were the reduction in fleet carbon emissions worldwide and the lower production volume due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Apart from carbon emissions, further decisive factors are energy and water consumption, the amount of waste sent for disposal and the use of solvents. In recent years, the BMW Group has made a great deal of progress in terms of resource consumption. Between 2006 and 2020, the BMW Group reduced its average resource consumption and emissions generated per vehicle by 56.7%, an improvement of 6.5% year on year. GRI 302-3, 305-4\n\nIMPROVEMENT IN RESOURCE CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS FROM VEHICLE PRODUCTION SINCE 2006\n\nper vehicle produced\n\n| Average of the values | \u2013 56.7 % |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| Energy consumption    | \u2013 38.0 % |\n| CO\u2082 emissions         | \u2013 78.1 % |\n| Water consumption     | \u2013 31.0 % |\n| Process wastewater    | \u2013 42.7 % |\n| Waste for disposal    | \u2013 82.4 % |\n| Solvent emissions     | \u2013 67.7 % |\n\n\u00b9 The detailed version of the BMW Group carbon footprint can be found in the section on BMW Group CO\u2082 Footprint.\n\u00b2 The emissions listed account for approximately 90% of the BMW Group\u2019s total Scope 1 to Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions exclude climate-impacting gases other than carbon dioxide.\n\u00b3 The base load is the amount of power permanently required (e.g., standby consumption), regardless of how many vehicles are produced. The base load includes energy required for emergency and basic lighting, minimum ventilation or heating and air conditioning in standby mode.\n\nThe pandemic-related interruption of production at most BMW Group plants had a significant impact on energy consumption per vehicle. When the production facilities were restarted, the same base load\u00b3 and simultaneously lower production volumes resulted in an overall increase in energy consumption per unit. Although the BMW Group\u2019s energy consumption fell to 5,714,610 MWh (2019: 5,974,625 MWh) in absolute terms during the pandemic Energy Consumption in Detail, energy efficiency was negatively impacted by lower unit volumes and not least also by hygiene measures such as the requirement to increase the frequency of ventilation. The BMW Group\u2019s specific energy consumption for vehicle production in 2020 therefore rose by 3.9% to 2.12 MWh per vehicle produced compared to 2019. GRI 302-1, 302-3, 302-4\nEnergy consumption per vehicle produced since 2006\n\nOptimisation measures are, however, offset by the higher consumption required to cool the newly installed combined heat and power plants. The BMW Group has investigated the use of water sources other than drinking water in a number of its plants in future. It focused on locations in dry climatic regions, such as the plant in San Luis Potos\u00ed (Mexico).\n\nDuring the year under report, the volume of waste for disposal per vehicle produced decreased by 18.6 % to 3.33 kg compared to 2019. The main reason for differences in the volume of waste for disposal is changes in the structure of the existing waste disposal companies at the BMW Group\u2019s various locations. For example, in 2020 the Shenyang plant in China began using household-type commercial waste to generate energy, a strategy also introduced at the Rosslyn plant in South Africa.\n\nThe BMW Group reduced its emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) per vehicle produced by 4.7 % to 0.81 kg in the 2020 reporting period. This year-on-year improvement is attributable to process optimisations such as restricting the quantity of material used for cleaning work, the use of solvent-free cleaning agents, and the equipping of several new paint shops with extended thermal oxidation facilities for base and clear coats, such as at the Munich, Dingolfing and Shenyang plants.\n\nThe monitoring of resource consumption is an integral part of the Group\u2019s environmental management strategy in the global production network and is managed by the Steering Committee of the BMW Group\u2019s international environmental protection network. Each facility, building and space at each location is allocated to an internal operator. Within this area, the operator is not only responsible for the facilities and technical systems as well as the smooth running of processes and procedures, but also for their environmental impact.\n\nAn environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001 has been implemented at all 31 BMW Group production plants. With the exception of the Manaus plant in Brazil (planned for 2021), all Group sites are certified according to this standard. The five competence centres \u2013 emissions, water, waste, qualification and environmental management system \u2013 coordinate the BMW Group\u2019s environmental protection measures worldwide. Accordingly, any ecological improvements that have proven to be effective at one location are implemented at other locations to the extent possible. Ongoing further training and the exchange of information between employees are aimed at ensuring the transfer of knowledge.\n\n1 Efficiency indicator calculated from electricity, heat, natural gas and heating oil consumption from vehicle production (without motorcycles) minus CHP losses, divided by the total number of vehicles produced, excluding vehicles from the Magna Steyr and Nedcar contract production plants, plus energy consumption of the engine plants and electric engines as well as battery production, divided by engine production in Hams Hall, Steyr, Munich and BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. in Shenyang.\n\n2 The figures for 2016 to 2018 were examined by the external auditor on the basis of a limited assurance engagement.\n\n3 VOC emissions (volatile organic compounds) are generated in particular during the painting process and can be reduced by deploying innovative painting technologies.\n\n4 Each operator is required to describe the environmental impacts in the aspect register in accordance with the environmental management system and identify measures for improvement (e.g. long-term targets).\nCIRCULAR ECONOMY MAXIMISES RESOURCE EFFICIENCY AND CONTRIBUTES TO CLIMATE PROTECTION\n\nThe responsible use of resources plays a key role in the BMW Group\u2019s business model. For example, if electric mobility is not only to be produced using primary materials in the long term, the underlying flows of resources need to undergo a sustainable transformation. The BMW Group intends to create high-quality secondary raw materials by promoting a greater degree of transparency in the recycling chain and tracking the actual further use of raw materials within the cycle. The Group wants to provide effective impetus for a circular economy that is viable in the long term by emphasising the importance of recycling valuable resources. At the same time, this strategy can significantly contribute to cutting carbon emissions (Scope 3 upstream), as the use of secondary raw materials can significantly reduce the size of the Group\u2019s carbon footprint in its procurement and production processes \u2013 even down to as little as one-sixth, depending on the material. For this reason, the BMW Group has defined the circular economy as a strategic focus for the coming years. This includes its own internal initiatives as well as increasing its external commitment in dialogue with major stakeholders.\n\nThe economical use of resources is already a key requirement in the design process and at the product development stage and guarantees that BMW Group products are designed to ensure that as much raw material as possible remains within the circular economy. In 2020, a total of 99.1% of the waste generated in production processes was either recycled or recovered. To the extent viable, i.e. depending on the waste disposal market and distances to the supplier, the cycles of materials are physically closed so that the resulting recyclates can be reused.\n\nEnd-of-life vehicles are therefore not considered as waste to be disposed of, but as a source of secondary raw materials. For this reason, the BMW Group promotes the return of end-of-life vehicles, components and materials to the raw materials cycle. Together with its sales organisations in each country, the Group has already organised the taking back of end-of-life vehicles in 30 countries and offers environmentally friendly recycling services at more than 2,800 take-back centres. All vehicles brought onto the market since 2008 comply with global requirements for the recycling of end-of-life vehicles, components and materials. Already today, vehicles are required to be 95% recyclable. GRI 301-3\n\nBy 2030, the BMW Group intends to further increase the percentage of recycled secondary raw materials in its vehicles while systematically developing the recycling process at the same time. During the year under report, around 25% of the steel and up to 20% of the thermoplastics the Group used for vehicle manufacturing were derived from secondary sources. Up to 50% of the aluminium the BMW Group uses to make its aluminium castings comes from secondary sources. GRI 301-2\n\nIn its efforts to minimise waste, the BMW Group has developed recycling and reprocessing concepts that are adapted to the waste flows in its various plants, to regional legal requirements and to existing local waste disposal structures. Moreover, the Group intends to increase its level of expertise in the development and production of battery cells Electric Mobility and create greater transparency regarding the whereabouts and recycling of end-of-life vehicles and their resources. Input/Output Assessment\n\nThrough its own venture capital fund BMW i Ventures, the BMW Group has invested in key technologies that can make a decisive contribution towards achieving its long-term vision of carbon neutrality. In 2020, for example, BMW i Ventures invested in PureCycle, the first company in the world that can recycle polypropylene (an essential vehicle component) into a colourless and odourless native state. The BMW Group also invested in Prometheus Fuels, which has developed a technology that enables carbon-neutral synthetic fuels to be produced using green energy. Logistics: freight carriers and carbon emissions\n\nIn close cooperation with freight carriers, infrastructure operators and commercial vehicle manufacturers, the BMW Group is developing ecologically sustainable logistics concepts. The Green Logistics strategy pursues the logistical aim of achieving climate-neutral transportation, thereby contributing to the Group\u2019s target of reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain by 20% per vehicle by 2030 (base year 2019).\n\nThe carbon footprint and the use of carbon-efficient energy and modes of transport is a decisive criterion for the BMW Group when selecting freight carriers. Currently, more than half of the vehicles the Group produces are transported from manufacturing plants by rail. When supplying vehicles to the Chinese market, the BMW Group is further reducing its carbon footprint by using the railway lines along the Silk Road more intensively. In order to reduce carbon emissions, some of the spare parts sent to China by airfreight are being increasingly dispatched by rail. For other overseas markets, the option to switch to intermodal air-sea transport has been tested.\n\nThe BMW Group is increasingly working on the further development and piloting as well as the use of innovative technologies and already deploys battery- and gas-driven trucks to supply production facilities. In 2020, the BMW Group used the sea route from Belgium to Spain for vehicle production purposes. The use of biofuel from waste cooking oil led to a reduction in carbon emissions of 1,100 t.\nRENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nAll BMW Group locations worldwide as well as the BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) joint venture purchase 100% green electricity, i.e. energy generated from renewable sources. With the aim of cutting the carbon emissions it generates in production processes by an additional 80% per vehicle by 2030 (base year 2019) in a further step, the BMW Group systematically continues to invest in optimising the energy efficiency of its global production network. The strategy includes the use of process heat in paint shops and data analysis to reduce the power consumption of its machinery to a minimum. Moreover, the BMW Group is further expanding its own renewable power generation capacities at its various locations and increasing its energy storage capability. Leveraging these and other measures, the Group is making steady progress towards its long-term goal of becoming a leader in the use of renewable energy in production and value creation.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATED IN-HOUSE\n\nThe BMW Group is reducing the size of its carbon footprint by generating its own electricity from renewable sources. It is utilising suitable technologies and developing solutions, depending on the location and the on-site conditions. The various options range from solar energy, for example in Mexico, to biogas in South Africa and wind power in Leipzig. As the BMW Group\u2019s in-house production cannot fully cover its energy requirements, it buys in electricity from renewable sources \u2013 preferably locally. At the same time, in future the BMW Group intends to cover an increasing percentage of its electricity requirements through so-called power purchase agreements (PPAs), i.e. direct purchases from defined renewable energy generation facilities.\n\nThe Group is also working on solutions for storing renewable energy. For example, the storage farm at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig is equipped with high-voltage batteries from the BMW i3. The storage farm is integrated in the public power grid and provides control energy, which means the BMW Group is additionally helping to keep the public electricity grids stable.\n\nSHARE OF GREEN ELECTRICITY PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES\n\nIndependent processes have been established throughout the company for planning and implementing energy-related measures, which assign clear roles and responsibilities to the central strategy departments, the regional controlling offices and the plants at local level. The BMW Group also maintains a close dialogue with its energy suppliers in local markets, monitors regulatory developments and calls in external support as needed in order to respond to any changes in the percentage of renewable electricity supplied and the size of its carbon footprint.\n\n1 Electricity from in-house renewable generation plants, direct supply contracts for green electricity and certified proofs of origin.\n2 See Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\n3 Calculated based on volumes of green electricity purchased (including via certificates of origin). Relates to all BMW Group production locations including the BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, joint venture as well as motorcycle production and non-production areas.\n4 The figures for 2016 to 2018 were examined by the external auditor on the basis of a limited assurance engagement.\nThe BMW Group has laid the foundations for a stable and sustainable supply chain by organising its purchasing processes, managing international supply relationships with its partners and producing its own components.\n\nThe Purchasing and Supplier Network therefore makes a significant contribution to the Group\u2019s focus on the strategic markets of tomorrow, such as e-mobility and connectivity, and takes steps to ensure corresponding production volumes in the supply chain. With the growing demand for electrified vehicles, the need for the respective components and parts in production is also increasing. For battery cells in particular, the BMW Group is taking a variety of measures to accommodate this growth. For example, it will purchase the battery cells for its entire fifth generation from four different suppliers, thus making itself less dependent on individual manufacturers. Flexibility in terms of volume is both a premise and a decisive criterion for selecting battery cell suppliers.\n\nThe Purchasing and Supplier Network has been operating on a global basis for many years and adheres to the principle of procuring parts and components locally. The BMW Group has efficient teams on the ground in all of its key purchasing markets. Direct contact with these local markets has proved particularly effective during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the high level of pressure on the supply chain, the BMW Group again managed to ensure a seamless supply of parts to its globally located production plants throughout the 2020 reporting year. The supply chain has thus demonstrated its stability and flexibility, despite the exceptional conditions witnessed in the 2020 pandemic year. Its many years of sustainable activity in the purchasing and supplier network have also helped to build this resilience.\n\nOverall, the Purchasing and Supplier Network is responsible for the global procurement and quality assurance of production materials, raw materials, capital goods and services as well as the in-house manufacturing of vehicle components. External suppliers are rigorously selected on the basis of competitiveness in terms of operational excellence, quality, innovation, flexibility, cost and sustainability.\nSUSTAINABILITY INTEGRAL TO PURCHASING AND SUPPLIER NETWORK\n\nThe BMW Group places great emphasis on corporate due diligence. The Group already addressed this issue in 2008, defining and setting out comprehensive environmental and social standards for the awarding of contracts for the BMW i3. Since 2010, the BMW Group has required its partners and suppliers for BMW i models to comply with human rights and extended environmental and social standards, including environmental protection management systems. Since 2014, these specifications have been mandatory for suppliers of all vehicle models. In 2019, this requirement was supplemented to include occupational health and safety management systems wherever necessary.\n\nFor many raw materials, the requirement to ensure that environmental standards and human rights have not been violated poses a particular challenge, for instance in the case of lithium and cobalt, both of which are key raw materials for manufacturing battery cells.\n\nThe BMW Group is continuously expanding its sustainability activities across the supplier network. The focus is essentially on three key issues: 1. Decarbonisation, 2. Compliance with environmental and social standards, particularly human rights, and 3. The protection of natural resources.\n\nNEW TARGETS FOR DECARBONISATION IN THE SUPPLIER NETWORK\n\nBy the year 2030, the BMW Group intends to have over seven million electrified vehicles on the road. This means that the average carbon emissions generated by the BMW Group\u2019s supplier network (scope 3 upstream according to SBTI) will increase by more than one-third per vehicle by 2030 if no countermeasures are taken. Apart from the growing percentage of electrified models in the BMW Group\u2019s product range, the reasons are, for example, the energy-intensive production of battery cells, the greater use of aluminium and increased localisation in China, where the proportion of green electricity in the energy mix is still relatively low. Nevertheless, the BMW Group has set itself the goal of not only halting this trend, but even reversing it and reducing carbon emissions per vehicle in the supply chain\u00b9 by at least 20 %\u00b2 (base year 2019) by 2030. With this aim in mind, among other measures, since 2020 it has established the carbon footprint as a criterion for awarding contracts within the supply chain.\n\nOne of the biggest levers for promoting decarbonisation in the supply chain is the use of green electricity. For this reason, the BMW Group has agreed with the suppliers of the current fifth generation of battery cells to use only green electricity from renewable sources for production purposes.\n\nMOTIVATING PARTNERS TO OPERATE SUSTAINABLY\n\nJust as the BMW Group continuously implements optimisation and efficiency measures in its own production environment, it is also actively committed to promoting decarbonisation measures within its supplier network. By participating in the CDP supply chain programme, the Group motivates its suppliers to operate sustainably and, for example, utilise renewable energy in their production activities. The core of the programme consists of annual reporting that takes a multitude of climate-related aspects into account, including specific measures to reduce carbon emissions or increase the percentage of renewable energy deployed. The BMW Group strongly encourages its suppliers to set targets in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and thereby contribute to limiting global warming. The Group\u2019s success is reflected in the steadily growing number of suppliers participating: 63 suppliers (2019: 40) reported at least one 2-degree-compliant target system, and 59 (2019: 54) plan to publish one within the next two years.\n\n\u00b9 Including transport logistics.\n\u00b2 Value rounded for simplification purposes. The target percentage validated in conjunction with SBTI is 22 %.\nIn 2020, a total of 218 suppliers to the BMW Group (2019: 199) reported via the CDP Supply Chain programme, accounting for approximately 79% of the BMW Group\u2019s production-related purchasing volume (2019: 78%). The participating suppliers reported carbon reduction totalling some 22 million tonnes of emissions (2019: 32 million tonnes), which are proportionately attributable to the materials and goods supplied to the BMW Group. Due to the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting decrease in production volumes, carbon emissions were generally lower in 2020. Accordingly, the reduction in reported carbon emissions was also lower. GRI 308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2\n\nThe BMW Group has integrated the assessments of the CDP Supply Chain Programme in its key purchasing processes. The results are used in discussions with suppliers, in strategic management meetings and in overall supplier strategies to point out potential for improvement. On average, suppliers that have been reporting within the CDP Supply Chain Programme for at least three years have improved. The BMW Group sees this fact as proof that the programme has become well established at the companies participating for longer periods and that it yields the intended results. In 2020, the Group also asked more than 1,000 additional suppliers who, as small and medium-sized companies, did not meet the criteria to be invited to the CDP Supply Chain Programme to complete a carbon-related questionnaire. The activity further covered approximately another 11% (and therefore a total of 90%) of the Group\u2019s production-related purchasing volume. The results of the survey provided the BMW Group with additional insights that enabled it to further establish the carbon footprint assessment in the supply chain as an award criterion in decision-making processes. This was already the case in 18 out of 31 tenders with the largest carbon footprint. GRI 308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2\n\nRESPECT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL STANDARDS AND HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nIt is a major challenge to ensure compliance with human rights as well as environmental, health and safety standards in the extraction of raw materials. For this reason, BMW Group Purchasing goes beyond the mere contractual agreement of sustainability standards to a deeper point in the supply chain in order to conclude respective direct agreements at particularly critical points in the supplier network and ensures compliance with them by conducting audits.\n\nThe BMW Group is also involved in various initiatives to standardise management approaches towards implementing human rights due diligence and applying them throughout the entire supplier network. In Germany, for example, these include the industry dialogue on respect for human rights along the global supply and value chains of the German automotive industry, in which the BMW Group is actively involved. It is also active internationally and involved in initiatives to standardise the mining of raw materials. By certifying mines in accordance with the standards of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) or the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI), the BMW Group is promoting compliance with environmental and social standards right from the raw material extraction stage with the aim of making a significant contribution to improving compliance with human rights throughout international supply chains.\n\nKEY ELEMENTS FOR SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS PURCHASING\n\nDuring the year under report, the BMW Group included key sustainability issues such as biodiversity, deforestation and animal welfare in its Supplier Sustainability Policy, which forms the basis for the Group\u2019s terms and conditions of purchase. Accordingly, BMW Group suppliers and all purchases are subject to the Group\u2019s comprehensive sustainability requirements.\n\nIn 2012, in its materials strategy the BMW Group identified particularly critical raw materials and other materials from a sustainability perspective and initiated the cross-industry study Material Change Report (2018) on this basis. The Group continuously analyses the raw materials prioritised in the report as well as other materials essential for production with regard to their impact on the environment and society along the entire supply chain. By sourcing raw materials such as cobalt and lithium directly, the BMW Group can establish traceability and transparency with regard to environmental and social standards, which is critical for conducting due diligence in raw materials supply chains.\nRESPONSIBLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES\n\nIn addition to compliance with environmental and social standards and respect for human rights, the responsible use of nature\u2019s finite resources also plays a major role.\n\nWith the aim of protecting stocks of critical raw materials, by 2030 the BMW Group plans to significantly increase the percentage of recycled raw materials, i.e. secondary raw materials, that it uses and to reuse these materials in line with circular economy principles. The growth of e-mobility is causing the topic of circular economy to become increasingly important, as a variety of critical raw materials are required to produce battery cells. The use of secondary raw materials significantly reduces the carbon footprint compared to primary materials: by a factor of 4 to 6 for aluminium and by a factor of 2 to 5 for steel and thermoplastics.\n\nAt its own plants, the BMW Group is gradually establishing closed recycling loops between the plants and the raw materials manufacturers, such as at the Landshut components plant. In late 2019, the foundry in Landshut was certified by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) for its sustainable use of aluminium. Around half of the aluminium used at the BMW Group\u2019s Landshut plant comes from a closed recycling loop. The Group is consciously reducing the use of carbon-intensive primary aluminium via this method.\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE MEASURES AND COOPERATION IN A SPIRIT OF PARTNERSHIP ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS.\n\nWe can only succeed in achieving our sustainability goals by interacting with suppliers on the basis of mutual cooperation. Ultimately, climate protection and compliance with environmental and social standards are a challenge for the whole of society. As with quality, sustainability is all about accomplishing ambitious goals in close collaboration with the supplier network.\n\nWith the aim of stepping up its efforts to ensure due diligence in the field of sustainability, since 2018 the BMW Group has been involved in developing the Automotive Sustainability Assessment (ASA) in the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA). Based on these guidelines, the performance of essential due diligence procedures can now be audited in a standardised manner, even at the premises of medium-sized suppliers to the automotive industry. The BMW Group already applies the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) audit programme for major suppliers from the electronics industry. It also carries out qualification, standardisation and empowerment measures and holds informational events, particularly in the case of supply chains exposed to a higher degree of risk. The aim is to further develop and actively bring about transformation at suppliers with regard to sustainability issues. In its efforts to achieve this aim, the BMW Group leverages both individual and standardised elements of the Drive Sustainability Initiative and the Responsible Business Alliance to integrate sustainability in business processes such as procurement.\n\nElectric mobility can only be sustainable if the raw materials it requires are also obtained as sustainably as possible. Take lithium for example:\n\nThe BMW Group currently sources lithium for its fifth generation of high-voltage batteries exclusively from Australia, where the material is extracted by means of a so-called hard rock mining process.\n\nFurthermore, the Group has commissioned a study on sustainable lithium mining under the auspices of two renowned American universities in order to scientifically investigate water consumption in the extraction of lithium. The purpose of the study, which will be jointly conducted by the University of Alaska-Anchorage and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, is to investigate the impact of lithium mining on local water supplies in Latin America.\n\nLithium is the lightest metal on earth and is mainly used to produce batteries, ceramics, glass and aluminium. It is therefore also an essential material for producing lithium-ion batteries and plays a key role in vehicle electrification.\n\nTwo-thirds of the world\u2019s lithium reserves are located in Latin America. To date, however, the impact of lithium mining in the region has not been sufficiently scientifically studied. The gap will now be closed by the study commissioned by the BMW Group. BASF SE is also partially financing the study.\nVia the due diligence process, the BMW Group checks whether and how sustainability standards are being implemented by its suppliers. Suppliers contractually undertake to comply with a range of requirements in line with their environmental (ISO 14001, EMAS) and occupational health and safety management systems (OHSAS 18001, ISO 45001) and to demand and maintain compliance with these agreements from their subcontractors.\n\nIn 2020, the sustainability questionnaire for suppliers, which was initiated by the BMW Group in 2012 and jointly compiled by the automotive manufacturers, was comprehensively revised. The BMW Group\u2019s Supply Chain Response Team processes any information regarding potential breaches of its sustainability standards in the supplier network. Furthermore, the BMW Group\u2019s Human Rights Contact Supply Chain serves as the central point of contact and can be reached anonymously by telephone or email to report any potential violations of social or environmental standards by suppliers.\n\nThe BMW Group has agreed corrective measures with 64% (2019: 62%) of the suppliers at which sustainability shortfalls were identified in the course of the reporting year. The suppliers are required to remedy these deficits prior to the start of production. The main areas to be acted upon in particular were hazardous materials management, waste management, working conditions and occupational health and safety.\\textsuperscript{GRI 308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2}\n\nIn 2020, responsibility for sustainability in the supply chain and also energy was combined in a separate department within Purchasing. It comprehensively manages the integration of sustainability factors in the BMW Group\u2019s procurement activities. At the same time, it works together closely with the Strategy department and continually adapts operational purchasing requirements.\n\nA detailed presentation of sustainability-related activities undertaken in the supplier network and a description of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance is available on the BMW Group website.\\textsuperscript{here}\n\nThe BMW Group follows the principle of empowerment before disengagement.\n\nThe mining of cobalt entails risks, particularly when it comes to upholding human rights. The BMW Group is committed to ensuring that the mining and processing of cobalt are carried out in accordance with sustainability standards and internationally applicable labour laws. For this reason, the Group purchases the cobalt needed to produce its fifth generation of battery cells directly from the mines themselves and makes it available to the battery cell suppliers. Around one-fifth of the BMW Group\u2019s cobalt requirement is purchased from mines in Morocco and the remaining four-fifths in Australia.\n\nAt the same time, the Group is engaged in a pilot project in the Democratic Republic of Congo in keeping with the principle of \u201cempowerment before disengagement\u201d. In 2018, the BMW Group joined forces with other partners to initiate the cross-sector initiative \u201cCobalt for Development\u201d with the aim of improving the working and living conditions of workers engaged in small-scale cobalt mining operations in the Congo. As part of the project, around 40 members of 12 mining cooperatives were trained as trainers on occupational and environmental risks who pass on the content to more than 1,500 miners in the form of training courses. These programmes are underpinned by activities in local communities by which the residents benefit from improved access to education and alternative income opportunities. The project is being implemented by the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.\n\nThe aim of the project is to further develop and professionalise artisanal mining in the Congo to meet the BMW Group\u2019s strict sustainability requirements and could be an option for sourcing cobalt in the long term.\n\nMore information on this project is available here.\\textsuperscript{here}\nTHE BMW GROUP SEES DIVERSITY as a STRENGTH. That is why it has set targets for the long-term advancement of women at all levels of the company.\nThe number of female managers at BMW AG has more than doubled since 2011.\n\u201cCommitment to a sustainable future is no longer just an option. It is an obligation. This is valid for the BMW Group and every other company. BMW has been a leader in sustainability for years \u2013 and we are now setting ourselves even more ambitious goals for the coming decade. We are putting sustainability at the very centre of the company, measuring our success and making this even more transparent through the BMW Group Report.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking at the BMW Group means taking responsibility far beyond our own premises \u2013 for our society, the environment and all our stakeholders. It is our associates who are creating more sustainable, connected and safer mobility. This is our contribution to a better future. This is what drives us forward every day.\u201d\nSabine Distler and Gabriele von Stetten are jointly responsible for diversity strategy at the BMW Group.\n\nWHAT DOES DIVERSITY MEAN TO THE BMW GROUP?\n\nThe BMW Group firmly believes that diversity enhances our performance capabilities. Diverse teams are more innovative \u2013 because everyone brings a different perspective. Our customers are diverse, too. If we want to understand them, win them over and engage them, we also need this kind of diversity among our employees.\n\nTHE BMW GROUP ALSO SETS ITSELF TARGETS \u2013 FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN IN MANAGEMENT. HOW CAN THESE GOALS BE ACHIEVED?\n\nWe identify female talents at the company and develop them selectively. At the same time, we continue to bring qualified women into the company. We already make sure we have a high percentage of women in our talent development programmes.\n\nWHAT ABOUT OTHER DIVERSITY FACTORS?\n\nWe have expanded our diversity strategy to include physical and mental ability, sexual orientation and identity, in addition to the previous dimensions of gender, cultural background, age and experience. For certain factors, quantitative targets make sense; for others, we need qualitative goals. It\u2019s about creating the best-possible working environment in an open and respectful corporate culture.\n\nWe need DIVERSITY: It makes us MORE INNOVATIVE and MORE COMPETITIVE.\n\nFurther information is available at: report.bmwgroup.com\nLONG-TERM EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYER ATTRACTIVENESS\n\nThe success of the BMW Group is based on the personal commitment and technical expertise of its employees. As an attractive employer offering highly interesting future-oriented jobs, the BMW Group is looking to recruit new employees, deploy them in the best way possible and specifically promote their potential with the aim of ensuring their long-term employability. The success of this approach is reflected not only in the results of employee satisfaction surveys, but also in the awards the BMW Group has received as an attractive employer.\n\nEMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYER ATTRACTIVENESS \u2013 KEY ASPECTS OF SUSTAINABILITY\n\nPromoting and developing the potential of its workforce and being an attractive employer are important aspects of sustainability for the BMW Group. And, as one of the most important stakeholder groups, it is logical to consistently involve employees in the dialogue when changing the Group\u2019s strategic course. In a series of international stakeholder dialogues with employees from various regions in 2020, the BMW Group discussed its perception as a sustainable company as well as the main focus of its strategy. \\[\\text{Dialogue with Stakeholders}\\]\n\nQUALIFICATION, DEVELOPING AND RESTRUCTURING COMPETENCIES\n\nSocial, economic and technological developments require companies to continually adapt to new situations and qualify their employees to meet the challenges of the future. The BMW Group therefore invests continuously in measures aimed at establishing, broadening or adapting the necessary competencies, and offers its workforce numerous options for training and further education.\n\nBROAD RANGE OF TRAINING AND FURTHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES\n\nLifelong learning is an integral part of everyday working life at the BMW Group. It aims to ensure the efficiency and employability of its workforce and thus its own long-term competitiveness by offering a needs-oriented and innovative range of training courses, particularly in forward-looking fields of expertise such as digitalisation and electrification. \\[\\text{GRI 404-2}\\]\n\nIn 2020, BMW Group employees spent an average of 2.0 days on further training (2019: 3.3). \\[\\text{GRI 404-1}\\]\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, face-to-face training was only conducted to a limited extent during the period under report. However, the increased use of e-learning formats ensured that qualification courses were held, for the most part, despite the situation. \\[\\text{GRI 404-1}\\]\n\nAVERAGE DAYS OF FURTHER TRAINING *\n\n| Number of days | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|---------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0             | 3.8  | 3.4  | 3.4  | 3.3  | 2.0  |\n\n* Further training of employees and temp workers of the BMW Group in the consolidated companies worldwide. Data retrieved by direct representation of the number of participants as well as a small share by qualified extrapolation. The data also include e-learning courses.\nExpenditure on training and further education totalled \u20ac279 million (2019: \u20ac370 million). The year-on-year decrease was due to the coronavirus pandemic, whereby much of the training initially planned as face-to-face events had to be transferred to virtual formats, the cost of which was significantly lower.\n\nStrategic human resources planning helps manage the need for systematically developing and/or restructuring competences, ensuring that vacancies are filled and employees are qualified in good time.\n\nAs one of the pioneers in this field, the BMW Group is also shaping the transformation to electric mobility and digitalisation. For example, it already commissioned its Autonomous Driving Campus in Unterschlei\u00dfheim near Munich back in 2018 and its Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich in 2019. By 2026, the Group intends to invest some \u20ac400 million in a new vehicle assembly line on the site of the current internal combustion engine production facility at its main plant in Munich. The transformation of production sites and long-term job security thus go hand in hand. Employees are trained and qualified in order to take on new responsibilities in other areas. For example, the BMW Group is further expanding its e-drivetrain production competence centre in Dingolfing. It has also established production facilities for battery modules and high-voltage batteries at its Leipzig and Regensburg plants, which are scheduled to begin production in 2021. Since 2009, the BMW Group has provided more than 52,000 people, not only its own employees, but also those of suppliers, with further training in the field of electric mobility.\n\nExcellent leadership is a vital prerequisite for delivering outstanding performance in a competitive environment. The BMW Group\u2019s managers play a key role in implementing its new corporate strategy. In order to develop this expertise, the BMW Group promotes personalities who have the right attitude and individual, context-related behaviour, joint team leadership skills and a high degree of connectedness within the company. Apart from careers in management, the BMW Group also offers the Expert Career. It empowers its managers to develop excellent leadership qualities based on a uniform understanding of leadership.\n\nThe technological heart of the BMW Group beats in its Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ). With the FIZ Future programme, the BMW Group is combining its knowledge, expertise and creativity at its location in Munich (Germany) in order to research and develop the individual mobility of the future, characterised by electrification, digitalisation and connectivity.\n\nThe opening of the FIZ Nord project building was a major milestone in the year under report. At the new FIZ Nord, the BMW Group is pooling the innovative strength and key competences it will need to take on the challenges of the future. For the first time, all its vehicle drivetrain developers are working under one roof \u2013 on both state-of-the-art, highly efficient petrol engines and the latest generation of electric drivetrains. The key aim here is to promote intensive collaboration and thus also the transfer of knowledge between the various technologies. With this strategy, the BMW Group has taken an important step towards developing the competences and networking of the people who work there as well as bolstering its innovative strength.\nPROMOTING YOUNG TALENT\n\nVocational training at the BMW Group makes an important contribution to meeting the constant demand for young talent within the company, thus underlining the attractiveness of the Group as an employer. At the same time, the Group has the ambition to develop personalities through vocational training and enable young people to participate in society. With this point in mind, the BMW Group invests in vocational training and thus in the skilled workers of tomorrow. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the BMW Group again recruited 1,200 trainees in Germany alone during the year under report. This social responsibility still includes the promise that BMW AG will offer its trainees permanent positions after completing their vocational training at its various plants and at the company headquarters.\n\nFor several years now, the BMW Group has been additionally investing in digitalised training, which has been even more widely used since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Innovative learning platforms and formats as well as digitalised learning content ensured that numerous training locations were able to continue offering training with virtually no gaps, even when the vocational schools were closed.\n\nTrainees are preparing for their future occupations in 30 skilled trades and 17 dual courses of study at 19 training locations around the world. The training opportunities on offer are geared towards the Group\u2019s future fields of activity. Graduate trainees thus play a key role in developing expertise within the BMW Group.\n\nThe BMW Group attracts further young talents by offering academic programmes for junior staff and supports them in their professional and personal development through mentoring, networking and a wide range of qualification opportunities in practical and international assignments. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the BMW Group managed to implement all of its programmes. Face-to-face events were partially replaced by digital formats and the international assignments that form part of the Global Leader Development Programme were largely conducted at BMW AG level, despite the unfavourable conditions. The total number of apprentices and trainees participating in development programmes for junior staff within the BMW Group remained at the high level of 4,672 in the year under report (2019: 4,801; \u2013 2.7%).\n\nAPPRENTICES AND PARTICIPANTS IN YOUNG TALENT PROGRAMMES\n\n| Year | Number |\n|------|--------|\n| 2016 | 4,613  |\n| 2017 | 4,750  |\n| 2018 | 4,964  |\n| 2019 | 4,801  |\n| 2020 | 4,672  |\n\nTHE BMW GROUP REMAINS AN ATTRACTIVE EMPLOYER\n\nHighly regarded industry ratings once again ranked the BMW Group as one of the world\u2019s most attractive employers in 2020. The BMW Group is therefore the world\u2019s top-ranked automotive manufacturer in the current ranking of the World\u2019s Most Attractive Employers 2020 as rated by the well-known study provider Universum. In the study \u2013 which counts as one of the leading studies in the field of employer attractiveness worldwide \u2013 the BMW Group ranked fourth among engineering and IT students worldwide, after Google, Microsoft and Apple. When conducting the study, Universum surveyed 235,000 students from the 12 economically largest nations worldwide. This recognition is a major success for the BMW Group. In the Trendence Young Professionals Barometer for Germany, the BMW Group again achieved top spot in 2020.\n\nAs an attractive employer, the BMW Group offers future-oriented jobs and the right conditions for employees to grow personally and contribute towards shaping the future. Outstanding performance is a daily motivation to develop individual potential and make the company successful together.\nIn our efforts to ensure that the BMW Group remains an attractive employer, we also offer above-average salaries for the respective labour markets. To verify this fact, we conduct remuneration studies each year on a worldwide basis. The total salary package consists of monthly remuneration and a variable component. We also offer a wide range of additional benefits, such as a company pension. GRI 401-2\n\nDepending on their stage of life or living circumstances, employees have different needs when it comes to organising their work and their working hours. For this reason and to help employees find a good work-life balance, the BMW Group offers a great deal of individual personal scope in the form of working time arrangements such as flexible working hours, remote working, additional holidays in return for a corresponding reduction in salary, sabbaticals or temporary and permanent part-time solutions. These factors form the basis for individually adjusting contractually agreed working hours. The BMW Group is also investing in so-called new working environments with the aim of offering employees contemporary and attractive spaces in which to collaborate.\n\nEvery two years, the BMW Group conducts a company-wide employee survey. The survey conducted in autumn 2019 again showed a slight improvement in the High Performance Index (HPO-I) compared to 2017. The HPO-I is integrated as a parameter in the BMW Group\u2019s management system and measures the performance of the organisation as a whole. The results of the 2019 employee survey were evaluated, analysed and internal measures derived accordingly. Among other aspects, attractiveness as an employer and overall satisfaction were rated with 85% and 82% approval respectively. Despite overall positive approval ratings with regard to employer attractiveness, a declining trend is discernible, which shows that topics such as climate change, sustainability and electric mobility are becoming increasingly important for the workforce and thus also for the survey results. The BMW Group is responding to this development with its new strategy, focusing on sustainability and numerous internal initiatives, including stakeholder dialogues with employees on the topic of sustainability. The Group is also implementing the new strategic guidelines in its various corporate divisions. Its assessment regarding processes has also developed highly positively, albeit still at a low level. In order to encourage this positive trend, activities aimed at improving interdisciplinary cooperation have been stepped up. The results of the follow-up process were reported to the Board of Management in July 2020. The next employee survey is currently being prepared and will be conducted in autumn 2021.\n\nMANAGING EMPLOYMENT AND WORKFORCE PLANNING\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the BMW Group employed a total of 120,726 people worldwide. From the 2020 reporting period onwards, the figure denoting the size of the workforce only includes core and temporary employees. The number of employees is slightly below that of the previous year (2019: number of employees based on new definition: 126,016; \u2013 4.2%). GRI 102-7, 102-8\n\nThe widespread restrictions on public life and the economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic also had a negative impact on the automotive industry in 2020. The BMW Group responded by taking a number of personnel measures. Initially, it made use of flexible arrangements such as reducing excess hours on time and holiday accounts, followed by the introduction of short-time working hours. In dialogue with the Works Council, the Group also agreed on a balanced package of personnel measures that reconciled the future viability of the organisation with the interests of the workforce. Firstly, the number of employees was reduced through natural fluctuation, and secondly by reaching voluntary agreements such as early retirement part-time working arrangements or direct early retirement.\n\nAppropriate provisions were recognised and the expected cost included in personnel expenses. For details see note 15 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nEMPLOYEE ATTRITION RATE *\n\n| Year | Attrition Rate |\n|------|---------------|\n| 2016 | 2.70          |\n| 2017 | 2.64          |\n| 2018 | 2.78          |\n| 2019 | 3.39          |\n| 2020 | 5.51          |\n\n* BMW AG; number of employees on unlimited employment contracts leaving the Company.\n\nStrategic personnel planning serves as a tool for identifying the need to readjust personnel and competence structures at an early stage. The BMW Group uses this information as the basis for making targeted improvements in the areas of training and further education, personnel development, marketing, recruiting and young talent programmes.\nHEALTH AND PERFORMANCE\n\nThe BMW Group places great emphasis on maintaining and promoting the health and the performance of its employees. It therefore encourages personal responsibility and designs its work environments with the idea of maintaining the health of its people in the long term. In line with this strategy, employees at all BMW Group locations have a comprehensive health management system available to them. The Group\u2019s very high standards of occupational safety also serve as a preventive measure.\n\nHEALTH MANAGEMENT WITH A HOLISTIC APPROACH\n\nSince 2011, the BMW Group has combined a set of coordinated measures to promote the health and performance of its workforce within its health initiative programme. A range of campaigns inform the workforce on subjects such as addiction prevention or ways of maintaining good mental health. Regular campaign days, dialogue events and training courses address current health topics such as nutrition, exercise and fitness, cancer prevention or mental resilience and raise awareness of these issues accordingly. Due to the unprecedented circumstances caused by the pandemic, many of these events took place virtually. GRI 403-6\n\nThe BMW Group greatly emphasises the importance of all of its employees having access to the company\u2019s in-house health services. In Germany, the focus is mainly on providing acute treatment for employees and temporary workers during working hours. In certain countries, however, the Group\u2019s health service also takes on primary care tasks, such as in Thailand, India or Mexico. The BMW Group\u2019s company doctors also advise employees on individual preventive measures if requested to do so and help them adapt their work environment to ensure that their health and performance are maintained in the long term. GRI 403-2, 403-3\n\nMeasures to address the coronavirus pandemic\n\nIn terms of health protection for the BMW Group\u2019s workforce, the exceptional challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic had to be addressed during the year under report. The primary aim was to ensure the Group\u2019s ability to perform while at the same time protecting the health of its staff. For these reasons, the BMW Group set up a crisis management team without delay to draw up and implement effective protection and hygiene concepts. Staff and managers were promptly provided with information and recommendations for action, not only to protect themselves, but others too. The crisis management team kept a watchful eye on international developments, as the infection spread extremely quickly during the year under report. The BMW Group responded effectively in a challenging situation that had to be reassessed on a daily basis at times.\n\nSpecially trained teams were sent out to the Group\u2019s various locations and plants, advising managers and employees on how best to implement the protection and hygiene measures. The experts from the hygiene teams were also available to answer questions at any time. Moreover, a Group-wide information campaign helped inform employees on how best to contribute to curbing the rate of infection. Regular safety and hygiene inspections ensure that the measures are being implemented effectively and on a sustained basis during the pandemic.\n\nThe BMW Group ensured the health and safety of its entire workforce at its various locations throughout the year under report, despite the exceptional challenge posed by the coronavirus pandemic. The new SARS-CoV-2 occupational health and safety regulations were implemented at BMW AG and a works agreement was concluded to that effect. A comprehensive manual based on this agreement is ensuring the implementation of infection control measures worldwide.\nIn line with the general demographic change, the increasingly high average age of the workforce presents further challenges in terms of healthcare. The BMW Group\u2019s Health Initiative also closely addresses the concerns of employees looking to remain as healthy and productive as possible at an advanced age. \\(^{1}\\) \\(^{2}\\) \\(^{3}\\)\n\nOne of the parameters the BMW Group uses to quantify the success of its health management measures is the sickness rate. At 3.4%, the sickness rate at BMW AG was lower than in the previous year (2019: 5.0% or 3.7% according to the new definition). \\(^{4}\\) \\(^{5}\\) \\(^{6}\\)\n\nThe Group continuously strives to improve this figure by means of its health management measures.\n\n**SICKNESS RATE**\n\n| Year | Old | New |\n|------|-----|-----|\n| 2016 | 4.6 | 3.0 |\n| 2017 | 4.6 | 3.5 |\n| 2018 | 4.9 | 3.6 |\n| 2019 | 5.0 | 3.7 |\n| 2020 | 3.4 | 3.2 |\n\n**ACCIDENT FREQUENCY RATE**\n\n| Year | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Rate | 4.0  | 3.6  | 3.5  | 3.5  | 3.2  |\n\nFortunately, in 2020 the accident frequency rate across the workforce as a whole dropped further to 3.2 accidents per 1 million hours worked (2019: 3.5). However, one fatal accident occurred at the Group\u2019s Dingolfing plant during the year under report. By 2015, the BMW Group had already achieved the target it set itself in 2011 of halving the accident frequency rate to 4.5 accidents per 1 million hours worked by 2020. Since then, the BMW Group has endeavoured to continue reducing this rate. \\(^{7}\\) \\(^{8}\\) \\(^{9}\\)\n\n69,092 or 99.7% of people employed at BMW Group plants work at a location certified in accordance with an international occupational health and safety management system. \\(^{10}\\) \\(^{11}\\) \\(^{12}\\)\n\n---\n\n1. BMW AG; Number of hours of absence due to paid sick leave divided by the contractually agreed target number of working hours; up to 2019, absence due to unpaid sick leave was also taken into account. Figures up to 2018 are not comparable.\n2. Number of occupational accidents with at least one day of absence from work per one million hours worked.\n3. OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series) or OHRIS (Occupational Health and Risk Management System).\nExternal companies and their employees also need to be able to work safely at BMW Group locations. For this reason, cooperation with contractual partners is regulated in a separate contractor declaration, enabling potential hazards to be identified and appropriate protective measures taken on this basis. On large construction sites, all employees of external companies are given safety briefings by BMW Group experts. On smaller construction sites, however, this duty is performed by the contractors themselves. The company department responsible for placing the order monitors compliance with the occupational health and safety regulations, supported by the relevant occupational health and safety unit as required.\n\nIn order to improve occupational safety at the upstream stages of the value chain, too, the BMW Group requires its suppliers to comply with internationally recognised occupational health and safety requirements via its Purchasing Conditions.\n\nMANAGEMENT, TRAINING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\n\nAll topics relating to health and occupational safety within the BMW Group are combined in the Work Environment, Health, Group Safety and Group Data Protection unit and allocated to the Board of Management\u2019s Human Resources area of responsibility. Moreover, the managers in the various specialist departments are responsible for all related in-house processes. Health management and occupational safety, i.e. occupational health professionals, occupational medical staff, safety specialists and safety officers support and advise the respective internal departments.\n\nThe BMW Group continually assesses and improves occupational health and safety at all its locations based on recognised management systems such as ISO 45001, OHSAS 18001 or OHRIS, via occupational health and safety committees and by way of in-house risk assessments. Health and safety committees that include both employer and employee representatives work actively at nearly all BMW Group locations, making continuous improvements to occupational health and safety standards.\n\nIn order to identify work-related risks in both production facilities and offices, the BMW Group conducts wide-ranging risk and stress analyses. For example, during the year under report, the internal analysis of an industrial accident uncovered a risk in the production of high-voltage batteries. A technical solution was then found to automate this stage of production. The employees concerned were then trained and instructed and their protective equipment was adapted accordingly. A specific risk assessment was also carried out pertaining to the coronavirus pandemic. Employees are encouraged to contact their managers at any time if hazards or risks are identified. Employees can also approach their designated work representative at any time, or report risks and hazards anonymously via the Compliance hotline.\n\nOn the basis of management systems, the BMW Group regularly evaluates all the methods and instruments used within the company. The results are then used to improve internal standards. As part of its co-determination process, the BMW Group involves the Works Council as well as representatives of the severely disabled and personnel management as required.\n\nThe Group ensures the quality of its processes by conducting internal audits on an annual basis. Tests at the BMW Group\u2019s various locations are performed by external certification organisations and the specialists responsible for implementation are given regular training. Due to the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, in order to comply with safety and hygiene regulations, audits were conducted partly on-site and partly virtually in the year under report.\n\nTo ensure occupational health and safety standards at all its locations, the BMW Group provides its staff with regular training. The BMW Group Academy is solely responsible for all training measures relating to environmental protection and occupational health and safety. It prepares its various seminars in cooperation with the relevant departments for occupational safety, ergonomics, environmental protection and health management. However, the occupational safety, ergonomics and environmental protection departments or the health services can also develop and offer their own measures if required to do so at short notice. The BMW Group is also adapting these programmes in line with the current pandemic situation and increasingly switching to virtual solutions.\n\n1 In accordance with OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 and management systems derived from ILO (International Labour Organization) or UNGC (United Nations Global Compact).\n\n2 OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series) or OHRIS (Occupational Health and Risk Management System).\nEMPLOYEE DIVERSITY\n\nThe BMW Group sees diversity as a strength and this factor in its workforce is one of the keys to its corporate success. The BMW Group believes that diversity fosters innovation and therefore also boosts competitiveness. A deeper understanding of the needs of customers around the world is just one example. In recent years, the BMW Group\u2019s diversity concept has continued to broaden the eclectic nature of its workforce in terms of gender, cultural background, age and experience. For this reason, the Board of Management not only approved the Group\u2019s existing diversity concept, but broadened it during the year under report.\n\nPROMOTING DIVERSITY AT ALL LEVELS\n\nThe BMW Group places great emphasis on an unprejudiced, appreciative and inclusive working environment for all its employees. To underline its conviction, in 2020 the BMW Group continued expanding the diversity concept with the existing dimensions of gender, cultural background, age and experience to include sexual orientation and identity as well as disability.\n\nThe BMW Group promotes a culture that sees strength in diversity and difference as a valued asset. It seeks to raise awareness of diversity issues among its employees and managers by means of training, presentations and dialogue formats and also promotes diversity and equal opportunity via its recruiting and personnel development measures. During the year under report, the BMW Group again organised an international Diversity Week with the aim of raising awareness of every dimension of diversity within the company and exerting a positive influence on its corporate culture. However, the programme was conducted exclusively online due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Diversity Week and the simultaneously run global diversity awareness campaign were transmitted in a variety of digital formats and reached an approximate total of 92,000 BMW Group employees online.\n\nThe equal treatment of all employees is a fundamental principle firmly enshrined in Group policy. The BMW Group Code of Conduct and the BMW Group Code of Human Rights and Working Conditions rigorously address discrimination of all kinds. Employees are asked to contact their managers, the relevant specialised units, the personnel department or the Works Council if they have any pertinent concerns. The BMW Group SpeakUP Line is a telephone service available in over 30 languages that gives employees worldwide the opportunity to report possible violations both anonymously and confidentially.\n\nDiversity-promoting concepts have also been developed for selecting the future composition of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The BMW Group provides information on the respective diversity criteria and how to implement them in its Corporate Governance Statement.\nThe BMW Group is committed to the sustained advancement of women and has therefore set targets for the percentage of women employed at all levels of the company. This target framework was valid up to and including 2020.\n\nThe percentage of women in management positions within the BMW Group has been rising steadily for many years. Globally, the proportion of female managers in the BMW Group stood at 17.8% at the end of 2020 (2019: new definition; 17.2%). At BMW AG, the number of women in management positions has more than doubled between 2011 and the present day. Expressed as a percentage, the proportion of female managers at BMW AG was 16.2% (2019: new definition; 15.5%) at the end of 2020.\n\nThe percentage of women employed in the BMW Group\u2019s total workforce reached 19.5% during the period under report (2019: new definition; 19.3%), exceeding the internally agreed target range of 15% to 17%. At 15.9%, the proportion of women working for BMW AG was within the target range of 15% to 17% (2019: new definition; 15.7%).\n\nBy 2025, the BMW Group aims to increase the proportion of women in the workforce in general as well as in management positions to between 20% and 22%. BMW AG is aiming for a proportion of 17% to 19% of women in the total workforce and 19% to 21% in management positions. To achieve this target, BMW AG carefully analysed the effectiveness of its existing measures and programmes during the year under report, focused on specifically optimising them to suit requirements and derived new measures. These include, for example, new formats for the targeted promotion of young female managers and the option of filling management positions with two people at the same time in a form of joint leadership. In addition, the BMW Group ensures a high proportion of women in its young talent promotion programmes and is committed to a seamless return to working life after parental leave.\n\nIn order to ensure gender pay parity, BMW AG has established a process that compares the monthly pay of men and women based on the categories of full-time, part-time and pay grade. In 2020, there were no significant differences in the total remuneration packages offered to women and men at BMW AG.  \n\n---\n\n1 The proportion of women in management functions includes management levels I to IV. Management levels are defined in terms of their functional level and follow a comprehensive job evaluation system based on Mercer.\n\n2 The new definition of the term \u201cemployee\u201d is provided in the Glossary. The difference between old and new definitions in previous years is similar to the difference between 2019 new and old.\nDIVERSITY IN ALL DIMENSIONS\n\nCultural background\n\nEmployees from over 110 countries work together at the BMW Group. The ability to work together in international teams in a spirit of trust and respect is key to the Group\u2019s success. A broad range of opportunities for personnel development, qualification and further training promotes intercultural understanding. For example, the Global Leader Development Programme for newly recruited employees is deliberately geared towards international participants. In 2020, new employees from eight countries took part in the programme (2019: 11 countries). With its \u201cCourage to be more open\u201d campaign, the BMW Group is also actively fighting against racism, for an unprejudiced working environment and mutual respect.\n\nAge and experience\n\nThe BMW Group sees demographic change as both a challenge and an opportunity, as it offers people the chance to combine (life) experience and fresh ideas in a productive way. Since 2019, as part of the Senior Expert Programme, retired employees have been passing on their knowledge and experience to their younger colleagues. Within the Reverse Mentoring Programme organised by the BMW Group, older employees benefit from the new knowledge of the younger generation. Managers are qualified to recognise and leverage the opportunities and challenges that mixed-age teams offer.

From 2020, reporting based on new employee definition GRI Glossary.\n\u00b2 Clock-controlled and production employees.\n\u00b3 All employees without clock control.\n\nSexual orientation and identity\n\nDiversity also means living a corporate culture in which employees of all sexual orientations and identities are treated with equal appreciation and respect. With this point in mind, the BMW Group is committed, for example, to raising awareness among employees and managers for the concerns of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people, as well as to various campaigns as part of the LGBT+ movement\u2019s PRIDE Month.\n\nDisability\n\nEmployees with disabilities need to be offered an inclusive and accessible working environment that enables them to fully develop their performance. That is the BMW Group\u2019s mission. It begins with providing training opportunities for severely disabled young people and continues by designing workplaces that meet their needs. As part of an internal communication campaign, during the year under report the BMW Group encouraged greater openness and assuredness in interaction with disabled employees.\n\nIn the coming years, the BMW Group intends to analyse its activities in all five dimensions of the extended diversity concept and add new measures and programmes as the need arises. The Human Resources Policy and Strategy department and the operational Human Resources department, together with the disciplinary managers, are responsible for all the measures provided for in this concept. GRI 405-1\nCORPORATE CITIZENSHIP\n\nCorporate citizenship is an integral part of the BMW Group\u2019s corporate identity. The company\u2019s commitment to corporate citizenship focuses in particular on long-term and international projects in which it can provide targeted support with its own core competences. At all the Group\u2019s international locations, this commitment aims at attaining better living conditions, intercultural understanding and good education.\n\nBUILDING BRIDGES BETWEEN CULTURES\n\nThe BMW Group aims to play a leading role in intercultural understanding. As a corporation with a multinational workforce and locations on five continents, the BMW Group has a keen interest in encouraging tolerance and understanding between various nations, cultures and religions. Together with the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC), since 2011 the Group has regularly presented the Intercultural Innovation Award. The Award is designed to promote innovative projects that seek solutions to intercultural tensions and conflicts.\n\nOriginally, the BMW Group had set itself the goal of reaching around one million people with the award-winning projects by 2020, but it surpassed that figure at an early stage. Since 2017, the Group has therefore been pursuing the new aim of supporting six million people with the award winners\u2019 projects by 2025. By the end of 2020, the award-winning projects had already helped some five million people.* The BMW Group therefore believes it is well on the way to exceeding the target it has set itself.\n\nVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT OF EMPLOYEES\n\nThe BMW Group is increasingly involving its employees in its social commitment efforts. Since 2011, the company has presented the BMW Group Awards for Social Commitment to its employees. The award goes to staff members who have made a special contribution through their voluntary work. In 2020, five employees were honoured for their charitable social commitment, two of them even received special awards from the Doppelfeld Foundation. The BMW Group Awards for Social Commitment are each endowed with \u20ac 5,000, which go directly to the respective aid projects. This year\u2019s award winners come from India (Ooruni Foundation), Germany (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Kinderkrebsforschung e.V. and Hilfe f\u00fcr Kinder in Kenya) and South Africa (Gauteng Community Organization and Golden Youth Club). In addition to the award winners, each of the other five finalists received prize money of \u20ac 2,500.\n\nThe organisation Waves For Water is another project with employee involvement that the BMW Group has been successfully working together with for five years. As part of this initiative, employees near the Group\u2019s locations in Mexico, India, Thailand and Indonesia help provide families with water filters to facilitate their access to clean drinking water. In the year under report, the project was unfortunately interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, but will be continued as soon as circumstances permit.\n\nSupport provided during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic posed major challenges for society and companies worldwide in the year under report. In order to help handle this exceptional situation, the BMW Group has oriented its measures internationally and focused on its areas of core competence. For example, the BMW Group made vehicles available to social and healthcare facilities. It also donated protective equipment to health authorities and medical facilities.\n\n* The number of people supported is provided by the award winners at the end of each year. It is calculated based on combined data from media and sources. The figure reported relates only to the people who benefit directly from the projects concerned.\nEDUCATION CREATES BETTER PROSPECTS FOR LIFE\n\nAt its various locations, the BMW Group develops educational projects that facilitate young people\u2019s first steps into the labour market and offer them better prospects for life. With its programmes from primary school level through to higher education, the BMW Group is making a lasting contribution towards more equal opportunity. The BMW Group bases its funding approach on the specific needs and requirements at its various locations. During the year under report, the BMW Group again supported a range of educational projects in the USA, Thailand, India, Brazil, Mexico, China, Korea, South Africa and Germany. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was unable to offer its support to the same extent as before.\u00b9 The workshops were therefore conducted with a smaller number of participants and online whenever possible. The BMW Group used any funds that could not be deployed for educational measures due to the coronavirus restrictions to mitigate the immediate consequences of the pandemic.\u00b2 Support provided during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nFor further information and additional projects, see the website BMW Group\u2019s Corporate Citizenship.\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s investment in corporate citizenship totalled \u20ac33.6 million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac33.2 million).\u00b3\n\nPEOPLE REACHED BY THE BMW GROUP\u2019S CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP ACTIVITIES\u00b9\n\nPeople reached by Intercultural Innovation Award-winning projects since 2011\n\nBy the end of 2020: approx. 5 million\n\nTarget 2025: 6 million\n\nDONATIONS WORLDWIDE\u00b2\n\nin \u20ac million\n\nSports 5.2% 0.1% Politics\nEnvironment/Sustainability 2.4% 57.0% Science/Education\nCulture 8.6% Total 16.2\nSociety/Community 26.7%\n\nTOTAL EXPENDITURE ON CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP BY TYPE OF ACTIVITY\u00b3\n\nin \u20ac thousand\n\nCommercial Activities\nCommunity Investment\nDonations/payments in kind\n\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\n87,837 33,436 37,242 33,229 33,631\n\n\u00b3 The activities of the BMW Group in the area of corporate citizenship are divided into three main areas: monetary donations and payments in kind; community investment, which refers to investment in project initiatives and partnerships conceived in-house as well as corporate volunteering by BMW Group employees; and our commercial activities, which encompass sponsorship and so-called cause-related marketing.\n\n\u00b9 Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the number of people who took part in educational projects was not recorded in 2020.\n\n\u00b2 In the form of donations and payments in kind.\n\n\u00b3 The relatively high amount in 2016 is due to a one-off donation to increase the capital of the BMW Foundation in the BMW centenary year 2016 from \u20ac50 million to \u20ac100 million.\nMANAGING CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP IN A TARGETED AND EFFECTIVE MANNER\n\nTo ensure transparency regarding all the measures taken in this area, the Group-wide guidelines on sponsoring, donations and memberships have been binding since 2011. Apart from transparency, it is also essential to carefully document all the measures in order to ensure that legal requirements are complied with.\n\nThe BMW Group will continue to be socially active on a global basis and focus its commitment on the UN Sustainable Development Goals going forward. The joint initiatives of the BMW Group and its partners, particularly the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt, therefore focus on the topics in which they can have the greatest impact and benefit society to the greatest extent.\n\nInspiring, connecting, investing \u2013 the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt\n\nThe BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt* is an independent corporate foundation whose activities contribute towards the BMW Group\u2019s corporate citizenship and mission. The Foundation\u2019s mission is to inspire executives worldwide to take social responsibility and work as responsible leaders for a peaceful, just and sustainable future. Moreover, the Foundation invests in initiatives and organisations that develop solutions to social, environmental and political crises.\n\nThrough its Responsible Leadership programmes, the global Responsible Leaders Network and its impact-oriented investments (the Eberhard von Kuenheim Fund), the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt has promoted the UN Sustainable Development Goals since their adoption in 2015.\n\nThe digital transformation expedited by the coronavirus pandemic also impacted the Foundation\u2019s programmes in 2020. For example, the Responsible Leaders Table format events on the topic of Europe featuring selected leaders from the worlds of politics, business and civil society were held virtually. The Foundation also conducted the Responsible Leaders forums that had already been planned for Turkey and India online. The RISE-City programme was carried out in Amsterdam, Madrid, Athens and Singapore \u2013 either physically or on a hybrid basis \u2013 depending on the local situation. The Responsible Leaders Network, which currently has 1,854 members in 109 countries, also maintained its collaboration via online meetings.\n\nIn order to actively support the ongoing transformation to a sustainable society and a sustainable economic system, the Foundation launched the RESPOND Accelerator programme in 2020. For the first group, ten start-ups were selected that aim to successfully develop their sustainable business models. RESPOND aims to demonstrate that social responsibility and successful entrepreneurship are not contradictory concepts. As part of the five-month programme, which got off to a successful start despite the adverse conditions caused by the pandemic, the start-ups received support from mentors and investors from the Foundation\u2019s network.\n\nIn response to the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt supported the German government\u2019s #WirVsVirus hackathon both financially and via its RESPOND network during the year under report. This world\u2019s largest hackathon aims to develop creative solutions to combat the impact of the pandemic.\n\nFurther information about the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt is available here: [www.bmw-foundation.org/en/](http://www.bmw-foundation.org/en/)\n\n* The BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt is a corporate foundation of BMW AG. The Foundation implements its programme with the income earned on endowment assets or received in the form of regular financial contributions from the benefactor. In accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, the Independent Foundation is advised by the Board of Trustees (Kuratorium), on which the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and one member of the Board of Management of BMW AG are represented.\nREPORT ON ECONOMIC POSITION\n\nGENERAL AND SECTOR-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT\n\nIn 2020, the coronavirus crisis caused the global economy to slump on a scale not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates the contraction in global gross domestic product (GDP) at 3.5%. All G7 countries saw a significant drop in economic output. The BRIC countries also suffered sharp declines \u2013 with the notable exception of China.\n\nEurope\u2019s economy was hit harder than any other major region. In the eurozone, the economy contracted sharply by 7.6% year-on-year. Significant losses were recorded in Germany (\u22125.0%), France (\u22128.3%), Italy (\u22129.0%) and Spain (\u221211.0%), the eurozone\u2019s largest economies. With many areas of the economy completely paralysed at times due to lockdowns lasting several weeks, both production and consumption slumped dramatically. Unemployment rates rose in all countries, despite the increases being at least partially held down by short-time work programmes. Governments across the region implemented extensive economic stimulus packages to support their countries\u2019 economies. The assistance programmes caused government spending to rise sharply in 2020, resulting in higher debt ratios in the respective countries.\n\nGDP in the United Kingdom (UK) slumped by 10.7% in 2020. The performance was influenced not only by the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, but also by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the terms of the Brexit trade deal, which would ultimately govern the UK\u2019s future relations with the European Union (EU).\n\nIn the USA, GDP fell by 3.5% during the year under report. Due to the lockdowns and in the absence of short-time work programmes, the unemployment rate rose significantly. Consumer sentiment and exports both slumped during various parts of the year. Both corporate investment and industrial production suffered a significant decline. In light of the ensuing economic situation, the US Federal Reserve (FED) further lowered its benchmark interest rates in 2020.\n\nAlthough China was the only economy to expand in 2020, its growth rate of 2.3% was significantly down on the previous year. Consumer demand collapsed almost completely during the spring lockdown. However, strong pent-up demand set in from early summer and lasted through to the end of the year, thereby helping the economy to recover.\n\nExport-reliant Japan also suffered a considerable decline in economic output (\u22125.3%) due to the coronavirus pandemic during the period under report. The main factors here were lower private consumption, particularly in the spring, and the drop in exports.\nCURRENCY MARKETS\n\nThe US dollar/euro exchange rate became far more volatile in 2020 due to the coronavirus crisis. It fluctuated between 1.07 and 1.22 to the euro, and resulted in an average rate for the year of 1.14 US dollars to the euro.\n\nThe value of the British pound was affected by both the coronavirus pandemic and the uncertainties surrounding a free trade agreement with the EU. For a while, the British currency fell to 0.93 pounds to the euro before finishing the year at 0.83 pounds to the euro. The average exchange rate of 0.89 pounds to the euro for the year was slightly lower than one year earlier.\n\nThe same applies to the Chinese renminbi, which averaged 7.87 renminbi to the euro over the year as a whole.\n\nThe Japanese yen fluctuated between 114 and 127 yen to the euro, resulting in an average exchange rate for the year of 122 yen to the euro.\n\nThe currencies of major emerging markets also lost in value in 2020 as a consequence of the coronavirus crisis. The Indian rupee and the Russian rouble fell by around 5% and 14% respectively against the euro on average, while the Brazilian real depreciated by as much as 33% against the euro.\nENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS PRICES\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus pandemic was also felt on practically all commodities markets in 2020. After falling noticeably in mid-year, steel and aluminium prices rose again sharply towards the end of the year.\n\nPrices for precious and non-ferrous metals also followed a similar trend. One exception, however, was rhodium, which is mainly used in catalytic converters. In this case, prices continued to rise significantly throughout the 12-month period. By the end of the year the price of this precious metal had almost tripled compared to one year earlier.\n\nLooking at raw materials for batteries, the price of cobalt remained largely stable compared to the previous year. By contrast, the price of lithium fell slightly, reflecting lower demand due to the coronavirus pandemic on the one hand and oversupply on the other.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF METALS PRICES\n\nIndex: December 2015 = 100\n\nSource: Reuters.\n\nSTEEL PRICE TREND\n\nIndex: January 2016 = 100\n\nSource: Working Group for the Iron and Metal Processing Industry.\nOil prices reacted sharply to the coronavirus pandemic and the related collapse in demand. The market price of WTI crude even turned negative for a short time. Although the price recovered somewhat by the end of 2020, it remains slightly lower than one year earlier. The price of Brent crude sank to a low of 19 US dollars before recovering to stand at 51 US dollars by the end of the year. For a short time in April, WTI crude was quoted at a negative market price of 37 US dollars, ultimately finishing the year at a positive market price of 48 US dollars.\n\n**OIL PRICE TREND**\n\nPrice per barrel of Brent Crude\n\n![Price per barrel of Brent Crude](image)\n\nSource: Reuters.\n\n**AUTOMOBILE MARKETS**\n\nAutomobile markets slumped worldwide in 2020 due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In total, registration figures for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles fell sharply by 13.3% to a total of 72.4 million units during the year under report.\n\n**INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOBILE MARKETS**\n\n| Region                  | Change in % |\n|-------------------------|-------------|\n| Europe                  | \u201324.3       |\n| thereof Germany         | \u201319.1       |\n| thereof France          | \u201325.5       |\n| thereof Italy           | \u201327.7       |\n| thereof Spain           | \u201332.3       |\n| thereof United Kingdom (UK) | \u201329.4   |\n| USA                     | \u201314.5       |\n| China                   | \u20135.0        |\n| Japan                   | \u201311.4       |\n| Total                   | \u201313.3       |\nINTERNATIONAL MOTORCYCLE MARKETS\n\nInternational motorcycle markets in the 250 cc plus class were down slightly overall (\u20130.9 %) in 2020 due to the pandemic. Markets in Europe were also negatively impacted by the developments and contracted by 1.1 %. In Spain, the decline was significantly higher at 13.7 %. Registration figures were also down in Italy (\u20139.1 %) and France (\u20134.6 %). By contrast, Germany saw a significant increase, with new registrations up by 15.0 %. The US market was at a similar level to the previous year (+0.1 %). Brazil, on the other hand, recorded a significant drop (\u201317.7 %).\n\nINTERNATIONAL INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT IN 2020\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and its severe impact on the economy in 2020 also prompted central banks around the world to adopt drastic countermeasures. The aim of their monetary policies was to mitigate the effects of the downturn, for example by making it easier for smaller companies to access cheap credit.\n\nIn the first half of the year, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to increase the existing bond purchase programme to \u20ac120 billion per month and launch an additional emergency bond purchase programme (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme \u2013 PEPP) with a total volume of \u20ac1,850 trillion.\n\nAs a direct response to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Bank of England (BoE) cut its benchmark interest rate in two steps from 0.75 % to 0.1 % during the first quarter and increased its bond-buying programme to a total volume of 895 billion British pounds.\n\nIn the USA, in two emergency meetings held during the first quarter, the Fed lowered its target range for the benchmark interest rate from between 1.50 and 1.75 % to between 0.00 and 0.25 %. It also announced further measures, including a commitment to make unlimited bond purchases.\n\nAfter suffering an economic slump at the beginning of the year, but then avoiding a second wave of infections, China recovered earlier and faster than other major economies. Instead of introducing massive stimulus programmes, China increasingly relied on other instruments, such as lowering the reserve requirement ratio to 12.5 % and the loan prime rate to 3.85 %.\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nThe BMW Group coped well with the major challenges that arose during the pandemic year 2020 and, in view of the pronounced level of volatility on international markets, can look back on a business performance over the last 12 months that can be regarded as satisfactory overall.\n\nDespite declining key performance indicators in 2020, the BMW Group\u2019s results of operations, financial position and net assets are indicative of its solid financial condition. Overall, business developed in line with management\u2019s revised expectations. This assessment also takes into account events after the end of the reporting period. The outlook for 2021 factors in the expected impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\nCOMPARISON OF FORECASTS WITH ACTUAL OUTCOMES\n\nThe following table shows the development of key performance indicators for the BMW Group as a whole as well as for the Automotive, Motorcycles and Financial Services segments in the financial year 2020 compared to the forecasts made in the Annual Report 2019. In light of the rapid escalation of the coronavirus crisis during the first quarter 2020, the BMW Group partially revised its outlook for the year. The changes are shown below.\n\nDetailed information on the Group\u2019s key performance indicators is provided in conjunction with the analysis of the Group\u2019s results of operations, financial position and net assets below. Changes in key performance indicators for the Automotive, Motorcycles and Financial Services segments are explained in the separate sections for each segment.\n\n| BMW GROUP COMPARISON OF 2020 FORECASTS WITH ACTUAL OUTCOMES 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GROUP**                                                     |\n| Profit before tax                                             |\n| Forecast for 2020 in 2019 Annual Report                        |\n| Forecast revision during the year                             |\n| Actual outcome in 2020                                        |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| \u20ac million                                                      |\n| 5,222 (\u2013 26.6 %)                                              |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| Workforce at year-end                                         |\n| In line with last year\u2019s level                                |\n| Q1: slight decrease                                           |\n| 120,726 (\u2013 4.2 %)                                             |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| **AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT**                                        |\n| Deliveries to customers                                      |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| Units                                                         |\n| 2,325,179 (\u2013 8.4 %)                                           |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| Emissions new vehicle fleet                                   |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| g CO\u2082/km                                                      |\n| 99 (\u2013 22.0 %)                                                 |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| EBIT margin                                                   |\n| Between 2 and 4                                               |\n| Q1: between 0 and 3                                           |\n| %                                                             |\n| 2.7 (\u2013 2.2 %-pts.)                                            |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| Return on capital employed                                    |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| %                                                             |\n| 12.7 (\u2013 16.3 %-pts.)                                          |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| **MOTORCYCLES SEGMENT**                                       |\n| Deliveries to customers                                      |\n| Slight decrease                                               |\n| Q1: significant decrease                                     |\n| Units                                                         |\n| 169,272 (\u2013 3.4 %)                                             |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| EBIT margin                                                   |\n| Between 6 and 8                                               |\n| Q1: between 3 and 5                                           |\n| %                                                             |\n| 4.5 (\u2013 3.7 %-pts.)                                            |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| Return on capital employed                                    |\n| Slight decrease                                               |\n| Q1: significant decrease                                     |\n| %                                                             |\n| 15.0 (\u2013 14.4 %-pts.)                                          |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n| **FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT**                                |\n| Return on equity                                              |\n| Slight decrease                                               |\n| Q1: moderate decrease                                         |\n| %                                                             |\n| 11.2 (\u2013 3.8 %-pts.)                                           |\n| Significant decrease                                          |\n\n1 Including the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang (2020: 602,247 units).\n2 EU including Norway and Iceland.\nRETAIL VEHICLE DELIVERY DATA*\n\nIn December 2019, BMW Group was informed by the SEC that the SEC had commenced an inquiry into BMW Group\u2019s vehicle sales and sales reporting practices. On January 22, 2020, the SEC formally opened an investigation into potential violations of U.S. securities laws by BMW Group relating to disclosures regarding BMW Group\u2019s unit sales of new vehicles. On September 24, 2020, BMW AG and two of its U.S. subsidiaries settled the matter with the SEC and, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of an order (the \u201cSEC Order\u201d) finding violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the U.S. Securities Act and agreed to pay a penalty of U.S.$18 million. The SEC Order alleged, among other things, that the disclosures that BMW Group had provided to investors in its U.S. bond offerings conducted under Rule 144A in the period from 2016 to 2019 had contained material misstatements and omissions regarding BMW Group\u2019s U.S. retail vehicle deliveries.\n\nIn connection with the above, BMW Group reviewed prior period retail vehicle delivery data for automobiles and determined that certain vehicle deliveries of automobiles were not reported in the correct periods. BMW Group has corrected its reported delivery data, as further described below, to report deliveries in the period in which they occurred and has made, and will continue to make in the future, certain adjustments to its policies and procedures (together, the \u201cRevised Reporting Process\u201d) in order to further improve the reliability and validity of its retail vehicle delivery data, in particular with respect to the timing of the recognition of retail vehicle deliveries.\n\nBMW Group has applied the Revised Reporting Process to all markets with effect from the year 2020. While BMW Group revised retail vehicle delivery data for certain of its most significant markets for the years 2016 through 2019 presented in this report, such data were not revised for BMW Group\u2019s other markets. As a result, retail vehicle delivery data presented in this report for the years 2016 through 2019 is not directly comparable to such data presented for the year 2020. Specifically, the retail vehicle delivery data for automobiles presented in this report have been revised as follows:\n\nWhen presenting total retail vehicle delivery data for automobiles other than model-by-model data, data relating to the years 2016 through 2019 for BMW Group\u2019s 16 most significant markets were adjusted to reflect the Revised Reporting Process. In the years 2016 through 2019, these 16 markets represented on average approximately 87% of BMW Group\u2019s total retail deliveries of automobiles. For each of the years 2016 through 2019, these revisions amounted to less than 1% of BMW Group\u2019s total retail deliveries of automobiles.\n\nThe retail vehicle delivery data for automobiles for BMW Group\u2019s other markets have not been adjusted for any period prior to 2020, nor have any retail vehicle delivery data for motorcycles been adjusted for any period prior to 2020. BMW Group believes the impact on BMW Group\u2019s retail vehicle delivery data presented in this report of such data not having been adjusted to reflect the Revised Reporting Process to be immaterial.\n\n* See Glossary for the definition of deliveries.\nThe preparation of BMW Group\u2019s retail vehicle delivery data involves a variety of estimates and judgments, some of which are complex and all of which are inherently subjective, and is subject to other uncertainties, including:\n\n\u2014 The vast majority of deliveries of vehicles are carried out by independent dealerships or other third parties, and BMW Group is reliant on such third parties to correctly report relevant data to BMW Group.\n\n\u2014 The definition of deliveries includes vehicles delivered in the United States and Canada if the relevant dealers designate such vehicles as service loaner vehicles or demonstrator vehicles.\n\n\u2014 Retail vehicle delivery data for periods prior to 2020 include an immaterial number of pre-series vehicles that were never intended to be sold to end users (such as vehicles for use by government agencies in connection with safety evaluations (e.g., crash tests) or for other tests).\n\nBMW Group believes the retail vehicle delivery data presented in this report are materially correct in accordance with BMW Group\u2019s current definition and related policies and procedures of retail vehicle deliveries.\n\nRetail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenue that BMW Group recognizes in respect of such reporting period.\n### RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE BMW GROUP\n\n#### BMW GROUP CONDENSED INCOME STATEMENT\n\n|                                | 2020  | 2019  | Change in % |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-------------|\n| **Revenues**                   | 98,990| 104,210| \u2013 5.0       |\n| **Cost of sales**              | \u2013 85,408| \u2013 86,147| 0.9         |\n| **Gross profit**               | 13,582| 18,063| \u2013 24.8      |\n| **Selling and administrative expenses** | \u2013 8,795| \u2013 9,367| 6.1         |\n| **Other operating income and expenses** | 43| \u2013 1,285| \u2013           |\n| **Profit before financial result** | 4,830| 7,411| \u2013 34.8      |\n| **Financial result**           | 392| \u2013 293| \u2013           |\n| **Profit/loss before tax**     | 5,222| 7,118| \u2013 26.6      |\n| **Income taxes**               | \u2013 1,365| \u2013 2,140| 36.2        |\n| **Profit from continuing operations** | 3,857| 4,978| \u2013 22.5      |\n| **Profit / loss from discontinued operations** | \u2013 | 44| \u2013           |\n| **Net profit**                 | 3,857| 5,022| \u2013 23.2      |\n| **Earnings per share of common stock in \u20ac** | 5.73| 7.47| \u2013 23.3      |\n| **Earnings per share of preferred stock in \u20ac** | 5.75| 7.49| \u2013 23.2      |\n\n|                                | 2020  | 2019  | Change in %-pts. |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|------------------|\n| **Pre-tax return on sales**    | 5.3   | 6.8   | \u2013 1.5            |\n| **Post-tax return on sales**   | 3.9   | 4.8   | \u2013 0.9            |\n| **Gross profit margin**        | 13.7  | 17.3  | \u2013 3.6            |\n| **Effective tax rate**         | 26.1  | 30.1  | \u2013 4.0            |\n\n1 Group profit before tax as a percentage of Group revenues.\n2 Group net profit as a percentage of Group revenues.\n3 Gross profit as a percentage of Group revenues.\n4 Income tax expense as a percentage of Group profit before tax.\nGroup revenues by region were as follows:\n\n**BMW GROUP REVENUES BY REGION**\n\n| Region          | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-----------------|------|------|\n| Europe          | 44.3 | 44.4 |\n| Asia            | 32.1 | 30.6 |\n| Americas        | 21.4 | 22.7 |\n| Other regions   | 2.2  | 2.3  |\n| **Group**       | 100.0| 100.0|\n\nDue to coronavirus-related dealership closures, Group revenues for the financial year under report were moderately down on the previous year (2020: \u20ac98,990 million; 2019: \u20ac104,210 million; \u2013 5.0%). Negative currency effects caused by the unfavourable development of the US dollar, the Russian rouble and the Chinese renminbi also had a downward impact on revenues.\n\nFactors working in the opposite direction included product mix effects due to the less pronounced drop in the sale of high-revenue models, higher selling prices on the back of a rejuvenated product range, and a portfolio-related upturn in leasing revenues. Positive developments on pre-owned vehicle markets were reflected in higher revenues generated from the sale of returned lease vehicles, particularly in the third and fourth quarters. Due to the drop in new leasing business in the first half of the year as well as the expected decline in new leasing business in light of lower inventory levels at dealerships, the amount of revenues eliminated on consolidation decreased year-on-year.*\n\nGroup cost of sales amounted to \u20ac85,408 million, similar to the previous year\u2019s level (2019: \u20ac86,147 million; \u2013 0.9%). Higher risk-provisioning expenses, mainly arising in connection with the measurement of credit and residual value risks, were partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs due to lower production volumes.\n\n* Further information is provided in note 5 to the Group Financial Statements.\nIn addition, warranty expenses were negatively impacted in 2020 by the recognition of provisions in connection with the exhaust gas recirculation cooler and vehicle recalls (such as for contaminated battery cells in plug-in hybrid vehicles).\n\nCost of sales relating to Financial Services business went up as a result of the costs associated with the sale of returned lease vehicles, mirroring the impact on revenues.\n\nFurthermore, the eliminations described above had an equal and opposite impact on revenues, resulting in a year-on-year decrease in the amount of cost of sales eliminated on consolidation.\n\nResearch and development expenses were slightly lower than in the previous year. Higher expenses were incurred in 2019 including those relating to the BMW iX\u00b9 for instance. By contrast, the amount capitalised for future vehicle model start-ups increased in the financial year under report. The higher level of capitalised development costs mainly related to new models, the electrification of the vehicle fleet and automated driving.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses totalled \u20ac6,143 million (2019: \u20ac6,017 million).\n\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased year-on-year, influenced in particular by lower personnel expenses (due to a year-on-year decline in the number of employees) and a decrease in expenses for marketing and communication (including the impact of new model launch events transmitted via digital formats). Stringent fixed cost management also contributed to the reduction in selling and administrative expenses.\n\nThe net amount of other operating income and expenses improved significantly, whereby the year-on-year change was attributable to the expense recognised in the first half of the previous financial year for the provision relating to ongoing antitrust proceedings.\u2074\n\nProfit before financial result dropped sharply to \u20ac4,830 million (2019: \u20ac7,411 million), reflecting the various negative impacts on gross profit described above.\n\nThe financial result improved significantly year-on-year. The figure reported for 2020 benefited in particular from an increase to \u20ac1,212 million (2019: \u20ac918 million) of at-equity earnings generated by the Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, as well as from the gain of \u20ac105 million recorded by THERE Holding B.V. on the sale of shares in the card service provider HERE International B.V. to Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT)\u2075 during the first half of 2020. In the previous year, the financial result also included higher impairment losses recognised in connection with the strategic realignment of the YOUR NOW Group.\n\n### BMW GROUP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE\n\n| in \u20ac million | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------------|------|------|\n| Research and development expenses | 5,689 | 5,952 |\n| Amortisation | \u20131,710 | \u20131,667 |\n| New expenditure for capitalised development costs | 2,300 | 2,134 |\n| Total research and development expenditure | 6,279 | 6,419 |\n\n### BMW GROUP PERFORMANCE INDICATORS RELATING TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES\n\n| in % | 2020 | 2019 | Change in %-pts. |\n|------|------|------|-----------------|\n| Research and development expenditure ratio\u00b2 | 6.3 | 6.2 | 0.1 |\n| Capitalisation rate\u00b3 | 36.6 | 33.2 | 3.4 |\n\n\u00b9 See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\n\u00b2 Research and development expenditure as a percentage of Group revenues.\n\u00b3 Capitalised development costs as a percentage of research and development expenditure.\n\u2074 Further information is provided in note 10 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\u2075 Further information is provided in note 24 to the Group Financial Statements.\nAs forecast most recently in the quarterly statement to 30 September 2020, Group profit before tax of \u20ac5,222 million was significantly lower than one year earlier (2019: \u20ac7,118 million) and therefore in line with the revised outlook.\n\nIncome tax expense for the year decreased to \u20ac1,365 million (2019: \u20ac2,140 million), mainly due to the pandemic-related drop in earnings. The effective tax rate fell to 26.1% (2019: 30.1%). In the previous financial year, the effective tax rate was raised due to the non-deductibility of items for tax purposes, namely the recognition of the provision relating to the EU Commission\u2019s anti-trust proceedings and impairment losses relating to the YOUR NOW Group, the latter of which was reported within other financial result.\n\nThe size of the workforce decreased slightly to 120,726 employees year-on-year and was therefore in line with expectations (2019: 126,016*; \u20134.2% employees).\n\nFINANCIAL POSITION OF THE BMW GROUP\n\nThe consolidated cash flow statements for the Group and the Automotive and Financial Services segments show the sources and applications of cash flows for the financial years 2020 and 2019, classified according to operating, investing and financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statements correspond to the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.\n\nCash flows from operating activities are determined indirectly, starting with Group/segment profit before tax. By contrast, cash flows from investing and financing activities are based on actual payments and receipts.\n\nBMW GROUP CASH FLOWS\n\n| in \u20ac million | 2020 | 2019 | Change |\n|-------------|------|------|--------|\n| Cash inflow (+)/outflow (\u2013) from operating activities | 13,251 | 3,662 | 9,589 |\n| Cash inflow (+)/outflow (\u2013) from investing activities | \u20133,636 | \u20137,284 | 3,648 |\n| Cash inflow (+)/outflow (\u2013) from financing activities | \u20138,254 | 4,790 | \u201313,044 |\n| Effects of exchange rate and changes in composition of Group | 140 | \u2013111 | 251 |\n| Change in cash and cash equivalents | 1,501 | 1,057 | 444 |\n\n* Since the reporting year 2020, a new definition for workforce size has been applied (see Glossary). To enable better comparability, the value for 2019 was adjusted accordingly (2019 before adjustment: 133,778 employees).\nDespite lower earnings, the increase in net cash inflows from operating activities can be explained primarily by the pandemic-related drop in new business recorded by the Financial Services segment. The swift measures taken at production level to adjust to the coronavirus situation also resulted in lower levels of inventories at dealerships and simultaneously to a reduction in receivables from sales financing, primarily in the form of lower credit financing for dealerships. Advance tax payments also dropped year-on-year due to the lower earnings. The reduction in inventories had a positive impact on the change in working capital, whereas the decrease in trade payables, caused mainly by earlier plant closures and stringent cost management, had an offsetting effect.\n\nThe year-on-year change in cash flows from investing activities was positively influenced by the level of net outflows disbursed in 2019 for investment assets, primarily for the acquisition of the YOUR NOW companies. In addition, the higher level of investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in 2019 \u2013 particularly for the market launch of new vehicle models such as the BMW 1 Series, the BMW 3 Series and the X5 \u2013 resulted in a year-on-year decrease in cash outflows. Proceeds from the sale of marketable securities also had a positive impact on the net cash outflow from investing activities.\n\nThe net cash outflow from financing activities was mainly attributable to lower financing requirements in the Financial Services segment and the related reduction in bond issues, the reduced volume of asset-backed financing and the repayment of liabilities to banks.\n\n**REFINANCING**\n\nA broad range of instruments on international money and capital markets is used to refinance worldwide operations. The funds raised are used almost exclusively to refinance the BMW Group\u2019s Financial Services business. The overall objective of Group financing is to ensure the solvency of the BMW Group at all times, focusing on three areas:\n\n1. The ability to act through permanent access to strategically important capital markets\n2. Autonomy through the diversification of refinancing instruments and investors\n3. Focus on value through the optimisation of financing costs\n\nFinancing measures undertaken at corporate level ensure access to liquidity for the Group\u2019s operating subsidiaries at standard market conditions and consistent credit terms. Funds are acquired in line with a target liability structure, comprising a balanced mix of financing instruments. The use of longer-term instruments to refinance the Group\u2019s Financial Services business and the maintenance of a sufficiently high liquidity reserve serves to rule out any imminent liquidity risk for the portfolio. This conservative financial approach also has a favourable effect on the Group\u2019s rating. Further information is provided in the section \u201cLiquidity risks\u201d within the \u201cReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\u201d.\n\nFocused capital market management, good ratings and the high level of acceptance enjoyed by the BMW Group on those markets enabled it to refinance itself on the world\u2019s debt capital markets at favourable conditions during the period under report, despite the temporary impact of the coronavirus pandemic on those markets. In addition to bonds, loan notes and private placements, the Group also issued commercial paper. As in previous years, the issues were all in high demand, not only from institutional investors, but also from private investors for selected transactions. In addition, retail customer and dealership financing receivables as well as rights and obligations from leasing contracts are securitised in the form of asset-backed securities (ABS) financing arrangements. Specific banking instruments, such as the customer deposits used by the Group\u2019s own banks in Germany and the USA, are also deployed for financing purposes. In addition, loans are also taken from international banks.\nIn 2020, the BMW Group issued one euro benchmark bond on the European capital market with a total issue volume of \u20ac2.3 billion as well as one bond on the US capital market with a total issue volume of 4.0 billion US dollars. In addition, one bond was issued for a total amount of 0.4 billion British pounds. Private placements totalling \u20ac3.6 billion were also issued, including so-called \u201cPanda Bonds\u201d for an amount of 6.0 billion Chinese renminbi. A total of nine public ABS transactions were executed in 2020, including three transactions in China, two in Germany and one each in Japan, the USA, Canada and the UK, with a total financing volume equivalent of \u20ac5.8 billion. In addition, further financing equivalent to \u20ac10.7 billion was realised or secured in the UK, Germany, the USA, Switzerland and Australia via new and prolonged ABS conduit transactions. Other transactions remain in place in Germany, China, the UK, the USA, Canada, Japan and South Africa, amongst others.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of amounts utilised at 31 December 2020 in connection with the BMW Group\u2019s money and capital market programmes:\n\n| Programme                        | Programme framework | Amount utilised* |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| Euro Medium Term Notes           | 50.0                | 35.3             |\n| Australian Medium Term Notes     | 1.6                 | \u2013                |\n| Commercial Paper                 | 13.0                | 0.6              |\n\n* Measured at exchange rates at the relevant transaction dates.\n\nLiquidity-related measures were put in place during the first half of the year to enable the Group to respond flexibly to ongoing uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic and to manage operations at short notice in the event of possible renewed containment measures. Reflecting the improved situation on capital markets in the second half of the year, the BMW Group was able to reduce the amount of liquidity on hand to \u20ac17.8 billion at 31 December 2020, similar to the previous year\u2019s level.\n\nThe BMW Group also has access to a syndicated credit line, which was renegotiated in July 2017. The syndicated credit line of \u20ac8 billion has a term ending in July 2024 and is being made available by a consortium of 44 international banks.\n\nThe credit line was not being utilised at 31 December 2020. Further information with respect to financial liabilities is provided in notes 31, 35 and 39 to the Group Financial Statements.\nNET ASSETS OF THE BMW GROUP\n\nAdjusted for currency effects, the BMW Group\u2019s balance sheet total was slightly lower than at 31 December 2019. Including currency effects from the US dollar and pound sterling, amongst others, the balance sheet total decreased moderately.\u00b9\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (adjusted for currency effects) were slightly down on the previous year, mainly due to the lower amount of capital expenditure in 2020. In the previous year, investments at the BMW plants in Spartanburg, USA and San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico had the effect of increasing property, plant and equipment.\n\nBMW GROUP CONDENSED BALANCE SHEET AT 31 DECEMBER\n\n| ASSETS | 2020 | 2019 | Change in % | Currency-adjusted change\u00b2 in % | Proportion of balance sheet total in % 2020 |\n|--------|------|------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Intangible assets | 12,342 | 11,729 | 5.2 | 5.6 | 5.7 |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 21,850 | 23,245 | \u22126.0 | \u22123.5 | 10.1 |\n| Leased products | 41,995 | 42,609 | \u22121.4 | 2.6 | 19.4 |\n| Investments accounted for using the equity method | 3,585 | 3,199 | 12.1 | 12.0 | 1.7 |\n| Other investments | 735 | 703 | 4.6 | 11.8 | 0.3 |\n| Receivables from sales financing | 84,277 | 92,437 | \u22128.8 | \u22124.7 | 38.9 |\n| Financial assets | 7,752 | 7,325 | 5.8 | 7.2 | 3.6 |\n| Deferred and current tax | 3,065 | 3,403 | \u22129.9 | \u22127.1 | 1.4 |\n| Other assets | 10,326 | 12,939 | \u221220.2 | \u221217.9 | 4.8 |\n| Inventories | 14,896 | 15,891 | \u22126.3 | \u22123.1 | 6.9 |\n| Trade receivables | 2,298 | 2,518 | \u22128.7 | \u22126.7 | 1.1 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 13,537 | 12,036 | 12.5 | 14.9 | 6.2 |\n| Total assets | 216,658 | 228,034 | \u22125.0 | \u22121.6 | 100.0 |\n\n| EQUITY AND LIABILITIES | 2020 | 2019 | Change in % | Currency-adjusted change\u00b2 in % | Proportion of balance sheet total in % 2020 |\n|------------------------|------|------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Equity | 61,520 | 59,907 | 2.7 | 7.1 | 28.4 |\n| Pension provisions | 3,693 | 3,335 | 10.7 | 11.7 | 1.7 |\n| Other provisions | 13,982 | 13,209 | 5.9 | 8.9 | 6.5 |\n| Deferred and current tax | 1,256 | 1,595 | \u221221.3 | \u221218.9 | 0.6 |\n| Financial liabilities | 106,376 | 116,740 | \u22128.9 | \u22125.9 | 49.1 |\n| Trade payables | 8,644 | 10,182 | \u221215.1 | \u221213.3 | 4.0 |\n| Other liabilities | 21,187 | 23,066 | \u22128.1 | \u22124.2 | 9.8 |\n| Total equity and liabilities | 216,658 | 228,034 | \u22125.0 | \u22121.6 | 100.0 |\n\n\u00b9 Further information is provided in note 5 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\u00b2 The adjustment for exchange rate factors is calculated by applying the relevant current exchange rates to the prior year figures.\nLeased products (adjusted for currency effects) were slightly up on the previous year due to portfolio growth, mainly in Germany, Italy and Switzerland.\n\nReceivables from sales financing (adjusted for currency effects) went down slightly compared to 31 December 2019, primarily due to the decrease in dealership financing, mainly in the USA, Germany, the UK and France. A total of 1,238,286 new credit financing contracts were concluded with retail customers during the financial year 2020. The number of contracts in place with dealerships and retail customers decreased by 0.6% to 4,040,231 contracts.\n\nGroup equity rose slightly by \u20ac1,613 million to \u20ac61,520 million, driven primarily by the profit of \u20ac3,775 million attributable to shareholders of BMW AG. The dividend payment for the financial year 2019 amounted to \u20ac1,646 million, reducing equity accordingly.\n\nOther provisions increased year-on-year due to additions to risk provisions in connection with the exhaust gas recirculation cooler and various recalls, such as for contaminated battery cells in plug-in hybrids.\n\nFinancial liabilities decreased moderately over the twelve-month period, with repayments of maturing bonds exceeding new issues.\n\nDespite the volatility caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the results of operations, financial position and net assets of the BMW Group remained stable throughout the financial year, thanks to a raft of measures that were immediately implemented, including focused working capital management, strict investment and fixed cost management and targeted liquidity management.\n\n### BMW GROUP EQUITY RATIO *\n\n|                      | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | Change in %-pts. |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|------------------|\n| Group                | 28.4       | 26.3       | 2.1              |\n| Automotive segment   | 37.0       | 35.5       | 1.5              |\n| Financial Services segment | 10.5   | 9.9        | 0.6              |\n\n* Equity capital as a percentage of the balance sheet total, respectively.\nVALUE ADDED STATEMENT\n\nThe value added statement shows the value of work performed by the BMW Group during the financial year, less the value of work bought in.

coronavirus pandemic also affected the BMW Group and its dealership organisation. Against this backdrop, deliveries\u00b9 were extremely volatile in 2020. After a promising start to the year, sales figures slumped in the spring, before recovering from the third quarter onwards. During the final months of the year, the BMW Group returned to its successful course.\n\nIn 2020, the BMW Group delivered a total of 2,325,179\u00b2 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand automobiles to customers (2019: 2,537,504\u00b2,\u00b3 units; \u2013 8.4 %), once again leading the premium segment worldwide.\n\nDue to the impact of the coronavirus crisis in the first half of 2020, deliveries were originally expected to drop significantly over the year as a whole. In the end, however, the decrease was relatively moderate at 8.4 %, largely on the back of a distinct recovery, particularly in the final quarter.\n\nA strong second six-month period also contributed significantly to the brands making up for a major part of the coronavirus-related decline in the first half of the year. Over the full year, the BMW brand delivered 2,028,841\u00b2 units to customers worldwide, 7.1 % below the record figure set one year earlier (2019: 2,184,939\u00b2,\u00b3 units). MINI was also down year-on-year at 292,582 units (2019: 347,465\u00b3 units; \u2013 15.8 %). Following the previous year\u2019s record high, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars delivered a total of 3,756 of its ultra-luxury brand vehicles to customers in 2020 (2019: 5,100\u00b3 units; \u2013 26.4 %).\n\nPROPORTION OF ELECTRIFIED VEHICLES UP SIGNIFICANTLY\n\nThe growing number of electrified models offered by BMW and MINI brands was again reflected in the sharply rising delivery figures recorded in 2020. Over the twelve-month period, the BMW Group sold a total of 192,662 electrified BMWs and MINIs worldwide, around one-third (31.8 %) up on the previous year (2019: 146,158\u00b3 units). Accordingly, electric mobility has become a significant growth driver for business. In the meantime, the BMW Group has expanded its portfolio of electrified vehicles to 14 models, which are available in a total of 95 countries worldwide. Based on its existing plans, the BMW Group will have 25 electrified models on the road by 2023.\n\nThe launch of the fully electric MINI\u2074 and the presentation of the BMW iX\u00b3 during 2020 will be followed in 2021 by the first deliveries of the two fully electric models, the BMW iX\u00b3 and the BMW i4.\n\nDELIVERIES OF ELECTRIFIED MODELS\u00b3\n\n|                      | 2020  | 2019  | Change in % |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------------|\n| BMW Group PHEV       | 148,121 | 106,639 | 38.9        |\n| BMW Group BEV        | 44,541  | 39,519  | 12.7        |\n| Total                | 192,662 | 146,158 | 31.8        |\n\n\u00b9 See Glossary for the definition of deliveries.\n\u00b2 Including the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang (2020: 602,247 units, 2019: 538,612 units).\n\u00b3 Retail vehicle delivery data presented for 2020 is not directly comparable to such data presented for previous years.

The increased share of electrified vehicles delivered and the rigorous use of Efficient Dynamics technologies have enabled the BMW Group to achieve the stipulated fleet CO\u2082 limit for 2020, based on regulatory requirements. Fleet carbon emissions of vehicles delivered in Europe at the end of the reporting period were 99 g CO\u2082/km (2019: 127 g CO\u2082/km; \u201322.0%).\n\nDELIVERIES UP IN ASIA AND DOWN IN EUROPE AND AMERICA\n\nBMW Group sales in Asia grew solidly in 2020, with deliveries to customers rising by 6.0% to a total of 986,464\u00b2 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles (2019: 930,767\u00b2,\u00b3 units). In China in particular, the BMW Group surpassed the previous year\u2019s figure by 7.4%, with 778,412\u00b2 units delivered to customers (2019: 724,711\u00b2,\u00b3 units).\n\nBy contrast, sales performance in Europe was affected more severely by the coronavirus crisis. In an unprecedented year marked by restrictions strongly affecting retail business, the BMW Group delivered a total of 913,642 units across the region (2019: 1,081,649\u00b3; \u201315.5%). The number of vehicles delivered in Germany fell by 13.8% to 285,019 units (2019: 330,507\u00b3 units).\n\nFigures for the UK deteriorated significantly, with deliveries falling to 163,174 units (2019: 233,771\u00b3 units; \u201330.2%), not least due to uncertainty over reaching a trade deal with the EU and the course of the pandemic.\n\nSales of the BMW Group\u2019s three brands on the American continent totalled 379,714 units (2019: 472,879\u00b3 units; \u201319.7%).\n\nA total of 307,876 units were delivered to customers in the USA (2019: 375,726\u00b3 units; \u201318.1%). Despite a challenging environment due to the coronavirus pandemic, the final quarter here finished strongly on the back of rising demand.\n\nBMW GROUP DELIVERIES OF VEHICLES BY REGION AND MARKET\u00b3\n\n| Region | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Europe | 913.6 | 1,081.6 | 1,097.4 | 1,101.9 | 1,089.8 |\n| thereof Germany | 285.0 | 330.5 | 310.6 | 296.5 | 298.5 |\n| thereof UK | 163.2 | 233.8 | 236.8 | 242.4 | 252.4 |\n| Americas | 379.7 | 472.9 | 457.1 | 456.1 | 453.7 |\n| thereof USA | 307.9 | 375.7 | 355.4 | 358.8 | 359.5 |\n| Asia\u00b2 | 986.5 | 930.8 | 871.8 | 847.7 | 738.2 |\n| thereof China\u00b2 | 778.4 | 724.7 | 635.8 | 595.0 | 508.8 |\n| Other markets | 45.4 | 52.2 | 59.9 | 59.3 | 68.3 |\n| Total\u00b2 | 2,325.2 | 2,537.5 | 2,486.1 | 2,465.0 | 2,350.0 |\n\n\u00b9 EU including Norway and Iceland.\n\u00b2 Including the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang (2020: 602,247 units, 2019: 538,612 units, 2018: 455,581 units, 2017: 385,705 units, 2016: 311,473 units).\n\u00b3 Retail vehicle delivery data presented for 2020 is not directly comparable to such data presented for previous years.

In addition, the 8 Series, the X6 and the X7 proved highly popular, each posting double-digit percentage increases. The highly successful BMW 3 Series model also recorded solid growth during the twelve-month period. Deliveries of the BMW 4 Series declined due to model life cycle factors.\n\nNEW BMW BRAND PRODUCTS\u00b9\n\nThe BMW brand introduced a variety of innovative new products over the course of 2020, starting with the BMW X3 plug-in hybrid variant in January, followed by the BMW X1 plug-in hybrid and the BMW 2 Series Gran Coup\u00e9 in March. The second half of the year saw the launch of model revisions of the BMW 5 Series and the BMW 6 Series Gran Turismo as well as the plug-in hybrid variants of the BMW 3 Series Touring and the BMW X2. The new BMW 4 Series Coup\u00e9 was launched in October. The fully electric BMW iX3 celebrated its market d\u00e9but in China in November, with other markets to follow in early 2021. Additional hybrid variants of the BMW 5 Series were also added to the product range.\n\nMOST SUCCESSFUL YEAR TO DATE FOR BMW M\u00b9\n\nBMW M GmbH finished the most successful year in its history with a 5.9 % rise in deliveries to 144,231 units (2019: 136,165\u00b3 units; + 5.9 %), boosted by good contributions from the new high-performance BMW X5 M and X6 M models. In addition to these two models, BMW M also presented the new BMW M8 Gran Coup\u00e9 and the M2 CS during the year under report. The new BMW M3 and the BMW M4 Coup\u00e9, which both celebrated their world premi\u00e8res in 2020, will be launched as further important models in 2021.\n\nDELIVERIES OF BMW VEHICLES BY MODEL VARIANT\u00b9 \u00b2 \u00b3\n\n| Model Variant | 2020 | 2019 | Change in % | Proportion of BMW sales volume 2020 in % |\n|---------------|------|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|\n| BMW 1 Series  | 164,056 | 173,870 | \u2013 5.6 | 8.1 |\n| BMW 2 Series  | 104,859 | 115,095 | \u2013 8.9 | 5.2 |\n| BMW 3 Series  | 381,416 | 358,643 | 6.3 | 18.8 |\n| BMW 4 Series  | 38,879 | 74,236 | \u2013 47.6 | 1.9 |\n| BMW 5 Series  | 302,564 | 353,249 | \u2013 14.3 | 14.9 |\n| BMW 6 Series  | 19,893 | 25,170 | \u2013 21.0 | 1.0 |\n| BMW 7 Series  | 46,025 | 50,552 | \u2013 9.0 | 2.3 |\n| BMW 8 Series  | 20,703 | 12,219 | 69.4 | 1.0 |\n| BMW X4        | 14,982 | 15,819 | \u2013 5.3 | 0.7 |\n| BMW X1        | 230,041 | 266,124 | \u2013 13.6 | 11.3 |\n| BMW X2        | 74,229 | 91,765 | \u2013 19.1 | 3.7 |\n| BMW X3        | 292,328 | 316,883 | \u2013 7.7 | 14.4 |\n| BMW X4        | 55,237 | 61,569 | \u2013 10.3 | 2.7 |\n| BMW X5        | 168,674 | 165,498 | 1.9 | 8.3 |\n| BMW X6        | 38,100 | 22,116 | 72.3 | 1.9 |\n| BMW X7        | 48,693 | 39,882 | 22.1 | 2.4 |\n| BMW i (i3 and i8) | 28,162 | 42,249 | \u2013 33.3 | 1.4 |\n| BMW total     | 2,028,841 | 2,184,939 | \u2013 7.1 | 100 |\n\n\u00b9 See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\n\u00b2 Including the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang (2020: 602,247 units, 2019: 538,612 units).\n\u00b3 Retail vehicle delivery data presented for 2020 is not directly comparable to such data presented for previous years.

In addition to the MINI Countryman plug-in hybrid variant, the fully electric MINI Cooper SE has been available since March 2020. The latter generated a great deal of market interest, with 17,580 units delivered to customers by the end of the reporting year. The revised model of the MINI Countryman became available in September. Deliveries of John Cooper Works high-performance models went up by 21.2% to 20,628 units (2019: 17,025 units\u00b2). The MINI John Cooper Works GP made its market d\u00e9but in March.\n\nROLLS-ROYCE: FIGURES DOWN IN CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT AFTER PREVIOUS YEAR\u2019S RECORD PERFORMANCE\u00b9\n\nDue to the global impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Rolls-Royce deliveries fell to 3,756 units (2019: 5,100\u00b2 units; \u2013 26.4%). Nevertheless, the leading marque in the ultra-luxury segment continued to expand its model range, including the launch of the new Rolls-Royce Ghost in September 2020.\n\nRolls-Royce Motor Cars\u2019 Bespoke programme allows customers to select their own personalised configurations with maximum flexibility.

For further information on retail vehicle delivery data, please see Comparison of Forecast with Actual Outcomes.\nAUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT PERFORMANCE\n\nAutomotive segment revenues amounted to \u20ac80,853 million (2019: \u20ac91,682 million; \u201311.8%, currency-adjusted: \u201310.5%) and were therefore significantly lower than one year earlier. Lower sales volumes due to the coronavirus pandemic and negative currency effects were partially offset by overall favourable product mix effects brought about by the less pronounced drop in the sale of high-revenue models. Improved selling prices also helped to cushion the impact of the drop in revenues.\n\nSegment cost of sales decreased moderately to \u20ac71,456 million compared to the previous year (2019: \u20ac78,062 million; \u20138.5%). The volume-related decline in cost of sales was offset by expenses for various provisions, including those recognised in connection with the exhaust gas recirculation cooler and recalls (such as contaminated battery cells in plug-in hybrid vehicles).\n\nIn addition, lower capitalised overhead costs due to the reduction of inventories accounted for at Group level as well as higher expenses for depreciation and amortisation had the effect of increasing segment cost of sales year-on-year.\n\nExpenses recognised for workforce measures were largely offset by lower expenses for performance-related remuneration components.\n\nThe net amount of other operating income and expenses improved by \u20ac1,361 million, largely due to the provision recognised in relation with the EU Commission\u2019s ongoing antitrust proceedings in the previous financial year.*\n\nThe segment EBIT margin (profit before financial result as a percentage of revenues) came in at 2.7% (2019: 4.9%; \u20132.2 percentage points). As forecast in the quarterly statement to 30 September 2020, the EBIT margin was within the target range of between 0 and 3% and therefore in line with the revised outlook. In the 2019 Annual Report, a segment EBIT margin within a target range of between 2 and 4% was forecast.\n\nAt \u20ac560 million, the Automotive segment\u2019s financial result was significantly up on the previous year (2019: negative \u20ac32 million), mainly reflecting the improved result from at-equity accounted investments described in the section on Group earnings above.\n\nProfit before tax for the year amounted to \u20ac2,722 million and was therefore significantly lower than one year earlier (2019: \u20ac4,467 million; \u201339.1%).\n\nThe Automotive segment\u2019s RoCE for 2020 was significantly lower at 12.7% (2019: 29.0%; \u201316.3 percentage points). The decline was mainly attributable to the lower EBIT. The higher volume of capital expenditure in previous years \u2013 including amounts invested to expand the product portfolio \u2013 also contributed to this development.\n\nAs forecast for the financial year 2020, RoCE declined significantly and was well below the long-term strategic target valid through 2020 of at least 26% for the automotive segment.\n\n* Further information is provided in note 10 to the Group Financial Statements.\nFree cash flow for the Automotive segment was as follows:\n\n**FREE CASH FLOW AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT**\n\n| in \u20ac million | 2020 | 2019 | Change |\n|--------------|------|------|--------|\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (\u2013) from operating activities | 8,178 | 9,690 | \u20131,512 |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (\u2013) from investing activities | \u20133,933 | \u20137,165 | 3,232 |\n| Adjustment for net investment in marketable securities and investment funds | \u2013850 | 42 | \u2013892 |\n| Free cash flow Automotive segment | 3,395 | 2,567 | 828 |\n\nIn the Automotive segment, net financial assets comprised the following:\n\n**NET FINANCIAL ASSETS AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT**\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | Change |\n|--------------|------------|------------|--------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 9,522 | 9,077 | 445 |\n| Marketable securities and investment funds | 3,759 | 4,470 | \u2013711 |\n| Intragroup net financing | 7,996 | 7,784 | 212 |\n| Financial assets | 21,277 | 21,331 | \u201354 |\n| Less: external financial liabilities* | \u20132,815 | \u20133,754 | 939 |\n| Net financial assets Automotive segment | 18,462 | 17,577 | 885 |\n\n* Excluding derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe main factor influencing the decrease in the net cash inflow from operating activities was the pandemic-related year-on-year deterioration in operational pre-tax earnings. The change in working capital was positively impacted by the reduction in inventories, while the lower level of trade payables \u2013 mainly due to an earlier closure of plants \u2013 had an offsetting effect compared to the prior year. The decrease in the net cash outflow from investing activities was mainly attributable to the changes described in the Group Cash Flow Statement.\nMOTORCYCLES SEGMENT\n\nMOTORCYCLE DELIVERIES DOWN DURING PANDEMIC YEAR\n\nMotorcycles segment deliveries dropped slightly to 169,272 units (2019: 175,162 units; \u20133.4%) due to the global pandemic. Favourable market developments in the fourth quarter, however, caused the total number of motorcycles delivered over the twelve-month period to exceed the revised outlook announced in the quarterly statement to 30 September 2020.\n\nDELIVERIES BY MARKET\n\nThe spread of the coronavirus caused international motorcycle markets to develop unevenly in 2020. Overall, however, the number of motorcycles delivered by BMW Motorrad worldwide fell only slightly by 2.8% to 102,026 units (2019: 104,994 units). Germany, however, managed to buck the general trend with deliveries up by 4.7% to 27,516 units (2019: 26,292 units). Motorcycle deliveries in France also edged up, rising by 1.4% to 17,539 units (2019: 17,300 units). By contrast, figures for Italy (13,918 units; 2019: 15,580 units; \u201310.7%) and Spain (11,030 units; 2019: 12,607 units; \u201312.5%) \u2013 both of which were particularly hard hit by the pandemic \u2013 dropped sharply year-on-year.\n\nSales in China grew strongly, with motorcycle deliveries climbing by 33.7% to 11,788 units (2019: 8,818 units). Brazil saw a solid increase of 6.4% to 10,707 units (2019: 10,064 units), also bucking the market trend. By contrast, deliveries in the USA fell moderately to 12,135 units (2019: 13,379 units; \u20139.3%).\n\nMARKET LAUNCHES IN 2020: MODEL RANGE REJUVENATED\n\nFour new models and several model revisions were launched in 2020.\n\nIn February, BMW Motorrad completed its mid-range offering with the market launches of the F 900 R (Roadster segment) and the F 900 XR (Adventure segment). The Adventure Sport model S 1000 XR followed in March. In the Heritage segment, the R18 \u2013 a cruiser with the largest boxer engine ever built by BMW Motorrad \u2013 has been available since September. The model revisions of the highly successful Enduro models R 1250 GS and R1250 GSA as well as that of the R nine T family followed in October. In addition, various special editions were introduced to mark the 40th anniversary of the GS series.\nBMW MOTORRAD OFFERS A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE\n\nIn light of the pandemic-related restrictions, BMW Motorrad increasingly turned to virtual formats to showcase its new models over the course of 2020.\n\nIn November 2020, products such as the Definition CE04 \u2013 an electrically powered scooter featuring innovative connectivity solutions for urban mobility \u2013 were presented online using a virtual format on the BMW Group\u2019s innovation platform #NEXTGen.\n\nNumerous series models scheduled for launch in 2021 were also presented online, including the M 1000 RR \u2013 BMW Motorrad\u2019s first-ever M model \u2013 in September. This was followed in October by the launch of the R18 Classic and in November by the launch of the S 1000 R. With the R18 Classic, BMW Motorrad is expanding its product range in the cruiser segment with the addition of a model that is also ideally suited for touring.\n\nRevised models of the G 310 GS, the G 310 R and the R 1250 RT were also presented in October and November.\n\nMOTORCYCLES SEGMENT PERFORMANCE\n\nMotorcycles segment revenues were slightly down year-on-year. The main reasons for this development were the pandemic-related drop in sales and unfavourable currency effects, which were partially offset by positive product mix effects.\n\nThe segment EBIT margin (profit before financial result as a percentage of revenues) came in at 4.5% (2019: 8.2%; \u20133.7 percentage points) and thus within the most recently forecast target range of between 3 and 5%.\n\nProfit before tax for the year was significantly lower than one year earlier.\n\nThe RoCE for the Motorcycles segment in 2020 was 15.0%, significantly down on the previous year\u2019s level (2019: 29.4%; \u201314.4 percentage points), mainly due to the lower level of EBIT.\n\nThe performance was in line with the outlook communicated in the quarterly statement to 30 September 2020, but well short of the Motorcycles segment\u2019s RoCE target valid through 2020 of 26%.\nFINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS HELD DOWN BY CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nIn a difficult environment dominated by the global impact of the coronavirus pandemic, business developed significantly less favourably for the Financial Services segment in 2020 compared to one year earlier, a fact reflected in a 24.1% drop in profit before tax to \u20ac1,725 million (2019: \u20ac2,272 million). As reported in previous quarters, this development was primarily due to the recognition of risk provisioning expenses for credit and residual value risks, thereby reducing reported earnings over the course of the twelve-month period. Due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the segment\u2019s total business volume in balance sheet terms decreased moderately by 6.8% to \u20ac133,093 million (2019: \u20ac142,834 million). The contract portfolio under management at 31 December 2020 comprised 5,981,928 contracts and was therefore at a similar level to one year earlier (2019: 5,973,682 contracts; +0.1%).\n\nNEW BUSINESS WITH RETAIL CUSTOMERS MODERATELY DOWN ON PREVIOUS YEAR\n\nA total of 1,845,271 new credit financing and leasing contracts was signed with retail customers during 2020, a moderate decrease of 7.9% on the previous year (2019: 2,003,782 contracts).\n\nNew credit financing contracts also dropped moderately by 6.2%, while new leasing contracts saw a more pronounced decrease of 11.1%. Overall, leasing accounted for 32.9% and credit financing for 67.1% of new business.\n\nBy contrast, customer demand for pre-owned vehicles picked up in a number of key sales markets including the USA. Overall, a total of 405,713 credit financing and leasing contracts relating to pre-owned BMW and MINI brand vehicles were signed in 2020, a year-on-year improvement of 1.9% (2019: 398,144 contracts).\n\nThe total volume of new credit financing and leasing contracts concluded with retail customers during the twelve-month period amounted to \u20ac57,200 million, moderately lower than one year earlier (2019: \u20ac61,353 million; \u20136.8%).\n\nThe share of new BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services segment stood at 49.8%\u00b9 in 2020, 2.4 percentage points down on the previous year (2019: 52.2%), mainly attributable to increased competition in China.\n\nThe total portfolio of credit financing and leasing contracts in place with retail customers edged up year-on-year, rising by 1.9% to stand at 5,591,799 contracts at the end of the reporting period (2019: 5,486,319 contracts). China remained the region with the highest growth rate, this time coming in with a moderate year-on-year rise of 8.7%. Figures for the Europe/Middle East/Africa region (+2.6%) and the EU Bank\u00b2 region (+2.2%) were also up on the previous year. By contrast, the contract portfolios in the Americas and Asia/Pacific regions fell slightly by 1.1% and 1.9% respectively.\n\nCONTRACT PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\n\nThe calculation only includes automobile markets in which the Financial Services segment is represented by a consolidated entity.\n\nEU Bank comprises BMW Bank GmbH with its branches in Italy, Spain and Portugal.\n\n\u00b9 The calculation only includes automobile markets in which the Financial Services segment is represented by a consolidated entity.\n\n\u00b2 EU Bank comprises BMW Bank GmbH with its branches in Italy, Spain and Portugal.\nBMW GROUP NEW VEHICLES FINANCED OR LEASED BY FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\u00b9\n\n| Year | Financing | Leasing |\n|------|-----------|---------|\n| 2016 | 49.9      | 22.4    |\n| 2017 | 46.7      | 20.7    |\n| 2018 | 50.1      | 21.2    |\n| 2019 | 52.2      | 22.3    |\n| 2020 | 49.8      | 21.4    |\n\nCONTRACT PORTFOLIO RETAIL CUSTOMER FINANCING OF FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT 2020\n\n| Region                  | %  |\n|-------------------------|----|\n| Asia/Pacific            | 7.8|\n| China                   | 13.0|\n| EU Bank\u00b2                | 18.6|\n| Europe/Middle East/Africa | 35.7|\n| Americas                | 24.9|\n\n\u00b9 Values adjusted retrospectively due to the restatement of delivery figures. See Glossary for the definition of deliveries.\n\nFLEET BUSINESS DOWN SLIGHTLY ON PREVIOUS YEAR\n\nUnder the brand name Alphabet, the Financial Services segment\u2019s fleet management business offers leasing and financing arrangements as well as specific services to commercial customers.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the segment was managing a portfolio of 704,977 fleet contracts (2019: 717,353 contracts), down slightly by 1.7% over the twelve-month period.\n\nDEALERSHIP FINANCING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER\n\nThe total volume of dealership financing was significantly lower compared to one year earlier, falling by 23.5% to \u20ac16,241 million at the end of the reporting period (2019: \u20ac21,227 million).\nFINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT PERFORMANCE\n\nRevenues generated by the Financial Services segment rose slightly to \u20ac30,044 million (2019: \u20ac29,598 million; 1.5%; currency-adjusted: +2.9%) due to portfolio growth mainly in Germany, Italy and Switzerland as well as due to higher revenues from the sale of returned lease vehicles.\n\nCost of sales relating to Financial Services business went up by \u20ac1,020 million (2019: \u20ac25,938 million; +3.9%). Apart from depreciation on leased vehicles and costs associated with the sale of returned lease vehicles, the increase was driven primarily by additional risk provisions related to expected residual value and credit losses.\n\nSegment profit before tax amounted to \u20ac1,725 million (2019: \u20ac2,272 million; \u201324.1%), significantly down on the previous year.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE) finished at 11.2%, slightly below the level achieved one year earlier (2019: 15.0%; \u20133.8 percentage points). The decline was primarily attributable to the pandemic-related increase in risk provisions for residual value risks and, to an even greater extent, for credit risks, in both cases causing earnings to deteriorate.\n\nThe improved risk profile in the fourth quarter, mainly due to better remarketing outcomes and lower risk provisions for credit losses, contributed greatly to the RoE for the full year 2020 being above the forecast value (\u201cmoderate decline\u201d) communicated in the quarterly statement to 30 September 2020.\n\nNet cash inflows and outflows for the Financial Services segment were as follows:\n\n| NET CASH FLOWS FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT | 2020 | 2019 | Change |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------|------|--------|\n| Cash inflow (+)/outflow (\u2013) from operating activities | 2,762 | \u20135,345 | 8,107 |\n| Cash inflow (+)/outflow (\u2013) from investing activities | 424 | 129 | 295 |\n| Cash inflow (+)/outflow (\u2013) from financing activities | \u20132,508 | 5,300 | \u20137,808 |\n| Net | 678 | 84 | 594 |\n\nAs described above, the net cash inflow from operating activities recorded by the Financial Services segment for the financial year 2020 resulted primarily from the fact that lower vehicle inventories at dealerships had the effect of reducing receivables from sales financing, mainly in the area of dealership financing. The net cash outflow from financing activities mainly reflected the repayment of loans and the decrease in asset-backed securities financing.\nCHANGE IN RISK PROFILE\n\nIn 2020, the risk profile across the Financial Services segment\u2019s total portfolio was shaped primarily by the volatility arising due to the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting additional risk provisioning measures recognised in connection with expected credit and residual value risks, mainly provisions and allowances to cover future credit and/or residual value losses.\n\nThe initial and continuous testing of customer creditworthiness is an important aspect of the BMW Group\u2019s credit risk management. As explained in previous quarters, for accounting purposes the Financial Services segment has raised credit loss allowances over the course of 2020 in order to reflect the potential longer-term economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on retail and dealership business. The amounts recognised were based on reasonable and appropriate market-specific information and estimates available at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe credit loss ratio on the total credit portfolio amounted to 0.21 % at 31 December 2020, and was therefore slightly lower than one year earlier (2019: 0.26 %). More specifically, the loss ratio stood at 0.16 % (2019: 0.15 %) for leasing business and 0.31 % (2019: 0.41 %) for credit financing business with retail customers. The overall improvement in the loss ratio was also attributable to government measures (such as payment moratoriums or restrictions in the receivables management process) implemented in many countries around the world.\n\nIn the premium segment for pre-owned vehicles, remarketing selling prices for vehicles coming out of leases developed positively overall in 2020. Whereas restrictions on sales and the lower supply of new vehicles had a negative impact on demand for new and pre-owned vehicles during the first lockdown, the market saw an upward trend during the second half of the year. Despite this moderate recovery, economic development remains exposed to an increased level of uncertainty due to the pandemic. This point is particularly relevant for the development of prices for pre-owned premium segment vehicles in the short and medium term. Under the prevailing circumstances, the BMW Group sees prices as likely to fluctuate significantly in subsequent quarters, as in 2020, due to a number of factors, including possible changes in demand patterns or the renewal of temporary restrictions that could have an impact on the remarketing process. Accordingly, in 2020 market-specific risk provisioning expenses were recognised relating to the vehicle portfolio subject to residual value risks.\n\nIn line with customary business practice, the Financial Services segment makes provision to take account of significant business risks on an ongoing and comprehensive basis. Based on current assessments, however, the segment has recognised appropriate levels of provisions/allowances to cover residual value and credit risks.\n\nFurther information on the segment\u2019s risk profile is provided in the section on risks and opportunities and in note 38 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF CREDIT LOSS RATIO\n\nOTHER ENTITIES SEGMENT/ELIMINATIONS\n\nThe combined profit before tax in the Other Entities segment and eliminations saw a significant improvement of \u20ac483 million. This was attributable to reversal effects from the leased products portfolios, lower eliminations due to the decline in new leasing business and the lower expected new leasing business resulting from the reduced levels of inventories at dealerships.\nCOMMENTS ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BMW AG\n\nBayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG), based in Munich, Germany, is the parent company of the BMW Group. The comments on the BMW Group and Automotive segment provided in earlier sections apply to BMW AG, unless presented differently in the following section. The Financial Statements of BMW AG are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the relevant supplementary provisions contained in the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe key financial performance indicator for BMW AG is the dividend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to net profit for the year of the BMW Group in accordance with IFRS). The key non-financial performance indicators are essentially identical and concurrent with those of the BMW Group. These are described in detail in the Report on Economic Position section of the Combined Management Report.\n\nDifferences in accounting treatments based on HGB (used for the Company Financial Statements) and IFRS (used for the Group Financial Statements) are mainly to be found in connection with the capitalisation of intangible assets, the creation of valuation units, the recognition and measurement of financial instruments and provisions as well as the recognition of deferred tax assets. Differences also arise in the presentation of assets and liabilities and of items in the income statement.\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND REVIEW OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe general and sector-specific environment of BMW AG is essentially the same as that of the BMW Group and is described in the Report on Economic Position section of the Combined Management Report.\n\nBMW AG develops, manufactures and sells automobiles and motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories manufactured in-house, by foreign subsidiaries and by external suppliers, and performs services related to these products. Sales activities are carried out primarily through branches, subsidiaries, independent dealerships and importers. Mainly due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, automobile deliveries fell by 305,852 units to 2,249,943 units in the financial year 2020. This figure includes 598,853 units relating to series sets supplied to the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, an increase of 64,215 units over the previous year.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, BMW AG employed a workforce of 84,668 people (31 December 2019: 86,700 people, adjusted). With effect from the financial year 2020, the key performance indicator for the size of the workforce comprises only core and temporary employees. The change in presentation is in line with the change in the internal management system, which now focuses on these employee groups.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nBMW AG INCOME STATEMENT\n\n| in \u20ac million | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenues     | 75,040 | 84,691 |\n| Cost of sales| \u201363,726| \u201370,178|\n| Gross profit | 11,314 | 14,513 |\n| Selling expenses | \u20134,030 | \u20133,979 |\n| Administrative expenses | \u20132,747 | \u20132,776 |\n| Research and development expenses | \u20135,394 | \u20135,528 |\n| Other operating income | 1,237  | 1,295  |\n| Other operating expenses | \u20131,250 | \u20132,526 |\n| Result on investments | 3,084  | 1,858  |\n| Financial result | \u2013280   | 39     |\n| Income taxes | \u2013214   | \u2013767   |\n| Profit after income tax | 1,720  | 2,129  |\n| Other taxes | \u201318    | \u201322    |\n| Net profit | 1,702  | 2,107  |\n| Transfer to revenue reserves | \u2013449   | \u2013461   |\n| Unappropriated profit available for distribution | 1,253  | 1,646  |\n\nRevenues fell by \u20ac9,651 million year-on-year, primarily reflecting the lower volume of deliveries to customers caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In geographical terms, the scale of decline was most pronounced in the Rest of Europe and USA regions. Revenues totalled \u20ac75,040 million (2019: \u20ac84,691 million), of which Group internal revenues accounted for \u20ac49,348 million (2019: \u20ac57,412 million) or 65.8% (2019: 67.8%).\n\nCost of sales went down by 9.2% to \u20ac63,726 million, mostly due to the lower number of deliveries. Expenses incurred in connection with the exhaust gas recirculation cooler, however, along with a number of other items, had a negative impact in the financial year under report. Gross profit fell by \u20ac3,199 million to \u20ac11,314 million.\n\nOverall, selling and general administrative expenses were at a similar level to the previous year.\n\nResearch and development expenses related mainly to new vehicle models (including the iX3* as well as the new 4 Series Coup\u00e9 and Convertible), expenses for the development of reference architectures, drivetrain systems, digital products and automated driving as well as increased expenses in connection with electrification. R&D expenses decreased by 2.4% year-on-year, in line with activities relating to new model start-ups.\n\n* See Fuel Consumption and CO\u2082 Emissions Information.\nOther operating income decreased to \u20ac1,237 million (2019: \u20ac1,295 million), whereby the main reasons for the change were lower income from the reversal of other provisions, offset by higher gains on financial transactions.\n\nOther operating expenses decreased to \u20ac1,250 million (2019: \u20ac2,526 million), mainly due to the prior-year recognition of a provision relating to EU Commission antitrust proceedings.\n\nIncome from profit transfer agreements with Group companies, reported in the line item Result on investments, increased year-on-year. By contrast, financial result deteriorated by \u20ac319 million, mainly due to lower income from designated plan assets offset against pension obligations.\n\nThe expense for income taxes related primarily to withholding taxes incurred during the financial year 2020.\n\nAfter deducting the expense for taxes, the Company reports a net profit of \u20ac1,702 million, compared to \u20ac2,107 million in the previous year.\n\nSubject to the shareholders\u2019 approval of the appropriation of results at the Annual General Meeting, the unappropriated profit available for distribution amounts to \u20ac1,253 million (2019: \u20ac1,646 million). As a percentage of Group net profit, the dividend corresponds to a payout ratio of 32.5% (2019: 32.8%).\n\nFINANCIAL AND NET ASSETS POSITION\n\nBMW AG BALANCE SHEET AT 31 DECEMBER\n\n| ASSETS | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Intangible assets | 488 | 405 |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 12,520 | 12,473 |\n| Investments | 3,826 | 3,762 |\n| Tangible, intangible and investment assets | 16,834 | 16,640 |\n| Inventories | 5,748 | 5,994 |\n| Trade receivables | 778 | 964 |\n| Receivables from subsidiaries | 18,939 | 16,698 |\n| Other receivables and other assets | 3,849 | 3,513 |\n| Marketable securities | 3,336 | 4,109 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 6,822 | 6,757 |\n| Current assets | 39,472 | 38,035 |\n| Prepaid expenses | 73 | 58 |\n| Surplus of pension and similar plan assets over liabilities | 1,261 | 1,086 |\n| Total assets | 57,640 | 55,819 |\nCapital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in the year under report totalled \u20ac2,790 million (2019: \u20ac3,233 million), down by 13.7% compared to the previous year. Depreciation and amortisation amounted to \u20ac2,646 million (2019: \u20ac2,573 million).\n\nInvestments increased to \u20ac3,826 million (2019: \u20ac3,762 million) mainly due to a contribution of \u20ac88 million made to the capital reserves of BMW Bank GmbH, Munich.\n\nInventories decreased to \u20ac5,748 million (2019: \u20ac5,994 million), mainly due to the lower level of finished goods held.\n\nReceivables from subsidiaries rose to \u20ac18,939 million (2019: \u20ac16,698 million), mainly reflecting the higher level of intragroup trade receivables.\n\nThe increase in other receivables and other assets to \u20ac3,849 million (2019: \u20ac3,513 million) was mainly attributable to higher receivables from companies with which an investment relationship exists. The decrease in tax receivables had an offsetting effect.\n\nEquity rose by \u20ac86 million to \u20ac15,165 million due to the transfer to other revenue reserves and the issue of shares of preferred stock in conjunction with the BMW AG\u2019s Employee Share Programme. These increases were offset by the lower balance of unappropriated profit available for distribution compared to the paid-out dividend for the previous financial year. The equity ratio changed from 27.0% to 26.3%.\nIn order to secure pension obligations, cash funds totalling \u20ac531 million were transferred to BMW Trust e.V., Munich, in conjunction with a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA), to be invested in plan assets. Plan assets are offset against the related guaranteed obligations. The resulting surplus of assets over liabilities is reported in the BMW AG balance sheet on the line item Surplus of pension and similar plan assets over liabilities.\n\nProvisions for pensions increased from \u20ac205 million to \u20ac229 million, after offsetting of pension plan assets against pension obligations.\n\nOther provisions increased year-on-year, mainly due to additions to provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty and product guarantees obligations in connection with the exhaust gas recirculation cooler on the one hand and for selling activities on the other.\n\nLiabilities to banks decreased by \u20ac410 million as a result of the repayment of project-related loans.\n\nLiabilities to subsidiaries increased to \u20ac23,404 million (2019: \u20ac21,777 million), mainly in connection with intragroup refinancing.\n\nDeferred income increased by \u20ac118 million to \u20ac3,615 million and included mainly amounts for services still to be performed relating to service and maintenance contracts.\n\nLiquidity within the BMW Group is ensured by means of a liquidity concept applied uniformly across the Group. This involves concentrating a significant part of the Group\u2019s liquidity at the level of BMW AG. An important instrument in this context is the cash pool based at BMW AG. The liquidity position reported by BMW AG therefore reflects the global activities of BMW AG and other Group companies.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased by \u20ac65 million to \u20ac6,822 million, mainly due to surpluses from operating activities and cash inflows from marketable securities held as current assets. Cash outflows from financing activities and investments in long-lived assets particularly had an offsetting effect.\n\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nBMW AG\u2019s performance is essentially dependent on the same set of risks and opportunities that affect the BMW Group and which are described in detail in the Report on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities section of the Combined Management Report. As a general rule, BMW AG participates in the risks entered into by Group companies in proportion to the respective shareholding percentage. At the same time, the result on investments has a significant impact on the earnings of BMW AG.\n\nBMW AG is integrated in the Group-wide risk management system and internal control system of the BMW Group. Further information is provided in the section Internal Control System Relevant for Accounting and Financial Reporting Processes within the Combined Management Report.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nFor the financial year 2021, BMW AG expects a dividend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to net profit for the year of the BMW Group in accordance with IFRS) within a range of between 30% and 40% (2020: 32.5%).\n\nDue to its significance in the Group and its close ties with Group companies, expectations for BMW AG with respect to its non-financial performance indicators correspond largely to the BMW Group\u2019s outlook. This is described in detail in the Report on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities section of the Combined Management Report. The outlook for 2021 takes account of the expected impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Munich branch, has issued an unqualified audit opinion on the financial statements of BMW AG, of which the balance sheet and the income statement are presented here. The BMW AG financial statements for the financial year 2020 will be submitted to the operator of the electronic version of the German Federal Gazette and can be obtained via the Company Register website. These financial statements are available on the BMW Group\u2019s website at www.bmwgroup.com/ir.\nREPORT ON OUTLOOK, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s report on outlook, risks and opportunities presents the expected development in 2021, including the main risks and opportunities from the perspective of the Group\u2019s management. In line with the Group\u2019s internal management system, the outlook covers a period of one year. Risks and opportunities are managed on the basis of a two-year assessment. The Report on Risks and Opportunities therefore addresses a period of two years.\n\nThe continuous forecasting process within the BMW Group ensures that it is always ready to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, but also to react appropriately to unexpected risks. The principal risks and opportunities are described in detail in the Report on Risks and Opportunities. The matters discussed therein are relevant for all of the BMW Group\u2019s key performance indicators and could result in variances between the outlook and actual outcomes.\n\nECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nAccording to the latest assessment of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is projected to grow by 5.5% in 2021. Many countries are expected to continue implementing a comprehensive range of monetary and fiscal policy measures in 2021, in a bid to boost economies battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, post-lockdown catch-up effects could generate additional momentum. Ultimately, however, the actual growth rate will depend heavily on the success of the vaccination campaigns now underway. Potential new waves of the virus and its mutations pose an additional risk. Further information on political and global economic risks is also provided in the Report on Risks and Opportunities.\n\nThe eurozone economy is projected to grow by around 4.3% in 2021. The rate for Germany, however, is likely to be somewhat lower (+3.6%). The economic outlook for the other eurozone member states is very positive in some cases, with countries such as France (+5.6%), Italy (+4.6%) and Spain (+5.7%) expected to post strong GDP growth over the forecast period.\n\nThe performance of the UK economy in 2021 will not only depend on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but also on that of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement reached with the EU. The latest projection for the UK economy is a growth rate of 4.6%.\n\nThe US economy is also projected to grow considerably by 4.8% in 2021. The US Federal Reserve is likely to continue pursuing its low-interest-rate policies. At the same time, the stimulus packages announced by US President Biden are expected to provide a boost to the economy.\n\nThe Japanese economy, which has also been severely affected by the pandemic, is projected to grow by 2.8% in 2021.\n\nChina was the only economy to expand slightly in 2020. With a projected rate of 8.4%, the Chinese economy is set to continue its growth course in 2021.\n\nCURRENCY MARKETS\n\nCurrencies of particular importance for the international operations of the BMW Group are the US dollar, the British pound, the Chinese renminbi and the Japanese yen. All of these major currencies are expected to be subject to a high degree of fluctuation in 2021.\nIt seems reasonable to assume that the US Federal Reserve will continue its expansionary monetary policies in 2021. The USA\u2019s central bank may also be willing to allow inflation to run at a rate higher than 2% in future, even over an extended period of time, thereby possibly leading to further depreciation of the US dollar against the euro.\n\nLooking at the Chinese renminbi, the close economic ties between the USA and China suggest that the currencies of these two countries will develop more or less synchronously. The renminbi is expected to depreciate slightly against the euro in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, the value of the British pound will be largely determined by the consequences of the agreement reached between the UK government and the EU. In view of the prevailing uncertainties, the exchange rate of the relatively weak pound is expected to move sideways over the course of 2021.\n\nThe central bank in Japan is unlikely to change its highly expansionary monetary policy in 2021. For this reason, the euro/yen exchange rate is also expected to remain more or less stable.\n\nThe currencies of numerous emerging markets could come under pressure against the US dollar and the euro due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. This applies in particular to countries such as Russia, Brazil and India.\n\n### INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOBILE MARKETS\n\nThe pandemic will continue to have a perceptible impact on international automobile markets in 2021. Although new registrations are expected to rise to around 78 million units (+7.7%), overall sales are likely to remain significantly lower than before the coronavirus crisis.\n\nEurope\u2019s automobile markets are forecast to see significant growth (12.4 million units; +4.2%), albeit still below pre-crisis levels. The latest forecast for Germany indicates that new registrations may even decline slightly (2.9 million units; \u22120.6%). By contrast, considerable growth is predicted for France (1.8 million units; +9.1%), Italy (1.5 million units; +9.0%) and Spain (approximately 0.9 million units; +4.3%). Likewise, new registrations in the UK are forecast to rise in 2021 (1.7 million units; +3.2%).\n\nThe negative trend in the USA is also expected to come to an end, at least for the time being. Based on current forecasts, the US market is set to grow in 2021 and reach a total of 16.0 million units (+9.8%).\n\nAccording to current estimates, passenger car registrations in China are likely to rise sharply year-on-year (22.0 million units; +7.6%).\n\nThe Japanese market is also expected to show a significant upward trend in 2021 (around 4.7 million units; +6.0%).\n\n### INTERNATIONAL MOTORCYCLE MARKETS\n\nThe BMW Group expects worldwide motorcycle markets in the 250 cc plus class to grow slightly overall in 2021. After contracting in 2020, demand in Spain is likely to see a solid recovery. Market volumes are expected to be slightly higher in Italy and slightly lower in Germany and France. A slight contraction is also forecast for the US market. Brazil is expected to bounce back with a solid recovery. The market in China is set to grow sharply again in 2021. As in the past year, motorcycle market demand will continue to be influenced by the course of the pandemic and its impact on the global economy in 2021.\nINTERNATIONAL INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT\n\nTrade relations between the USA and China should improve under the new US administration, whilst still remaining strained. Low inflation rates give central banks sufficient headroom to continue their expansionary monetary policies. However, the rise in inflation rates since the beginning of the year, especially in the eurozone, indicates that consumer prices are also likely to increase again in the course of 2021.\n\nWithin the eurozone, the course of the pandemic and delays in the vaccine rollout suggest that the pathway back to normality could take some time yet. Any further lockdowns during the first half of the year could dampen economic growth and hold down inflation figures, potentially leaving the ECB with little flexibility to raise interest rates in 2021.\n\nThe UK\u2019s economy is not expected to improve significantly during the first quarter. Following the initial success of the vaccination programme, the UK government is now looking to ease the lockdown on a cautious step-by-step basis. It remains to be seen, however, to what extent the virus mutation circulating there could cause the situation to deteriorate again. In light of the fiscal and monetary policy measures taken by the government and the Bank of England, the economy is not expected to see an upturn before the summer. It is therefore safe to assume that the Bank of England will keep interest rates stable for the time being.\n\nIn the USA, the House of Representatives has approved President Biden\u2019s 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus package aimed at countering the impact of the pandemic on the economy. Despite inflation being expected to rise in 2021, the Federal Reserve seems determined to continue its current programme of quantitative easing and leave the benchmark interest rate unchanged.\n\nThe Chinese central bank is expected to maintain an unchanged course. Despite strained trade relations with the USA, economic growth in China is likely to gather additional pace in 2021.\n\nCONSEQUENCES FOR THE BMW GROUP\n\nFuture developments on international automobile markets also have a direct impact on the BMW Group. Challenges in the competitive environment as well as the course of the coronavirus pandemic are likely to have a significant impact on sales volumes. Due to its global business model, the BMW Group is well placed to capitalise on opportunities that present themselves, even at short notice. Coordination between the Group\u2019s sales and production networks also enables it to even out the impact of unforeseeable developments in various regions. Moreover, investments in key future-oriented markets form a sound basis for further growth, while simultaneously strengthening the global presence of the BMW Group.\n\nAn unpredictable political environment may cause actual economic growth in some regions to deviate from expected trends and developments. Areas affected in this context include trade and customs policies, security and potential additional international trade conflicts.\n\nFurthermore, risks continue to exist for upstream processes, including possible bottlenecks due to supply shortages arising in regions that could become the focus of a pandemic. Due to the high demand on international semiconductor markets, there is currently an additional risk of bottlenecks in the supply of electronic components to production.\n\nThe BMW Group continues to observe these developments and is ready to implement all necessary measures quickly and effectively.\n\nASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OUTLOOK\n\nThe report on outlook, risks and opportunities contains forward-looking statements. These are based on the BMW Group\u2019s expectations and assessments and may be influenced by unforeseeable events. As a result, actual outcomes can deviate either positively or negatively from the expectations described below, among other things due to changes in the political and economic environment as well as the further course of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe following outlook relates to a forecast period of one year and is based on the composition of the BMW Group during that time. The outlook takes account of all information available at the time of reporting and which could have an effect on the overall performance of the Group. The expectations contained in the outlook are based on the BMW Group\u2019s forecast for 2021 and reflect its most recent status. The basis for the preparation of and the principal assumptions used in the forecasts \u2013 which consider the consensual opinions of leading organisations, such as economic research institutes and banks \u2013 are set out below. The BMW Group\u2019s outlook takes account of these assumptions.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic will continue to have an impact on business performance in 2021 and hence on the results of operations, financial position and net assets of BMW AG and the BMW Group. Due to the continuing uncertainty surrounding the course and potential consequences of the pandemic going forward, it is difficult to make an accurate forecast of the BMW Group\u2019s business performance in 2021. For the forecast year 2021, the BMW Group is working on the basis that the original widespread prevalence of the infection that was the dominant feature of 2020 will be replaced by recurrent, regional hotspots. The outlook has been therefore been drawn up on the assumption that, outside of hot spots, the overall incidence of infection can be controlled worldwide. The successive launch of vaccination campaigns and improved vaccine supply should also have an increasingly positive effect in 2021.\n\nUncertainties remain, however, as mutated strains of the virus emerge and spread, raising questions about the efficacy of currently available vaccines in combating mutations. It is not possible to assess the extent to which such risks could impact the global economy, the financial markets and therefore the BMW Group and, for this reason, they have not been taken into account in the outlook.\n\nWith demand on international semiconductor markets currently at a high level, the supply situation for electronic chips has become increasingly tense, which could result in supply bottlenecks affecting the availability of semiconductor components required for production. The BMW Group is monitoring the situation closely. Should the situation deteriorate further and significant supply bottlenecks occur, it cannot be ruled out that this will have an adverse impact on the outlook.\n\nThe BMW Group expects that the tensions between the USA and China will persist after the change in the US administration and remain a source of uncertainty. However, based on up-to-date assessments, customs tariffs are not expected to rise.\n\nCurrent estimates and assumptions for the financial year 2021, to the extent already known to the BMW Group, have been taken into account and described in the outlook report. Beyond these assessments, no further significant opportunities and risks are known or can be estimated at the present time. However, it cannot be ruled out that the assumptions underlying estimates may need to be changed over the course of the year.\n\nOUTLOOK FOR THE BMW GROUP\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT BY GROUP MANAGEMENT\n\nDespite the volatile situation brought about by the global spread of coronavirus, the BMW Group expects business to develop positively and the risk situation to remain stable in the financial year 2021. New automobile and motorcycle models as well as individual mobility-related services are expected to generate momentum. Group profit before tax is therefore expected to rise significantly during the outlook period.\n\nThe Automotive segment is expected to record a solid year-on-year increase in the number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles delivered to customers. At the same time, the BMW Group is targeting a further significant reduction in carbon emissions in the new vehicle fleet\u00b9, calculated using the revised base\u00b2. In addition to improvements achieved through developments in highly efficient combustion engines, the expected reduction also reflects the significant increase in the forecast proportion of electrified vehicles sold. According to the planning, carbon emissions per vehicle produced are likely to fall moderately. The Automotive segment\u2019s EBIT margin is set to recover in 2021, most likely finishing within a range of 6 to 8% and thus causing the segment RoCE to improve significantly.\n\n\u00b9 EU including Norway and Iceland; since 2018 figure based on WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure) and converted back to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).\n\u00b2 Efficiency indicator calculated on the basis of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (i.e. a market-based method according to GHG protocol Scope 2 guidance that excludes climate-changing gases other than carbon dioxide) of vehicle production excluding motorcycles, adjusted for CHP losses and divided by the total number of vehicles produced, including the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, but excluding vehicles produced by the contract manufacturers Magna Steyr and Nedcar.\nThe RoE in the Financial Services segment is expected to finish within a range of 12 to 15%. The switch to a forecast corridor for RoE allows for a narrower and therefore more precise outlook.\n\nThe Motorcycles segment is expected to record a solid increase in deliveries to customers. The EBIT margin is predicted to lie within the target range of 8 to 10%, enabling the segment to record a significantly higher level of RoCE than one year earlier.\n\nThe proportion of women in management positions in the BMW Group is expected to increase slightly.\n\nThe targets described above are to be met with a slightly lower number of employees.\n\nOngoing uncertainty, particularly regarding the further course of the coronavirus pandemic, macroeconomic and political developments as well as international trade and customs policies, could cause economic conditions in many regions to differ quite considerably from expected trends and developments. All these factors could have significant effects on the overall business performance of the BMW Group. Furthermore, the Group\u2019s actual business performance may also differ from current expectations as a result of the risks and opportunities discussed below in the Report on Risks and Opportunities.\n\n### BMW GROUP KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n| Segment | 2020 reported | 2020 adjusted | 2021 Outlook |\n|---------|---------------|---------------|--------------|\n| **GROUP** |               |               |              |\n| Profit before tax | \u20ac million | 5,222 | \u2013 | Significant increase |\n| Workforce at year-end | \u2013 | 120,726 | \u2013 | Slight decrease |\n| Share of women in management positions in the BMW Group | % | 17.8 | \u2013 | Slight increase |\n| **AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT** |               |               |              |\n| Deliveries to customers | units | 2,324,809 | \u2013 | Solid increase |\n| Share of electrified vehicles in deliveries | % | 8.3 | \u2013 | Significant increase |\n| CO\u2082-Emissions EU New Vehicle Fleet | g/km | 99 | 135 | Significant decrease |\n| CO\u2082 emissions per vehicle produced | tons | 0.23 | 0.31 | Moderate decrease |\n| EBIT margin | % | 2.7 | \u2013 | between 6 and 8 |\n| Return on capital employed | % | 12.7 | \u2013 | Significant increase |\n| **MOTORCYCLES SEGMENT** |               |               |              |\n| Deliveries to customers | units | 169,272 | \u2013 | Solid increase |\n| EBIT margin | % | 4.5 | \u2013 | between 8 and 10 |\n| Return on capital employed | % | 15.0 | \u2013 | Significant increase |\n| **FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT** |               |               |              |\n| Return on equity | % | 11.2 | \u2013 | between 12 and 15 |\n\n1.

The CO\u2082 fleet emissions figure of 99 g/km for the year 2020, as measured internally, is based on NEDC and takes due account of permitted offsetting factors (phase-in, super credits and eco-innovations). The CO\u2082 fleet emissions forecast for 2021 is based on WLTP in accordance with legal requirements and includes fewer offsetting factors due to the fact that phase-in is no longer permitted for 2021 and the BMW Group fully utilised the maximum amount of super credits in 2020. For better comparability of the CO\u2082 fleet emissions forecast for 2021 and the fleet value for 2020, the 2020 figure has been converted internally from an NEDC basis (including offsetting factors) to a WLTP basis (excluding offsetting factors). The figure derived for 2020 serves only to enable reconciliation with the 2021 figure; it is not official and does not correspond to legislation that was in place in 2020.\n8. From 2021, CO\u2082 emissions according to Scope 1 and 2 include not only production emissions but also emissions at locations not allocated to production, e.g. research centres, distribution centres, office buildings.\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nAs a globally leading provider of premium automobiles, motorcycles, mobility services and financial services, the BMW Group is exposed to an array of uncertainties and changes. To ensure growth, profitability, efficiency and continued sustainability going forward, the BMW Group needs to take well calculated risks and make full use of any opportunities that present themselves.\n\nThe management of opportunities and risks is essential in order to respond in an appropriate manner to any changes that occur in political, economic, technical or legal conditions. The BMW Group has put a comprehensive risk management system in place to effectively with risks as they arise. The aim of the risk management system is to identify, assess and actively manage any risks that could threaten the attainment of the Group\u2019s corporate targets. As part of that process, individual and cumulative risks capable of posing a threat to the profitability of the business are monitored and managed.\n\nAll opportunities and risks expected to materialise have already been addressed in the Outlook Report. The following sections focus on potential future developments or events that could result in a positive (opportunity) or a negative deviation (risk) from the outlook for the BMW Group.\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK AND OPPORTUNITIES SITUATION\n\nThe assessment of the overall risk situation is based on a consolidated view of all significant individual risks. The overall risk situation for the BMW Group has worsened moderately compared to one year earlier, reflecting \u2013 in the worst-case scenario \u2013 a significant deterioration in the global economic situation due to the coronavirus pandemic. The BMW Group has already adjusted its sales and production planning to take account of expected macroeconomic developments and incorporated their impact in the outlook. Should the effect of the pandemic prove less severe in 2021 and if the economy recovers more quickly than expected, opportunities for both revenues and earnings could arise.\n\nManagement does not see any threat to the BMW Group\u2019s status as a going concern. Similar to one year earlier, the current set of risks to the BMW Group are considered manageable. If these risks \u2013 or opportunities \u2013 were to materialise, they could have an impact on underlying key performance indicators, thus causing deviations from the outlook. The BMW Group\u2019s financial resources are stable, with liquidity requirements currently covered by existing liquidity and available financing instruments.\n\nIn addition to the risks described below, unforeseen events could have a negative impact on business operations and hence on the BMW Group\u2019s results of operations, financial position and net assets as well as on its reputation.\n\nORGANISATION OF RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk management is organised as a decentralised, Group-wide network and steered by a centralised risk management function. Every BMW Group division is represented by Network Representatives. This formal structure reinforces the network\u2019s visibility and underlines the importance of risk management within the BMW Group. The responsibilities and duties of the centralised risk management function and the Network Representatives are clearly documented and understood. Significant risks reported from within the network are firstly presented for review to the Risk Management Steering Committee, which is chaired by Group Controlling. After review, any significant risks identified are reported to both the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee.\n\nOther functions such as Compliance and Human Rights and the Internal Control System serve as key interfaces to the risk management system. In its capacity as an independent control body, Corporate Audit reviews the risk management system established by the Board of Management on an annual basis.\nAccording to Group-wide guidelines, every employee and manager has a duty to report risks via the relevant reporting channels. The key elements of an effective risk culture are embedded in the BMW Group\u2019s core values, in its risk management guidelines and in the risk strategy. New information and new requirements are continuously fed into the BMW Group\u2019s risk management system, thereby ensuring its ongoing development. Training programmes and informational events are regularly conducted across the BMW Group, particularly within the risk management network. These measures are essential ways of preparing those involved in the process to comply with any new or additional requirements.\n\nThe risk management process applies across the entire Group and comprises the early identification, analysis and assessment of risks, the coordinated use of appropriate management tools and the monitoring and evaluation of the measures taken.\n\nThe BMW Group utilises standardised methods to assess risks. All significant risks are measured using value-at-risk models and assessed on the basis of uniform loss distribution metrics, thereby enabling better comparability of risks for both internal and external reporting purposes. The overall effect of risks on the results of operations, financial and net assets position is referred to in the following sections uniformly as \u201cearnings impact\u201d.\n\nRisks are classified both according to their potential impact on earnings (worst-case scenario) and according to the risk amount (average earnings impact, taking into account the probability of occurrence). The impact of risks is measured and reported net of any mitigation measures that are already taking effect (net basis). Risks are measured over a two-year assessment period.\nThe potential earnings impact in the worst-case scenario is classified as follows:\n\n| Class  | Potential earnings impact in a worst-case scenario |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Low    | > \u20ac0 \u2013 500 million                                 |\n| Medium | > \u20ac500 \u2013 2,000 million                             |\n| High   | > \u20ac2,000 million                                   |\n\nThe following criteria apply for the purpose of classifying the risk amount:\n\n| Class  | Risk amount |\n|--------|-------------|\n| Low    | > \u20ac0 \u2013 50 million |\n| Medium | > \u20ac50 \u2013 400 million |\n| High   | > \u20ac400 million |\n\nThe earnings impact of risks and opportunities is presented separately without offsetting. If no specific reference is made, opportunities and risks relate to the Automotive segment. The scope of entities covered in the report on risks and opportunities corresponds to the scope of consolidated entities included in the BMW Group Financial Statements.\n\n**MONITORING RISK-BEARING CAPACITY**\n\nGroup-wide effects and trends can be identified by aggregating all significant risks at Group level using value-at-risk models. For this purpose, the potential earnings impact of the risks (confidence level: 99%) is aggregated, taking correlation effects into account. In order to assess the risk-bearing capacity of the BMW Group, the aggregated amount of risks is compared with the risk cover amount (equity recognised for accounting purposes). A limit system for various risks helps monitor the risk-bearing capacity.\n\n**MANAGING NON-FINANCIAL RISKS AS REPORTED IN THE NFS**\n\nAlongside comprehensive risk management, sustainability constitutes a core strategic principle of the BMW Group. Risks resulting from sustainability issues are generally identified via the Group-wide risk management network.\n\nWhen analysing sustainability-related opportunities and risks, the physical risks associated with climate change (e.g. disruption of supply chains due to natural hazards) and transition risks (such as meeting emissions requirements) are also assessed.\n\nIn accordance with \u00a7 289 c of the German Commercial Code (HGB) risks that could have an impact on the non-financial aspects referred to in the Act are reviewed as part of the reporting process. Significant risks in this context are defined as those stemming from business activities, business relationships and products and/or services provided by the BMW Group that are highly likely to have a seriously adverse impact. No significant non-financial risks were identified during the year under report.\n\n**OPPORTUNITIES MANAGEMENT**\n\nA dynamic market environment also gives rise to opportunities. Identifying these opportunities is an integral part of the BMW Group\u2019s strategic planning process. The Group\u2019s range of products and services is continually reviewed on the basis of these analyses, resulting, for example, in new product projects being presented to the Board of Management for consideration. In order to compete successfully in the long term and at the same time effectively help play an active role in achieving the goal of climate neutrality \u2013 as called for by politicians and desired by society in general \u2013 the Group\u2019s vehicle platforms are designed to operate flexibly with various types of drivetrain, enabling it to respond more swiftly to changing customer needs.\n\nThe continuous monitoring of key business processes and strict cost controls are also essential for ensuring high levels of profitability and return on capital employed.\n\nOnce identified, opportunities are acted upon in the relevant operational areas on a decentralised basis. The importance of opportunities for the BMW Group is classified on a qualitative basis in the categories \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cinsignificant\u201d. Probable measures aimed at increasing profitability are already incorporated in the outlook.\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe following table provides an overview of significant risks and opportunities and indicates their level of importance for the BMW Group. Overall, no risks capable of threatening the continued existence of the BMW Group were identified either at the balance sheet date or at the date on which the Group Financial Statements were drawn up. Due to the particular features of the business model applied for the Financial Services segment, risks and opportunities relating to it are presented separately on the Risk Management System in the Financial Services Segment.\n\n| Classification of risk amount | Change compared to prior year | Classification | Change compared to prior year |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| **RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES**  |                               |                |                               |\n| Macroeconomic risks and opportunities | High | Stable | Significant | Increased |\n| Strategic and sector risks and opportunities | High | Stable | Insignificant | Stable |\n| Changes in legislation and regulatory requirements | High | Stable | Insignificant | Stable |\n| Market developments | High | Stable | Insignificant | Stable |\n| Risks and opportunities relating to operations | High | Stable | Insignificant | Stable |\n| Production and technology | High | Stable | Insignificant | Stable |\n| Purchasing | High | Increased | Insignificant | Stable |\n| Sales network | Low | Stable | Insignificant | Stable |\n| Information, data protection and IT | High | Stable | Insignificant | Stable |\n| Financial risks and opportunities | High | Increased | Significant | Stable |\n| Foreign currencies | Medium | Stable | Significant | Stable |\n| Raw materials | Medium | Stable | Significant | Stable |\n| Liquidity | Medium | Increased | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Other financial risks | Medium | \u2013 | Significant | \u2013 |\n| Pension obligations | High | Stable | Significant | Stable |\n| Legal risks | Medium | Stable | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n\nMACROECONOMIC RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nEconomic conditions have an impact on business performance and hence the level of earnings generated by the BMW Group. Unforeseen disruptions in global economic relations can have highly unpredictable effects. Macroeconomic risks due to sales volume fluctuations could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amounts attached to macroeconomic risks are classified as high.\n\nCurrently, the greatest risk for the global economy is the further spread and the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. Considerable uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic going forward, despite the current decline in infection figures. The situation is highly dependent on the progress and success of the vaccination campaigns currently underway. It is not currently possible to predict with any degree of certainty the point in time from which a high vaccination rate could significantly mitigate the course of the pandemic. As a result, restrictions to public life and regional lockdowns are likely to be a continued source of uncertainty for consumers and weigh heavily on the sales situation across all markets. The BMW Group is monitoring the situation on a continuous basis and taking appropriate measures as required.\nHowever, risks that existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic still remain, despite being partially displaced in the public perception. The trade conflict between the USA and China is likely to be an enduring topic, despite the inauguration of the new US president. However, the focus could well shift from pure tariff increases to import and export restrictions on certain technologies. The potential introduction of further trade restrictions on both sides could have a significantly adverse impact on the BMW Group\u2019s business operations due to less favourable economic activity in the affected regions could be negatively influenced. For instance, economic activity in the affected regions could be negatively influenced. For consumers, this would mean a loss of income and the threat of unemployment and have a negative effect on sales. In the context of its \u201cAdaptation to Climate Change\u201d project, the BMW Group is preparing for numerous possible scenarios and has taken the step of systematically integrating the reporting of opportunities and risks associated with climate change within this report.\n\nIn the wake of ongoing climate change, natural disasters could occur more frequently and impact the BMW Group in a variety of ways. For instance, economic activity in the affected regions could be negatively influenced. For consumers, this would mean a loss of income and the threat of unemployment and have a negative effect on sales. In the context of its \u201cAdaptation to Climate Change\u201d project, the BMW Group is preparing for numerous possible scenarios and has taken the step of systematically integrating the reporting of opportunities and risks associated with climate change within this report.\n\nOther risks to the economy include political instability in Belarus, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, political unrest in the USA, the impact of the change in Hong Kong\u2019s status, and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of debt levels in some European countries.\n\nIf the coronavirus is overcome with the help of effective vaccines over the course of 2021, opportunities could arise for the BMW Group in terms of revenues and earnings. Significantly higher GDP growth in our strongest sales regions, positive signals in Europe and the USA on the back of new economic stimulus packages, and a de-escalation of the trade conflict between the USA and its economic partners could result in significantly stronger sales volume growth, reduced competitive pressures and improved pricing. Against this backdrop, macroeconomic opportunities capable of generating a sustainably positive impact on earnings are currently classified by the BMW Group as significant.\n\n**STRATEGIC AND SECTOR-SPECIFIC RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES; CHANGES IN LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**\n\nThe short-term introduction of more stringent legislation and regulations, particularly with regard to emissions, safety and consumer protection as well as regional, vehicle-related purchase and usage taxes, represents a significant risk for the automobile industry. Country- and sector-specific trade barriers can also be subject to change at short notice. Any sudden tightening of regulations in these areas could necessitate significantly higher investments and ongoing expenses or exert influence on customer behaviour. If the risk of market disruption due to unforeseeable short-term changes in legislation and regulations were to materialise, this could have a highly negative earnings impact over the two-year assessment period and beyond. The resulting risk amounts are therefore classified as high.\n\nAt present, the BMW Group sees a continuous trend towards increasingly stringent vehicle emissions regulations, particularly for conventional drivetrain systems. The BMW Group is addressing this risk primarily by systematically electrifying its entire portfolio of brands and models: based on its existing plans, the BMW Group will already have 25 electrified models on the road by 2023.\n\nAt the same time, the Group is pressing ahead with the continued development of highly efficient combustion engines in order to further reduce fuel consumption and emissions.\n\nAdditional risks could result from the tightening of existing import and export regulations, which could, in turn, lead primarily to additional expenses, but also complicate the import and export of vehicles and parts.\n\nChanges in trade policies could also have a positive impact on the BMW Group\u2019s earnings in the short to medium term. Any reduction in tariff barriers, import restrictions or direct excise duties could result in lower manufacturing costs or enable products and services to be offered to customers at more attractive prices. Further opportunities to improve the BMW Group\u2019s earnings performance due to changes in legislation and regulatory requirements compared to the outlook are classified as insignificant.\n\n**Market developments**\n\nApart from economic factors and sector-specific political conditions, increasingly fierce competition among established manufacturers and the emergence of new market competitors could also have effects that are difficult to predict. Unforeseen consumer preferences and changes in brand perceptions can also give rise to both opportunities and risks. If market risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount is classified as high.\nA potential further intensification in terms of competition could put pressure on sales volumes, selling prices and margins. For instance, the BMW Group could be confronted with supply and demand distortions in the transition from conventionally powered vehicles to alternative drivetrain concepts, despite complying with legal requirements. Customer behaviour can also alter due to changes in attitudes, values, environmental factors and fuel or energy prices. The flexibility of the BMW Group\u2019s sales and production processes makes it possible to mitigate risks and take any opportunities arising in corresponding market and product segments.\n\nLocal product usage restrictions in specific sectors could have a limiting impact on the BMW Group\u2019s sales in individual markets. In some urban areas, for instance, local measures have been, or are being, introduced, including entry restrictions, congestion charges or, in some situations, highly restrictive registration rules. These could influence local demand for the BMW Group vehicles affected and hence have a negative impact on sales, margins and, possibly, the residual values of these vehicles. Among other measures, the BMW Group is addressing this risk by broadening its range of electrified vehicles and mobility services.\n\nMoreover, the BMW Group continuously monitors its sales markets with the aim of increasing added value for customers and making the most of opportunities in terms of sales volume growth and pricing. The further development of the product and mobility portfolio as well as expansion in growth regions offer the greatest medium- to long-term growth opportunities for the BMW Group. This depends above all on the Group\u2019s ability to develop innovative products and services and bring them to market. If the negative impact of the current competitive situation is reduced more quickly than expected, additional opportunities are likely to arise for the BMW Group. Compared to the assumptions made in the outlook, the BMW Group does not expect these opportunities to have a significant earnings impact over the two-year assessment period.\n\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES RELATING TO OPERATIONS\n\nRisks and opportunities relating to production and technologies\n\nRisks relating to production processes and fields of technology can lead to unplanned production interruptions or additional costs due to vehicle recalls. If any such risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The corresponding risk amounts are classified as high.\n\nPotential causes of production downtimes include fires, infrastructural damage, machine and tooling breakdowns, IT malfunctions, temporary disruptions in utility supply or transportation and logistical disruptions, or the outbreak of a pandemic. All production units have a variety of measures in place to deal with potential production interruptions and downtimes, some of which are already integrated in the planning process and can be implemented operationally with a high degree of flexibility. These measures have an effect on both the amount of damage and the probability of the risks occurring.\n\nTechnical fire protection, rapid response by on-site fire brigades and appropriate employee training are the key strategies for preventing and reducing any potential damage from fires. Furthermore, policies are in place with insurance companies of high credit standing to cover the risk of fire-related events that lead to significant production interruptions at the Group\u2019s or at suppliers\u2019 premises.\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s successful business continuity management concept helps minimise downtimes in the event of a production stoppage and make up for lost production volumes as quickly as possible.\n\nFlexible working time models and working time accounts designed to manage employee deployment, coupled with the ability to build individual vehicle models or engine types with a high degree of flexibility at other BMW Group plants as required, make a significant contribution to ensuring that fluctuations in demand can be met.\n\nDetect-analyse-respond measures have been rolled out to counter the threat of targeted cyberattacks, reflecting the fact that such attacks could cause damage to production facilities, resulting in long downtimes and substantial losses.\n\nVehicles may be damaged or destroyed by natural hazards or other risks during transport from production plants to the sales regions. Due to the growing number of major claims, deductible amounts included in transport insurance policies have risen significantly. In fact, as more and more insurance companies withdraw from this market segment, there is a risk that it could become economically unviable to take out insurance, as a result of which the BMW Group would be required to bear the losses itself.\nThe BMW Group recognises appropriate provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations. It cannot be ruled out, however, that additional costs arise in conjunction with vehicle recalls that are either not covered or not fully covered by provisions. Despite thorough quality assurance processes, such risks can always arise if the materials and/or processing procedures used prove insufficient, in some cases years after a product is launched. Further information on risks in conjunction with provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations is provided in note 33 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nThe BMW Group sees opportunities relating to production processes and fields of technology primarily in the competitive edge gained by mastering new and complex technologies. Innovations in the technologies deployed and in IT in general are driving the pace of digitalisation in production processes. Given the long lead times involved in developing new products and processes, additional opportunities are not expected to have a significant earnings impact for the BMW Group during the outlook period.\n\nRisks and opportunities relating to purchasing\n\nPurchasing risks relate primarily to supply risks caused by the failure of a supplier to deliver as well as to threats to BMW Group-relevant know-how within the supplier network. Production problems at supplier level could lead to consequences caused by increased expenditure for the BMW Group due to production interruptions and a corresponding reduction in vehicle sales. The BMW Group deploys an extensive set of checks and proactive management measures to tackle the challenges currently facing the automotive supply industry. If purchasing risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount attached to purchasing risks is classified as high.\n\nClose cooperation between carmakers and suppliers in the development and production of vehicles and the provision of services generates economic benefits, but also raises levels of dependency. Potential reasons for the failure of individual suppliers to deliver include, in particular, IT-related risks, non-compliance with sustainability or quality standards and the occurrence of natural hazards and fires. Insufficient financial capacity on the part of individual suppliers could also jeopardise supplies to production plants. In this context, additional countermeasures have been put in place in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMoreover, any major deterioration of a particular country\u2019s national security situation is incorporated in the risk measurement process as a potential reason for the failure of a value and/or supply chain. Any risks potentially arising for individual suppliers and/or entire supply chains in conjunction with the need to adapt to the consequences of climate change are continually assessed on the basis of in-house expert knowledge, taking scientific findings into due account.\n\nThe growing complexity of the supplier network, particularly in the case of sub-suppliers whose operations can only be indirectly monitored by the BMW Group, is a further potential cause of downtimes at supplier locations. For instance, there is a risk that strong demand on international semiconductor markets gives rise to bottlenecks in the supply of electronic components for production. The increased threat of cyberattacks along the entire value chain also affects supply security as well as the ability to protect know-how relevant to the BMW Group. To ensure a uniform level of IT security for all those involved along the value and supply chain, the BMW Group impresses on suppliers the importance of obtaining appropriate IT security certification.\n\nBy monitoring and developing global supplier markets, the BMW Group continuously strives to become more competitive by working together with the world\u2019s best product and service providers. As part of its supplier preselection process, the BMW Group checks for compliance with the sustainability standards established for its supplier network. This includes due consideration of and compliance with internationally recognised human rights and applicable labour and social standards.\n\nThe level of carbon emissions generated by prospective suppliers is taken into account as an independent criterion when processing tenders and awarding new contracts. This approach ensures that first-tier suppliers regard the issue of carbon emissions \u2013 alongside other factors \u2013 as relevant for their business and, in turn, set targets for other supply chain levels in which they are involved. The aim is to reduce carbon emissions across all relevant supply chains on the basis of constructive cooperation with suppliers. It is important to point out, however, that the BMW Group depends on receiving accurate information from suppliers in this regard.\n\nFurthermore, fire risks at series suppliers are evaluated by means of questionnaires and selective on-site inspections. Suppliers are required to implement the necessary measures on a continuous basis. Following evaluation, the results are fed back into the process for awarding contracts for new projects.\nThe risks associated with the supply of raw materials are mitigated either by reducing the use of raw materials or substituting them with alternative products.\n\nWithin the Purchasing and Supplier Network, opportunities arise above all in the area of global sourcing and the associated efficiency improvements. Making optimal use of any innovations developed by suppliers is a key prerequisite for developing future-oriented mobility products and services. Similarly, favourable location-related cost factors, in particular those arising due to the close proximity of supplier structures to new and existing BMW Group production plants as well as the introduction of innovative production technologies, could lead to lower cost of materials for the BMW Group.\n\nOne of the BMW Group\u2019s aims is to have battery cells manufactured in Europe. Key prerequisites for achieving this aim, however, are primarily further advances in the development of battery cell technology and the mastery of cell production processes. Contracts have been concluded with various suppliers as part of the Group\u2019s electrification strategy. A further source of opportunities is seen in the possible integration of previously unidentified supplier-driven innovations in the Group\u2019s product range. The BMW Group offers innovative suppliers numerous options for creating specific contractual arrangements that promote companies developing innovative solutions. Compared to the assumptions made in the outlook, the BMW Group does not expect such additional opportunities to have a significant earnings impact over the two-year assessment period.\n\nRisks and opportunities relating to the sales network\n\nIn order to sell its products and services, the BMW Group operates a global sales network mainly comprising independent dealerships, branches, subsidiaries and importers. In addition, a pilot project to promote direct sales was launched in South Africa in 2020. Any threat to the continued activities of parts of the sales network, for example due to the impending insolvency of a dealership, would entail risks for the BMW Group. The occurrence of sales and marketing risks would have only a low earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount is classified as low.\n\nNew developments in the field of digital communication and connectivity provide new opportunities for the BMW Group\u2019s brands to take advantage of additional sales channels in their efforts to bring new products to market. Based on vehicle-driven telematics data, customers can elect to use a specific service and actively consent to the relevant data being transferred. The service providers contracted to perform the work receive the necessary data via the BMW Group\u2019s secure back end system. The information forms the basis for customised, data-driven, innovative service options. Additional opportunities could arise if new sales channels contribute to greater brand reach to customer groups than currently envisaged in the outlook. Compared to the assumptions made in the outlook, the BMW Group does not expect these opportunities to have a significant earnings impact over the two-year assessment period.\n\nInformation security, data protection and IT\n\nThe advance of digitalisation throughout all areas of the business world places considerable demands on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronically processed data and the associated use of information technology (IT). Alongside higher threat levels in this area, regulatory requirements worldwide relating to the use of personal data are becoming increasingly stringent, for example due to the California Consumer Privacy Act. If risks relating to information security, data protection and IT were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. Despite extensive security measures and constant efforts to ensure compliance with applicable data protection legislation, the risk amount in this area is classified as high.\n\nIn addition to cyberattacks and direct physical intervention, there is a risk that either a lack of knowledge or misconduct on the part of employees could also pose a danger to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, data and systems. The main direct consequences could range from negative effects on revenues due to the misuse of information through to disruption in the production of components or vehicles. A further indirect consequence could be reputational damage.\n\nThe BMW Group places great emphasis on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information from unauthorised access or misuse, whether relating to business, employees or customers. Data security is an integral part of all Group business processes and practised in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001 international standard. In conjunction with risk management requirements, risks relating to information security, data protection and IT are systematically documented, allocated appropriate measures by the departments concerned and continuously monitored with regard to threat level and risk mitigation. Regular analyses and controls as well as rigorous security management policies ensure an appropriate level of security.\nHowever, despite continuous testing and preventive security measures, it is impossible to eliminate risks completely in this area. All Group employees are required to treat information such as confidential business, customer and employee data with care, use information systems securely and handle risks in a transparent manner. Group-wide requirements are documented in a comprehensive set of principles, guidelines and instructions, such as, for example, the Privacy Corporate Rules for handling personal data. Regular communication, awareness-raising and training measures form the basis for a high level of security and risk awareness. With regard to cooperations and business partnerships, the BMW Group protects its intellectual property as well as its customer and employee data by issuing clearly defined instructions on information security, data protection and the use of information technology. Trade secrets and sensitive personal data are subject to particularly stringent security measures. Technical data protection incorporates industry-wide standards and good practices. Responsibility for information security and data protection for each Group entity lies with either the Board of Management or the relevant management team.\n\nWith the advance of digitalisation, the BMW Group is continually improving the customer experience in its existing lines of business. At the same time, new business segments are emerging, which have only become feasible due to innovation in the field of information technology. The development and provision of digital services for customers, increased vehicle connectivity and automated driving solutions are opening up new opportunities. Via BMW ConnectedDrive and BMW CarData, the range of services and apps on offer to customers is constantly being expanded and updated. Compared to the assumptions made in the outlook, the BMW Group does not expect these opportunities to have a significant earnings impact over the two-year assessment period.\n\nFINANCIAL RISKS AND RISKS RELATING TO THE USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nCurrency risks and opportunities\n\nAs an internationally operating enterprise, the BMW Group conducts business in a variety of currencies, thus giving rise to currency risks and opportunities. A substantial portion of Group revenues, purchasing and funding occur outside the eurozone, particularly in China and the USA. Regularly updated cash-flow-at-risk models and scenario analyses are used to measure currency risks and opportunities. If currency risks were to materialise, they could be associated with a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount relating to currency risks is classified as high. The risk assessment is therefore slightly less favourable than one year earlier, due to the increased volatility of individual currencies in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Significant opportunities can arise if currency developments are favourable for the BMW Group.\n\nOperational currency management is based on the results of currency risk analyses. The BMW Group manages currency risks at both strategic (medium to longterm) and operational level (short to mediumterm). Medium- to long-term measures include increasing production and purchase volumes in foreign currency regions, i.e. natural hedging. Currency risks are managed in the short to medium term and for operational purposes by means of hedging on financial markets. The principal objective is to increase planning reliability for the BMW Group. Hedging transactions are entered into only with financial partners of good credit standing. Opportunities are also secured through the use of options during specific market phases.\n\nRisks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices\n\nAs a large-scale manufacturing company, the BMW Group is exposed to purchase price risks, particularly in relation to the raw materials used in vehicle production. The analysis of raw materials price risks is based on planned purchases of raw materials and components containing those products. Cash-flow-at-risk models and scenario analyses are used to measure risks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices.\n\nIf such risks were to materialise, they could have a medium earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount is classified as medium. Significant opportunities could arise if raw materials prices develop favourably for the BMW Group.\n\nChanges in prices are monitored via a well-defined management process, the primary objective of which is to increase planning reliability for the BMW Group. Price fluctuations for precious metals (platinum, palladium, rhodium), nonferrous metals (aluminium, copper), raw materials for batteries (lead, nickel, cobalt) and, to some extent, for steel and its basic ingredients (iron ore, coking coal) as well as energy (gas, electricity) are hedged using financial derivatives and supply contracts with fixed pricing arrangements.\nLiquidity risks\n\nThe major part of the Financial Services segment\u2019s credit financing and leasing business is refinanced on capital markets. Liquidity risks can arise in the form of rising refinancing costs or from restricted access to funds as a consequence of the general market situation. If liquidity risks were to materialise, they would be likely to have a medium earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount associated with liquidity risks, including the risk of the BMW Group\u2019s rating being downgraded, is classified as medium. The year-on-year change in the assessment of the risk amount reflects the sharp short-term rise in refinancing costs on capital markets at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBased on the experience gained during the global financial crisis, a liquidity concept has been drawn up, which is rigorously adhered to and continuously developed. The concept has been recently updated to take account of the implications of the coronavirus pandemic. The use of the \u201cmatched funding principle\u201d to finance the Financial Services segment\u2019s operations ensures that liquidity risks are generally avoided. Furthermore, scenarios have been calculated to present and analyse the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the matched funding principle.\n\nSolvency is assured at all times throughout the BMW Group by adhering to liquidity ratios and using a broadly diversified range of refinancing sources. Regular measurement and monitoring ensure that cash inflows and outflows for the various maturities and currencies offset one another. This approach is an integral part of the BMW Group\u2019s liquidity concept.\n\nThe liquidity position is monitored continuously and managed through the Group-wide planning of financial requirements and funding. The diversified refinancing strategy employed reduces dependency on financial instruments and markets. Moreover, the BMW Group\u2019s solid financial and earnings position results in high credit ratings from internationally recognised rating agencies. At present, opportunities relating to liquidity are not expected to have any significant earnings impact.\n\nFurther information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in note 39 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nOther financial risks\n\nOther financial risks worth mentioning include counterparty risks as well as those arising in connection with investments in other entities.\n\nThe BMW Group works together with banks to ensure that the available liquidity is optimally invested and to hedge against financial market risks (particularly currency, commodity and interest rate risks) using derivative financial instruments. Counterparty risk describes the risk that the BMW Group will not receive the payments due to it in connection with the investment and hedging transactions referred to above. An enhanced value-at-risk model is employed to measure counterparty risk, taking into account the creditworthiness (rating) of the banks and the business volumes involved. Risk is managed using a limit system, which includes daily monitoring of the extent to which limits are being utilised.\n\nThe BMW Group holds equity investments of varying amounts in numerous entities, which could result in risk from depreciation and amortisation.\n\nIf other financial risks were to materialise, they could have a medium earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount associated with other financial risks is classified as medium. Revaluations of investments could give rise to opportunities with a significant earnings impact.\n\nRisks and opportunities relating to pension obligations\n\nFuture pension obligations are financed largely via external pension funds or trust constructs that are legally separate from BMW. Externally managed funds are invested on capital markets in a broadly diversified portfolio with a view to enabling future pension payments to be disbursed out of pension assets. These arrangements greatly reduce the need to fund pension payments out of ongoing operations.\nRisks arise from fluctuations in pension obligations on the one hand and the related pension assets on the other. Opportunities arise if the value of pension assets on capital markets develops favourably or if pension obligations decrease at a more pronounced rate than the related assets.\n\nPension obligations are primarily measured using a discount rate based on market yields from high-quality corporate bonds. These yields are subject to market fluctuations and therefore influence the level of pension obligations. Changes in other parameters, such as rising inflation rates and longer life expectancy, also impact the amount as well as the duration of future pension payments. Regulatory requirements or changes may also affect the amount of pension obligations.\n\nThe fluctuation of pension assets reflects the volatility of individual asset classes on capital markets. The broadly diversified portfolio comprises investments in interest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and other asset classes.\n\nDespite the high level of external funding, risks relating to pension obligations could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amounts attached to pension obligations are classified as high. The strategic portfolio allocation of pension assets therefore comprises two key components. One part is allocated with a view to hedging against value fluctuations, applying the \u201cliability-driven investment approach\u201d, whereby capital market instruments are employed on a targeted basis to hedge against financial risks arising from the measurement of pension obligations. A second part is allocated with a view to generating income. Within a favourable capital market environment, this part of the pension assets offers the opportunity to further reduce pension plan deficits by generating positive returns and thereby impact the BMW Group\u2019s financial position to a significant degree. The risks and opportunities described above are continuously monitored and managed.\n\nRemeasurements on the liability and asset sides are recognised net of deferred taxes through other comprehensive income and hence directly in equity (within revenue reserves).\n\nFurther information on risks in conjunction with pension provisions is provided in note 32 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nLEGAL RISKS\n\nThe BMW Group is exposed to various legal risks, not least due to the global nature of its operations. Legal risks may result from non-compliance with laws or other legal requirements or from legal disputes with business partners or other market participants. If legal risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amounts attached to significant identified legal risks are classified as medium. However, it cannot be ruled out that new legal risks, as yet unforeseen, materialise that could have a high earnings impact for the BMW Group.\n\nThe growing globalisation of the BMW Group\u2019s operations as well as of business interdependencies in general, combined with the variety and complexity of legal provisions \u2013 increasingly including import and export regulations \u2013 give rise to a greater risk of non-compliance with applicable law. A Compliance Management System is in place across the BMW Group to ensure that its representative bodies, executives and staff members worldwide consistently act in a lawful manner. In 2020, the system was further developed, primarily by establishing additional compliance functions in various centralised departments within BMW AG, stepping up face-to-face training on antitrust compliance and via a Group-wide \u201cTone from the Top\u201d communication initiative that reflects the compliance management culture within the BMW Group. Corporate Governance\n\nLike all entities with international operations, the BMW Group is confronted with legal disputes, alleged claims (particularly relating to warranties and product liability or intellectual property rights infringements) and proceedings initiated by government agencies. Any of these could, amongst other consequences, have an adverse impact on the Group\u2019s reputation. Such proceedings are typical for the sector, may result as a consequence of realigning product or purchasing strategies to changed market conditions or are antitrust-related. Particularly in the US market, class action lawsuits and product liability risks can have substantial financial consequences and cause damage to the Group\u2019s reputation. More rigorous application or interpretation of existing regulations or the introduction of new regulations could result in a greater number of recalls.\nIn an antitrust investigation, the EU Commission alleges that five German car manufacturers colluded with the aim of restricting competition for innovation with regard to certain exhaust treatment systems for diesel- and petrol-driven passenger vehicles. The current investigation is solely concerned with possible infringements of competition law. The EU Commission is not alleging that the BMW Group conducted a deliberate and unlawful manipulation of the emissions control system. The Statement of Objections leads the BMW Group to believe that it is probable (\u201cmore likely than not\u201d) that the Commission will issue a significant fine. A provision of approximately \u20ac1.4 billion was recognised in 2019 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for negative financial impacts that cannot yet be definitively assessed. In December 2019 the BMW Group submitted a detailed reply to the Statement of Objections. The EU Commission is currently examining the reply and, on that basis, will determine the next procedural steps. Therefore, the financial impact cannot yet be definitively assessed.\n\nFor several years, lawsuits have been filed against BMW Bank GmbH (BMW Bank) in which consumers claim the withdrawal of their loan and leasing contracts on the basis of allegedly incorrect and insufficient pre-contractual information. The focus is on loan contracts. Since 2017, BMW Bank has won the vast majority of these lawsuits. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) adopted a decision of principle in favour of BMW Bank, confirming the accuracy of consumer-relevant information in loan contracts. In addition, in October 2020 the BGH decided in a case in which BMW Bank was not involved that consumers are generally obliged to pay a compensation after a successful withdrawal. Since the beginning of 2020, several references for a preliminary ruling on the scope of information obligations have been filed with the European Court of Justice (ECJ). On the basis of these requests, there is a risk that BMW Bank\u2019s prospects of success in the withdrawal lawsuits could deteriorate in the event of negative future ECJ case law. The possible financial impact cannot be definitively assessed at this stage.\n\nThe BMW Group recognises appropriate levels of provision for lawsuits. In addition, a part of these risks is insured to an economically reasonable extent. Further risks from legal proceedings are reported as other contingent liabilities. It cannot be ruled out, however, that damages arise that are either not covered or not fully covered by insurance policies or provisions or reported as contingent liabilities. In accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets), the required information is not provided if the BMW Group concludes that its disclosure could seriously prejudice the outcome of the relevant legal proceedings. Further information on contingent liabilities is provided in note 38 to the Group Financial Statements.\nRISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, the risk management process also takes financial regulatory requirements such as Basel III into account. Internal methods for identifying, measuring, managing and monitoring risks within the Financial Services segment comply with national and international standards. Risk management within the Financial Services business is built on the prevailing risk culture, the defined risk strategy, the internal capital adequacy assessment process framework and a set of rules comprising principles and guidelines. In organisational terms, the risk management process is ensured by means of a clear division between front- and back-office activities and a comprehensive internal control system. The main tool used to manage risk within the Financial Services segment is to ensure the segment\u2019s risk-bearing capacity.\n\nAll risks \u2013 in the sense of unexpected losses \u2013 must be covered at all times. Based on the entity\u2019s risk appetite, this is achieved by ensuring specified levels of risk-covering assets (asset cushions) in the form of equity capital. Unexpected losses are measured using various value-at-risk models, which are validated at regular intervals. Risks are also aggregated after taking account of correlation effects. In addition to assessing the Group\u2019s ability to bear risk, stress scenarios are also examined. The segment\u2019s risk-bearing capacity is also regularly monitored by means of an integrated limit system for the various risk categories.\n\nSustainability has developed into a megatrend of our time and is increasingly becoming the focus of political and social debate. Both the effects of climate change and the changes brought about by the fight against climate change are also likely to be reflected across the world\u2019s financial system. Due to the potential macroeconomic consequences, the related sustainability risks are seen as a threat to the stability of financial markets. In the context of bank supervision at national and international level, it is therefore essential that the banks concerned take sustainability risks adequately into account.\n\nThe Financial Services segment not only helps its customers to satisfy their mobility needs by offering credit financing and leasing products, it also promotes the BMW Group\u2019s industrial business from a sales point of view. The far-reaching consequences of the debate on sustainability and sustainability risks affect both the non-financial economy (and therefore the BMW Group) and the financial economy (and therefore the Financial Services segment). Due to the close interrelationships within the Group, developments that affect the BMW Group\u2019s industrial business in the first step (e.g. diesel driving bans, adjustments to carbon emissions targets, the growing proportion of e-vehicles, etc.) are also relevant for the Financial Services segment in the second step. This environment has always been part of the underlying framework of the Financial Services segment\u2019s business model.\n\nThe growing challenges posed by climate change and the resulting impact on the financial system are taken into account in the Financial Services segment by adequately addressing sustainability risks. As an integral part of the BMW Group\u2019s value chain, the Financial Services segment is highly aware of the importance of managing sustainability risks and is therefore fully integrated in the BMW Group\u2019s comprehensive sustainable corporate strategy.\n\nThe following overview provides a general summary of the main risks and opportunities in the Financial Services segment:\n\n| Risks and opportunities relating to the provision of financial services | Classification of risk amount | Change compared to prior year | Classification | Change compared to prior year |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Credit risk | Medium | Stable | Insignificant | Stable |\n| Residual value | High | Stable | Significant | Stable |\n| Interest rate changes | Medium | Stable | Significant | Stable |\n| Operational risks | Medium | Stable | \u2013 | \u2013 |\nRisks and opportunities relating to the Financial Services segment\n\nThe main categories of risk relevant for the Financial Services segment are credit and counterparty risk, residual value risk, interest rate risk, operational risk and liquidity risk. The evaluation of liquidity risk for the Financial Services segment is included in the liquidity risk category for the Group as a whole.\n\nDuring the financial year 2020, the aggregate risk cushion for risks in the Financial Services segment was sufficient at all times, thereby ensuring the segment\u2019s risk-bearing capacity.\n\nCredit and counterparty risks and opportunities relating to the Financial Services segment\n\nCredit and counterparty default risk arises within the Financial Services segment if a contractual partner (e.g. a customer or dealership) becomes either unable or only partially able to fulfil its contractual obligations, so that lower income is generated or losses are incurred. If unexpected credit and counterparty default risks were to materialise, they could have a medium earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount is classified as medium. The BMW Group classifies potential opportunities in this area as insignificant.\n\nIn light of the uncertainties surrounding the future course of the coronavirus pandemic, additional credit loss provisions were recognised during the financial year 2020 for expected credit losses, in order to reflect the possible negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on retail customer and dealership business for accounting purposes.\n\nInitial and continuous creditworthiness testing is an important aspect of the BMW Group\u2019s credit risk management system. For this reason, every borrower\u2019s creditworthiness is tested for all credit financing and leasing contracts entered into by the BMW Group. Opportunities may arise if the managed portfolio performs better over time than estimated when the credits were granted. The intensive management of purchasing processes and collateral assessment as well as favourable macroeconomic developments could accentuate these opportunities. In the case of retail customer financing, creditworthiness is assessed using validated scoring systems integrated in the purchasing process. In the area of dealership financing, creditworthiness is assessed by means of ongoing credit monitoring and an internal rating system that takes account not only of the material credit standing of the borrower, but also of qualitative factors such as past reliability in business relationships. Changes in the creditworthiness of customers arising during the credit term are covered by risk provisioning procedures. The credit risk of individual customers is quantified on a monthly basis and, depending on the outcome, taken into account within the risk provisioning system. Macroeconomic developments are currently subject to a higher degree of volatility. If developments are more favourable than assumed in the outlook, credit losses may be reduced, leading to a positive earnings impact.\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, moratoria were granted to customers and dealers, particularly during the first six months of the year, taking into account the prevailing legal requirements. The simultaneous improvement in the economic situation in most markets in the second half of the year meant that the low percentage of actual loan defaults was kept stable.\n\nResidual value risks and opportunities relating to the Financial Services segment\n\nRisks and opportunities arise in conjunction with leasing contracts if the market value of a leased vehicle at the end of the contractual term of a lease differs from the residual value estimated at the commencement date of the lease. A residual value risk exists if the expected market value of the vehicle at the end of the contractual term is lower than its estimated residual value at the date the contract is entered into. If unexpected residual value risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact from the Group\u2019s perspective over the two-year assessment period. A high earnings impact would then arise for the affected Financial Services and Automotive segments. The risk amount is classified as high for the Group as a whole. Opportunities can arise out of a positive deviation between the actual market value and the original residual value forecast. The BMW Group classifies potential residual value opportunities as significant.\nEach vehicle\u2019s estimated residual value is calculated on the basis of historical external and internal data. This estimation provides the expected market value of the vehicle at the end of the contractual period. Developments on pre-owned car markets are an important factor for the BMW Group. In 2020, the number of electrified vehicles also continued to increase. Changes in the value of these vehicles are largely determined by a set of known influencing factors. Prices on pre-owned car markets in the premium segment fluctuated within the usual range and were even favourably influenced in some cases by coronavirus-related catch-up effects. As part of the management of residual value risks, the net present value of risk costs is also calculated at the contract commencement date. Market developments are monitored throughout the contractual period and the risk assessment updated accordingly. Residual value risk management essentially follows the same established process, regardless of the drivetrain variant.\n\nBased on current expectations of a rising level of residual value losses in subsequent years, the level of risk provisioning has been raised in the form of additional provisions and in line with applicable financial reporting standards. Accordingly, risk costs for residual value risks in the Financial Services segment are significantly higher than one year earlier.\n\nInterest rate risks and opportunities relating to the Financial Services segment\n\nInterest rate risks in the Financial Services segment relate to potential losses caused by changes in market interest rates. These can arise when fixed interest rate periods do not match for assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet. If interest rate risks were to materialise, they could have a medium earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount is classified as medium. Favourable interest rate developments compared to the outlook represent opportunities that the BMW Group classifies as significant. Interest rate risks in the Financial Services business are managed by ensuring that fixed interest rate periods match to a large extent and through the use of interest-rate derivatives. If the relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled, derivatives used by the BMW Group are accounted for as hedging relationships. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in note 39 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nOperational risks relating to the Financial Services segment\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, operational risks are defined as the risk of losses arising as a consequence of the unsuitability or failure of internal procedures (process risks), people (personnel-related risks), systems (infrastructure- and IT-related risks) and external events (external risks). The recording and measurement of risk scenarios, loss events and countermeasures in the operational risk management system provide the basis for the systematic analysis and management of potential or materialised operational risks. Annual self-assessments are also carried out. This risk category also includes sustainability risks that correspond to the definition of operational risks, such as external events or natural and man-made disasters.\n\nIf operational risks were to materialise, they would be likely to have a low earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount is classified as medium. At present, no significant opportunities for the earnings situation are seen with regard to operational risks.\nINTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM* RELEVANT FOR ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESSES\n\nThe internal control system relevant for accounting and financial reporting processes has the task of ensuring that accounting and financial reporting of the BMW Group is both accurate and reliable. Within the framework of the \u201cThree Lines of Defence\u201d model used to manage risk across the Group, the internal control system represents a key component of the second line of defence, serving as a link between the operating units, the corporate audit function and the external auditors.\n\nInternationally recognised standards for internal control systems were taken into account when designing the various components of the BMW Group\u2019s internal control system. The system comprises:\n\n\u2014 Group-wide mandatory accounting guidelines\n\u2014 Controls integrated in processes and IT systems\n\u2014 Organisational measures incorporating the principles of the risk-oriented segregation of duties\n\u2014 Process-independent monitoring measures\n\nThe system and the methodologies applied are subject to continuous improvement, with system effectiveness assessed regularly on the basis of centralised and decentralised process analyses, analyses of data within the various financial systems and audit procedures. The principal features of the internal control system, as far as they relate to individual entity and Group accounting and financial reporting processes, are described below.\n\nGuidelines for recognising, measuring and allocating items to accounts are available to all Group employees via the intranet. New accounting standards are assessed for their impact on the BMW Group\u2019s accounting and financial reporting. Accounting guidelines and processes are reviewed continuously and revised at least once a year, or more frequently if required.\n\nPreventive and detective controls are integrated in Group accounting and financial reporting processes. Preventive controls serve to prevent errors and omissions, whereas detective controls serve to detect and correct errors. To the extent possible, they are designed to comply with the principle of the segregation of duties. Key IT systems that are relevant for accounting and financial reporting incorporate controls designed, among other things, to prevent business transactions from being recorded incorrectly as well as to ensure the timely recognition and measurement of all business transactions in accordance with applicable requirements. Controls are also in place to test the appropriateness of consolidation procedures.\n\nIn conjunction with the ongoing development of IT systems relevant for accounting and financial reporting processes at both individual entity and Group level, controls are adapted to take account of new requirements and opportunities arising as a result of advances in information technology. Moreover, the BMW Group uses data analysis tools to identify and subsequently eliminate any weaknesses in the control system.\n\nResponsibilities for ensuring the effectiveness of the internal control system in Group accounting and financial reporting processes are clearly defined and allocated to the relevant line and process managers. These managers report annually on their assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control system for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assessment also includes the results of internal and external audits as well as of data analysis that is conducted on a continual basis. In this context, the Group\u2019s various units confirm the effectiveness of the internal control system for accounting and financial reporting. The results of the assessment are gathered and documented with the aid of appropriate tools. Any weaknesses in the control system are eliminated, taking into account their potential impact on accounting and financial reporting processes. The Board of Management and the Audit Committee are briefed annually on the effectiveness of the internal control system for accounting and financial reporting. The Board of Management and, where appropriate, the Supervisory Board, are informed without delay if there are any significant changes in the effectiveness of the internal control system.\n\n* Disclosures pursuant to sections 289 and 315 HGB.\nDISCLOSURES RELEVANT FOR TAKEOVERS* AND EXPLANATORY COMMENTS\n\nCOMPOSITION OF SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL\n\nThe subscribed capital (share capital) of BMW AG amounted to \u20ac659,684,500 at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u20ac658,862,500) and, in accordance with Article 4 no. 1 of the Articles of Incorporation is sub-divided into 601,995,196 shares of common stock (91.26 %) (2019: 601,995,196; 91.37 %) and 57,689,304 shares of non-voting preferred stock (8.74 %) (2019: 56,867,304; 8.63 %), each with a par value of \u20ac1. The Company\u2019s shares are issued to bearer.\n\nThe rights and obligations of shareholders derive from the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in conjunction with the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, the full text of which is available at www.bmwgroup.com. The right of shareholders to have their shares evidenced is excluded in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation.\n\nThe voting power attached to each share corresponds to its par value. Each \u20ac1 of par value of share capital represented in a vote entitles the holder to one vote (Article 18 no. 1 of the Articles of Incorporation).\n\nThe Company\u2019s shares of preferred stock are shares as defined in \u00a7 139 ff. AktG, which carry a cumulative preferential right in terms of the allocation of profit and for which voting rights are excluded. These shares confer voting rights only in exceptional cases stipulated by law, in particular when the preference amount has either not been paid or has not been fully paid within one year and the arrears are not paid in the subsequent year alongside the full preference amount due for that year. With the exception of voting rights, holders of shares of preferred stock are entitled to the same rights as holders of shares of common stock. Article 24 of the Articles of Incorporation confers preferential treatment to the non-voting shares of preferred stock with regard to the appropriation of the Company\u2019s unappropriated profit. Accordingly, the unappropriated profit is required to be appropriated in the following order:\n\na Subsequent payment of any arrears on dividends on non-voting shares of preferred stock in the order of accrual\n\nb Payment of an additional dividend of \u20ac0.02 per \u20ac1 par value on non-voting preferred shares\n\nc Uniform payment of any other dividends on shares of common and preferred stock, provided the shareholders do not resolve otherwise at the Annual General Meeting\n\nRESTRICTIONS AFFECTING VOTING RIGHTS OR THE TRANSFER OF SHARES\n\nIn addition to shares of common stock, the Company has also issued non-voting shares of preferred stock. Further information is provided in the section \u201cComposition of subscribed capital\u201d.\n\nWhen the Company issues non-voting shares of preferred stock to employees in conjunction with its Employee Share Programme, these shares are generally subject to a Company-imposed blocking period of four years, calculated from the beginning of the calendar year in which the shares were issued.\n\nContractual holding period arrangements also apply to shares of common stock acquired by Board of Management members and certain senior department heads in conjunction with the share-based remuneration programmes (Remuneration Report of the Corporate Governance section; note 41 to the Group Financial Statements).\n\n* Disclosures pursuant to \u00a7 289a and \u00a7 315a HGB.\nDIRECT OR INDIRECT INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EXCEEDING 10% OF VOTING RIGHTS\n\nBased on information available to the Company, the following direct or indirect holdings exceeding 10% of the voting rights at the end of the reporting period were held at the stated reporting date:\u00b9\n\n| in % | Direct share of voting rights | Indirect share of voting rights |\n|------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Stefan Quandt, Germany | 0.2 | 25.6\u00b2 |\n| AQTON SE, Bad Homburg v. d.

As the Company\u2019s shares are issued to bearer, the Company is generally aware of changes in shareholdings only if such changes are subject to mandatory notification rules.\n\nSHARES WITH SPECIAL RIGHTS THAT CONFER CONTROL RIGHTS\n\nThere are no shares with special rights that confer control rights.\n\nCONTROL OF VOTING RIGHTS WHEN EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN CAPITAL AND DO NOT DIRECTLY EXERCISE THEIR CONTROL RIGHTS\n\nLike all other shareholders, employees exercise their control rights pertaining to shares they have acquired in conjunction with the Employee Share Programme and/or the share-based remuneration programme directly on the basis of relevant legal provisions and the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation.\n\nSTATUTORY REGULATIONS AND PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION GOVERNING THE APPOINTMENT AND REMOVAL OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND CHANGES TO THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION\n\nThe appointment or removal of members of the Board of Management is based on the rules contained in \u00a7 84 f. AktG in conjunction with \u00a7 31 of the German Co-Determination Act (MitbestG).\n\nAmendments to the Articles of Incorporation must comply with \u00a7 179 ff. AktG. Amendments must be decided upon by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (\u00a7 119 (1) no. 6, \u00a7 179 (1) AktG). The Supervisory Board is authorised to approve amendments to the Articles of Incorporation that only affect its wording (Article 14 no. 3 of the Articles of Incorporation). Resolutions are passed at the Annual General Meeting by a simple majority of shares cast unless otherwise explicitly required by binding provisions of law or, if a majority of share capital is required, by a simple majority of shares represented in the vote (Article 20 no. 1 of the Articles of Incorporation).\n\n\u00b9 Based on voluntary notifications provided by the listed shareholders as at 31 December 2020.\n\u00b2 Controlled entities, of which 3% or more are attributed: AQTON SE, AQTON Verwaltung GmbH, AQTON GmbH & Co.

KG f\u00fcr Automobilwerte.\n\u2075 Controlled entities, of which 3% or more are attributed: Susanne Klatten Beteiligungs GmbH.\nAUTHORISATIONS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT, IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUING OR BUYING BACK OF SHARES\n\nThe Board of Management is authorised to buy back shares and sell repurchased shares in situations specified in \u00a7 71 AktG, for example to avert serious and imminent damage to the Company and/or to offer shares to persons employed or previously employed by BMW AG or one of its affiliated companies.\n\nIn accordance with Article 4 no. 5 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Management is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase by means of cash contributions BMW AG\u2019s share capital during the period up to and including 15 May 2024 by up to \u20ac3,437,600 for the purposes of an Employee Share Programme by issuing new non-voting shares of preferred stock, which carry the same rights as existing non-voting preferred stock (Authorised Capital 2019). The subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. No conditional capital was in place at the reporting date.\n\nSIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS OF THE COMPANY TAKING EFFECT IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL FOLLOWING A TAKEOVER BID\n\nBMW AG is party to the following major agreements, which contain provisions that would apply in the event of a change in control or the acquisition of control as a result of a takeover bid:\n\n\u2014 An agreement concluded with an international consortium of banks relating to a syndicated credit line, which was not being utilised at the balance sheet date, entitles the lending banks to give extraordinary notice to terminate the credit line, such that all outstanding amounts, including interest, would fall due with immediate effect if one or more parties jointly acquire direct or indirect control of BMW AG. The term \u201ccontrol\u201d is defined as the acquisition of more than 50% of the share capital of BMW AG, the right to receive more than 50% of the dividend or the right to direct the affairs of the Company or appoint the majority of members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n\u2014 A cooperation agreement concluded with Peugeot SA relating to small (1- to 1.6-litre) petrol engines entitles each of the cooperation partners to give extraordinary notification of termination in the event of a competitor acquiring control over the other contractual party and if any concerns of the other contractual party regarding the impact of the change of control on the cooperation arrangements are not resolved during the subsequent discussion process.\n\n\u2014 BMW AG acts as guarantor for all obligations arising from the joint venture agreement relating to BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. in China. This agreement grants an extraordinary right of termination to either joint venture partner in the event of a change in control at one of the parties or if more than 25% of the shares of the other party are acquired by a third party \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 or if the other party is merged with another legal entity. Termination of the joint venture agreement may lead to the dissolution of the joint venture with an optional purchase right for BMW (or for the partner) to acquire the shares of the other partner or to the liquidation of the joint venture company.\n\n\u2014 Framework agreements are in place with financial institutions and banks (ISDA Master Agreements) with respect to trading activities with derivative financial instruments. These agreements include an extraordinary right of termination that triggers actions in the event that the creditworthiness of the party involved is materially weaker following a direct or indirect acquisition of beneficially owned equity capital which confers the power to elect a majority of the Supervisory Board of a contractual party or any other ownership interest that enables the acquirer to exercise control over a contractual party or which constitutes a merger or a transfer of net assets.\nFinancing agreements in place with the European Investment Bank (EIB) entitle the EIB to demand early repayment of its loans in the event of an imminent or actual change in control of BMW AG, if the EIB has reason to assume \u2013 after the change in control has taken place or 30 days after it has made a request to discuss the situation \u2013 that the change in control could have a significantly adverse impact, or if the borrower refuses to hold any such discussions. A change in control of BMW AG arises if one or more individuals take over or lose control of BMW AG, with control being defined in the above-mentioned financing agreements as (i) holding or having control over more than 50% of the voting rights, (ii) the right to appoint the majority of the members of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board, (iii) the right to receive more than 50% of dividends payable or (iv) any other comparable controlling influence over BMW AG.\n\nBMW AG and Daimler AG have entered into a joint venture agreement relating to mobility services in the areas of car sharing, ride hailing, parking, charging and multimodality, which entitles both Daimler AG and BMW AG (hereafter referred to as \u201cprincipals\u201d) to initiate a bidding procedure in the event that (i) the other principal receives notice in accordance with \u00a7 33 of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG) that \u2013 including shares attributed pursuant to \u00a7 30 WpHG \u2013 holds more than 50% of the voting rights or shares in the other principal, or (ii) the other principal has concluded a control agreement as dependent company. The outcome of such a bidding procedure is that the joint venture will go to the principal making the highest bid.\n\nSeveral supply and development contracts between BMW AG and various industrial customers, all relating to the sale of components for drivetrain systems, grant an extraordinary right of termination to the relevant industrial customer in specified cases of a change in control at BMW AG (for example BMW AG merges with a third party or is taken over by a third party; an automobile manufacturer acquires more than 50% of the voting rights or share capital of BMW AG).\n\nBMW AG is party to the shareholder agreement relating to There Holding B.V., which is the majority shareholder of the HERE Group. In accordance with the shareholder agreement, each contractual party is required to offer its directly or indirectly held shares in There Holding B.V. for sale to the other shareholders in the event of a change in control. A change in control of BMW AG arises if a person takes over or loses control of BMW AG, with control defined as (i) holding or having control over more than 50% of the voting rights, (ii) the possibility to control more than 50% of voting rights exercisable at Annual General Meetings on all or nearly all matters, or (iii) the right to determine the majority of members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, a change in control occurs if competitors of the HERE Group or certain potential competitors of the HERE Group from the technology sector acquire at least 25% of BMW AG. If none of the other shareholders acquire these shares, the other shareholders are entitled to resolve that There Holding B.V. be dissolved.\n\nThe development collaboration agreement between BMW AG, Intel Corporation and Mobileye Vision Technologies Ltd., relating to the development of technologies used in automated vehicles, may be terminated by any of the contractual parties if a competitor of one of the parties acquires and subsequently holds at least 30% of the voting shares of one of the contractual parties.\n\nThe development collaboration agreement between BMW AG, FCA US LLC and FCA Italy S.p.A. relating to the development of technologies used in conjunction with automated vehicles may be terminated by any of the contractual parties if certain competitors in the technology sector acquire and subsequently hold at least 30% of the voting shares of one of the other contractual parties.\nUntil 19 June 2020, BMW AG was party to a collaboration agreement with Mercedes-Benz AG for the development of technologies for second-generation automated driving (from 2024), which could be terminated by either party in the event that a third party \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 acquires at least 30% of the voting rights in one of the contractual parties (\u00a7 29 (2) and \u00a7 30 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wp\u00dcG)). This collaboration was terminated with immediate effect in accordance with an agreement dated 18/19 June 2020.\n\nBMW AG has entered into an agreement with Great Wall Motor Company Limited to establish the joint venture Spotlight Automotive Ltd. in China. The agreement grants an extraordinary right of termination to either joint venture partner in the event that \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 more than 25% of the shares of the other party are acquired by a third party or if the other party is merged with another legal entity. The termination of the joint venture agreement may result in the sale of the shares to the other joint venture partner or in the liquidation of the joint venture entity.\n\nCOMPENSATION AGREEMENTS WITH MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT OR WITH EMPLOYEES IN THE EVENT OF A TAKEOVER BID\n\nThe BMW Group has not concluded any compensation agreements with members of the Board of Management or with employees for situations involving a takeover offer.\nGROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n186  Income Statement for Group and Segments\n187  Statement of Comprehensive Income for Group\n188  Balance Sheet

the Group Financial Statements).\nNOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nAccounting Principles and Policies\n\n01 BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW Group Financial Statements or Group Financial Statements) at 31 December 2020 were drawn up in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU), and the supplementary requirements of \u00a7 315 e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The Group Financial Statements also include an income statement and a balance sheet for the Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial Services and Other Entities segments. The Group Cash Flow Statement is supplemented by a statement of cash flows for the Automotive and Financial Services segments. Inter-segment transactions relate primarily to internal sales of products, the provision of funds for Group companies and the related interest. A description of the nature of the business and the major operating activities of the BMW Group\u2019s segments is provided in note 45 (\u201cExplanatory notes to segment information\u201d).\n\nApproval for the publication of the Group Financial Statements was granted by the Board of Management on 9 March 2021 and by the Supervisory Board on 11 March 2021.\n\nThe presentation of selected items was changed in the financial year 2020, whereby the changes were not material overall. Attention is drawn to the changes in presentation in the notes relating to relevant balance sheet and income statement items. Prior year figures have been adjusted accordingly.\n\n02 GROUP REPORTING ENTITY AND CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES\n\nThe BMW Group Financial Statements include BMW AG and all material subsidiaries over which BMW AG \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 exercises control. This also includes 57 structured entities, consisting of asset-backed financing arrangements and special purpose funds.\n\nIn relation to fully consolidated companies, the following changes took place in the Group reporting entity in the financial year 2020:\n\n|                      | Germany | Foreign | Total |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|-------|\n| Included at 31 December 2019 | 21      | 186     | 207   |\n| Included for the first time in 2020 | \u2013       | 14      | 14    |\n| No longer included in 2020 | \u2013       | 15      | 15    |\n| Included at 31 December 2020 | 21      | 185     | 206   |\nAll consolidated subsidiaries have the same year-end as BMW AG with the exception of BMW India Private Ltd. and BMW India Financial Services Private Ltd., whose year-ends are 31 March in accordance with local legal requirements.\n\nWhen assessing whether an investment gives rise to a controlled entity, an associated company, a joint operation or a joint venture, the BMW Group considers contractual arrangements and other circumstances, as well as the structure and legal form of the entity. Discretionary decisions may also be required. If indications exist of a change in the judgement of (joint) control, the BMW Group undertakes a new assessment.\n\nAn entity is deemed to be controlled if BMW AG \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 has power over it, is exposed or has rights to variable returns from it and has the ability to influence those returns.\n\nAn entity is classified as an associated company if BMW AG \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 has the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity\u2019s operating and financial policies. As a general rule, the Group is assumed to have significant influence if it holds 20% or more of the entity\u2019s voting power.\n\nJoint operations and joint ventures are forms of joint arrangements. Such an arrangement exists when a BMW Group entity jointly carries out activities with a third party on the basis of a contractual agreement.\n\nIn the case of a joint operation, the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of a joint operation are recognised proportionately in the Group Financial Statements on the basis of the BMW Group entity\u2019s rights and obligations (proportionate consolidation).\n\nThe two largest joint operations that are accounted for by the BMW Group and which are described below are of minor significance for the Group Financial Statements as a whole:\n\n\u2014 The BMW Group is party to a cooperation with Toyota Motor Corporation, Toyota City, which has developed a sports car.\n\n\u2014 In 2019, the BMW Group and the Chinese automobile manufacturer Great Wall Motor Company Limited (Great Wall) established the jointly operated company, Spotlight Automotive Limited (Spotlight) for the future joint development and manufacture of electric vehicles in China. The BMW Group and Great Wall each hold 50% of the joint operation\u2019s equity. In addition to electric MINI vehicles, Spotlight will also develop and produce electric vehicles for Great Wall.\n\nIn June 2020, a joint decision was taken to temporarily put on hold the cooperation with the Daimler Group for the development of highly automated driving systems, which is accounted for as a joint operation. This has no impact on the financial statements.\n\nIn the case of a joint venture, the parties which have joint control only have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, with measurement on initial recognition based on acquisition cost.\n\nThe other changes to the Group reporting entity do not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position and net assets of the Group.\n\n03 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nThe financial statements of consolidated companies which are presented in a foreign currency are translated using the modified closing rate method. Under this method, assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate, whilst income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate. Differences arising on foreign currency translation are presented in \u201cAccumulated other equity\u201d.\n\nIn the single entity accounts of BMW AG and its subsidiaries, foreign currency receivables and payables are measured on initial recognition using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of first-time recognition. Advance payments to suppliers or from customers in a foreign currency that result in the addition of non-monetary assets or liabilities are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency receivables and payables are measured using the closing exchange rate. The resulting unrealised gains and losses, as well as realised gains and losses arising on settlement, are recognised in the income statement, in line with the underlying substance of the transaction. Non-monetary balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies are rolled forward on the basis of historical exchange rates.\nThe exchange rates of currencies which have a material impact on the Group Financial Statements were as follows:\n\n| Currency          | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 2020  | 2019  |\n|-------------------|------------|------------|-------|-------|\n| US-Dollar         | 1.23       | 1.12       | 1.14  | 1.12  |\n| British Pound     | 0.90       | 0.85       | 0.89  | 0.88  |\n| Chinese Renminbi  | 8.00       | 7.82       | 7.87  | 7.73  |\n| South African Rand| 17.97      | 15.72      | 18.77 | 16.17 |\n| Russian Rouble    | 90.54      | 69.60      | 82.71 | 72.43 |\n\nArgentina has fulfilled the definition of a hyper-inflationary economy since 1 July 2018. Since that date, IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies) has therefore been applied for the BMW subsidiary in Argentina. The price indices published by the Federaci\u00f3n Argentina de Consejos Profesionales de Ciencias Econ\u00f3micas (FACPCE) are used to adjust non-monetary assets and liabilities and items in the income statement. The resulting effects are not material for the BMW Group.\n\n04 FINANCIAL REPORTING RULES\n\na Financial reporting standards applied for the first time in the financial year 2020\n\nStandards or amendments to standards applied for the first time in the financial year do not have any significant impact on the BMW Group Financial Statements.\n\nb Financial reporting standards issued by the IASB, but not yet applied\n\nIn August 2020, the IASB published the Amendment Standard Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR) \u2013 Phase 2. The amendments contain a number of reliefs to mitigate the impact on the accounting treatment of hedge relationships, financial instruments and lease liabilities resulting from the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nIn accordance with the amendments, hedge accounting is not required to be discontinued solely because of the reform. Instead, the hedge relationships are deemed to remain in place even if the existing benchmark interest rate is replaced by an alternative interest rate, provided that the underlying documentation has been appropriately updated.\n\nReplacing a previous benchmark rate results in a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows relating to financial assets and financial liabilities. For simplification purposes, it is permitted to account for the change by updating the effective interest rate without any immediate impact on profit or loss. This practical expedient is also available for finance leases, in that the requirements contained in IFRS 9 for modifications are deemed to apply. A similar practical expedient is available for lease liabilities accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16. In this case, any modification required by the benchmark reform results only in the lease liability being remeasured when the alternative interest rate is used to discount the modified lease payments.\n\nThe amendments are mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The BMW Group intends to apply the proposed practical expedients for transactions affected by the benchmark reform. The amendments have not been adopted early for the financial year 2020.\n\nOther financial reporting standards issued by the IASB and not yet applied are not expected to have any significant impact on the BMW Group Financial Statements.\nRevenues from customer contracts include in particular revenues from the sale of products (primarily new and pre-owned vehicles and related products) as well as revenues from services. Revenue is recognised when control is transferred to the dealership or retail customer. In the case of sales of products, this is usually at the point in time when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Revenues are stated net of settlement discount, bonuses and rebates as well as interest and residual value subsidies. The consideration arising from these sales usually falls due for payment immediately or within 30 days. In exceptional cases, a longer payment may also be agreed. In the case of services, control is transferred over time. Consideration for the rendering of services to customers usually falls due for payment at the beginning of a contract and is therefore deferred as a contract liability. The deferred amount is released over the service period and recognised as revenue in the income statement. As a rule, amounts are released on the basis of the expected expense trend, as this best reflects the performance of the service. If the sale of products includes a determinable amount for services (multiple-component contracts), the related revenues are deferred and recognised as income in the same way. Variable consideration components, such as bonuses, are measured at the expected value, and in the case of multi-component contracts, allocated to all performance obligations unless directly attributable to the sale of a vehicle.\n\nRevenues from the sale of products, for which repurchase arrangements are in place, are not recognised immediately in full. Instead, revenues are either recognised proportionately or the difference between the sales and repurchase price recognised in instalments over the term of the contract depending on the nature of the agreement. In the case of vehicles sold to a dealership that are expected to be repurchased in a subsequent period as part of leasing operations, revenues are not recognised at Group level at the time of the sale of the vehicle. Instead, assets and liabilities relating to the right of return vehicles are recognised.\n\nRevenues from leases of own-manufactured vehicles are recognised at Group level in accordance with the requirements for manufacturer or dealer leases. In the case of operating leases, revenues from lease payments are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In the case of finance leases, revenues are recognised at the lease commencement date at the amount of the fair value of the leased asset and reduced by any unguaranteed residual value of vehicles that are expected to be returned to the Group at the end of the lease term. Similarly, cost of sales is reduced for unguaranteed residual values. In addition, initial direct costs are recognised as cost of sales at the lease commencement date.\n\nRevenues also include interest income from financial services. Interest income arising on finance leases as well as on retail customer and dealership financing is recognised using the effective interest method and reported as interest income on credit financing within revenues.\n\nPublic sector grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attaching to them have been complied with and the grants will be received. The resulting income is recognised in cost of sales over the periods in which the costs occur that they are intended to compensate.\n\nEarnings per share are calculated as follows: Basic earnings per share are calculated for common and preferred stock by dividing the net profit for the year after minority interests and attributable to each category of stock, by the average number of outstanding shares. Net profit for the year is accordingly allocated to the different categories of stock. The portion of the net profit that is not being distributed is allocated to each category of stock based on the number of outstanding shares. Profits available for distribution are determined directly on the basis of the dividend proposals or resolutions for common and preferred stock. Diluted earnings per share are calculated and separately disclosed in accordance with IAS 33.\n\nIntangible assets are measured at acquisition or manufacturing cost. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of between three and 20 years. Impairment losses are recognised where necessary. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment. Internally generated intangible assets mainly comprise development costs for vehicle, module and architecture projects.\nDevelopment costs are capitalised if all of the criteria specified by IAS 38 are met. They are measured on the basis of direct costs and directly attributable overhead costs. Project-related capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis following the start of production over the estimated product life (usually seven to twelve years).\n\nGoodwill arises on first-time consolidation of an acquired business when the cost of acquisition exceeds the Group\u2019s share of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identified during the acquisition.\n\nIntangible assets also include emission allowances and similar rights arising from programmes aimed at reducing carbon or other climate-damaging emissions (for example in conjunction with the EU Emissions Trading System or vehicle-related emissions regulations in the USA or China). These allowances and rights are carried at cost and, in the event that they are allocated free of charge, recorded at a value of zero. Amounts are derecognised at the date of the return, sale or expiry of the allowances or rights. In parallel to the recognition of these allowances and rights as assets, provisions are recognised in accordance with IAS 37 corresponding to the amount of obligations expected to arise in conjunction with the related emission regulations. Provisions are measured on the basis of the expected value of the allowances or rights that are to be returned.\n\nIf there is any indication of impairment of intangible assets, or if an annual impairment test is required (i.e. intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, intangible assets during the development phase and goodwill), an impairment test is performed. Each individual asset is tested separately unless the cash flows generated by the asset are not sufficiently independent from the cash flows generated by other assets or other groups of assets. In these cases, impairment is tested at the level of a cash-generating unit, which is the norm for the BMW Group.\n\nFor the purpose of the impairment test, the carrying amount of an asset (or a cash-generating unit) is compared with the recoverable amount. The first step of the impairment test is to determine the value in use. If the value in use is lower than the carrying amount, the next step is to determine the fair value less costs to sell and compare the amount so determined with the asset\u2019s carrying amount. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised, reducing the carrying amount to the higher of the asset\u2019s value in use or fair value less costs to sell.\n\nIf the reason for a previously recognised impairment loss no longer exists, the impairment loss is reversed up to the level of the recoverable amount, but no higher than the amortised acquisition or manufacturing cost. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.\n\nAs part of the process of assessing recoverability, it is generally necessary to apply estimations and assumptions \u2013 in particular regarding future cash inflows and outflows and the length of the forecast period \u2013 which could differ from actual amounts. Actual amounts may differ from the assumptions and estimations used if business conditions develop differently to expectations.\n\nThe BMW Group determines the value in use on the basis of a present value computation. Cash flows used for this calculation are derived from long-term forecasts approved by management. These long-term forecasts are based on detailed forecasts drawn up at an operational level, covering a planning period of six years. For the purposes of calculating cash flows beyond the planning period, a perpetual annuity return is assumed which does not take growth into account. Forecasting assumptions are continually adjusted to current information and regularly compared with external sources. The assumptions used take account in particular of expectations of the profitability of the product portfolio, future market share development, macroeconomic developments (such as currency, interest rate and raw materials prices) as well as the legal environment and past experience.\nAmounts are discounted on the basis of a market-related cost of capital rate. Impairment tests are performed for accounting and financial reporting purposes for the Automotive and Motorcycles cash-generating units using a risk-adjusted pre-tax cost of capital (WACC). In the case of the Financial Services cash-generating unit, a pre-tax cost of equity capital is used, as is customary in the sector. The following discount factors were applied:\n\n|                | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------|------|------|\n| Automotive     | 10.2 | 10.9 |\n| Motorcycles    | 10.2 | 10.9 |\n| Financial Services | 13.2 | 11.5 |\n\nThe risk-adjusted discount rate, calculated using a CAPM model, also takes into account specific peer-group information relating to beta-factors, capital structure data and borrowing costs. In conjunction with the impairment tests for cash-generating units, sensitivity analyses are performed for the main assumptions in order to rule out that possible changes to the assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount would result in the requirement to recognise an impairment loss. Even in the case of a 10% deterioration in the individual measurement assumptions, the need to recognise an impairment loss did not arise.\n\nAll items of property, plant and equipment are measured at acquisition or manufacturing cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of internally constructed plant and equipment comprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manufacturing process as well as an appropriate proportion of production-related overheads. This includes production-related depreciation and amortisation as well as an appropriate proportion of administrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in acquisition or manufacturing cost unless they are directly attributable to the asset. The carrying amount of items of depreciable property, plant and equipment is written down according to scheduled usage-based depreciation \u2013 as a general rule on a straight-line basis \u2013 over the useful lives of the assets. Depreciation is recorded as an expense in the income statement.\n\nThe following useful lives are applied throughout the BMW Group:\n\n|                                | in years |\n|--------------------------------|----------|\n| Factory and office buildings, residential buildings, fixed installations in buildings and outside facilities | 8 to 50  |\n| Plant and machinery            | 3 to 21  |\n| Other equipment, factory and office equipment | 2 to 25  |\n\nFor machinery used in multiple-shift operations, depreciation rates are increased to account for the additional utilisation. If there is any indication of impairment of property, plant and equipment, an impairment test is performed as described above for intangible assets.\n\nIn the case of leased items of property, plant and equipment, a right-of-use asset and a liability for the outstanding lease payments are recognised with effect from the date on which the leased asset becomes available for use by the BMW Group. The acquisition cost for the right-of-use asset is calculated as the sum of the present value of the future lease payments, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and the estimated costs of dismantling, removing or restoring the leased asset. Lease incentives granted by the lessor are deducted. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset and the expected lease term. If ownership of the leased asset is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in the lease payments, the right-of-use asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the leased asset. Right-of-use assets are reported in the balance sheet within the relevant line items for property, plant and equipment. The amortisation expense on right-of-use assets is reported in the income statement in cost of sales as well as in selling and administrative expenses.\n\nThe lease liability is measured on initial recognition at the present value of the future lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying amount of the lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced, without income statement impact, by the lease payments made. Lease liabilities are reported within financial liabilities, while interest expense is reported as part of net interest result. In the cash flow statement, both the repayment portion and the interest portion of lease payments are shown as cash outflows from financing activities.\nThe lease payments to be taken into account to measure the right-of-use asset and the lease liability comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or an interest rate as well as amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees. If it is reasonably certain that a purchase or lease extension option will be exercised, the relevant payments are also included. Payments for periods for which the lessee has an option to terminate a lease unilaterally are only included in the lease payments if it is reasonably certain that the termination option will not be exercised. For the purposes of assessing options, the BMW Group takes account of all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise the option.\n\nIFRS 16 requires that lease payments are discounted as a general rule using the interest rate implicit in the lease. However, since the interest rate in leases entered into by the BMW Group cannot readily be determined, amounts are discounted on the basis of the incremental borrowing rate, comprising the risk-free interest rate in the relevant currency for matching maturities plus a premium for the credit risk. Specific risks attached to an asset are generally not taken into account, given that collateral received in the context of alternative financing arrangements is not relevant within the BMW Group.\n\nDetermining which items are to be counted as lease payments \u2013 including the issue of the lease term underlying those payments \u2013 and which discount rate to apply involves using estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual outcomes.\n\nAs lessee, the BMW Group makes use of the application exemptions available for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.\n\nThe BMW Group has not applied the exemptions available to lessees to account for COVID-19-related rent concessions (amendment to IFRS 16 dated 28 May 2020).\n\nGroup products recognised by BMW Group entities as leased products under operating leases are measured at manufacturing cost and all other leased products at acquisition cost, in each case including initial direct costs. All leased products are depreciated over the period of the lease using the straight-line method down to their expected residual value. Where the recoverable amount of a lease exceeds the asset\u2019s carrying amount, changes in residual value expectations are recognised by adjusting scheduled depreciation prospectively over the remaining term of the lease. If the recoverable amount is lower than the asset\u2019s carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised for the shortfall. A test is carried out at each balance sheet date to determine whether an impairment loss recognised in prior years no longer exists or has decreased. In such cases, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount, at a maximum up to the amount of the asset\u2019s amortised cost.\n\nAssumptions and estimations are required regarding future residual values, since these represent a significant part of future cash inflows. Relevant factors to be considered include the trend in market prices and demand on the pre-owned automobile market. The assumptions are based on internally available historical data and current market data as well as on forecasts of external institutions. Furthermore, assumptions are regularly validated by comparison with external data.\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method are measured \u2013 provided no impairment has been recognised \u2013 at cost of investment adjusted for the Group\u2019s share of earnings and changes in equity capital. If there is any indication that an investment is impaired, an impairment test is performed on the basis of a discounted cash flow method. An indicator exists, for example, in the event of a serious shortfall compared to budget, the loss of an active market or if funds are required to avoid insolvency.\n\nWith the exception of lease receivables, financial assets are measured on initial recognition at their fair value. Financial assets include in particular other investments, receivables from sales financing, marketable securities and investment funds, derivative financial assets, trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. As a general rule, initial recognition takes place as soon as the BMW Group becomes a party to a contract; in the case of standard purchases or sales of non-derivative financial assets, initial recognition takes place at the settlement date.\n\nDepending on the business model and the structure of contractual cash flows, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, at fair value through comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. The category \u201cmeasured at fair value through comprehensive income\u201d at the BMW Group comprises\nmainly marketable securities and investment funds used for liquidity management purposes. Selected marketable securities and investment funds, money market funds within cash and cash equivalents as well as convertible bonds are recognised at fair value through profit or loss, as their contractual cash flows do not solely represent payments of principal and interest. The BMW Group does not make use of the option to measure equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income or debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe market values of financial instruments measured at fair value are determined on the basis of market information available at the balance sheet date, such as quoted prices or using appropriate measurement methods, in particular the discounted cash flow method.\n\nItems reported under other investments within the scope of IFRS 9 are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated companies that are not material to the BMW Group are also included in other investments.\n\nReceivables from sales financing are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Operating lease receivables due for payment at the end of the reporting period and included in this balance sheet line item are also measured on this basis, and the related vehicles reported as leased products. Receivables from sales financing also include finance lease receivables which are measured at the amount of the net investment in the lease.\n\nWith the exception of receivables from operating leases and trade receivables, the BMW Group applies the general approach described in IFRS 9 to determine impairment of financial assets. Under the general approach, loss allowances are measured on initial recognition on the basis of the expected 12-month credit loss (stage 1). If the credit loss risk at the end of the reporting period has increased significantly since initial recognition, the impairment allowance is measured on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses (stage 2 \u2013 general approach). The measurement of the change in default risk is based on a comparison of the default risk at the date of initial recognition and at the end of the reporting period. The default risk at the end of each reporting period is determined on the basis of credit checks, current key performance indicators and any overdue payments.\n\nThe BMW Group applies the simplified approach described in IFRS 9 to operating lease and trade receivables, whereby the amount of the loss allowance is measured subsequent to the initial recognition of the receivable on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses (stage 2 \u2013 simplified approach). For the purposes of allocating at item to stage 2, it is irrelevant whether the credit risk of the assets concerned has increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nAs a general rule, the BMW Group assumes that a receivable is in default if it is more than 90 days overdue or if there are objective indications of insolvency, such as the opening of insolvency proceedings. Credit-impaired assets are identified as such on the basis of this definition of default. In the case of credit-impaired assets which had not been credit-impaired at the time they were acquired or originated, an impairment allowance is recognised at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (stage 3). This is the case regardless of whether the general or simplified approach is applied. In the case of stage 3 assets, interest income is calculated on the asset\u2019s carrying amount less any impairment loss.\n\nThe BMW Group derecognises financial assets when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery. This may be the case, for instance, if the debtor is deemed not to have sufficient assets or other sources of income to service the debt.\n\nLoss allowances relating to the balance sheet item \u201cReceivables from sales financing\u201d are determined primarily on the basis of past experience with credit losses, current data on overdue receivables, rating classes and scoring information. Forward-looking information (for instance forecasts of key performance indicators) is also taken into account if, based on past experience, such indicators show a substantive correlation to actual credit losses.\nLoss allowances on trade receivables are determined primarily on the basis of information relating to overdue amounts. Input factors available on the market, such as ratings and probabilities of default, are used to calculate valuation allowance for cash and cash equivalents, financial receivables, receivables from subsidiaries and receivables from companies in which an investment is held. In the case of marketable securities and investment funds, the BMW Group usually applies the option not to allocate financial assets with a low default risk to different stages. Accordingly, assets with an investment grade rating are always allocated to stage 1.\n\nExpected credit losses are only presented separately if they are material for the BMW Group Financial Statements.\n\n**Derivative financial instruments** are used within the BMW Group for hedging purposes in order to reduce currency, interest rate, fair value and market price risks. Derivative financial instruments are recognised as of the trade date, measured at their fair value. Depending on their market value at measurement date, these financial instruments are reported in the balance sheet as financial assets or financial liabilities.\n\nFair values are determined on the basis of valuation models. Observable market price, tenor and currency basis spreads are taken into account in the measurement of derivative financial instruments. Furthermore, the Group\u2019s own credit risk and that of counterparties is taken into account on the basis of credit default swap values for market contracts with matching terms.\n\nThe BMW Group applies the option to recognise the credit risks arising from the fair values of a group of derivative financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their total net amount. Portfolio-based valuation adjustments (credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation adjustments) to the individual derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are allocated using the relative fair value approach (net method).\n\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are presented as part of other financial result in the income statement or within other comprehensive income as a component of accumulated other equity, depending on whether the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\n\nFair value hedges are mainly used to hedge interest rate risks relating to financial liabilities. The currency basis is not designated as part of the hedging relationship in the case of cross currency interest rate hedges accounted for as fair value hedges. Accordingly, changes in the market value of such components are recorded as costs of hedging within accumulated other equity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to other financial result within the income statement over the term of the hedging relationship.\n\nIn addition, for selected fixed-interest assets, a portion of the interest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis in accordance with IAS 39. The designated hedged items (underlying transactions) are reported in the balance sheet as receivables from sales financing and financial liabilities. In this case, swaps are used as the hedging instrument. Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a monthly basis at the end of each reporting period, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content of each portfolio.\n\nFair value hedge ineffectiveness is generally recognised in other financial result.\n\nThe time values of option transactions and the interest component \u2013 including the currency basis \u2013 of forward currency contracts are not designated as part of the hedging relationship in the case of currency hedges accounted for as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of such components are recorded as costs of hedging on a separate line within accumulated other equity. Amounts recorded in accumulated other equity from currency hedges are reclassified to cost of sales when the related hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIn the case of raw materials hedges that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, the hedging instruments are designated in full as part of the hedging relationship. As an exception to this general rule, the interest component of raw materials derivative instruments redesignated in conjunction with the first-time application of IFRS 9 was not designated as part of the hedging relationship. Changes in the fair value of this component are recorded as costs of hedging on a separate line within accumulated other equity. Amounts recorded in accumulated other equity are included in the carrying amount of inventories on initial recognition.\n\nIneffectiveness arising on cash flow hedges is recognised directly in cost of sales, whereas the impact of terminated hedging relationships is recognised in other operating income and expenses.\nDeferred income taxes are recognised for all temporary differences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and liabilities, including differences arising on consolidation procedures, as well as on unused tax losses and unused tax credits, to the extent that they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply for the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed at each balance sheet date on the basis of planned taxable income in future financial years. If with a probability of more than 50 percent future tax benefits will not be realised, either in part or in total, a valuation allowance is recognised on the deferred tax assets. The calculation of deferred tax assets requires assumptions to be made with regard to the level of future taxable income and the timing of recovery of deferred tax assets. These assumptions take account of forecast operating results and the impact on earnings of the reversal of taxable temporary differences. Since future business developments cannot be predicted with certainty and to some extent cannot be influenced by the BMW Group, the measurement of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associated companies as well as interests in joint arrangements are not recognised if the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. This is particularly the case if it is intended that profits will not be distributed, but rather will be used to maintain the substance and expand the volume of business of the entities concerned.\n\nCurrent income taxes are calculated within the BMW Group on the basis of tax legislation applicable in the relevant countries. To the extent that judgement was necessary to determine the treatment and amount of tax items presented in the financial statements, there is in principle a possibility that local tax authorities may take a different position.\n\nAs a general rule, each income tax treatment is considered independently when accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. If it is not considered probable that an income tax treatment will be accepted by the local tax authorities, the BMW Group uses the most likely amount of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit and the tax base.\n\nInventories of raw materials, supplies and goods for resale are stated at the lower of average acquisition cost and net realisable value.\n\nWork in progress and finished goods, as well as vehicles held for sale in the financial services business, are stated at the lower of manufacturing cost and net realisable value. Manufacturing cost comprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manufacturing process as well as an appropriate proportion of production-related overheads. This includes production-related depreciation and amortisation and an appropriate proportion of administrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in the acquisition or manufacturing cost of inventories.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise mainly cash on hand and cash at bank with an original term of up to three months. With the exception of money market funds, cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.\n\nFinancial liabilities, with the exception of lease liabilities, are measured on first-time recognition at their fair value. For these purposes, transaction costs are taken into account except in the case of financial liabilities allocated to the category \u201cmeasured at fair value through profit or loss\u201d. Subsequent to initial recognition, liabilities are \u2013 with the exception of derivative financial instruments \u2013 measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nProvisions for pensions are measured using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, not only obligations relating to known vested benefits at the reporting date are recognised, but also the effect of future expected increases in pensions and salaries. The calculation is based on independent actuarial valuations which take into account the relevant biometric factors.\nIn the case of funded plans, the pension obligation is offset against plan assets measured at their fair value. If the plan assets exceed the pension obligation, the surplus is tested for recoverability. In the event that the BMW Group has a right of reimbursement or a right to reduce future contributions, it reports an asset (within Other financial assets), measured on the basis of the present value of the future economic benefits attached to the plan assets. For funded plans, in cases where the obligation exceeds plan assets, a liability is recognised under pension provisions.\n\nThe calculation of the amount of the provision requires assumptions to be made with regard to discount rates, salary trends, employee fluctuation and the life expectancy of employees. Discount rates are determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality fixed-interest corporate bonds. The salary trend relates to the expected future rate of salary increase which is estimated annually based on inflation and the career development of employees within the Group.\n\nNet interest expense on the net defined benefit liability or net interest income on the net defined benefit assets are presented within the financial result. All other costs relating to allocations to pension provisions are allocated to costs by function in the income statement.\n\nPast service cost arises where a BMW Group company introduces a defined benefit plan or changes the benefits payable under an existing plan. This cost is recognised immediately in the income statement. Similarly, gains and losses arising on the settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nRemeasurement of the net liability can result from changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of the plan assets or the asset ceiling. Remeasurement can result, amongst others, from changes in financial and demographic parameters, as well as changes following the portfolio development. Remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income and ultimately in equity (within revenue reserves).\n\nOther provisions are recognised when the BMW Group has a present legal or factual obligation towards a third party arising from past events, the settlement of which is probable, and when the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions with a remaining period of more than one year are measured at their net present value.\n\nThe measurement of provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations (statutory, contractual and voluntary) involves estimations. In addition to manufacturer warranties prescribed by law, the BMW Group offers various further standard (assurance-type) warranties depending on the product and sales market. No provisions are recognised for additionally offered service packages that are treated as separate performance obligations.\n\nProvisions for statutory and non-statutory warranties are recognised at the point in time when control over the goods is transferred to the dealership or retail customer or when it is decided to introduce new warranty measures. With respect to the level of the provision, estimations are made in particular based on past experience of damage claims and processes. Future potential repair costs and price increases per product and market are also taken into account. Provisions for warranties for all companies of the BMW Group are adjusted regularly to take account of new information, with the impact of any changes recognised in the income statement. Further information is provided in note 33. Similar estimates are also made in conjunction with the measurement of expected reimbursement claims.\n\nThe recognition and measurements of provisions for litigation and liability risks necessitates making assumptions in order to determine the probability of liability, the amount of claim and the duration of the legal dispute. The assumptions made, especially the assumption about the outcome of legal proceedings, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The appropriateness of assumptions is regularly reviewed, based on assessments undertaken both by management and external experts, such as lawyers. If new developments arise in the future that result in a different assessment, provisions are adjusted accordingly.\n\nIf the recognition criteria relevant for provisions are not fulfilled and the outflow of resources on fulfilment is not unlikely, the potential obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability.\n\nRelated party disclosures comprise information on associated companies, joint ventures and non-consolidated subsidiaries as well as individuals which have the ability to exercise a controlling or significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the BMW Group. This includes all persons in key positions of the Company, as well as close members of their families or intermediary entities. In the case of the BMW Group, this also applies to members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. Details relating to these individuals and entities are provided in note 40 and in the list of investments disclosed in note 46.\nShare-based remuneration programmes which are expected to be settled in shares are measured at their fair value at grant date. The related expense is recognised as personnel expense in the income statement over the vesting period and offset against capital reserves. Share-based remuneration programmes expected to be settled in cash are revalued to their fair value at each balance sheet date between the grant date and the settlement date and on the settlement date itself. The expense is recognised as personnel expense in the income statement over the vesting period and presented in the balance sheet as a provision.\n\nThe share-based remuneration programme for Board of Management members and senior heads of department entitles BMW AG to elect whether to settle its commitments in cash or with shares of BMW AG common stock. Based on the decision to settle in cash, the share-based remuneration programmes for Board of Management members and senior heads of department are accounted for as cash-settled, share-based remuneration programmes. Further information on share-based remuneration programmes is provided in note 41.\n\n06 IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nGENERAL SITUATION\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s earnings for the financial year 2020 have been negatively impacted by the course of the coronavirus pandemic and the related measures put in place to contain the virus.\n\nWhereas the main negative factors in the first quarter were the drop in demand in China and the closure of dealerships in a few other markets, business in the second quarter was adversely impacted by the global spread of the pandemic affecting other key sales markets of the BMW Group. Although customer demand increased in many markets during the second half of the year, the repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic on business in the first half of the year continued to be felt. This is reflected in particular in the decline in revenues, mainly due to the lower number of vehicle sales and lower revenues from spare parts. The decline in vehicle sales was also reflected in cost of sales, whereby fixed costs fell on a less pronounced scale by comparison to the reduction in capacity utilisation levels. Group earnings were also negatively impacted by higher risk provisioning expenses relating in particular to the reassessment of residual value and credit risks.\n\nDue to lower new leasing business as well as lower expected new leasing business, the amount of revenues eliminated on consolidation fell compared to the previous year.\n\nThe year-on-year decrease in selling and administrative expenses mainly reflected the reduction in communication, marketing and travel expenses arising as a result of the containment measures implemented in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. Short-time work allowances received have been netted in the income statement against the corresponding expenses.\n\nIn light of the developments described above, Group net profit was significantly lower than in the previous year.\n\nSignificant effects on the Group Financial Statements are described below.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nImpairment tests\n\nThe increasing global spread of the coronavirus and the related low market capitalisation of BMW AG gave rise to an indication that tangible and intangible assets of the BMW Group could be impaired. As a result, impairment tests were performed for the Automotive, Motorcycles and Financial Services cash-generating units. In this context, values in use were determined on the basis of updated long-term forecasts that already reflect adjustments to expectations made in light of coronavirus. Against this backdrop, it was decided not to include probability-weighted scenarios. A detailed description of the methodology applied to perform impairment tests is provided in note 5.\n\nFrom the BMW Group\u2019s perspective, the spread of coronavirus also provided an indication of impairment relating to investments accounted for using the equity method. The exception to this general consideration was the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture in China, given the rapid economic recovery registered in that region. Further information is provided in note 24.\n\nDe-designation of hedge relationships\n\nFor the purposes of accounting for currency and commodity hedges, coronavirus-related effects on sales and production were taken into account as unscheduled exposure updates. If the hedged item was no longer expected to occur, the hedge relationships were de-designated. The corresponding amounts were then re-classified immediately from other comprehensive income to profit and loss (other operating income and expenses).\n\nResidual value risk\n\nFor the purposes of measuring and accounting for residual value risks, discretionary adjustments were made to the expected market values of vehicles in order to take account of the effects of the pandemic that are not considered in the existing measurement models (post-model adjustments). The adjustments were determined using a market-specific approach, thereby taking account of the varying effects and measures arising in each market as well as the structure of the valuation models.\n\nIn the case of the US market, past experience relevant for market value changes arising during the financial crisis was taken into account in the calculation of post-model adjustments. In the case of the UK and Canadian markets, the procedures applied also included projections drawn up by external providers on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In all cases, assumptions pertaining to the scale and duration of the pandemic\u2019s effects took account of current market value developments. If the regression models used were highly affected by market values realised in recent months, the outcomes were adjusted for exceptionally positive results in the second half of the year for instance, in the UK and the Netherlands. In the case of the Belgian and German markets, for instance, procedures included the derivation of a number of macroeconomic scenarios to calculate the potential impact on pre-owned vehicle valuations. Probabilities were weighted where necessary, taking into account external indicators (e.g. consumer confidence indices) and internal indicators (e.g. inventory trends). In some cases, including for the French market, macroeconomic parameters based on current risk estimates were adjusted.\n\nDiscretionary model adjustments are regularly reviewed in order to ensure that allowances for residual value losses are continuously updated on the basis of expected market values. In light of the volatile market environment and the current high level of uncertainty surrounding the future course of the coronavirus pandemic, only limited conclusions can be drawn from the recent improvement in market values observed on pre-owned automobile markets. A summary of the relevant values is provided in note 23.\nCredit risk\n\nI. Receivables from sales financing\n\nIn connection with the coronavirus pandemic, allowances for expected credit losses were increased to take account of the negative impact on retail customer and dealership business, to the extent not covered by the BMW Group\u2019s standard loss provisioning models (post-model adjustments).\n\nIn the case of retail customer business, portfolios were measured taking into account market-specific qualitative factors with the aim of identifying particularly affected portfolio segments (such as the tourism sector). This assessment was based on local expertise and took into account various scenarios, including the number of payment deferral applications, government measures and additional qualitative portfolio data. For the identified portfolio segments affected, amounts were reclassified from stage 1 (impairment allowance based on the 12-month expected credit losses) to stage 2 (impairment allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses), resulting in the recognition of additional risk allowances. Credit risk parameters were otherwise left unchanged.\n\nFurthermore, additional scenarios were considered for the economic development of individual markets (for example, the UK), for which an increased level of uncertainty exists. In addition, in light of current risk assessments, macroeconomic parameters were adjusted to take account of specific circumstances in some markets (for instance, South Africa and Malaysia). A summary of the values is provided in note 25.\n\nII. Trade receivables\n\nThe effects of a higher risk on receivables within stage 2 were calculated using a scenario model as the basis for recognising additional credit risk allowances for trade receivables. The standard model used by the BMW Group to determine expected credit losses is unable \u2013 at present \u2013 to appropriately take account of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. An increasing overdue status of these receivables is seen as a risk. A simulated reclassification of receivables to a higher overdue band was run, taking account of macroeconomic influencing factors, the development of the gross domestic product (GDP), of the countries concerned. An additional allowance for expected credit losses was calculated and recorded on the basis of this simulation. Further information on the calculation of valuation allowances in accordance with IFRS 9 is provided in note 5.\n\nOverall, the additional impairment losses described above were offset by a volume-related decrease in receivables. The lower level of impairment allowances compared to 31 December 2019 therefore arose as a result of the lower level of receivables overall. A summary of the relevant values is provided in note 30.\nNOTES TO THE INCOME STATEMENT\n\n07 REVENUES\n\nRevenues by activity comprise the following:\n\n| Activity                                      | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Sales of products and related goods           | 67,548 | 73,433 |\n| Sales of products previously leased to customers | 11,345 | 11,020 |\n| Income from lease instalments                 | 11,322 | 10,746 |\n| Interest income on loan financing and finance leases | 3,677  | 3,996  |\n| Revenues from service contracts, telematics and roadside assistance | 2,763  | 2,820  |\n| Other income                                  | 2,335  | 2,195  |\n| **Revenues**                                  | **98,990** | **104,210** |\n\nRevenues recognised from contracts with customers in accordance with IFRS 15 totalled \u20ac83,814 million (2019: \u20ac89,610 million).\n\nAn analysis of revenues by segment is shown in the explanatory comments on segment information provided in note 45. Revenues from the sale of products and related goods are generated primarily in the Automotive segment and, to a lesser extent, in the Motorcycles segment. Revenues from the sale of products previously leased to customers, income from lease instalments and interest income on loan financing are allocated to the Financial Services segment. Other income relates mainly to the Automotive segment and the Financial Services segment.\n\nThe major part of revenues expected to arise from the Group\u2019s order book at the end of the reporting period relates to the sale of vehicles. Revenues resulting from those sales will be recognised in the next financial year. The services included in vehicle sale contracts that will be recognised as revenues in subsequent years represent only an insignificant portion of expected revenues. Accordingly, use has been made of the practical expedient contained in IFRS 15, permitting an entity not to disclose information on a quantitative basis due to the short-term nature of items and the lack of informational value of such disclosures.\n\nInterest income on loan financing and finance leases includes interest calculated on the basis of the effective interest method totalling \u20ac3,424 million (2019: \u20ac3,687 million). This interest income is not reported separately in the income statement as it is not significant compared to total Group revenues.\n\n08 COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales comprises:\n\n| Activity                                      | 2020   | 2019*  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Manufacturing costs                           | 46,878 | 48,776 |\n| Cost of sales relating to financial services business | 27,114 | 25,828 |\n| thereof: interest expense relating to financial services business | 1,960  | 2,288  |\n| Research and development expenses            | 5,689  | 5,952  |\n| Expenses for service contracts, telematics and roadside assistance | 1,411  | 1,641  |\n| Warranty expenditure                          | 2,971  | 2,566  |\n| Other cost of sales                           | 1,345  | 1,384  |\n| **Cost of sales**                             | **85,408** | **86,147** |\n\n* Prior year\u2019s figures adjusted.\n\nCost of sales is reduced by public-sector subsidies in the form of reduced taxes on assets and reduced consumption-based taxes amounting to \u20ac105 million (2019: \u20ac105 million). Other cost of sales included expenses that were able to be allocated to manufacturing costs or cost of sales relating to financial services business. Prior year figures have been adjusted accordingly.\nImpairment losses recognised in the income statement 2020 in connection with receivables from sales financing amounted to \u20ac646 million (2019: \u20ac219 million). In view of the fact that the impairment losses are of minor importance compared to total Group cost of sales, they have not been disclosed separately in the income statement.\n\nResearch and development expenditure was as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------------|------|------|\n| Research and development expenses | 5,689 | 5,952 |\n| Amortisation | -1,710 | -1,667 |\n| New expenditure for capitalised development costs | 2,300 | 2,134 |\n| **Total research and development expenditure** | **6,279** | **6,419** |\n\n**09 SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES**\n\nSelling and administrative expenses relate mainly to expenses for marketing and communication, personnel and IT.\n\n| in \u20ac million | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------------|------|------|\n| Selling expenses | 5,300 | 5,656 |\n| Administrative expenses | 3,495 | 3,711 |\n| **Total selling and administrative expenses** | **8,795** | **9,367** |\n\n**10 OTHER OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES**\n\nOther operating income and expenses comprise the following items:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------------|------|------|\n| Exchange gains | 326 | 148 |\n| Income from the reversal of provisions | 114 | 433 |\n| Income from the reversal of impairment losses and write-downs | 164 | 8 |\n| Gains on the disposal of assets | 30 | 41 |\n| Sundry operating income | 282 | 401 |\n| **Other operating income** | **916** | **1,031** |\n| Exchange losses | -286 | -181 |\n| Expense for additions to provisions | -157 | -1,732 |\n| Expense for impairment losses and write-downs | -47 | -173 |\n| Loss on the disposal of assets | -117 | -20 |\n| Sundry operating expenses | -266 | -210 |\n| **Other operating expenses** | **-873** | **-2,316** |\n| **Other operating income and expenses** | **43** | **-1,285** |\n\nImpairment losses recognised on receivables from contracts with customers amounted to \u20ac47 million (2019: \u20ac48 million).\n\nThe expense for additions to provisions includes litigation and other legal risks. Income from the reversal of provisions includes income arising on the reassessment of risks from legal disputes.\n\nIn the previous year, an expense of approximately \u20ac1.4 billion was also recognised in connection with the ongoing anti-trust proceedings carried out by the European Commission (see also note 10 to the BMW Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2019). In December 2019, the BMW Group submitted a detailed response to the European Commission regarding the latter\u2019s Statement of Objections. A decision by the European Commission is pending. There was no impact on the income statement in the financial year 2020. The financial impact cannot be definitively assessed at this point in time.\n\nIncome from the reversal of and expenses for the recognition of impairment allowances and write-downs relate mainly to impairment allowances on receivables.\n### 11 NET INTEREST RESULT\n\n| Description                                                                 | 2020  | 2019  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Other interest and similar income                                          | 116   | 179   |\n| thereof from subsidiaries:                                                 | 8     | 9     |\n| Interest and similar income                                                | 116   | 179   |\n| Expense relating to interest impact on other long-term provisions          | \u2013199  | \u2013226  |\n| Net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability for pension plans| \u201334   | \u201341   |\n| Other interest and similar expenses                                        | \u2013225  | \u2013232  |\n| thereof subsidiaries:                                                      | \u20131    | \u20134    |\n| Interest and similar expenses                                              | \u2013458  | \u2013499  |\n| Net interest result                                                        | \u2013342  | \u2013320  |\n\n### 12 OTHER FINANCIAL RESULT\n\n| Description                                                                 | 2020  | 2019  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Income from investments in subsidiaries and participations                 | 135   | 387   |\n| thereof from subsidiaries:                                                 | 12    | 13    |\n| Expenses from investments in subsidiaries and participations               | \u201387   | \u2013307  |\n| Result on investments                                                      | 48    | 80    |\n| Income (+) and expenses (-) from financial instruments                     | \u2013234  | \u2013189  |\n| Sundry other financial result                                              | \u2013234  | \u2013189  |\n| Other financial result                                                     | \u2013186  | \u2013109  |\n\nSundry other financial result comprises mainly income and expenses arising on the measurement of stand-alone derivatives and fair value hedge relationships, as well as income and expenses from the measurement and sale of marketable securities and shares in investment funds.\n\n### 13 INCOME TAXES\n\nTaxes on income of the BMW Group comprise the following:\n\n| Description                                                                 | 2020  | 2019  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Current tax expense                                                        | 2,023 | 3,316 |\n| Deferred tax expense (+) / deferred tax income (\u2013)                          | \u2013658  | \u20131,176|\n| thereof relating to temporary differences                                  | \u2013450  | \u20131,439|\n| thereof relating to tax loss carryforwards and tax credits                 | \u2013208  | 263   |\n| Income taxes                                                               | 1,365 | 2,140 |\n\nThe tax expense was reduced by \u20ac4 million (2019: \u20ac30 million) as a result of utilising tax loss carryforwards, for which deferred assets had not previously been recognised and in conjunction with previously unrecognised tax credits and temporary differences.\n\nThe tax expense resulting from the change in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets relating to tax losses available for carryforward and temporary differences amounted to \u20ac10 million (2019: \u20ac7 million).\nDeferred taxes are determined on the basis of tax rates which are currently applicable or expected to apply in the relevant national jurisdictions when the amounts are recovered. After taking account of an average municipal trade tax multiplier rate (Hebesatz) of 428.0 (2019: 428.0), the underlying income tax rate for Germany was as follows:\n\n| in % | 2020 | 2019 |\n|------|------|------|\n| Corporate tax rate | 15.0 | 15.0 |\n| Solidarity surcharge | 5.5 | 5.5 |\n| Corporate tax rate including solidarity surcharge | 15.8 | 15.8 |\n| Municipal trade tax rate | 15.0 | 15.0 |\n| German income tax rate | 30.8 | 30.8 |\n\nDeferred taxes for non-German entities are calculated on the basis of the relevant country-specific tax rates. These ranged in the financial year 2020 between 9.0% and 40.0% (2019: between 9.0% and 40.0%).\n\nThe difference between the expected tax expense based on the underlying tax rate for Germany and actual tax expense is explained in the following reconciliation:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------|------|------|\n| Profit before tax | 5,222 | 7,118 |\n| Tax rate applicable in Germany | 30.8% | 30.8% |\n| Expected tax expense | 1,608 | 2,192 |\n| Variances due to different tax rates | \u2013397 | \u2013373 |\n| Tax increases (+)/tax reductions (\u2013) due to: | | |\n| Tax-exempt income | \u201397 | \u2013314 |\n| Non-deductible expenses | 398 | 909 |\n| Equity accounted | \u2013210 | 5 |\n| Tax expense (+)/benefits (\u2013) for prior years | 61 | \u2013162 |\n| Effects from tax rate changes | 17 | \u201317 |\n| Other variances | \u201315 | \u2013100 |\n| Actual tax expense | 1,365 | 2,140 |\n| Effective tax rate | 26.1% | 30.1% |\n\nThe tax increases as a result of non-deductible expenses mainly relate to non-recoverable withholding taxes.\n\nTax expense for prior years resulted primarily from adjustments to income tax receivables and provisions for prior years, among other things due to transfer pricing issues in conjunction with unconcluded and ongoing transfer pricing proceedings.\n\nOther variances include various reconciling items.\nThe allocation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to balance sheet line items at 31 December is shown in the following table:\n\n|                      | Deferred tax assets | Deferred tax liabilities |\n|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n|                      | 2020 | 2019 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Intangible assets    | 17   | 17   | 3,354 | 3,186 |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 49   | 53   | 673   | 780   |\n| Leased products      | 282  | 324  | 3,203 | 4,085 |\n| Other investments    | 6    | 3    | 1     | 22    |\n| Sundry other assets  | 1,013 | 1,125 | 3,966 | 3,454 |\n| Tax loss carryforwards | 476  | 306  | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n| Capital Losses       | 348  | 329  | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n| Provisions           | 6,655 | 6,239 | 33    | 42    |\n| Liabilities          | 3,717 | 3,544 | 852   | 647   |\n| Eliminations         | 3,721 | 3,883 | 1,766 | 1,539 |\n|                      | 16,284 | 15,823 | 13,848 | 13,755 |\n| Valuation allowances on tax loss carryforwards | \u2013138 | \u2013177 | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n| Valuation allowances on capital losses | \u2013348 | \u2013329 | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n| Netting              | \u201313,339 | \u201313,123 | \u201313,339 | \u201313,123 |\n| Deferred taxes       | 2,459 | 2,194 | 509   | 632   |\n| Net                  | 1,950 | 1,562 | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n\nLoss carryforwards relating to Germany and foreign operations amounted to \u20ac1,568 million (2019: \u20ac954 million). This includes one tax-loss carryforward amounting to \u20ac406 million (2019: \u20ac519 million), on which a valuation allowance of \u20ac138 million (2019: \u20ac177 million) was recognised on the related deferred tax asset. The increase in tax losses available for carryforward was mainly attributable to the decline in earnings as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFor entities with tax losses available for carryforward, a net surplus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities is reported amounting to \u20ac392 million (2019: \u20ac292 million). The basis for the recognition of deferred taxes is the BMW Group business model or management\u2019s assessment that there is material evidence that the entities will generate future taxable profit, against which deductible temporary differences can be offset. In this context, it is also expected that the loss recorded by BMW AG tax group for income tax purposes for the financial year 2020 can be utilised in full in the coming years, taking into account the minimum taxation rules in Germany. Furthermore, it is assumed that tax start-up losses relating to the San Luis Potos\u00ed plant in Mexico, opened in 2019, can be utilised by offset against planned future profits.\n\nLoss carryforwards amounting to \u20ac1,129 million (2019: \u20ac553 million) can be used indefinitely, while \u20ac439 million (2019: \u20ac401 million) expire after more than 3 years.\n\nCapital losses available for carryforward in the United Kingdom which do not relate to ongoing operations decreased to \u20ac1,832 million (2019: \u20ac1,938 million) due to currency factors. As in previous years, deferred tax assets recognised on these tax losses \u2013 amounting to \u20ac348 million at the end of the reporting period (2019: \u20ac329 million) \u2013 were fully written down since they can only be utilised against future capital gains.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted for each relevant tax entity if they relate to the same tax authorities.\nDeferred taxes recognised directly in equity amounted to \u20ac1,710 million (2019: \u20ac2,015 million).\n\n| in \u20ac million | 2020 | 2019* |\n|--------------|------|-------|\n| Deferred taxes at 1 January (assets (+)/liabilities (\u2212)) | 1,562 | \u2212122 |\n| Deferred tax expense (\u2212)/income (+) recognised through income statement | 658 | 1,176 |\n| Change in deferred taxes recognised directly in equity | \u2212305 | 558 |\n| thereof relating to fair value gains and losses on financial instruments and marketable securities recognised directly in equity | \u2212443 | 170 |\n| thereof relating to the remeasurements of net liabilities for defined benefit pension plans | 161 | 376 |\n| thereof from currency translation | \u221223 | 12 |\n| Exchange rate impact and other changes | 35 | \u221250 |\n| Deferred taxes at 31 December (assets (+)/liabilities (\u2212)) | 1,950 | 1,562 |\n\n* Sign convention changed compared to previous year\u2019s Group Financial Statements.\n\nTaxable temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures amount to \u20ac22,174 million (2019: \u20ac21,215 million). No deferred taxes are recognised on these taxable temporary differences because the BMW Group is able to determine the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future, in particular in view of the fact that there is no intention to distribute the profits, but rather to use them to maintain their substance and reinvest in the companies concerned. No computation was made of the potential impact of income taxes on the grounds of proportionality. Deferred tax liabilities on expected dividends amount to \u20ac76 million (2019: \u20ac64 million) and relate primarily to dividends from foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures.\n\nThe tax returns of BMW Group entities are checked regularly by German and foreign tax authorities. Taking account of numerous factors \u2013 including interpretations, commentaries and legal decisions relating to the various tax jurisdictions as well as past experience \u2013 adequate provision has been made, to the extent identifiable and probable, for potential future tax obligations.\n14 EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\n|                                | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net profit attributable to the shareholders of BMW AG | \u20ac 3,775.0 | \u20ac 4,914.5 |\n| Profit attributable to common stock | \u20ac 3,448.1 | \u20ac 4,494.4 |\n| Profit attributable to preferred stock | \u20ac 326.9 | \u20ac 420.1 |\n| Average number of common stock shares in circulation | 601,995,196 | 601,995,196 |\n| Average number of preferred stock shares in circulation | 56,867,180 | 56,122,857 |\n| Basic / diluted earnings per share of common stock | \u20ac 5.73 | \u20ac 7.47 |\n| Basic / diluted earnings per share of preferred stock | \u20ac 5.75 | \u20ac 7.49 |\n| Dividend per share of common stock | \u20ac 1.90* | \u20ac 2.50 |\n| Dividend per share of preferred stock | \u20ac 1.92* | \u20ac 2.52 |\n\n* Proposal by management.\n\nEarnings per share of preferred stock are computed on the basis of the number of preferred stock shares entitled to receive a dividend in each of the relevant financial years. As in the previous year, diluted earnings per share correspond to basic earnings per share.\n\n15 PERSONNEL EXPENSES\n\nThe income statement includes personnel expenses as follows:\n\n|                                | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Wages and salaries             | 10,081 | 10,370 |\n| Pension and welfare expenses   | 1,252  | 1,133  |\n| Social insurance expenses      | 911    | 948    |\n| Personnel expenses             | 12,244 | 12,451 |\n\nPersonnel expenses include \u20ac602 million (2019: \u20ac72 million) of costs relating to workforce measures. The total pension expense for defined contribution plans of the BMW Group amounted to \u20ac150 million (2019: \u20ac148 million). Employer contributions paid to state pension insurance schemes totalled \u20ac634 million (2019: \u20ac667 million).\nThe average number of employees during the year was:\n\n|                      | 2020  | 2019* |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|\n| Average number of employees | 122,874 | 123,868 |\n| thereof at proportionately-consolidated entities | 139 | \u2013 |\n\n* Prior year\u2019s figures adjusted.\n\nThe previous year\u2019s figure was adjusted in view of the change in the internal management system (see Annual Report 2019, Group Management Report). The number of employees at the end of the reporting period is disclosed in the Combined Management Report.\n\n16 LEASES\n\na  As lessee\n\nIn terms of accounting for leases as a lessee, the following amounts are included in the income statement:\n\n|                      | 2020  | 2019 |\n|----------------------|-------|------|\n| Expenses for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases | \u2013 91 | \u2013 94 |\n| Expenses relating to variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities | \u2013 13 | \u2013 3 |\n| Interest expense arising on the measurement of lease liabilities | \u2013 55 | \u2013 54 |\n\nMost of the expenses for leases for low-value assets and short-term leases relate to low-value assets.\n\nThe BMW Group is party to leases at the end of the reporting period which have not yet commenced. These leases could give rise to future cash outflows amounting to \u20ac225 million (2019: \u20ac42 million).\n\nTotal cash outflows for leases in 2020 amounted to \u20ac653 million (2019: \u20ac591 million).\n\nInformation on right-of-use assets, lease liabilities as well as further explanatory comments are provided in note 5 (Accounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimates), note 20 (Analysis of changes in Group tangible, intangible and investment assets in 2020), note 22 (Property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use assets arising from leases)) and note 35 (Financial liabilities).\n\nb  As lessor\n\n|                      | 2020  | 2019 |\n|----------------------|-------|------|\n| Income from variable lease payments for operating leases | 148 | 171 |\n| Income from variable lease payments for finance leases | 17 | 19 |\n| Financial income on the net investment in finance leases | 890 | 885 |\n| Selling profit on the sale of vehicles previously leased to retail customers under finance leases* | 1,167 | 1,384 |\n\n* Prior year\u2019s figures adjusted.\n\nVariable lease payments are based on distance driven. The agreements have, in part, extension and purchase options.\n17 FEE EXPENSE FOR THE GROUP AUDITOR\n\nThe fee expense pursuant to \u00a7 314 (1) no. 9 HGB recognised in the financial year 2020 for the Group auditor and the PwC network of audit firms amounted to \u20ac18 million (2019: \u20ac19 million) and consists of the following:\n\n| in \u20ac million | PwC International | thereof: PwC GmbH

allocated to the Automotive segment and is not subject to scheduled amortisation since its useful life is deemed to be indefinite. The asset is subject to a limited right of ownership. The \u20ac3 million decrease in the carrying amount is entirely due to currency factors. Intangible assets also include goodwill of \u20ac33 million (2019: \u20ac33 million) allocated to the Automotive cash-generating unit (CGU) and goodwill of \u20ac346 million (2019: \u20ac347 million) allocated to the Financial Services CGU.\n\nAs in the previous year, there was no requirement to recognise impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses on intangible assets in 2020.\n\nAs in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a cost component of intangible assets in 2020.\n\n22 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS ARISING FROM LEASES)\n\nNo impairment losses were recognised in 2020, as in the previous year.\n\nAs in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a cost component of property, plant and equipment in 2020.\n\nRight-of-use assets arising from leases of land and buildings relate primarily to logistics and office premises and, to a lesser extent, to selling and production premises. In order to secure these premises and, in the interests of flexibility, the property rental agreements concerned often contain extension and termination options.\n\n23 LEASED PRODUCTS\n\nMinimum lease payments of non-cancellable operating leases amounting to \u20ac20,872 million (2019: \u20ac20,894 million) fall due as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|-------------|------------|------------|\n| within one year | 9,285 | 9,804 |\n| between one and two years | 6,327 | 6,489 |\n| between two and three years | 3,416 | 3,278 |\n| between three and four years | 1,534 | 1,073 |\n| between four and five years | 275 | 225 |\n| later than five years | 35 | 25 |\n| Minimum lease payments | 20,872 | 20,894 |\n\nImpairment losses amounting to \u20ac312 million (2019: \u20ac198 million) were recognised on leased products in 2020 as a consequence of changes in residual value expectations. Income from the reversal of impairment losses amounted to \u20ac110 million (2019: \u20ac74 million).\n24 INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method comprise the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BMW Brilliance), Shenyang, the joint venture YOUR NOW Holding GmbH, Munich, the joint venture IONITY Holding GmbH & Co. KG (IONITY), Munich, and the interest in the associated company THERE Holding B.V. (THERE), Rijswijk.\n\nBMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\n\nBMW Brilliance produces BMW brand models mainly for the Chinese market and also has engine manufacturing facilities, which supply the joint venture\u2019s two plants with petrol engines.\n\nThe BMW Group intends to increase its stake in the BMW Brilliance joint venture from 50% to 75%. On 11 October 2018, the BMW Group signed an agreement with its joint venture partner, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (CBA), to acquire an additional 25% shareholding in BMW Brilliance. The two partners agreed on a purchase price of an equivalent of \u20ac3.6 billion. The contractual term of the joint venture, which would currently expire in 2028, is to be extended to 2040 as part of the agreement. The prerequisite for the extension is the acquisition of the additional shares as agreed. The agreement was approved at the CBA shareholders\u2019 meeting on 18 January 2019 and remains subject to the approval of the relevant authorities. The transaction is scheduled to close in 2022. The closing will result in BMW Brilliance being fully consolidated in the BMW Group Financial Statements and is expected to result in the recognition of a significant valuation gain in the financial year in which the transaction closes.\n\nYOUR NOW\n\nWith effect from 31 January 2019, the BMW Group completed the merger of several mobility services companies under the name YOUR NOW. The at-equity loss reported for YOUR NOW Holding GmbH for 2020 amounted to \u20ac349 million (2019: loss of \u20ac662 million). This loss includes impairment losses amounting to \u20ac113 million (2019: loss of \u20ac277 million), recorded at the level of YOUR NOW Holding GmbH. The impairment losses arose in light of the fact that \u2013 with respect to its impact on the BMW Group\u2019s investments accounted for using the equity method \u2013 the spread of the coronavirus gave rise to an indication of possible impairment, both at the level of the BMW Group and at the level of YOUR NOW Holding GmbH. The test only resulted in the need to recognise an impairment loss at the level of YOUR NOW Holding GmbH. In the previous year, impairment losses amounting to \u20ac240 million were also recognised in the BMW Group Financial Statements on the carrying amount of individual YOUR NOW companies. These impairment losses were reported in the result on investments within other financial result.\n\nIONITY\n\nTogether with Daimler AG, Stuttgart (Daimler AG), the Ford Motor Company, the Volkswagen Group, Kia Motors Corporation and Hyundai Motor Corporation, the BMW Group operates the joint venture IONITY Holding GmbH & Co. KG, whereby each of the parties has an equal shareholding. The entry of Kia Motors Corporation and Hyundai Motor Corporation was completed in May 2020. Following the impairment test, an impairment loss of \u20ac27 million was recognised in the BMW Group Financial Statements and included in the result on investments within other financial result.\n\nTHERE\n\nTogether with AUDI AG, Daimler AG and other companies, the BMW Group holds shares in THERE. HERE International B.V. (HERE) is an associated company of THERE. HERE\u2019s digital maps are laying the foundations for the next generation of mobility and location-based services, providing the basis for new assistance systems and, ultimately, fully automated driving.\n\nIn December 2019, it was announced that Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) would jointly acquire a 30% stake in HERE. This acquisition was completed in May 2020 following the receipt of approval from the antitrust authorities. The sale of the shares gave rise to a positive impact of \u20ac105 million which is reported within the result from equity accounted investments. In addition, share capital reductions were carried out at the level of THERE in June and September 2020, resulting in \u20ac197 million being returned to the BMW Group.\n\nThe spread of the coronavirus also gave rise to an indication of possible impairment from the BMW Group\u2019s perspective. The impairment test was based on HERE\u2019s current business plan, which already incorporates its lowered expectations in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The value in use was determined on the basis of a present value computation derived from the revised business plan. A pre-tax discount rate of 18.5% was applied. Following the impairment test, an impairment loss of \u20ac27 million was recognised in the BMW Group Financial Statements and included in the result on investments within other financial result.\nFinancial information relating to equity accounted investments is summarised in the following tables (from a 100% perspective):\n\n| in \u20ac million | BMW Brilliance | THERE | YOUR NOW | IONITY |\n|--------------|----------------|-------|----------|--------|\n|              | 2020 | 2019 | 2020 | 2019 | 2020 | 2019\u00b9 | 2020 | 2019\u00b9 |\n| DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THE BALANCE SHEET | | | | | | | | |\n| Non-current assets | 7,292 | 7,248 | 1,190 | 1,131 | 945 | 1,610 | 244 | 175 |\n| Current assets | 9,859 | 7,381 | 24 | 467 | 767 | 1,116 | 55 | 70 |\n| thereof cash and cash equivalents | 5,137 | 2,937 | 24 | 1 | 341 | 818 | 17 | 50 |\n| Equity | 7,388 | 5,293 | 1,214 | 1,597 | 1,226 | 2,073 | 244 | 205 |\n| Non-current financial liabilities, provisions and liabilities | 1,546 | 1,358 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 113 | 184 | 13 | 10 |\n| Current financial liabilities, provisions and liabilities | 8,217 | 7,978 | \u2013 | 1 | 373 | 469 | 42 | 30 |\n| RECONCILIATION OF AGGREGATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION | | | | | | | | |\n| Assets | 17,151 | 14,629 | 1,214 | 1,598 | 1,712 | 2,726 | 299 | 245 |\n| Provisions and liabilities | 9,763 | 9,336 | \u2013 | 1 | 486 | 653 | 55 | 40 |\n| Net assets | 7,388 | 5,293 | 1,214 | 1,597 | 1,226 | 2,073 | 244 | 205 |\n| Group\u2019s interest in net assets | 3,694 | 2,646 | 335\u00b2 | 475 | 591 | 987 | 49 | 51 |\n| Eliminations | \u20131,084 | \u2013960 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Carrying amount | 2,610 | 1,686 | 335\u00b2 | 475 | 591 | 987 | 49 | 51 |\n\n\u00b9 Prior year\u2019s figures adjusted.\n\u00b2 Including shareholder impairment.\n### DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THE INCOME STATEMENT\n\n|                                | BMW Brilliance | THERE | YOUR NOW | IONITY |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|-------|----------|--------|\n|                                | 2020           | 2019  | 2020     | 2019   | 2020   | 2019\u00b9 |\n| Revenues                       | 23,913         | 21,910| \u2013        | \u2013      | 234    | 424   | 8     | 1     |\n| Scheduled depreciation         | 707            | 651   | \u2013        | \u2013      | 127    | 150   | 19    | 10    |\n| Profit / loss before financial result | 3,174         | 2,374 | \u20131       | \u20131     | \u2013693   | \u20131,349| \u201343   | \u201329   |\n| Interest income                | 80             | 84    | 4        | \u2013      | \u2013      | \u2013     | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n| Interest expense               | 5              | 5     | \u2013        | \u2013      | 3      | 23    | 1     | 1     |\n| Income taxes                   | 822            | 654   | \u2013        | \u2013      | 6      | \u201328   | \u20138    | \u20135    |\n| Profit / loss after tax        | 2,560          | 1,947 | 206      | \u2013383   | \u2013749   | \u20131,805| \u201337   | \u201324   |\n| thereof from continuing operations | 2,560         | 1,947 | 206      | \u2013383   | \u2013701   | \u20131,805| \u201337   | \u201324   |\n| thereof from discontinued operations | \u2013             | \u2013     | \u2013        | \u2013      | \u201348    | \u2013     | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n| Other comprehensive income     | 169            | \u201314   | 10       | 1      | \u201381    | 17    | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n| Total comprehensive income     | 2,729          | 1,933 | 216      | \u2013382   | \u2013830   | \u20131,788| \u201337   | \u201324   |\n| Group dividend income\u00b2         | 379            | 1,284 | \u2013        | \u2013      | \u2013      | \u2013     | \u2013     | \u2013     |\n\n\u00b9 Prior year\u2019s figures adjusted.\n\u00b2 Including dividends received in the amount of \u20ac1,020 million (2019: \u20ac643 million).\n25 RECEIVABLES FROM SALES FINANCING\n\nReceivables from sales financing comprise the following:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12. 2020 | 31.12. 2019 |\n|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Credit financing for retail customers and dealerships* | 63,584 | 71,104 |\n| Finance lease receivables | 20,693 | 21,333 |\n| Receivables from sales financing | 84,277 | 92,437 |\n\n* Figure contains Operating leases.\n\nImpairment allowances on receivables from sales financing in accordance with IFRS 9, which only arise within the Financial Services segment, developed as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Total |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|\n| General | Simplified | Total |\n| Impairment allowances at 1 January 2020 | 361 | 209 | 12 | 517 | 1,099 |\n| Reclassification to Stage 1 | 1 | -6 | -

Claims may be settled earlier than this depending on the timing of the underlying proceedings. The decrease in income tax assets was mainly attributable to tax reimbursements.\n28 OTHER ASSETS\n\nOther assets comprise:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Return right assets for future leased products | 3,041 | 4,807 |\n| Receivables from companies in which an investment is held | 2,048 | 2,641 |\n| Other taxes | 1,581 | 1,935 |\n| Expected reimbursement claims | 1,046 | 1,086 |\n| Receivables from subsidiaries | 546 | 308 |\n| Collateral assets | 454 | 413 |\n| Prepaid expenses | 364 | 396 |\n| Sundry other assets | 1,246 | 1,353 |\n| **Other assets** | **10,326** | **12,939** |\n| thereof non-current | 1,216 | 1,325 |\n| thereof current | 9,110 | 11,614 |\n\nCollateral assets comprise mainly customary collateral (banking deposits) arising on the sale of asset-backed financing instruments.\n\n29 INVENTORIES\n\nInventories comprise the following:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Finished goods and goods for resale | 10,542 | 11,491 |\n| Work in progress, unbilled contracts | 1,373 | 1,286 |\n| Raw materials and supplies | 1,660 | 1,674 |\n| Vehicles held for sale in the financial services business | 818 | 808 |\n| Advance payments to suppliers | 503 | 632 |\n| **Inventories** | **14,896** | **15,891** |\n\nOut of the total amount recognised for inventories at 31 December 2020, inventories measured at net realisable value amounted to \u20ac899 million (2019: \u20ac973 million).

The previous year\u2019s figures were adjusted due to a change in the computational logic. The adjusted amount disclosed no longer relates only to products sold, but also includes the impact of inter-segment eliminations. Excluding inter-segment eliminations, the prior-year figure amounted to \u20ac62,633 million.

Preferred stock, to which no voting rights are attached, bear an additional dividend of \u20ac0.02 per share.\n\nIn 2020, a total of 822,124 shares of preferred stock was sold to employees at a reduced price of \u20ac36.55 per share in conjunction with an Employee Share Programme. These shares are entitled to receive dividends for the first time with effect from the financial year 2021.\n\nIssued share capital increased by \u20ac0.8 million as a result of the issue to employees of 822,000 new shares of non-voting preferred stock. BMW AG is authorised up to 15 May 2024 to issue 5 million shares of non-voting preferred stock amounting to nominal \u20ac5.0 million. At the end of the reporting period, 3.4 million of these amounting to nominal \u20ac3.4 million remained available for issue.\n\nIn addition, 124 previously issued shares of preferred stock were acquired and re-issued to employees.\nCapital reserves\n\nCapital reserves include premiums arising from the issue of shares and totalled \u20ac2,199 million (2019: \u20ac2,161 million). The change amounting to \u20ac38 million related to the share capital increase in conjunction with the issue of shares of preferred stock to employees.\n\nRevenue reserves\n\nRevenue reserves comprise the non-distributed earnings of companies consolidated in the Group Financial Statements. In addition, remeasurements of the net defined benefit obligation for pension plans are also presented in revenue reserves.\n\nIt is proposed that the unappropriated profit of BMW AG for the financial year 2020 amounting to \u20ac1,253 million be utilised as follows:\n\n\u2014 Distribution of a dividend of \u20ac1.92 per share of preferred stock (\u20ac109 million)\n\u2014 Distribution of a dividend of \u20ac1.90 per share of common stock (\u20ac1,144 million)\n\nThe proposed distribution was not recognised as a liability in the Group Financial Statements.\n\nAccumulated other equity\n\nAccumulated other equity comprises amounts recognised directly in equity resulting from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and marketable securities, costs of hedging recognised directly in equity as well the related deferred taxes.\n\nCapital management disclosures\n\nThe BMW Group\u2019s objectives with regard to capital management are to safeguard over the long-term the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide an adequate return to shareholders.\n\nThe capital structure is managed in order to meet needs arising from changes in economic conditions and the risks of the underlying assets.\n\nThe BMW Group is not subject to any unified external minimum equity capital requirements. Within the Financial Services segment, however, there are a number of individual entities which are subject to equity capital requirements of relevant regulatory banking authorities.\n\nIn order to manage its capital structure, the BMW Group uses various instruments, including the amount of dividends paid to shareholders and share buybacks. Moreover, the BMW Group actively manages debt capital, carrying out funding activities with a target debt structure in mind. A key aspect in the selection of financial instruments is the objective to achieve matching maturities for the Group\u2019s financing requirements. In order to reduce non-systematic risk, the BMW Group uses a variety of financial instruments available on the world\u2019s capital markets to achieve diversification.\n\nThe capital structure at the end of the reporting period was as follows:\n\n|                                | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of BMW AG | 60,891     | 59,324     |\n| Proportion of total capital    | 36.4%      | 33.7%      |\n| Non-current financial liabilities | 67,390     | 70,647     |\n| Current financial liabilities  | 38,986     | 46,093     |\n| Total financial liabilities    | 106,376    | 116,740    |\n| Proportion of total capital    | 63.6%      | 66.3%      |\n| Total capital                  | 167,267    | 176,064    |\n\nEquity attributable to shareholders of BMW AG increased during the financial year by 2.6%, primarily reflecting the increase in revenue reserves.\n32 PENSION PROVISIONS\n\nIn the case of defined benefit plans, the BMW Group is required to pay the benefits it has granted to present and past employees. Defined benefit plans may be covered by provisions or pension assets. In Germany, pension obligations of the BMW Group are mostly covered by assets transferred to BMW Trust e.V., Munich, in conjunction with a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA) (funded plan). Funded plans also exist in the UK, the USA, Switzerland, Belgium and Japan. In the meantime, most of the defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants.\n\nThe assumptions stated below, which depend on the economic situation in the relevant country, are used to measure the defined benefit obligation of each pension plan. In Germany, the so-called \u201cpension entitlement trend\u201d (Festbetragstrend) remained at 2.0%. The following weighted average values have been used for Germany, the UK and other countries:\n\n|                      | Germany | United Kingdom | Other |\n|----------------------|---------|----------------|-------|\n| Discount rate        | 0.55    | 1.00           | 1.19  |\n| Pension level trend  | 1.33    | 1.38           | 2.19  |\n| Weighted duration of all pension obligations in years | 21.6 | 21.3 | 19.8 |\n\nThe following mortality tables are applied in countries, in which the BMW Group has significant defined benefit plans:\n\n- Germany: Mortality Table 2018 G issued by Prof. K. Heubeck (with invalidity rates reduced by 70%)\n- United Kingdom: S2PA tables and S3PA light tables\nBased on the measurement principles contained in IAS 19, the following balance sheet carrying amounts apply to the Group\u2019s pension plans:\n\n|                      | Germany | United Kingdom | Other | Total |\n|----------------------|---------|----------------|-------|-------|\n|                      | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligations | 15,535 | 14,022 | 9,944 | 9,503 | 1,108 | 1,127 | 26,587 | 24,652 |\n| Fair value of plan assets | 12,451 | 11,320 | 9,589 | 9,137 | 870 | 883 | 22,910 | 21,340 |\n| Effect of limiting net defined benefit asset to asset ceiling | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2 |\n| Carrying amounts at 31 December | 3,084 | 2,702 | 355 | 366 | 241 | 246 | 3,680 | 3,314 |\n| thereof pension provisions | 3,084 | 2,702 | 355 | 371 | 254 | 262 | 3,693 | 3,335 |\n| thereof assets | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u20135 | \u201313 | \u201316 | \u201313 |\n\nThe most significant of the BMW Group\u2019s pension plans are described below.\n\n**Germany**\n\nBoth employer- and employee-funded benefit plans exist in Germany. Benefits paid in conjunction with these plans comprise old-age retirement pensions as well as invalidity and surviving dependants\u2019 benefits. The level of ongoing pension payments is adjusted in accordance with \u00a7 16 of the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz).\n\nThe defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants since 2014. Defined contribution plans with a minimum rate of return, comprising employer- and employee-funded components, continue to exist. The fact that the plan involves a minimum rate of return means that the defined contribution entitlements are classified in accordance with IAS 19 as defined benefit plans. In the case of defined benefit plans involving the payment of a pension, the amount of benefits to be paid is determined by multiplying a fixed amount by the number of years of service.\n\nThe assets of the German pension plans are invested by BMW Trust e.V., Munich, in accordance with a CTA. The representative bodies of this entity are the Board of Directors and the Members\u2019 General Meeting. BMW Trust e.V., Munich, currently has seven members and three members of the Board of Directors elected by the Members\u2019 General Meeting. The Board of Directors is responsible for investments, drawing up and deciding on investment guidelines as well as monitoring compliance with those guidelines. The members of the association can be employees, employee representatives, senior executives and members of the Board of Management of BMW AG. An ordinary Members\u2019 General Meeting takes place once every calendar year, and deals with a range of matters, including receiving and approving the association\u2019s annual report, ratifying the activities of the Board of Directors and adopting changes to the association\u2019s statutes.\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\nDefined benefit plans exist in the United Kingdom which are closed for all plan participants. Vested benefits remain in place. New benefits are covered by contributions made to a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans are administered by BMW Pension Trustees Limited, Farnborough, and BMW (UK) Trustees Limited, Farnborough, both trustee companies which act independently of the BMW Group. BMW (UK) Trustees Limited, Farnborough, is represented by ten trustees and BMW Pension Trustees Limited, Farnborough, by five trustees. A minimum of one third of the trustees must be elected by plan participants. The trustees represent the interests of plan participants and decide on investment strategies. Funding contributions to the funds are determined in agreement with the BMW Group.\nThe change in the net liability for defined benefit pension plans can be derived as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million | Defined benefit obligation | Plan assets | Total | Effect of limitation of the net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling | Net defined benefit liability

Past service cost resulted mainly from differing assumptions used to calculate statutory pension entitlements on the one hand and for the ongoing accounting for active employees on the other.\n\nPast service cost in the previous year resulted mainly from the complete closure of two defined benefit plans in the USA.\n\nDepending on the cash flow profile and risk structure of the pension obligations involved, plan assets relating to defined benefit plans are invested in a diversified portfolio.\nPlan assets in Germany, the UK and other countries comprised the following:\n\n| COMPONENTS OF PLAN ASSETS | Germany 2020 | Germany 2019 | United Kingdom 2020 | United Kingdom 2019 | Other 2020 | Other 2019 | Total 2020 | Total 2019 |\n|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Equity instruments        | 2,166        | 2,031        | 348                 | 584                 | 74         | 91         | 2,588      | 2,705      |\n| Debt instruments          | 7,326        | 6,513        | 6,940               | 6,646               | 632        | 592        | 14,898     | 13,754     |\n| thereof investment grade  | 5,041        | 4,275        | 6,316               | 5,891               | 625        | 585        | 11,982     | 10,752     |\n| thereof mixed funds (funds without a rating) | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| thereof non-investment grade | 2,285 | 2,238 | 624 | 757 | 7 | 7 | 2,916 | 3,002 |\n| Real estate funds         | \u2013            | \u2013            | \u2013                   | \u2013                   | 19         | 19         | 19         | 19         |\n| Money market funds        | \u2013            | \u2013            | 85                  | 74                  | 2          | 29         | 87         | 103        |\n| Absolute return funds     | \u2013            | \u2013            | \u2013                   | \u2013                   | \u2013          | \u2013          | \u2013          | \u2013          |\n| Other                     | 128          | 109          | \u2013                   | \u2013                   | 6          | 15         | 134        | 124        |\n| Total with quoted market price | 9,620 | 8,653 | 7,373 | 7,306 | 733 | 746 | 17,726 | 16,705 |\n| Debt instruments          | 779          | 911          | 673                 | 256                 | 1          | 1          | 1,453      | 1,168      |\n| thereof investment grade  | 324          | 316          | \u2013                   | \u2013                   | \u2013          | \u2013          | 324        | 316        |\n| thereof mixed funds (funds without a rating) | 455 | 595 | 673 | 256 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 1,128 | 851 |\n| thereof non-investment grade | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Real estate               | 428          | 394          | 656                 | 716                 | \u2013          | \u2013          | 1,084      | 1,110      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 159          | 20           | \u2013                   | \u2013                   | \u2013          | 1          | 159        | 21         |\n| Absolute return funds     | 645          | 632          | 643                 | 640                 | 23         | 31         | 1,311      | 1,303      |\n| Other                     | 820          | 710          | 244                 | 219                 | 113        | 104        | 1,177      | 1,033      |\n| Total without quoted market price | 2,831 | 2,667 | 2,216 | 1,831 | 137 | 137 | 5,184 | 4,635 |\n| 31 December               | 12,451       | 11,320       | 9,589               | 9,137               | 870        | 883        | 22,910     | 21,340     |\nIn the financial year 2021, disbursements out of the plan assets are expected to exceed the employer\u2019s contributions to plan assets by \u20ac85 million. Plan assets of the BMW Group include own transferable financial instruments amounting to \u20ac1 million (2019: \u20ac8 million).\n\nThe BMW Group is exposed to risks arising both from defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans with a minimum return guarantee. The discount rates used to calculate pension obligations are subject to market fluctuation and therefore influence the level of the obligations. Furthermore, changes in other actuarial parameters, such as expected rates of inflation, also have an impact on pension obligations. In order to reduce currency exposures, a substantial portion of plan assets is either invested in the same currency as the underlying plan or hedged by means of currency derivatives. As part of the internal reporting procedures and for internal management purposes, financial risks relating to the pension plans are reported using a value-at-risk approach by reference to the pension deficit. The investment strategy is also subject to regular review together with external consultants, with the aim of ensuring that investments are structured to match the timing of pension payments and the expected development of pension obligations. In this way, fluctuations in pension funding shortfalls are reduced.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation relates to current employees, pensioners and former employees with vested benefits as follows:\n\n|                      | Germany | United Kingdom | Other |\n|----------------------|---------|----------------|-------|\n|                      | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n| Current employees    | 66.2    | 67.6           | \u2013      | \u2013          | 62.9    | 64.3    |\n| Pensioners           | 27.4    | 27.4           | 42.2   | 45.5       | 29.9    | 29.0    |\n| Former employees with vested benefits | 6.4    | 5.0            | 57.8   | 54.5       | 7.2     | 6.8     |\n| Defined benefit obligation | 100.0  | 100.0          | 100.0  | 100.0      | 100.0   | 100.0   |\nThe sensitivity analysis provided below shows the extent to which changes in individual factors \u2013 independently of each other \u2013 could influence the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIt is only possible to aggregate sensitivities to a limited extent. Since the change in obligation follows a non-linear pattern, estimates made on the basis of the specified sensitivities are only possible with this restriction. The calculation of sensitivities using ranges other than those specified could result in a disproportional change in the defined benefit obligation.\n\n| Change in defined benefit obligation | 31.12. 2020 | 31.12. 2019 |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                     | in \u20ac million | in %        | in \u20ac million | in %        |\n| Discount rate                       |             |             |             |             |\n| increase of 0.75 %                  | -3,514      | -13.2       | -3,352      | -13.6       |\n| decrease of 0.75 %                  | 4,585       | 17.2        | 4,290       | 17.4        |\n| increase of 0.25 %                  | 766         | 2.9         | 905         | 3.7         |\n| Pension level trend                 |             |             |             |             |\n| decrease of 0.25 %                  | -721        | -2.7        | -810        | -3.3        |\n| increase of 1 year                  | 1,078       | 4.1         | 1,155       | 4.7         |\n| Average life expectancy             |             |             |             |             |\n| decrease of 1 year                  | -1,081      | -4.1        | -1,097      | -4.4        |\n| increase of 0.25 %                  | 218         | 0.8         | 200         | 0.8         |\n| Pension entitlement trend           |             |             |             |             |\n| decrease of 0.25 %                  | -210        | -0.8        | -192        | -0.8        |\n\nIn the UK, the sensitivity analysis for the pension level trend also takes account of restrictions due to caps and floors.\n33 OTHER PROVISIONS\n\nOther provisions changed during the year as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million | as of 1.1.2020* | Translation differences | Additions | Reversal of discounting | Utilised | Reversed | 31.12.2020 | thereof due within one year |\n|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------------|\n| Statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations, product guarantees | 5,550 | \u2013277 | 3,178 | 158 | \u20132,354 | \u2013124 | 6,131 | 1,731 |\n| Obligations for personnel and social expenses | 2,496 | \u201319 | 1,405 | 19 | \u20131,288 | \u201331 | 2,582 | 1,483 |\n| Other obligations | 3,271 | \u201343 | 1,361 | 9 | \u2013508 | \u2013337 | 3,753 | 2,794 |\n| Other obligations for ongoing operational expenses | 1,892 | \u201394 | 1,288 | \u2013 | \u20131,399 | \u2013171 | 1,516 | 1,486 |\n| Other provisions | 13,209 | \u2013433 | 7,232 | 186 | \u20135,549 | \u2013663 | 13,982 | 7,494 |\n\n* Prior year\u2019s figures adjusted.\n\nDepending on when claims occur, it is possible that the BMW Group may be called upon to fulfil the warranty or guarantee obligations over the whole period of the warranty or guarantee.

figures adjusted.\n\nContract liabilities relate to obligations for service and repair work as well as telematics services and roadside assistance agreed to be part of the sale of a vehicle (in some cases multi-component arrangements). An amount of \u20ac2,604 million (2019: \u20ac2,255 million) was released from contract liabilities in the financial year and recognised as revenues from contracts with customers.\n\nDeferred income includes down payments received on leases with customers as well as deferred grants. Grants comprise mainly public sector funds to promote regional structures and which have been invested in the production plants in Brazil, China, Germany, Mexico, Austria and South Africa amongst others. The grants are partly subject to holding periods for the assets concerned of up to five years and/or minimum employment figures or minimum production figures. Grant income is recognised in the income statement over the useful lives of the assets to which it relates.\n\n37 TRADE PAYABLES\n\nAs in the previous year, trade payables are due within one year.\nOTHER DISCLOSURES\n\n38 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS\n\nContingent liabilities\n\nThe following contingent liabilities existed at the balance sheet date:\n\n|                        | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Investment subsidies   | 77         | 284        |\n| Litigation             | 105        | 139        |\n| Guarantees             | 43         | 46         |\n| Other                  | 1,067      | 618        |\n| Contingent liabilities | 1,292      | 1,087      |\n\nOther contingent liabilities comprise mainly risks relating to taxes and customs duties.\n\nThe BMW Group determines its best estimate of contingent liabilities on the basis of the information available at the date of preparation of the Group Financial Statements. This assessment may change over time and is adjusted regularly on the basis of new information and circumstances. A part of the risks is covered by insurance.\n\nThe European Commission is currently conducting an investigation in connection with antitrust allegations against five German car manufacturers. The BMW Group has provided for the potential outcome of the investigation in the form of a provision measured on the basis of the Statement of Objections, at the best possible estimate (see also note 10 to the Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2019). In relation to these allegations, numerous class action lawsuits have been brought in the USA and Canada as well as several private lawsuits in South Korea. The class action lawsuits in the USA were dismissed in the first instance in October 2020. The plaintiffs have appealed this decision. Class action lawsuits in Canada and private lawsuits in South Korea are still at an early stage. Further civil lawsuits based on the allegations are possible going forward. In addition, the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation opened antitrust proceedings against BMW AG in March 2019, followed by the Korea Fair Trade Commission in May 2020 and the Turkish Competition Authority in July 2020. Possible risks for the BMW Group cannot be currently foreseen, either in terms of their outcome or the amounts involved. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nRegulatory authorities have ordered the BMW Group to recall various vehicle models in conjunction with airbags supplied by the Takata group of companies. Provision for the costs involved has been recognised within warranty provisions. In addition to the risks already covered by warranty provisions, it cannot be ruled out that further BMW Group vehicles will be affected by future recall actions. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nOn January 22, 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had opened an investigation into potential violations of U.S. securities laws by BMW Group relating to disclosures regarding BMW Group\u2019s unit sales of new vehicles. This matter was settled on September 24, 2020 with the SEC, without admitting or denying the allegations, and BMW Group consented to the entry of an Order finding violations of the U.S. Securities Act and agreed to pay a penalty of $18 million. Certain BMW Group entities and their officers are defendants in private securities litigation following the SEC Order. Possible risks for the BMW Group cannot be quantified at present. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nOther financial commitments\n\nIn addition to liabilities, provisions and contingent liabilities, the following commitments

financial assets and liabilities that are measured at amortised cost and whose carrying amounts differ from their fair value.\n\nThe fair values are generally determined using the discounted cash flow method, taking into account the relevant risk of default. For the purposes of fair value measurement using the discounted cash flow method, expected future cash flows are discounted on the basis of up-to-date interest curves observable on the market.\n\nThe fair values of receivables from sales financing are measured using the discounted cash flow method, taking into account customer-specific credit risk. In view of the fact that these allowances are calculated in part on the basis of internal information, receivables from sales financing are allocated to Level 3 in the level hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13. The fair values of the financial assets shown in the table relate to financial institutions and are also measured using the discounted cash flow method, taking into account the risk of default. Given that these financial institutions all have excellent credit ratings, the risk of default is low and can be observed on the market. The fair values of these items are therefore allocated to Level 2.\n\nIn the case of financial liabilities, own credit risk is also taken into account based on credit default swaps available on the market, so that the fair values of these items are also allocated to Level 2.\n\nFor all other financial instruments not listed here that are measured at amortised cost, the carrying amount corresponds to the fair value. For this reason, they are not presented separately.\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n|              | Fair value | Carrying amount | Fair value | Carrying amount |\n| Receivables from sales financing \u2013 credit financing | 65,326 | 63,104 | 73,699 | 70,625 |\n| Receivables from sales financing \u2013 finance and operating leases | 23,116 | 21,173 | 22,741 | 21,812 |\n| Financial assets \u2013 Marketable securities and investment funds | 116 | 115 | 446 | 444 |\n| Financial liabilities | | | | |\n| Bonds | 58,136 | 56,665 | 62,757 | 62,165 |\n| Asset-backed financing transactions | 18,818 | 18,819 | 19,659 | 19,549 |\n| Liabilities from customer deposits (banking) | 16,599 | 16,466 | 14,739 | 14,657 |\n| Liabilities to banks | 9,209 | 9,037 | 12,071 | 11,436 |\nDisclosures relating to financial instruments measured at fair value\n\nThe carrying amounts of financial instruments measured at fair value are allocated to the measurement levels pursuant to IFRS 13 as described below.\n\n|                      | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|\n|                      | Level 1    | Level 2    | Level 3 | Level 1    | Level 2    | Level 3 |\n| Marketable securities, investment funds and collateral assets | 3,608      | 503        | \u2013       | 4,582      | 365        | \u2013       |\n| Other investments    | 80         | \u2013          | 397     | 106        | \u2013          | 355     |\n| Cash equivalents     | 915        | \u2013          | \u2013       | \u2013          | 462        | \u2013       |\n| Loans to third parties | \u2013         | \u2013          | 22      | \u2013          | \u2013          | 14      |\n| Derivative instruments (assets) | \u2013         | \u2013          | 2,344   | \u2013          | 1,274      | \u2013       |\n| Interest rate risks  | \u2013          | \u2013          | 335     | \u2013          | 74         | \u2013       |\n| Currency risks       | \u2013          | \u2013          | 573     | 1          | 267        | \u2013       |\n| Raw material market price risks | \u2013         | \u2013          | 3       | \u2013          | \u2013          | 5       |\n| Other risks          | \u2013          | \u2013          | \u2013       | \u2013          | \u2013          | \u2013       |\n| Derivative instruments (liabilities) | \u2013         | \u2013          | 919     | \u2013          | 1,155      | \u2013       |\n| Interest rate risks  | \u2013          | \u2013          | 171     | \u2013          | 723        | \u2013       |\n| Currency risks       | \u2013          | \u2013          | 52      | 6          | 218        | \u2013       |\n\nIn the financial year 2020, the availability of market or stock exchange prices was re-assessed as at 31 December. As a result, an amount of \u20ac275 million relating to marketable securities, investment funds and collateral assets was reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2, in view of the fact that the fair values of the marketable securities concerned are derived on the basis of comparable instruments in the form of a theoretical price. Furthermore, money market funds amounting to \u20ac915 million were reclassified from Level 2 to Level 1 as at 31 December 2020, due to the fact that corresponding market or stock exchange prices are available.\n\nIn the previous financial year, marketable securities amounting to \u20ac187 million were transferred as at 30 June 2019 from Level 1 to Level 2, reflecting the fact that their fair value was determined on the basis of observable market data.\n\nAs a general rule, any transfers between fair-value hierarchy levels are made at the end of the relevant interim or year-end reporting period.\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value using input factors not based on observable market prices are allocated to Level 3. The fair values of these financial instruments are shown in the following table:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 Fair value | 31.12.2019 Fair value |\n|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Unquoted equity instruments | 397 | 355 |\n| Convertible bonds | 22 | 14 |\n| Options on unquoted equity instruments | 3 | 5 |\n| Derivative instruments | \u20135 | \u2013 |\n\nFinancial instruments allocated to Level 3 relate mainly to investments in a private-equity fund. The valuation of unquoted equity instruments is determined primarily using the market-based approach. In particular, the financing rounds that take place within the private equity sector \u2013 usually on a regular basis at intervals of approximately 12 to 24 months \u2013 represent a significant input factor for these purposes. In addition, the investment advisor provides the external fund manager with relevant, investment-specific information on an ongoing basis (at least quarterly). The latter subsequently assesses the underlying individual companies in accordance with the guidelines for International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuations (IPEV).\n\nAs part of the process of analysing valuations, the external fund manager reviews the investment-specific milestones, including an analysis of financial, technical and liquidity-specific performance indicators. Based on this analysis, it is considered whether the price of the most recent financing round is acceptable as a reasonable market valuation, in particular for early-stage or growth-phase investments. Key performance indicators used for the purpose of milestone analysis are highly dependent on the business model underlying the investment; typical technical key performance indicators relate to licenses and patents held, the stage of technology development such as evidence of feasibility and prototypes, market entries, customer and user growth and appointments to key management positions. Key financial performance indicators used are revenues, EBITDA and the corresponding growth rate and/or development of specific contribution margins. Key liquidity-specific performance indicators are cash on hand, cash burn rates and prospects for future financing rounds.\n\nSince the pricing of equity investments derived from financing rounds is considered to be the key input factor for the valuation, adjustments in valuation give rise to a similar change in the equity instrument that is required to be recorded with income statement effect.\n\nIn addition, the valuation of selected equity instruments is based on the income approach. This involves discounting cash flows on the basis of current business cases using the weighted average cost of capital to determine the fair value of the financial instrument. Changes in fair values determined in connection with adjustments to significant input factors are not material for the BMW Group.\nThe convertible bonds that have been classified to Level 3 are primarily used as instruments in advance of future financing rounds relating to private equity investments. Valuations are therefore performed in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) guidelines.\n\nMandatory conversions are usually structured in such a way that the number of shares to be received depends on the future share price. Due to the generally short maturities, the instruments are subject to only insignificant fluctuations in value. Irrespective of this fact, impairment tests are performed at regular intervals.\n\nThe exercise price for share options in such companies is generally low, verging towards zero. Consequently, financing rounds have a direct impact on the market value of the options. In this respect, they are valued in a similar way to unquoted equity instruments, as described above.\n\nFor selected derivatives, a complete set of data relevant for valuation purposes is not available due to their limited market maturity. In order to model forward curves, data is collated and updated on the basis of regular bank and trader inquiries. The valuation methodology applied is in line with the general valuation principles for derivatives used within the treasury management system of the BMW Group. Changes in fair values resulting from shifts in forward curves within a range of +/- 10% are not material for the BMW Group.\n\nThe balance sheet carrying amount of Level 3 financial instruments developed as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million | Unquoted equity instruments | Convertible bonds | Options on unquoted equity instruments | Derivative instruments | Financial Instruments Level 3 |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1 January 2020 | 355                         | 14                | 5                                      | \u2013                      | 374                           |\n| Additions    | 73                          | 17                | \u2013                                      | \u2013                      | 90                            |\n| Disposals    | \u201387                         | \u20137                | \u20132                                     | 2                      | \u201394                           |\n| Gains (+)/losses (\u2013) recognised in accumulated other equity | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u20137 | \u20137 |\n| Gains (+)/losses (\u2013) recognised in the income statement | 85 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 85 |\n| Currency translation differences | \u201329 | \u20132 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u201331 |\n| 31 December 2020 | 397                         | 22                | 3                                      | \u20135                     | 417                           |\n\n| in \u20ac million | Unquoted equity instruments | Convertible bonds | Options on unquoted equity instruments | Derivative instruments | Financial Instruments Level 3 |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1 January 2019 | 265                         | 3                 | 4                                      | \u2013                      | 272                           |\n| Additions    | 90                          | 14                | \u2013                                      | \u2013                      | 104                           |\n| Disposals    | \u201338                         | \u20133                | \u2013                                      | \u2013                      | \u201341                           |\n| Gains (+)/losses (\u2013) recognised in accumulated other equity | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| Gains (+)/losses (\u2013) recognised in the income statement | 33 | \u2013 | 1 | \u2013 | 34 |\n| Currency translation differences | 5 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 5 |\n| 31 December 2019 | 355                         | 14                | 5                                      | \u2013                      | 374                           |\n\nGains and losses recognised in the income statement are reported within the line item \u201cOther financial result\u201d. Gains and losses recognised in the income statement in the 2020 financial year included an unrealised net positive amount of \u20ac84 million (2019: \u20ac32 million).\nOffsetting of financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments of the BMW Group are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements or similar contracts. However, receivables and payables relating to derivative financial instruments are not netted due to non-fulfilment of the stipulated criteria. Offsetting would have the following impact on the carrying amounts of derivatives:\n\n|                      | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|\n|                      | Reported on assets side | Reported on equity and liabilities side | Reported on assets side | Reported on equity and liabilities side |\n| Balance sheet amounts as reported | 3,256 | 1,148 | 1,620 | 2,096 |\n| Gross amount of derivatives which can be offset in case of insolvency | \u2013790 | \u2013790 | \u2013833 | \u2013833 |\n| Net amount after offsetting | 2,466 | 358 | 787 | 1,263 |\n\nNon-derivative financial assets and liabilities are only offset if a legally enforceable right currently exists and it is actually intended to offset the relevant amounts. No financial assets and liabilities have been netted in the BMW Group due to the fact that the necessary requirements for netting have not been met.\n\nGains and losses on financial instruments\n\nThe following table shows the net gains and losses arising on financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 9:\n\n|                      | 2020 | 2019 |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n| Financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income | 7 | 42 |\n| Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss | 310 | \u20131,012 |\n| Financial assets measured at amortised cost | \u20131,050 | 160 |\n| Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost | \u2013350 | 296 |\n\nNet gains and losses arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income mainly relate to changes in the fair value of marketable securities. Further details are provided in the disclosures relating to the statement of comprehensive income (note 19). Total interest income arising on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income amounted to \u20ac37 million (2019: \u20ac49 million) and total interest expense to \u20ac30 million (2019: \u20ac41 million).\n\nNet gains and losses arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss mainly include results from the fair value measurement of stand-alone derivatives, marketable securities and shares in investment funds, as well as other financial assets.\n\nNet gains and losses arising on financial assets measured at amortised cost comprise mainly exchange rate gains/losses and impairment losses/reversals. Net gains and losses arising on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost comprise mainly exchange rate gains/losses as well as fair value gains/losses on hedged items in designated hedging relationships that are recognised in the income statement.\n\nTotal interest income arising on financial assets measured at amortised cost relates mainly to the interest income earned on credit financing and reported within revenues. Total interest expense arising on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost amounted to \u20ac1.8 billion (2019: \u20ac1.9 billion).\nCredit risk\n\nThe BMW Group is exposed to counterparty credit risks if contractual partners, for example a retail customer or a dealership, are unable or only partially able to meet their contractual obligations. Information on the management of credit risk for receivables from financial services is provided in the Combined Management Report (see section Report on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities).\n\nNotwithstanding the existence of collateral accepted, the carrying amount of financial assets (with the exception of derivative financial instruments) generally represents the maximum credit risk. In addition, the credit risk is increased by additional unutilised loan commitments in the dealership financing line of business. Total dealership financing credit risk at the end of the reporting period therefore amounted to \u20ac30,682 million (2019: \u20ac31,943 million).\n\nIn the case of all relationships underlying non-derivative financial instruments, in order to minimise the credit risk and depending on the nature and amount of exposure, collateral is required, credit information and references obtained or historical data based on the existing business relationship, in particular payment behaviour, reviewed.\n\nIn the case of trade receivables, customers are regularly assessed with regard to their credit risk. Depending on contractual status, necessary measures, such as dunning procedures, are initiated in good time.\n\nThe credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is minimised by the fact that the Group only enters into such contracts with parties of first-class credit standing.\n\nWithin the financial services business, items financed for retail customers and dealerships (such as vehicles, facilities and property) serve as first-ranking collateral with a recoverable value. Security is also put up by customers in the form of collateral asset pledges, asset assignment and first-ranking mortgages, supplemented where appropriate by warranties and guarantees. Items previously held as collateral that are subsequently acquired relate mainly to vehicles. As a rule, these assets can be converted into cash at short notice through the dealership organisation. Creditworthiness testing is an important aspect of the BMW Group\u2019s credit risk management. Every borrower\u2019s creditworthiness is tested for all credit financing and lease contracts entered into by the BMW Group. In the case of retail customer financing, creditworthiness is assessed using validated scoring systems integrated in the acquisition process. In the area of dealership financing, creditworthiness is assessed by means of ongoing credit monitoring and an internal rating system that takes account not only of the material credit standing of the borrower, but also of qualitative factors, such as past reliability in business relations.\n\nThe credit risk on trade receivables is assessed mainly on the basis of information relating to overdue amounts. The gross carrying amounts of these receivables are allocated in accordance with IFRS 9 to overdue ranges used for management purposes as follows:\n\n| Period                  | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|-------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Not overdue             | 2,002      | 1,947      |\n| 1 \u2013 30 days overdue     | 229        | 369        |\n| 31 \u2013 60 days overdue    | 31         | 89         |\n| 61 \u2013 90 days overdue    | 23         | 40         |\n| More than 90 days overdue| 60         | 145        |\n| Total                   | 2,345      | 2,590      |\nReceivables from sales financing are allocated to internally defined rating categories based on credit risk. The classification into creditworthiness levels is based on default probabilities. The related gross carrying amounts in accordance with IFRS 9 are allocated as follows:\n\n|                      | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|\n|                      | Stage 1    | Stage 2    | Stage 3    | Total | Expected credit loss | Stage 1    | Stage 2    | Stage 3    | Total | Expected credit loss |\n| in \u20ac million          | General    | Simplified | Total      |       |                      | General    | Simplified | Total      |       |                      |\n| Gross carrying amount of financial assets with good credit ratings | 76,356     | 1,633      | 367        | \u2013     | 78,356               | 406        | 696        | 378        | \u2013     | 86,473               | 272        |\n| Gross carrying amount of financial assets with medium credit ratings | 3,778      | 1,653      | 38         | \u2013     | 5,469                | 431        | 1,167      | 22         | \u2013     | 5,291               | 199        |\n| Gross carrying amount of financial assets with poor credit ratings | 118        | 937        | 17         | 1,019 | 2,091                | 802        | 704        | 16         | 1,014 | 1,772               | 628        |\n| Total                | 80,252     | 4,223      | 422        | 1,019 | 85,916               | 1,639      | 1,014      | 416        | 1,014 | 93,536               | 1,099      |\n\nFurther disclosures relating to credit risk \u2013 in particular with regard to the amounts of impairment losses recognised \u2013 are provided in the explanatory notes to the relevant categories of receivables in note 25 and 30.\nLiquidity risk\n\nThe following table shows the maturity structure of expected contractual cash flows (undiscounted) for financial liabilities:\n\n| in \u20ac million | Maturity within one year | Maturity between one and five years | Maturity later than five years | Total |\n|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------|\n|              | 31.12.2020               | 31.12.2019                         |                               |       |\n| NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES | | | | |\n| Bonds        | 13,456                   | 33,224                             | 11,930                        | 58,610|\n| Asset-backed financing transactions | 7,067                   | 12,369                             | \u2013                             | 19,436|\n| Liabilities to banks | 5,295                   | 3,317                              | 1,388                         | 10,000|\n| Liabilities from customer deposits (banking) | 12,808                   | 3,781                              | 22                            | 16,611|\n| Trade payables | 8,644                   | \u2013                                  | \u2013                             | 8,644|\n| Lease liabilities | 512                     | 1,227                              | 1,028                         | 2,767|\n| Commercial paper | 550                     | \u2013                                  | \u2013                             | 550|\n| Other financial liabilities | 120                     | 288                                | 357                           | 765|\n| DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES | | | | |\n| With gross settlement | 432                     | 248                                | 14                            | 694|\n| Cash outflows | 14,910                   | 5,544                              | 631                           | 21,085|\n| Cash inflows | \u201314,478                  | \u20135,296                             | \u2013617                          | \u201320,391|\n| With net settlement | 380                     | 144                                | 28                            | 552|\n| Cash outflows | 380                     | 144                                | 28                            | 552|\n| Total financial liabilities | 49,264                  | 54,598                             | 14,767                        | 118,629|\n\nThe cash flows relating to non-derivative liabilities comprise principal repayments and the related interest. The amounts disclosed for derivative instruments comprise only cash flows relating to derivatives that have a negative fair value at the balance sheet date. In the case of derivatives with a negative fair value, an overall positive cash flow can arise due to the various yield curves used.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 credit commitments available at short notice to dealerships which had not been called upon at the end of the reporting period amounted to \u20ac14,367 million (2019: \u20ac10,776 million).\n\nSolvency is assured at all times by managing and monitoring the liquidity situation on the basis of a rolling cash flow forecast. The resulting funding requirements are covered by a variety of instruments placed on the world\u2019s financial markets, with the aim to minimise risk by matching maturities with financing requirements and in alignment with a dynamic target debt structure.\nAs a further reduction of risk, a syndicated credit line totalling \u20ac8 billion (2019: \u20ac8 billion) from a consortium of international banks is available to the BMW Group. Intra-group cash flow fluctuations are balanced out by the use of daily cash pooling arrangements.\n\nFurther information is provided in the Combined Management Report.\n\nMarket risks\n\nThe principal market risks to which the BMW Group is exposed are currency risk, interest rate risk and raw materials market price risk.\n\nProtection against such risks is provided in the first instance through natural hedging which arises when the values of non-derivative financial instruments have matching maturities and amounts (netting). Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the risk remaining after netting.\n\nCurrency, interest rate and raw materials market price risks of the BMW Group are managed at a corporate level.\n\nFurther information is provided in the \u201cReport on outlook, risks and opportunities\u201d section of the Combined Management Report.\n\nCurrency risk\n\nAs an enterprise with worldwide operations, the BMW Group conducts business in a variety of currencies, from which currency risks arise. In order to hedge currency risks, the BMW Group holds, as at 31 December 2020, derivative financial instruments mostly in the form of forward currency contracts and currency swaps.\n\nAs part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should be hedged is decided at regular intervals. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is based essentially on the fact that they are denominated in the same currency and have the same maturities. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for counterparty credit risk. However, in view of the processes that have been established for credit risk management, ineffectiveness is not expected to arise.\n\nThe BMW Group measures currency risk using a cash-flow-at-risk model. The analysis of currency risk is based on forecast foreign currency transactions which could result in exposures to surpluses of foreign currency cash inflows and cash outflows. At the end of the reporting period, the overall currency exposure \u2013 in each case for the following year and determined by aggregating the individual currency exposures based on their absolute amount \u2013 was as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Currency exposure | 33,975 | 33,950 |\n\nCurrency exposures include short positions amounting to \u20ac5,222 million (2019: \u20ac2,789 million).\n\nThis exposure is compared to all hedges that are in place. The net cash flow surplus represents an uncovered risk position. The cash-flow-at-risk approach involves showing the impact of potential exchange rate fluctuations on operating cash flows on the basis of probability distributions. Volatilities and correlations serve as the main input factors to determine the relevant probability distributions.\n\nThe potential negative impact on earnings is calculated at the reporting date for each currency for the following financial year on the basis of current market prices and exposures with a confidence level of 95%. The risk mitigating effect of correlations between the various currencies is taken into account when the risks are aggregated.\n\nThe following table shows the potential negative impact for the BMW Group for the following year resulting from unfavourable changes in exchange rates, measured on the basis of the cash-flow-at-risk approach.\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash flow at risk | 531 | 487 |\nInterest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risks arise when funds are borrowed and invested with differing fixed-rate periods or differing terms. At the BMW Group, all items subject to, or bearing, interest are exposed to interest rate risk and can therefore affect both the assets and liabilities side of the balance sheet.\n\nThe fair value of the Group\u2019s interest rate portfolios was as follows at the end of the reporting period:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Fair values of interest rate portfolios | 58,545 | 55,697 |\n\nInterest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate derivatives. As part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, interest rate risks are monitored and managed at regular intervals. The interest rate contracts used for hedging purposes comprise mainly swaps, which, if hedge accounting is applied, are accounted for as fair value hedges. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is based on the fact that the main parameters of the hedged item and the related hedging instrument, for example start date, term and currency, are the same. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\nIn view of the fact that own credit risk is excluded from the hedging relationship, ineffectiveness is expected to be low.\n\nFor selected fixed-interest assets, part of the interest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis. In this case, swaps are used as the hedging instrument. Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a monthly basis at the end of each reporting period, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content of each portfolio.\n\nIn view of the plans to reform and replace certain benchmark interest rates, the timing and exact nature of these changes is currently subject to uncertainty. Across the BMW Group, a considerable number of contracts are directly affected by the benchmark interest rates reform. Hedging relationships entered into by the BMW Group are mainly based on USD LIBOR and GBP LIBOR benchmark interest rates, which are designated as hedged risks in fair value hedging relationships. The hedging relationships affected are subject to uncertainty with respect to the identifiability of the designated benchmark interest rates.\n\nThe transition to the newly created or revised benchmark rates is being managed and monitored as part of a multidisciplinary project. The conversion project will involve making changes to systems, processes, risk and valuation models, as well as dealing with the associated accounting implications. The uncertainty arising from the benchmark interest rate reform is likely to continue to exist up to the end of 2021.\n\nThe BMW Group applies a value-at-risk approach throughout the Group for internal reporting purposes and to manage interest rate risk. This approach is based on a historical simulation in which the potential future fair value losses of the interest rate portfolios are compared across the Group with expected amounts on the basis of a holding period of 250 days and a confidence level of 99.98%. The risk mitigating effect of correlations between the various portfolios is taken into account when the risks are aggregated.\n\nIn the following table, the potential volumes of fair value fluctuations \u2013 measured on the basis of the value-at-risk approach \u2013 are compared with the expected value for the interest-rate-sensitive exposures of the BMW Group:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Value at risk | 1,160 | 1,094 |\n\nRaw materials price risk\n\nThe BMW Group is exposed to market price risks on raw materials. In order to hedge these risks, the Group mainly uses forward commodity contracts. As part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should be hedged is decided at regular intervals and the corresponding hedging ratio defined. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for counterparty credit risk. However, in view of the processes that have been established for credit risk management, ineffectiveness is not expected to arise.\nThe economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is based essentially on the fact that they have the same basis and term. The BMW Group designates only the commodity price index-linked raw material surcharge as a hedged item. Other price components contained in the contract are not designated as being part of the hedge relationship as no effective hedging instruments exist for these components.\n\nThe starting point for analysing raw materials price risk is to identify planned purchases of raw materials or components containing raw materials, the so-called \u201cexposure\u201d. At each reporting date, the exposure for the following financial year amounted to:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Raw material price exposures | 4,204 | 4,382 |\n\nThis exposure is compared to all hedges that are in place. The net cash flow surplus represents an uncovered risk position. The cash-flow-at-risk approach involves showing the impact of potential raw materials market price fluctuations on operating cash flows on the basis of probability distributions. Volatilities and correlations serve as input factors to assess the relevant probability distributions.\n\nThe potential negative impact on earnings is calculated at the reporting date for each raw materials category for the following financial year on the basis of current market prices and exposure with a confidence level of 95%. The risk mitigating effect of correlations between the various categories of raw materials is taken into account when the risks are aggregated.\n\nThe following table shows the potential negative impact for the BMW Group resulting from fluctuations in prices across all categories of raw materials, measured on the basis of the cash-flow-at-risk approach. The risk at each reporting date for the following financial year was as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash flow at risk | 310 | 419 |\n\nDisclosures on hedging measures\n\nThe following disclosures on hedging measures include derivatives of fully consolidated companies that are designated as a hedging instrument. The amounts shown in the table are stated before deferred taxes and take account of additional effects arising from the application of the modified closing rate method.\n\nThe nominal amounts of hedging instruments were as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Currency risks | 11,939 | 4,530 |\n| Interest rate risks | 8,082 | 28,213 |\n| Raw material price risks | 1,449 | 1,792 |\n| Nominal amounts of hedging instruments | 21,470 | 34,535 |\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Currency risks | 14,823 | 9,020 |\n| Interest rate risks | 6,672 | 29,691 |\n| Raw material price risks | 1,651 | 1,920 |\n| Nominal amounts of hedging instruments | 23,146 | 40,631 |\nThe following table shows the most significant average hedging rates of hedging transactions used by the BMW Group:\n\n| Currency risks | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|----------------|------------|------------|\n| EUR/CNY        | 8.05       | 8.26       |\n| EUR/USD        | \u2013          | 1.16       |\n| EUR/GBP        | 0.87       | 0.87       |\n| EUR/KRW        | 1,334.86   | 1,328.59   |\n| EUR/JPY        | 124.20     | 124.92     |\n\nA cash-flow-at-risk approach to risk management involves making use of portfolio effects. No USD-denominated hedging transactions were in hedging relationships at the balance sheet date.\n\nInformation on average interest hedge rates is not provided, since interest rate derivatives designated as hedging instruments are used exclusively to hedge items in fair value hedges. The hedge rates therefore correspond in each case to current market interest rate levels. Most of the hedges used in this context relate to variable yield curves relating to the euro, US dollar and British pound currency areas.\n\nThe following table provides information on the nominal

In 2020, Entrust Corp., Shakopee, Minnesota, acquired vehicles from the BMW Group by way of leasing.\nSeen from the perspective of BMW Group entities, the volume of transactions with the above-mentioned entities was as follows:\n\n| Entity Name                        | Supplies and services performed | Supplies and services received | Receivables at 31 December | Payables at 31 December |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                    | 2020                            | 2019                           | 2020                        | 2019                    | 2020                        | 2019                        |\n| DELTON Health AG (formerly DELTON AG) | 1,950                           | 2,065                          | \u2013                           | 1                       | 20                           | \u2013                           |\n| DELTON Logistics S.\u00e0 r.l.          | 1,235                           | 1,473                          | 19,068                      | 21,596                  | 5                            | 14                          | 1,574                      | 1,871                     |\n| DELTON Technology SE               | 6                               | 6                              | \u2013                           | \u2013                       | \u2013                            | \u2013                           | \u2013                          | \u2013                         |\n| SOLARWATT GmbH                     | 2,363                           | 453                            | \u2013                           | 287                     | 8                            | \u2013                           | \u2013                          | \u2013                         |\n| ALTANA AG                          | 2,425                           | 2,529                          | 273                         | 462                     | 243                          | 355                         | 80                         | 65                        |\n| UnternehmerTUM GmbH                | 37                              | 104                            | 1,310                       | 2,651                   | \u2013                            | 27                          | 510                        | 693                       |\n| EnviroChemie GmbH                  | 11                              | 28                             | \u2013                           | 107                     | \u2013                            | \u2013                           | \u2013                          | \u2013                         |\n| Entrust Corp.                      | 134                             | 154                            | \u2013                           | \u2013                       | 9                            | 10                          | \u2013                          | \u2013                         |\n\nA significant proportion of the BMW Group\u2019s transactions with related parties relates to the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\n\n| Entity Name                        | Supplies and services performed | Supplies and services received | Receivables at 31 December | Payables at 31 December |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                    | 2020                            | 2019                           | 2020                        | 2019                    | 2020                        | 2019                        |\n| BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.     | 9,701                           | 9,227                          | 155                         | 107                     | 2,045                       | 2,639                       | 804                        | 496                       |\n\nFor the most part, this involves the sale of vehicle components to BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. for further processing. BMW Group entities also perform services on behalf of BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\nIn total, the following amounts of goods and services were supplied to or received from other joint ventures and associated companies:\n\n|                                | Supplies and services performed | Supplies and services received | Receivables at 31 December | Payables at 31 December |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                | 2020                            | 2019                          | 2020                      | 2019                   |\n| Other joint ventures and associated companies | 32                              | 28                            | 64                        | 78                     |\n\nBusiness relationships with non-consolidated companies are small in scale.\n\nBMW Trust e.V., Munich, administers assets on a trustee basis to secure obligations relating to pensions in Germany and is therefore a related party of the BMW Group in accordance with IAS 24. This entity has no assets of its own. It had no income or expenses during the period under report. BMW AG bears expenses on an immaterial scale and performs services for BMW Trust e.V., Munich.\n\nThe BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt, Munich, is an independent corporate foundation and due to the BMW Group\u2019s significant influence, qualifies as a related party according to IAS 24. BMW Group made donations to the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt during the financial year 2020 totaling \u20ac6.3 million (2019: \u20ac6.4 million). No other significant transactions took place.\n\nFor disclosures relating to key management personnel, please see note 43 and the Remuneration Report.\n\n41 SHARE-BASED REMUNERATION\n\nThe BMW Group provides three share-based programmes: one for eligible employees, one for senior heads of department and one for members of the Board of Management.\n\nEmployee Share Programme\n\nIn connection with the Employee Share Programme, non-voting shares of preferred stock in BMW AG were granted in 2020 to qualifying employees at favourable conditions (see note 31 for the number and price of issued shares). Participants in the programme were entitled in 2020 to acquire packages of 8, 18 or 28 shares of preferred stock (2019: 10, 17 or 25) with a discount in each case of \u20ac11.50 (2019: \u20ac13.00) per share compared to the market price (average closing price in Xetra trading in the period from 3 November to 6 November 2020: \u20ac48.05). The programme was open to employees who have been in an employment relationship with BMW AG or by a wholly-owned BMW AG subsidiary in Germany, provided that the management of the subsidiary concerned has decided to participate in the programme. At the date of the announcement of the programme, there was a requirement for the employment relationship to have existed without interruption for at least one year and for it to continue until the transfer of the shares of preferred stock. Shares of preferred stock acquired in conjunction with the Employee Share Programme are subject to a vesting period of four years, starting from 1 January of the year in which the shares were acquired. In the financial year under report, 822,124 (2019: 744,447) shares of preferred stock were acquired by employees. This figure includes 822,000 (2019: 740,400) shares out of Authorised Capital 2019, with the remainder bought back via the stock exchange. Every year the Board of Management of BMW AG decides whether the scheme is to be continued.\n\nIn the financial year 2020, the BMW Group recorded a personnel expense of \u20ac9 million (2019: \u20ac10 million) for the Employee Share Programme, corresponding to the difference between the market price and the reduced price of the shares of preferred stock purchased by employees.\nProgramme for senior heads of department and members of the Board of Management\n\nThe share-based remuneration programme for qualifying department heads, introduced with effect for financial years beginning after 1 January 2012, is closely based on the programme for Board of Management members and is aimed at rewarding a long-term, entrepreneurial approach to running the business on a sustainable basis. Under the terms of the programme, participants give a commitment to invest an amount equivalent to 20% of their performance-based bonus in BMW common stock and to hold the shares so acquired for a minimum of four years. With effect from 1 July 2019, the share-based compensation programme was revised and the investment requirement increased to 26% of the earnings-related bonus. In return for the investment requirement, BMW AG pays 100% of the investment amount as a net subsidy. Once the four-year holding period requirement has been fulfilled, the participants receive \u2013 for each three common stock shares held and at the Company\u2019s option \u2013 one additional share of common stock or the cash equivalent, to be decided at BMW AG\u2019s discretion.\n\nFor financial years beginning after 1 January 2011, BMW AG has added a share-based remuneration component to the existing compensation system for Board of Management members.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management receive a cash compensation (investment component) for the specific purpose of investment \u2013 after tax and contributions \u2013 in shares of common stock of BMW AG. For the financial years 2018 to 2020, the investment component corresponds to 45% of the gross bonus. The investment component is paid after the end of the Annual General Meeting, at which the separate financial statements of BMW AG for the relevant financial year are presented.\n\nThe shares of common stock are purchased immediately after the investment component has been paid out. Shares of common stock purchased in this way by Board members are required to be held for a period of four years. Under the compensation system valid up to the financial year 2020, Board members receive from BMW AG, for every three shares of common stock held, either one additional share of common stock or the cash equivalent, to be decided at BMW AG\u2019s discretion. In the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for early payment of share-based remuneration components based on the target amounts. Insofar the service contract is prematurely terminated and the Company has an extraordinary right of termination, or if the Board member resigns without the Company\u2019s agreement, entitlements to amounts as yet unpaid relating to share-based remuneration are forfeited.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management in office at the end of the reporting period hold 44,037 shares of BMW common stock based on holding requirements arising from share-based remuneration for the financial years 2016 to 2019 (2019: 36,921).\n\nThe share-based remuneration component is measured at its fair value at each balance sheet date between grant and settlement date, and on the settlement date. The amounts are recognised as personnel expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and reported in the balance sheet as a provision.\n\nThe cash-settlement obligation for the share-based remuneration component is measured at its fair value at the balance sheet date (based on the closing price of BMW AG common stock in Xetra trading at 31 December 2020).\n\nThe total carrying amount of the provision for the share-based remuneration component of current and former Board of Management members and senior heads of department at 31 December 2020 was \u20ac6,383,766 (2019: \u20ac5,851,703).\n\nThe total expense recognised in 2020 for the share-based remuneration component of current and former Board of Management members and senior heads of department was \u20ac1,820,265 (2019: \u20ac1,979,477).\n\nThe fair value of the programmes for Board of Management members and senior heads of department at the date of grant of the share-based remuneration components was \u20ac987,759 (2019: \u20ac1,374,798), based on a total of 13,444 shares (2019: 19,983 shares) of BMW AG common stock or a corresponding cash-based settlement measured at the relevant market share price prevailing on the grant date.\n\nFurther details on the remuneration of the Management Board are provided in the Remuneration Report, which is part of the Combined Management Report.\n\n42 DECLARATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft have issued the prescribed Declaration of Compliance pursuant to \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act. It is included in the Corporate Governance Statement, which is on the BMW Group website at www.bmwgroup.com/ezu.\nThe total compensation of the current members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of BMW AG expensed for the financial year 2020 in accordance with IFRS comprised the following:\n\n| in \u20ac million | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------------|------|------|\n| Compensation to members of the Board of Management | 18.8 | 30.0 |\n| Fixed remuneration | 7.3 | 8.1 |\n| Variable remuneration | 10.9 | 20.9 |\n| thereof Performance Cash Plan | 1.3 | 8.3 |\n| Share-based remuneration component | 0.6 | 1.0 |\n| Allocation to pension provisions | 2.6 | 2.9 |\n| Benefits in conjunction with the termination of board activity | 0.6 | 7.1 |\n| Compensation to members of the Supervisory Board | 5.6 | 5.6 |\n| Fixed compensation and attendance fees | 5.6 | 2.0 |\n| Variable compensation | \u2013 | 3.6 |\n| Total expense | 27.6 | 45.6 |\n| thereof due within one year | 23.1 | 28.6 |\n\nSince the financial year 2018 and up to and including the financial year 2020, variable cash compensation has been supplemented by a multi-year and future-orientated Performance Cash Plan (PCP). The PCP evaluation period comprises three years, the grant year and the two subsequent years. The PCP is paid out after the end of the three-year assessment period. The total remuneration of former members of the Board of Management and their dependants amounted to \u20ac13.1 million (2019: \u20ac16.0 million).\n\nPension obligations to current members of the Board of Management are covered by provisions amounting to \u20ac14.7 million (2019: \u20ac14.6 million), determined in accordance with IAS 19. Pension obligations to former members of the Board of Management and their surviving dependants, also determined in accordance with IAS 19, amounted to \u20ac118.8 million (2019: \u20ac113.1 million).\n\nThe compensation arrangements applicable for members of the Supervisory Board for the financial year 2020 do not include any stock options, value appreciation rights comparable to stock options or any other stock-based compensation components. Apart from an advance amount paid out of the Performance Cash Plan 2019 \u2013 2021 to individual members of the Board of Management, no loans or advances were granted to members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board by BMW AG or its subsidiaries in the financial year 2020, nor were any contingent liabilities entered into in their favour. During the year under report, members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board concluded vehicle purchase contracts and related service contracts as well as vehicle rental, vehicle leasing and vehicle financing contracts with BMW Group entities on market conditions.\n\nFurther details about the remuneration of current members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board can be found in the Remuneration Report, which is part of the Combined Management Report.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic will continue to influence the course of business for the BMW Group in 2021. The situation remains volatile and could have an impact on the results of operations, financial position and net assets of BMW AG and the BMW Group.\n\nThe further course of the pandemic and implications for the BMW Group\u2019s business performance is being continually monitored.\n\nCurrent estimates and assumptions for the financial year 2021, to the extent already known to the BMW Group, have been taken into account and described in the Report on Outlook. Apart from these assessments, no further significant negative effects are known or can be estimated at the present time. However, further negative effects could arise in the course of the year.\n\nNo other events have occurred since the end of the financial year which could have a major impact on the results of operations, financial position and net assets of BMW AG and the BMW Group.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\n\n45 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nInformation on reportable segments\n\nFor the purposes of presenting segment information, the activities of the BMW Group are divided into operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8. The segmentation follows the internal management and reporting system and takes account of the organisational structure of the BMW Group based on the various products and services of the reportable segments.\n\nThe activities of the BMW Group are broken down into the operating segments Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial Services and Other Entities.\n\nWithin the Automotive segment, the BMW Group develops, manufactures, assembles and sells automobiles and off-road vehicles, under the brands BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce as well as spare parts, accessories and mobility services. BMW and MINI brand products are sold in Germany through branches of BMW AG and by independent, authorised dealerships. Sales outside Germany are handled mainly by subsidiary companies and by independent import companies in some markets. Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are sold in selected markets via subsidiary companies and elsewhere by independent, authorised dealers.\n\nActivities relating to the development, manufacture, assembly and sale of motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories are reported in the Motorcycles segment.\n\nAutomobile leasing, fleet business, multi-brand business, retail and dealership financing, customer deposit business and insurance activities are the main activities allocated to the Financial Services segment.\n\nHolding and Group financing companies are reported in the Other Entities segment. This segment also includes the operating companies BMW (UK) Investments Ltd. and Bavaria Lloyd Reiseb\u00fcro GmbH, which are not allocated to one of the other segments.\nInternal management and reporting\n\nSegment information is prepared as a general rule in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the Group Financial Statements. Exceptions to this general principle include the treatment of inter-segment warranties, the earnings impact of which is allocated to the Automotive and Financial Services segments on the basis used internally to manage the business. In addition, intragroup repurchase agreements between the Automotive and Financial Services segments pursuant to IFRS 15, impairment allowances on intragroup receivables and changes in the value of consolidated other investments pursuant to IFRS 9 are also excluded. Intragroup leasing arrangements are not reflected in the internal management and reporting system on an IFRS 16 basis and therefore, in accordance with IFRS 8, do not give rise to any changes in the presentation of segment information. Inter-segment receivables and payables, provisions, income, expenses and profits are eliminated upon consolidation. Inter-segment revenues are based on market prices. Centralised functions are included in the segments concerned. Expenses for centralised administrative functions allocated to the Financial Services segment are not settled in cash.\n\nThe role of \u201cchief operating decision maker\u201d with respect to resource allocation and performance assessment of the reportable segment is embodied in the full Board of Management. For this purpose, different measures of segment performance as well as segment assets are taken into account in the operating segments.\n\nThe Automotive and Motorcycles segments are managed on the basis of return on capital employed (RoCE). The relevant measure of segment results used is therefore profit before financial result. Capital employed is the corresponding measure of segment assets used to determine how to allocate resources and comprises all current and non-current operational assets after deduction of liabilities used operationally which are generally not subject to interest (e.g. trade payables).\n\nThe success of the Financial Services segment is measured on the basis of return on equity (RoE). Profit before tax therefore represents the relevant measure of segment earnings. The measure of segment assets in the Financial Services segment corresponds to net assets, defined as total assets less total liabilities.\n\nThe success of the Other Entities segment is assessed on the basis of profit or loss before tax. The corresponding measure of segment assets used to manage the Other Entities segment is total assets less asset-side income tax items and intragroup investments.\nSegment information by operating segment is as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million | Automotive 2020 | Automotive 2019 | Motorcycles 2020 | Motorcycles 2019 | Financial Services 2020 | Financial Services 2019 | Other Entities 2020 | Other Entities 2019 | Reconciliation to Group figures 2020 | Reconciliation to Group figures 2019 | Group 2020 | Group 2019 |\n|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| External revenues | 68,106          | 73,624          | 2,293            | 2,374            | 28,590                  | 28,210                  | 1                   | 2                   | \u2013                                    | \u2013                                    | 98,990    | 104,210   |\n| Inter-segment revenues | 12,747          | 18,058          | \u20139               | \u20136               | 1,454                   | 1,388                   | 2                   | 3                   | \u201314,194                             | \u201319,443                             | \u2013         | \u2013         |\n| Total revenues | 80,853          | 91,682          | 2,284            | 2,368            | 30,044                  | 29,598                  | 3                   | 5                   | \u201314,194                             | \u201319,443                             | 98,990    | 104,210   |\n| Segment result | 2,162           | 4,499           | 103              | 194              | 1,725                   | 2,272                   | \u2013235                | \u201396                  | 1,467                               | 249                                  | 5,222     | 7,118     |\n| Result from equity accounted investments | 920             | 136             | \u2013                | \u2013                | \u2013                       | \u2013                       | \u2013                   | \u2013                   | \u2013                                    | \u2013                                    | 920       | 136       |\n| Capital expenditure on non-current assets | 6,041           | 7,607           | 146              | 149              | 24,146                  | 27,544                  | \u2013                   | \u2013                   | \u20136,291                              | \u20137,003                              | 24,042    | 28,297    |\n| Depreciation and amortisation on non-current assets | 5,978           | 5,853           | 119              | 110              | 12,054                  | 11,142                  | \u2013                   | \u2013                   | \u20136,175                              | \u20136,356                              | 11,976    | 10,749    |\n\n| in \u20ac million | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 | 31.12.2020 | 31.12.2019 |\n|--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Segment assets | 15,779     | 16,193     | 681        | 712        | 15,555     | 15,545     | 98,226     | 106,038    | 86,417     | 89,546     | 216,658    | 228,034    |\n| Investments accounted for using the equity method | 3,585      | 3,199      | \u2013          | \u2013          | \u2013          | \u2013          | \u2013          | \u2013          | \u2013          | \u2013          | 3,585      | 3,199      |\nWrite-downs on inventories to their net realisable value amounting to \u20ac59 million (2019: \u20ac126 million) were recognised by the Automotive segment in the financial year 2020. The reversal of impairment losses had a positive impact of \u20ac2 million (2019: \u20ac22 million) on the segment result of the Automotive segment.\n\nThe result of the Financial Services segment was negatively impacted by impairment losses totalling \u20ac362 million (2019: \u20ac254 million) recognised on leased products.

Revenues with other segments result mainly from the sale of vehicles, for which the Financial Services segment has concluded a financing or lease contract. Eliminations of inter-segment items in the reconciliation to the Group profit before tax, capital expenditure and depreciation and amortisation mainly result from the sale of vehicles in the Automotive segment, which are subsequently accounted for as leased products in the Financial Services segment. In the reconciliation of segment assets to Group assets, eliminations relate mainly to intragroup financing balances.\n\nIn the information by region, external sales are based on the location of the customer.

Corporate culture within the BMW Group is founded on transparent reporting and corporate communication, corporate governance in the interest of stakeholders, trustful cooperation both of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board as well as among employees, and compliance with applicable law.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board report below on the main features of corporate governance. The Corporate Governance Report pursuant to Principle 22 of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK), as amended on 16 December 2019, is part of the Corporate Governance Statement, which can be accessed at www.bmwgroup.com/ezu (Corporate Governance).\n\nINFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S GOVERNING CONSTITUTION\n\nThe designation BMW Group comprises Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG) and its Group entities. BMW AG is a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) within the meaning of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and has its registered office in Munich, Germany. It has three representative bodies, namely the Annual General Meeting, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management. The duties and authorities of those bodies derive from the Stock Corporation Act and the Articles of Incorporation of BMW AG. Shareholders, as the owners of the business, exercise their rights at the Annual General Meeting. The Board of Management is fully responsible for managing the enterprise and is monitored and advised by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Board of Management and can, for an important reason, revoke an appointment at any time. The Board of Management informs the Supervisory Board and reports to it regularly, promptly and comprehensively, in line with the principles of conscientious and faithful accountability and in accordance with the law and the reporting duties determined by the Supervisory Board. The Board of Management requires the approval of the Supervisory Board for certain major proceedings. The Supervisory Board is not, however, authorised to undertake management measures itself.\n\nThe close interaction between Board of Management and Supervisory Board in the interests of the enterprise as described above is also known as a \u201ctwo-tier board structure\u201d.\n\nBOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Board of Management manages the enterprise under its own responsibility, acting in the best interests of the BMW Group with the aim of achieving sustainable growth in value. The interests of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders are also taken into account in the pursuit of this aim.\n\nIn accordance with \u00a7 7 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Management of BMW AG comprises two or more persons; other than that, the number of members of the Board of Management is determined by the Supervisory Board. At 31 December 2020, the Board of Management comprised seven members. The Board of Management decides on the principal guidelines for managing the enterprise, determines and agrees upon the strategic orientation with the Supervisory Board, and ensures its implementation. The Board of Management is responsible for ensuring that all provisions of law and internal regulations are complied with. Further details on compliance within the BMW Group are available in the section Compliance and Human Rights. The Board of Management is also responsible for ensuring that appropriate risk management and risk controlling systems are in place throughout the Group.\nMembers of the Board of Management are required to act in the enterprise\u2019s best interests and may not pursue personal interests in their decisions or take advantage of business opportunities intended for the benefit of the BMW Group. Individual members of the Board of Management of BMW AG are required to disclose any conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board without delay and inform the other members of the Board of Management accordingly.\n\nDeliberations are held and decisions taken by the Board of Management as a collegiate body at full Board meetings as well as at Product and Customer full Board meetings. The Board of Management also deliberates and makes decisions at meetings of its three committees \u2013 Customer, Operations and Senior Executives. The overall framework for developing business strategies, the use of resources, the implementation of strategies and matters of particular importance to BMW AG are decided upon at Board of Management meetings.\n\nThe Board of Management Board has issued terms of procedure for itself. The allocation of areas of responsibility and business segments among the members of the Board of Management is set out in the Board\u2019s Schedule of Responsibilities.\n\nFurther information on the composition and working methods of the Management Board and its committees is provided in the Corporate Governance Statement at www.bmwgroup.com/ezu (Corporate Governance).\n\nSUPERVISORY BOARD\n\nBMW AG\u2019s Supervisory Board is composed of ten shareholder representatives (elected by the Annual General Meeting) and ten employee representatives (elected in accordance with the Co-Determination Act). The ten Supervisory Board members representing employees comprise seven Company employees, including one executive staff representative, and three members elected following nomination by unions. The Supervisory Board has the task of advising and supervising the Board of Management in its management of BMW AG. It is involved in all decisions of fundamental importance for BMW AG. The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Board of Management and decides upon the level of remuneration they receive. The Supervisory Board can revoke appointments for important reasons.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board of BMW AG are obliged to act in the best interest of the enterprise as a whole. They may not pursue personal interests in their decisions or take advantage of business opportunities intended for the benefit of the BMW Group.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are obliged to inform the full Supervisory Board of any conflicts of interest so that the latter can report to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on its treatment of the issue. Conflicts of interest requiring to be disclosed include, in particular, conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of a consultant or board function with clients, suppliers, lenders or other business partners. Significant and non-temporary conflicts of interest of a Supervisory Board member result in the termination of mandate.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly assesses the efficiency of its activities. To this end, shared discussion is conducted within the Supervisory Board and, at regular intervals, in personal discussions with the Chairman, prepared on the basis of a questionnaire sent in advance, which is drawn up by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has stated specific targets for its composition, agreed to a diversity concept and determined a competency profile. Members of the Supervisory Board are responsible for undertaking any training required for the performance of their duties. The Company provides them with appropriate assistance therein.\n\nTaking into account the specific circumstances of the BMW Group and the number of Board members, the Supervisory Board has set up a Presiding Board and four committees, namely the Personnel Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Mediation Committee. These serve to raise the efficiency of the Supervisory Board\u2019s work and facilitate the handling of complex issues.\n\nComposition of the Presiding Board and the various committees is based on legal requirements, the Articles of Incorporation, rules of procedure and corporate governance principles, while taking into particular account the expertise of the members concerned.\n\nBMW AG ensures that the Supervisory Board and its committees are appropriately equipped to carry out their duties. This includes providing a central Supervisory Board office to support the chairpersons in their coordination work.\n\nFurther information on the composition and working procedures of the Supervisory Board and its committees is provided in the Corporate Governance Statement at www.bmwgroup.com/ezu (Corporate Governance).\nSHAREHOLDERS AND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nThe shareholders of BMW AG exercise their rights at the Annual General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting decides in particular on the utilisation of unappropriated profit, the ratification of the acts of the members of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board, the appointment of the external auditor, changes to the Articles of Incorporation and specified capital measures and elects the shareholders\u2019 representatives to the Supervisory Board.\n\nMoreover, the systems for the remuneration of Board of Management members and Supervisory Board members are presented to the Annual General Meeting for approval in the case of significant changes, but at least every four years. This is scheduled to take place at the Annual General Meeting in 2021.\n\nShareholders may exercise their voting rights at the Annual General Meeting either in person, by proxy or via a representative designated by BMW AG. Voting rights may also be exercised via postal vote.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2020 Annual Meeting was held for the first time as a virtual meeting, i.e., without the physical presence of shareholders and proxies, except for the Company representatives bound by instructions issued by shareholders. In this case, the Company enabled shareholders to exercise their voting rights by issuing instructions to Company representatives or by postal vote (in both cases in paper form and online).\n\nDECLARATION OF COMPLIANCE\n\nOnce a year, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of BMW AG issue an annual Declaration of Compliance pursuant to \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) with regard to recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code as officially published and valid at the date of the declaration. BMW AG\u2019s current and previous Declarations of Compliance are available online at www.bmwgroup.com/compliancedeclaration (Corporate Governance). In the Declaration of Compliance issued in December 2020, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board declared that all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (version dated 16 December 2019) will be complied with going forward.\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\n\nFurther information on corporate management and governance, including the declaration of compliance pursuant to \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act, can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement (\u00a7 289f and \u00a7 315 HGB) at www.bmwgroup.com/corporategovernance (Corporate Governance).\nMEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nOLIVER ZIPSE (b.1964)\nChairman\n\nKLAUS FR\u00d6HLICH (b.1960)\nDevelopment (until 30 June 2020)\nMandates\n\u2014 E.ON SE\n\nILKA HORSTMEIER (b.1969)\nHuman Resources, Labour Relations Director\n\nDR.

(Independent) financial expert within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 100 (5) and 107 (4) AktG, C.10, D.4 DCGK.\nThe following section describes the principles governing the remuneration of the Board of Management and the stipulations set out in the statutes relating to the remuneration of the Supervisory Board. In addition to explaining the system of remuneration for the financial years 2018 to 2020, details of components of remuneration are also provided with figures. Furthermore, the remuneration of each member of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the financial year 2020 is disclosed by individual member and analysed with its component parts.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has resolved a new remuneration system for the Board of Management for financial year from 2021 onwards. In accordance with the statutory requirements, the new remuneration system will be submitted to the 2021 Annual General Meeting for resolution.\n\n1. Board of Management remuneration\n\nResponsibilities\n\nThe determination and regular review of the system and structure of Board of Management remuneration is a task of the full Supervisory Board, as is the determination of the individual level of remuneration of Board of Management members. The Supervisory Board\u2019s Personnel Committee assumes a preparatory function in determining and reviewing the system and level of Board of Management remuneration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the remuneration system annually for appropriateness in terms of structure, target and maximum remuneration as well as and actual remuneration. In preparation, the Personnel Committee also consults remuneration studies. In order to check that the remuneration system is in line with peers, the Supervisory Board compares remuneration paid by other DAX companies in horizontal terms. For a vertical view, it compares Board remuneration with the salaries of executive managers and with the average salaries of employees of BMW AG based in Germany, also with regard to the development over time. Recommendations made by an independent external remuneration expert and suggestions made by investors and analysts are also considered in the consultative process.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is required to submit the remuneration system to the Annual General Meeting for approval in the event of significant changes, but at least every four years. The remuneration system valid for the 2020 financial year was approved by the Annual General Meeting in 2018.\n\nPrinciples of remuneration\n\nThe remuneration system for the Board of Management at BMW AG is designed to encourage a management approach focused on the sustainable and long-term development of the BMW Group. One further principle applied when designing remuneration systems at BMW is that of consistency at different levels. This means that remuneration systems for the Board of Management, senior management and employees of BMW AG are composed of similar elements. The Supervisory Board performs an annual review to ensure that all Board of Management remuneration components are appropriate, individually and in total, and do not encourage the Board of Management to take inappropriate risks for the BMW Group. At the same time, the remuneration model used for the Board of Management needs to be attractive for highly qualified executives in a competitive environment.\n\nThe remuneration of members of the Board of Management is determined by the full Supervisory Board on the basis of performance criteria and after taking into account any remuneration received from Group companies. The principal performance criteria are the tasks and exercise of mandate of the Board member, the economic situation as well as the performance and future prospects of the BMW Group. The Supervisory Board sets ambitious and relevant parameters as the basis for variable remuneration. It also ensures that variable components based on multi-year criteria take account of both positive and negative developments and that the overall incentive is on the long term. As a general rule, targets and comparative parameters may not be changed retrospectively.\nRemuneration system, remuneration components\n\nBoard of Management remuneration comprises fixed and variable cash elements as well as a share-based component. Retirement and surviving dependants\u2019 benefit entitlements are also in place. The remuneration components are described in more detail below.\n\nOVERVIEW OF REMUNERATION SYSTEM FOR FINANCIAL YEARS 2018 \u2013 2020: DEPICTION OF ALLOCATION TO CASH BENEFITS (TARGET REMUNERATION) AND PENSION CONTRIBUTION\u00b9\n\n| Component                        | Approx.

Percentage |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Earnings-based component of the bonus | approx. 12        |\n| Performance component of the bonus | approx. 37        |\n| Share-based remuneration         | approx. 29         |\n\n\u00b2 Simplified depiction of target amounts for the variable cash remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Management. Excludes basic salary, other remuneration and pension contribution. Based on the assumption that the share price remains unchanged for the calculation of the matching component.\n\nFixed remuneration\n\nFixed remuneration consists of a base salary, which is paid monthly, and fringe benefits (other remuneration elements such as the use of Company cars, insurance premiums and contributions towards security systems). The basic remuneration of Board of Management members for the financial year 2020 is \u20ac0.8 million p.a. for a Board member during the first period of office, \u20ac0.95 million p.a. for a Board member with effect from the second period of office or the fourth year of mandate and \u20ac1.8 million p.a. for the Chairman of the Board of Management.\n\nVariable remuneration\n\nThe variable remuneration of the Board of Management comprises three components:\n\n- Bonus\n- Performance Cash Plan\n- Share-based remuneration\n\nPayment of a discretionary additional bonus is not provided for. An upper limit has been set for each component of variable remuneration (see Overview of remuneration system and remuneration components).\n\nBonus\n\nAssuming 100% target achievement, the bonus for the 2020 financial year comprises an earnings-related component of 30% and performance-related component of 70%. The target bonus (100%) is \u20ac0.85 million p.a. for a Board member during the first period of office, \u20ac1.0 million p.a. from the second period of office or the fourth year of mandate and \u20ac1.8 million p.a. for the Chairman of the Board of Management. For all Board members, the upper limit of the bonus is set at 180% of the relevant target bonus.\nIn order to calculate the earnings-related component, an earnings factor is determined on the basis of the target parameters and multiplied by 30% of the target bonus amount. The level of the earnings-related component depends on the degree to which the targets set by the Supervisory Board for Group net profit and Group post-tax return on sales are achieved. The degree of achievement is expressed in an earnings factor. The underlying measurement values for the bonus payable for the financial year 2020 were determined three financial years ago (i.e. back in 2017) and may not be changed retrospectively. The earnings factor is capped at a maximum value of 1.8. The bonus is paid out after the end of the Annual General Meeting, at which the separate financial statements of BMW AG for the relevant financial year are presented.\n\nFor the financial year 2020, an earnings factor of 1.000 would give rise to an earnings-related component of \u20ac0.255 million for a Board member in the first period of office, \u20ac0.3 million from the second period of office or the fourth year of mandate and \u20ac0.54 million for the Chairman of the Board of Management. For instance, in the event of a Group net profit of \u20ac5.3 billion and a post-tax return on sales of 5.6%, the earnings factor is 1.000. Similarly, a Group net profit of \u20ac6.9 billion and a post-tax return on sales of 7.3% gives rise to an earnings factor of 1.500 and a Group net profit of \u20ac9.0 billion and a post-tax return on sales of 8.0% to one of 1.637. A minimum earnings factor of 0.135 arises in the event of a Group net profit of \u20ac3 billion and a post-tax return on sales of 3%. If the Group net profit were below \u20ac3 billion or the post-tax return on sales below 3%, the earnings factor would be zero. In this case, an earnings-related component would not be paid. The maximum earnings factor of 1.800 is reached in the event of a Group net profit of \u20ac11 billion and a post-tax return on sales of 9%. In exceptional circumstances, for instance major acquisitions or disposals, the Supervisory Board may adjust the earnings factor.\n\nThe performance-related component for the financial year 2020 bonus is calculated using a performance factor which the Supervisory Board has set for each member of the Board of Management and which is multiplied by 70% of the target bonus amount. The Supervisory Board sets the performance factor on the basis of a detailed evaluation of the contribution made by Board members to sustainable and long-term business development over a period of at least three financial years. The evaluation by the Supervisory Board is based on predefined criteria that take into account the Group\u2019s long-term success, the interests of shareholders and stakeholders as well as social responsibility.\n\nThe criteria include in particular innovation (economic and ecological, for example in the reduction of carbon emissions), the Group\u2019s market position compared to its competitors, customer focus, ability to adapt, leadership, corporate culture, promotion of compliance and integrity, contribution to the Group\u2019s attractiveness as an employer, progress in implementing the diversity concept, and activities that foster corporate social responsibility. The Supervisory Board also draws comparisons with competitors. The individual performance factor lies between zero and a maximum 1.8.\nBONUS OVERVIEW\n\n**EARNINGS COMPONENT BONUS**\n\n- Earnings factor\n  - x 0.3 of target amount\n  - Value between 0 and 1.8\n\n**PERFORMANCE COMPONENT**\n\n- Performance factor\n  - x 0.7 of target amount\n  - Value between 0 and 1.8\n\n**TOTAL**\n\n- Cash payment\n- Capped at 180% of target amount\n\n**Basis for earnings factor:**\n- Group net profit\n- Group post-tax return on sales\n\n**Basis for performance factor:**\n- Contribution to sustainable and long-term business development over a period of at least three financial years\n- Qualitative, mainly non-financial parameters\n\n---\n\n**Performance Cash Plan**\n\nUp to and including the grant year 2020, variable cash remuneration includes a multi-year and future-oriented Performance Cash Plan (PCP). The PCP is calculated at the end of a three-year evaluation period by multiplying a predefined target amount by a factor that is based on multi-year target achievement (the PCP factor). The PCP target amount (100%) amounts to \u20ac0.85 million p.a. for a Board member in the first period of office, \u20ac0.95 million p.a. from the second period of office or the fourth year of mandate and \u20ac1.6 million p.a. for the Chairman of the Board of Management. The maximum amount that can be paid to a Board member is capped at 180% of the PCP target amount p.a.\n\nThe PCP evaluation period comprises three years, the grant year and the two subsequent years. PCP entitlements are paid in cash. The bonus is paid out after the end of the Annual General Meeting, at which the separate financial statements of BMW AG for the third year of the evaluation period are presented.\n\nIn order to determine the PCP factor, a multi-year profit factor is multiplied by a multi-year performance factor. The PCP factor is capped at a maximum value of 1.8.\n\nIn order to determine the multi-year earnings factor, an earnings factor is calculated for each year of the three-year evaluation period and an average is then calculated for the evaluation period. As for the earnings-related component of the bonus, the earnings factor for each individual year within the evaluation period is determined on the basis of Group net profit and post-tax return on sales for the relevant year. The maximum earnings factor is 1.8. The underlying measurement values are determined in advance for a period of three financial years and may not be changed retrospectively.\n\nIn addition to the multi-year earnings factor, the Supervisory Board also determines a multi-year performance factor after the end of the evaluation period. To this end, the Supervisory Board takes account in particular of the business development during the evaluation period, the forecast trend in the business development, the Board member\u2019s individual contribution to profitability and the status of compliance within the Board member\u2019s area of responsibility. The multi-year performance factor can be between 0.9 and 1.1.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management who were Board members on 1 January 2018 received and will receive an advance payment out of the 2018\u20132020 Performance Cash Plan in 2019 and from the 2019\u20132021 Performance Cash Plan in 2020. At the end of each relevant assessment period, the advance payment is set off or repaid, depending on the amount then determined. The advance payment for each relevant year is \u20ac0.5 million for a Board member in the first period of office and \u20ac0.6 million from the second period of office or the fourth year of mandate. For the Chairman of the Board of Management the amount is \u20ac0.9 million p.a.\nPERFORMANCE CASH PLAN OVERVIEW\n\nTARGET AMOUNT \u00d7 PCP FACTOR = CASH PAYMENT\n\u2014 Cash payment at end of evaluation period\n\u2014 Capped at 180% of target amount\n\nPCP FACTOR OVERVIEW\n\nMULTI-YEAR EARNINGS FACTOR \u00d7 MULTI-YEAR PERFORMANCE FACTOR = PCP FACTOR\n\u2014 Average earnings factor\n\u2014 Based on Group net profit and Group post-tax return on sales\n\u2014 Value between 0 and 1.8\n\u2014 Measurement based on multi-year performance factor:\n  \u2014 Trend in business development\n  \u2014 Status of compliance in each Board member\u2019s area of responsibility\n  \u2014 Individual contribution to profitability\n  \u2014 Forecast trend in business development\n  \u2014 Value between 0.9 and 1.1\n\nShare-based remuneration\n\nAt the end of the Annual General Meeting at which the separate financial statements of BMW AG for the relevant financial year are presented, members of the Board of Management receive for financial years up to and including the financial year 2020 a cash remuneration (investment component) for the specific purpose of investment \u2013 after tax and deductions \u2013 in shares of common stock of BMW AG. The investment component corresponds to 45% of the gross bonus. The shares of common stock are purchased immediately after the investment component has been paid out. As a general rule, the acquired shares are required to be held by Board members for four years. This period also applies if a Board member leaves the Board of Management, including in the case of retirement.\n\nAt the end of the holding period, Board members receive from the Company, for every three shares of common stock held, either one additional share of common stock or the cash equivalent, to be decided at the Company\u2019s discretion (matching component). Upper limits have been defined for both the investment component and the matching component (see Overview of remuneration system and remuneration components).\n\nOther\n\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for early payment of performance cash plans and share-based remuneration components based on the target amounts. Insofar as the service contract is prematurely terminated and the Company has an extraordinary right of termination, or if the Board member resigns without the Company\u2019s agreement, entitlements to amounts as yet unpaid relating to performance cash plans and share-based remuneration are forfeited.\n\nA one-year post-contractual non-competition clause has been agreed with the Board members under specified circumstances against payment of a remuneration amount. Service agreements taking effect after 1 January 2021 provide for the payment of a monthly amount corresponding to the respective monthly base salary during the period of the post-contractual non-competition clause. In accordance with the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code dated 16 December 2019, any severance payment is offset against the non-competition clause remuneration amount. The same applies to other income, unless it relates to remuneration for supervisory board mandates approved during the term of office. The Company may unilaterally waive the requirement to comply with the post-contractual non-competition clause.\nOverview for Financial Years 2018 \u2013 2020 of remuneration system and remuneration components\n\n| Component          | Parameter / measurement base                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **BASE SALARY**    | Member of the Board of Management:                                                                                                                                 |\n|                    | \u2014 \u20ac0.80 million p.a.

contribution. For the purposes of the overall cap, German accounting rules (HGB) require the relevant grant year to be taken in the calculation for the PCP; in the case of the matching component, the actual amount deemed to have been received is required to be added retrospectively to the total remuneration of the grant year concerned. The overall cap in absolute terms is lower than the sum of the maximum amounts for the individual components.\n\n**Retirement benefits**\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2010, the provision of retirement benefits for members of the Board of Management was changed to a defined contribution system with a guaranteed minimum return.\n\nIf a mandate is terminated, the defined contribution system provides, in the case of death or invalidity, for amounts accumulated on individual pension accounts to be paid out as a one-off amount or in instalments. For entitlements arising before 2016, there is an option to receive payment as a lifelong pension or in a combined form. Former Board members are entitled to receive the retirement benefit at the earliest upon reaching the age of 60, or in the case of entitlements awarded for the first time after 1 January 2012, upon reaching the age of 62.\n\nThe amount of the benefits to be paid is determined on the basis of the amount accrued in each Board member\u2019s individual pension savings account. The amount on this account results from annual contributions paid in, plus interest earned depending on the type of investment.\n\nIf a member of the Board of Management with a vested entitlement dies prior to the commencement of benefit payments, a surviving spouse or registered partner, or otherwise surviving children \u2013 in the latter case depending on their age and education \u2013 are entitled to receive benefits as surviving dependants.\n\nIn the case of death or invalidity, a minimum benefit is payable based on the number of contributions possible up to the age of 60 (subject to maximum of ten contributions).\n\nThe annual contribution paid by the Company for the financial year 2020 is \u20ac350,000 for a Board member and \u20ac500,000 for the Chairman of the Board of Management. The guaranteed minimum rate of return p. a. corresponds to the maximum interest rate used to calculate insurance reserves for life insurance policies (guaranteed interest on life insurance policies). When granting pension entitlements, the Supervisory Board considers the targeted level of pension provision in each case as well as the resulting expense for the BMW Group.\n\nContributions falling due under the defined contribution model are paid into an external fund in conjunction with a trust model that is also used to fund pension obligations to employees.\nIncome earned on an employed or a self-employed basis up to the age of 63 may be offset against instalment payments. In addition, certain circumstances have been specified, in the event of which the Company no longer has any obligation to pay benefits. Transitional payments are not provided.\n\nIn the event of the death of a Board member during the service contract term, the base remuneration for the month of death and a maximum of three further calendar months are paid to entitled surviving dependants.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management who retire immediately after their service on the Board, or who are deemed to be in an equivalent position, are entitled to acquire vehicles and other BMW Group products and services at conditions that also apply to BMW pensioners and to lease BMW Group vehicles in accordance with the guidelines applicable to senior heads of departments. Retired Chairmen of the Board of Management are entitled to use a BMW Group vehicle as a company car on a similar basis to senior heads of departments, and depending on availability and against payment, use BMW chauffeur services.\n\nTermination benefits on premature termination of Board activities, benefits paid by third parties\n\nKlaus Fr\u00f6hlich left the Board of Management on 30 June 2020. In accordance with the provisions of his service contract, a one-year post-contractual non-competition clause applies. The proportionate amount of remuneration relating to the financial year 2020 is \u20ac0.3 million. The corresponding figure for the remaining period from 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021 is \u20ac0.3 million, for which a provision has been recognised.\n\nIn line with the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code dated 16 December 2019, Board of Management service contracts provide for severance pay to be paid to the Board member in the event of premature termination by the Company without important reason, the amount of which is limited to a maximum of two years\u2019 remuneration (severance payment cap). If the remaining term of the contract is less than two years, the severance payment is reduced proportionately. For these purposes, annual remuneration is based on the sum of base remuneration and the target amount of variable remuneration components for the last full financial year before termination. If the relevant target amount for variable remuneration was not reached, the amounts granted are used instead.\n\nNo commitments or agreements exist for payment of remuneration in the event of early termination of a Board member\u2019s mandate due to a change of control or a takeover offer. No members of the Board of Management received any payments or relevant commitment from third parties in 2020 on account of their activities as members of the Board of Management.\n\nRemuneration caps\n\nThe Supervisory Board has stipulated upper limits for all variable remuneration components and for the remuneration of Board of Management members in total. The total upper limit amounts are lower than the sum of the maximum amounts applicable for the individual components. The upper limits are shown in the table Overview of remuneration system and remuneration components for the financial years 2018 \u2013 2020.\nTotal remuneration of the Board of Management for the financial year 2020 (2019)\n\nThe total remuneration of the current members of the Board of Management of BMW AG for the financial year 2020 amounted to \u20ac17.5 million (2019: \u20ac21.4 million), of which \u20ac7.3 million (2019: \u20ac8.1 million) relates to fixed components (including other remuneration). Variable components amounted to \u20ac9.7 million (2019: \u20ac12.6 million) and the share-based remuneration component to \u20ac0.5 million (2019: \u20ac0.7 million).\n\nFor the financial year 2020, the BMW Group achieved a net profit of \u20ac3,857 million (2019: \u20ac5,022 million) and a post-tax return on sales of 3.9% (2019: 4.8%). According to the defined allocation table, these results yield an earnings factor of 0.444 (2019: 0.798) for the earnings component relevant for the bonus for the financial year 2020.\n\nIn determining the performance factor, the Supervisory Board uses agreed-upon criteria to evaluate the contribution of Board members to the sustainable and long-term development and future viability of the BMW Group.\n\nThe Supervisory Board\u2019s decision-making process is based on a detailed, documented analysis of performance based on all agreed-upon criteria, as well as in-depth discussions at Personnel Committee and full Supervisory Board level.\n\nIn particular, the members of the Board of Management jointly exceeded the targets for the following criteria deemed particularly relevant by the Supervisory Board:\n\n\u2014 Market position compared to competitors: Despite the restrictions due to the pandemic, the BMW Group remained the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of premium automobiles for the 17th year in succession. Sales of electrified vehicles saw a sharp rise compared to the previous year.\n\n### DELIVERIES OF ELECTRIFIED VEHICLES\n\n| Units/Year | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| BEV        | 39,519 | 44,541 | 148,121 | 192,662 |\n| PHEV       | 106,639 | 148,121 | 192,662 | 192,662 |\n| Total      | 146,158 | 192,662 | 340,742 | 385,284 |\n\nIn 2020, the BMW Group delivered 385,284 electrified vehicles, a 31.8% increase compared to 2019.\n\u2014 Ecological benefits from innovation: At 99 g/km\\(^1\\)\\(^2\\), the figure for the BMW Group\u2019s fleet carbon emissions was 5 g/km below the EU legal limit, as in previous years. Further progress is likely to be made in the foreseeable future on the back of measures already adopted.\n\nFLEET EMISSIONS IN THE EU\\(^1\\)\n\n| Year | CO\\(_2\\) g/km |\n|------|--------------|\n| 2018 | 130          |\n| 2019 | 110          |\n| 2020 | 90           |\n\n\u2014 Customer orientation: As in previous years, the BMW Group won several industry awards for concept studies on various vehicles and plants, assessed on the basis of the concept of quality.\n\n\u2014 Customer orientation and innovative solutions: New software was installed in approximately 624,000 vehicles via remote upgrades, without the need for a visit to a service partner. The proportion of new vehicles sold with the new software has risen sharply over the past few years, and a further increase in the number of such vehicles is foreseeable as a result of product decisions already taken.\n\n\u2014 Reputation: Capital market rating agencies once again ranked the BMW Group as the best European automobile manufacturer. The BMW Group again performed excellently in sustainability indices such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, taking first place in the \u201cAutomobiles\u201d segment as the most sustainable manufacturer. It is also in the top CDP grouping (Climate A List).\n\n\u2014 Adaptability: Prudent management limited the impact of the pandemic on the Group, particularly in terms of keeping global supply chains running.\n\nOn the basis of these criteria, the Supervisory Board\u2019s first calculated and then set a performance factor of 1.15 for all members of the Board of Management for the financial year 2020 (2019: 1.20).\n\nThe performance cash plan (PCP) included in the remuneration system for the financial years 2018 to 2020 serves as a long-term incentive. The PCP is paid out in cash after the end of the relevant three-year assessment period.\n\nIn the case of the 2020 grant year, the PCP assessment period covers the financial years 2020 to 2022. The target amount for the PCP 2020 \u2013 2022 is \u20ac1.6 million for Mr Zipse, \u20ac0.85 million each for Ms Horstmeier, Mr Nedeljkovic, Mr Nota and Dr Wendt, \u20ac0.95 million for Dr Peter and \u20ac0.425 million for Mr Weber. The target amount for Mr Fr\u00f6hlich is \u20ac0.475 million. Due to the fact that the criteria established for the PCP 2020 \u2013 2022 have not yet been fully met, this component is not included in variable remuneration for the financial year 2020.\n\nIn the 2020 financial year, in line with contractually agreed arrangements, advances were paid out of the PCP 2019 \u2013 2021 to the Board members in office at 31 December 2020 (Mr Zipse, Mr Nota and Dr Peter) with a total amount of \u20ac1.7 million, and an advance of \u20ac0.6 million paid to Mr Fr\u00f6hlich.\n\nAt the end of assessment period, the advance payments will be set off or refunded, depending on the actual entitlement arising. The expense of the PCP for the financial year 2020 recognised in accordance with IAS 19 amounted to \u20ac1.3 million (2019: \u20ac8.3 million).\n\nRemuneration awarded for the financial year 2020 (2019) is presented in the table below on an individualised basis.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Based on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test procedure. With effect from September 2018, all vehicles in the EU are required to be approved in accordance with the new WLTP testing cycle. However, the EU Commission will not start using WLTP to calculate fleet CO\\(_2\\) emissions until 2021. For this reason, WLTP fleet emissions must be retroactively calculated as NEDC values for the purposes of reporting up to and including 2020.\n\n\\(^2\\) Taking into account the offset of certain flexibilities that are defined in the regulatory requirements (phase-in with 5 g/km, supercredits BEV/PHEV with 7.5 g/km and eco-innovations with 2.4 g/km). This is a preliminary internal calculation with a potential variation of \u00b10.5 g CO\\(_2\\)/km, as official registration figures from the authorities are not available from all EU states. Officially published values by the EU Commission are not expected to be available until November 2021.\nRemuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management for the financial year 2020 (2019)\u00b9\n\n| Name                  | Base salary | Other remuneration | Total | Bonus | Share-based remuneration component | Total | Number | Monetary value |\n|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------|-------|-------|------------------------------------|-------|--------|----------------|\n| Oliver Zipse          | 1,800,000   | 66,256             | 1,866,256 | 1,688,760 | 759,942 | 2,448,702 | 1,669 | 123,873 | 4,438,831 |\n|                       | (1,269,892) | (50,947)           | (1,320,839) | (1,404,380) | (631,971) | (2,036,351) | (1,725) | (103,037) | (3,460,227) |\n| Klaus Fr\u00f6hlich\u00b2       | 475,000     | 56,546             | 531,546 | 469,100 | 211,095 | 680,195 | 463 | 34,364 | 1,246,105 |\n|                       | (950,000)   | (71,822)           | (1,021,822) | (1,079,400) | (485,730) | (1,565,130) | (1,135) | (79,155) | (2,666,107) |\n| Ilka Horstmeier       | 800,000     | 87,374             | 887,374 | 797,470 | 358,862 | 1,156,332 | 846 | 62,790 | 2,106,496 |\n|                       | (133,333)   | (29,375)           | (162,708) | (152,915) | (68,812) | (221,727) | (173) | (12,013) | (396,448) |\n| Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107     | 800,000     | 101,973            | 901,973 | 797,470 | 358,862 | 1,156,332 | 846 | 62,790 | 2,121,095 |\n|                       | (200,000)   | (5,105)            | (205,105) | (229,373) | (103,218) | (332,591) | (280) | (18,026) | (555,722) |\n| Pieter Nota           | 800,000     | 18,408             | 818,408 | 797,470 | 358,862 | 1,156,332 | 846 | 62,790 | 2,037,530 |\n|                       | (800,000)   | (20,782)           | (820,782) | (917,490) | (412,871) | (1,330,361) | (1,036) | (72,251) | (2,223,394) |\n| Nicolas Peter         | 950,000     | 24,231             | 974,231 | 938,200 | 422,190 | 1,360,390 | 927 | 68,802 | 2,403,423 |\n|                       | (800,000)   | (29,988)           | (829,988) | (891,490) | (412,871) | (1,330,361) | (965) | (67,299) | (2,227,648) |\n| Frank Weber\u00b3          | 400,000     | 26,593             | 426,593 | 396,735 | 179,431 | 576,166 | 558 | 31,360 | 1,038,119 |\n|                       | (\u2013)         | (\u2013)                | (\u2013)    | (\u2013)    | (\u2013)    | (\u2013)    | (\u2013) | (\u2013)    | (\u2013)    |\n| Andreas Wendt         | 800,000     | 56,319             | 856,319 | 797,470 | 358,862 | 1,156,332 | 846 | 62,790 | 2,075,441 |\n|                       | (800,000)   | (102,701)          | (902,701) | (917,490) | (412,871) | (1,330,361) | (1,036) | (72,251) | (2,305,313) |\n| Total\u00b9                | 6,825,000   | 439,700            | 7,264,700 | 6,684,675 | 3,008,106 | 9,692,781 | 7,001 | 509,559 | 17,467,040 |\n|                       | (7,659,140) | (496,271)          | (8,155,411) | (8,697,280) | (3,913,778) | (12,611,058) | (9,728) | (659,614) | (21,426,083) |\n\n\u00b9 Contains disclosures in accordance with HGB and the requirements of German Accounting Standard No. 17.\n\u00b2 Member of the Board of Management until 30 June 2020.\n\u00b3 Member of the Board of Management from 1 July 2020.\n\u2074 Preliminary number or preliminary monetary value calculated in accordance with German Financial Reporting Standard 17 (DRS 17).\n\u2075 Preliminary number or preliminary monetary value calculated in accordance with German Financial Reporting Standard 17 (DRS 17).\n\nThe final number of matching shares is determined in each case when the requirement to invest in BMW AG common stock has been fulfilled.\n\nSee note 41 to the Group Financial Statements for a description of the accounting treatment of the share-based remuneration component.\nRemuneration in accordance with HGB and the requirements of German Accounting Standard No. 17\n\nThe PCP 2018 \u2013 2020 was awarded for the performance of Board of Management members in the financial year 2018. The three-year assessment period for this remuneration component, which was subject to specified forfeiture provisions, expired on 31 December 2020. The earnings factors determined for each year of the assessment period (financial year 2018: 1.520; financial year 2019: 0.798, financial year 2020: 0.444), give rise to a multi-year earnings factor of 0.921. The Supervisory Board set the multi-year performance factor at 1.0 for members of the Board of Management in office in financial year 2018, so that the PCP factor for the PCP 2018 \u2013 2020 is 0.921. For the purposes of determining the multi-year performance factor, the Supervisory Board took account in particular of business development during the assessment period, the outlook for business development going forward, the Board member\u2019s individual contribution to profitability and the status of compliance within the Board member\u2019s area of responsibility. When considering actual and forecasted business development for the relevant periods, the Supervisory Board paid particular attention to the development of certain key performance figures such as the number of deliveries, the EBIT margin and the return on capital employed. For the financial year 2020, the Supervisory Board took account of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic of these figures. It was not necessary to change the assessments relating to individual contributions to profitability or the status of compliance within Board members\u2019 area of responsibility.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of HGB and German Accounting Standard No. 17, PCP-related remuneration is required to be included in the total remuneration figure for the financial year in which the plan\u2019s conditions are fulfilled. The amount arising for the PCB 2018 \u2013 2020 is therefore required to be included in the financial year 2020. The following tables show the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management in accordance with the requirements of HGB and applicable accounting standards for the financial year 2020 (2019) and in the financial year 2020 (2019) respectively.\n\n|                      | 2020       | 2019       |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|\n|                      | Amount     | Proportion in % | Amount     | Proportion in % |\n| Fixed remuneration   | 7.3        | 34.9       | 8.1        | 37.8          |\n| Variable cash remuneration\u00b9 | 13.0      | 62.6       | 12.6       | 58.9          |\n| Share-based remuneration component\u00b2 | 0.5       | 2.5        | 0.7        | 3.3           |\n| **Total remuneration** | **20.8**   | **100.00** | **21.4**   | **100.0**     |\n\n\u00b9 Variable cash payments for the financial year 2020 also include a payment out of the PCP 2018 \u2013 2020 for the 2018 grant year amounting to \u20ac3.3 million.

2020.\n\u2074 Disclosures for the previous year include amounts relating to members of the Board of Management who left office during the financial year 2019.\nRevision of Board of Management remuneration for financial years from 2021 onwards\n\nDuring the financial year 2020, the Supervisory Board considered in detail the new requirements for Board of Management remuneration resulting from the Act Implementing the Second EU Shareholder Rights Directive (ARUG II) as well as the recommendations and suggestions contained in the German Corporate Governance Code (GCCC) dated December 16, 2019. At its meeting in December 2020, the Supervisory Board, acting on the recommendation of the Personnel Committee, resolved to revise the existing system of Board of Management remuneration for financial years from 2021 onwards. In its deliberations, the Supervisory Board also took into account the recommendations of an independent remuneration expert as well as suggestions from investor representatives and analysts. In agreement with the members of the Board of Management in office at that time, the relevant service contracts were amended with effect from 1 January 2021, in order to implement changes to the remuneration system for financial years from 2021 onwards for all Board members at the same time.\n\nThe Supervisory Board will submit the new system for Board of Management remuneration to the 2021 Annual General Meeting for approval. The new remuneration system will be explained in detail in the notice document inviting shareholders to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nKey features of the new remuneration system include in particular:\n\n\u2014 The new remuneration system for members of the Board of Management is designed to be simple, clear and easy to understand. It complies with the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations and suggestions of the GCCC for executive board remuneration.\n\n\u2014 Under the new remuneration system, variable, earnings-related remuneration will be oriented even more closely towards the company\u2019s sustainable development. Non-financial targets, particularly in the areas of the environment (e.g. reduction of carbon emissions), social issues and governance are taken into account appropriately.\n\n\u2014 The Performance Cash Plan will no longer apply in the future, resulting in a simplification of the remuneration system.\n\n\u2014 In future, most of the variable remuneration of the Board of Management will be determined using a share-based approach, in compliance with the recommendation of the GCCC in the version dated 16 December 2019. In order to simplify the remuneration system, the matching component that was previously paid out in cash or shares at the end of the four-year holding period no longer applies. As in the past, the company awards a so-called \u201cpersonal cash investment amount\u201d, which is required to be used \u2013 after tax and deductions \u2013 to acquire shares of BMW common stock. Compared to the previous arrangements, the personal cash investment amount will have a significantly higher weighting within the target structure, given that it replaces the PCP as a long-term incentive. Within the target structure, one half of the personal cash investment amount will be linked to the attainment of an RoCE target for the Automotive segment and one half to the attainment of strategic focus targets set by the Supervisory Board in accordance with corporate planning.\n\n\u2014 The members of the Board of Management are required to hold the BMW common stock acquired with the personal cash investment amount on a long-term basis, i.e. at least for a period of four years.\n\n\u2014 In the new remuneration system, the payment of variable remuneration components is subject to special malus and clawback clauses.\nOutlook: Remuneration elements, parameters, target remuneration levels and caps for financial years from financial year 2021 onwards\n\n| Component | Parameters / measurement base, applicable amounts |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| **BASE SALARY** | |\n| Member of the Board of Management: | |\n| \u2014 \u20ac0.90 million p.a.

Supervisory Board remuneration\nProvisions of Articles of Incorporation, procedures\n\nThe remuneration regulation valid for the financial year under report was resolved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2020 and is set out in Article 15 of BMW AG\u2019s Articles of Incorporation. With effect from the financial year 2020, members of the Supervisory Board are remunerated exclusively on the basis of a fixed remuneration structure. In accordance with the Act Implementing the Second EU Shareholder Rights Directive (ARUG II), a resolution on the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board is required to be adopted by the Annual General Meeting of a listed stock corporation at least every four years. A proposal will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2021 to confirm the existing remuneration arrangements.\n\nRemuneration principles, remuneration components\n\nThe exclusively fixed remuneration structure for Supervisory Board remuneration is intended to strengthen the independent exercise of its control and advisory functions and complies with Suggestion G.18 of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCCC) dated 16 December 2019. In accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, each member of the Supervisory Board of BMW AG who does not perform any additional remuneration-relevant functions receives \u2013 in addition to reimbursement of reasonable expenses \u2013 a fixed remuneration of \u20ac200,000, payable after the end of the financial year.\n\nThe latest version of the GCCC dated 16 December 2019 recommends that the exercising of chair and deputy chair positions in the Supervisory Board as well as the chair and membership of committees should also be considered when determining the level of remuneration (Recommendation G.17) due to the higher time consumption. Accordingly, the Articles of Incorporation of BMW AG stipulate that the Chairman of the Supervisory Board shall receive three times the amount and each Deputy Chairman twice the amount of remuneration paid to a Supervisory Board member, excluding amounts relating to additional remuneration-relevant functions. The chair of the Audit Committee receives two-and-a-quarter times the amount, the chair of other Supervisory Board committees twice the amount and each member of a committee one-and-a-half times the amount of the remuneration paid to a Supervisory Board member, provided the relevant committee convened on at least three days during the financial year. If a member of the Supervisory Board exercises more than one of the functions referred to above, their remuneration is measured only on the basis of the function receiving the highest amount.\n\nIn the event of changes in the composition of the Supervisory Board during the year or in the performance of additional remuneration-relevant functions, remuneration is determined on a proportionate basis.\n\nIn addition, each member of the Supervisory Board receives an attendance fee of \u20ac2,000 for each full meeting of the Supervisory Board (Plenum) which the member has attended, payable at the end of the financial year. Attendance at more than one meeting on the same day is not remunerated separately.\n\nFurthermore, the Company reimburses each member of the Supervisory Board for their reasonable expenses.\n\nIn order to be able to perform his duties, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is provided with secretariat and chauffeur services.\n\nOverview of remuneration\u00b9\n\n| Factor | Amount in \u20ac

Other\n\nWith exception of the advance payments relating to the PCP 2019\u20132021 described above, neither BMW AG nor any of its subsidiaries granted loans or advances to members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board during the financial year 2020, nor were any contingent liabilities entered into in their favour. During the year under report, members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board concluded vehicle purchase, service, rental, leasing and financing contracts for vehicles on customary market terms and conditions.\nGLOSSARY AND EXPLANATION OF KEY FIGURES\n\nASSET-BACKED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS\n\nA form of corporate financing involving the sale of receivables to a financing company.\n\nBOND\n\nA securitised debt instrument in which the issuer certifies its obligation to repay the nominal amount at the end of a fixed term and to pay a fixed or variable rate of interest.\n\nBUSINESS VOLUME IN BALANCE SHEET TERMS\n\nThe sum of the balance sheet line items \u201cLeased products\u201d and \u201cReceivables from sales financing\u201d (current and non-current), as reported in the balance sheet for the Financial Services segment.\n\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE RATIO\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets (excluding capitalised development costs) as a percentage of Group revenues.\n\nCAPITALISATION RATE\n\nCapitalised development costs as a percentage of research and development expenditure.\n\nCASH FLOW\n\nLiquid funds generated (cash inflows) or used (cash outflows) during a reporting period.\n\nCASH FLOW AT RISK\n\nSimilar to \u201cvalue at risk\u201d (see definition below).\n\nCASH FLOW HEDGE\n\nA hedge against exposures to the variability in forecasted cash flows, particularly in connection with exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nCARBON EMISSIONS OF THE NEW VEHICLE FLEET\n\nThe average carbon emissions of a manufacturer\u2019s fleet are calculated on the basis of the weighted average of carbon emissions across all vehicles newly registered during the reporting period. New registrations for these purposes comprise all newly registered vehicles of a given manufacturer in the EU, including Norway and Iceland, during the calendar year, plus any individual vehicle-specific carbon emissions determined in accordance with the WLTP type test procedure and converted back to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The BMW Group\u2019s fleet carbon emissions figure for 2020, as measured internally, includes legally permitted offsetting factors (i.e. phase-in, supercredits and eco-innovations).\n\nIn accordance with legal requirements, the forecast of fleet carbon emissions for 2021 is based on WLTP and includes lower offsetting factors, as phase-in is no longer permitted for 2021 and the BMW Group fully utilised the maximum amount of supercredits in 2020. For better comparability of the fleet carbon emissions forecast for 2021 and the actual figure for the fleet in 2020, the latter has been converted internally from NEDC (including offsetting factors) to a WLTP basis (excluding offsetting factors). The figure derived for 2020 serves only to reconcile it with the 2021 figure; it is not official in nature and does not correspond to legislation that was in place in 2020.\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER\n\nShort-term debt instruments with a term of less than one year which are usually issued at a discount to their face value.\n\nCONSOLIDATION\n\nThe process of combining separate financial statements of Group entities into Group Financial Statements, depicting the financial position, net assets and results of operations of the Group as a single economic entity.\n\nCREDIT DEFAULT SWAP (CDS)\n\nFinancial swap agreements, under which creditors of securities (usually bonds) pay premiums to the seller of the CDS to hedge against the risk that the issuer of the bond will default. As with credit default insurance agreements, the party receiving the premiums gives a commitment to compensate the bond creditor in the event of default.\n\nDELIVERIES\n\nA new or used vehicle will be recorded as a delivery once handed over to the end user. End users also include leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services and \u2013 in the US and Canada \u2013 dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle. In the case of used vehicles, end users may include dealers and other third parties when they purchase a vehicle at auction or directly from BMW Group. Vehicles designated for the end user and suffering total loss in transit will also be recorded as deliveries. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent dealers. The vast majority of deliveries \u2013 and hence the reporting to BMW Group of deliveries \u2013 is made by independent dealers.\n\nEARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated for common and preferred stock by dividing the net profit after minority interests, as attributable to each category of stock, by the average number of shares in circulation. Earnings per share of preferred stock are computed on the basis of the number of preferred stock shares entitled to receive a dividend in each of the relevant financial years.\n\nEBIT\n\nAbbreviation for \u201cEarnings Before Interest and Taxes\u201d, equivalent in the BMW Group income statement to \u201cProfit/loss before financial result\u201d. This is comprised of revenues less cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses and the net amount of other operating income and expenses.\n\nEBIT MARGIN\n\nProfit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.\n\nEBT\n\nEBIT plus financial result.\n\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE\n\nThe effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the income tax expense by the Group profit before tax.\n\nELECTRIFIED VEHICLES\n\nThe BMW Group uses the terms Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) to denote fully electric vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle (PHEV) to denote vehicles that can be charged and also driven on a fully electric basis.\nEMPLOYEES\n\nThe number of employees includes BMW AG and all companies in which it holds a majority interest, irrespective of whether they are consolidated in the Group Financial Statements. The figure does not include employees in dormant employment relationships, those in the non-work phase of partial retirement working arrangements and low-wage earners. With effect from the financial year 2020, the definition also includes employees with permanent and fixed-term contracts. Up to 2019, it also included temporary staff, postgraduate students, interns, apprentices, those on extended sick leave and sabbaticals.\n\nEQUITY RATIO\n\nEquity capital as a percentage of the balance sheet total.\n\nFAIR VALUE\n\nThe amount at the measurement date for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm\u2019s length transaction.\n\nFAIR VALUE HEDGE\n\nA hedge against exposures to fluctuations in the fair value of a balance sheet item.\n\nFREE CASH FLOW\n\nFree cash flow is derived from cash flows from operating and investing activities. The cash flows from investing activities from the purchase and sale of marketable securities and investment funds is not included. Cash flows from the purchase and sale of shares and the dividend payout from investments accounted for using the equity method are included in the cash flows from investing activities.\n\nGOODWILL\n\nGoodwill corresponds to the consideration paid to acquire an entity, less the fair value of the separate assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The buyer is willing to pay the additional amount in return for future expected earnings.\n\nGROSS PROFIT MARGIN\n\nGross profit as a percentage of Group revenues.\n\nLIQUIDITY\n\nCash and cash equivalents as well as marketable securities and investment funds.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nThe BMW Group uses the following terminology and ranges when forecasting key performance indicators:\n\n- At previous year\u2019s level: [-0.9% / +0.9%]\n- Slight increase: [+1.0% / +4.9%]\n- Slight decrease: [-1.0% / -4.9%]\n- Solid increase: [+5.0% / +9.9%]\n- Moderate decrease: [-5.0% / -9.9%]\n- Significant increase: >+10.0%\n- Significant decrease: >-10.0%\n\nUnlike the other key performance indicators, the RoCE forecast for the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is based on the change in percentage points:\n\n- At previous year\u2019s level: [-0.9%-pts. / +0.9%-pts.]\n- Slight increase: [+1.0%-pts. / +4.9%-pts.]\n- Slight decrease: [-1.0%-pts. / -4.9%-pts.]\n- Solid increase: [+5.0%-pts. / +9.9%-pts.]\n- Moderate decrease: [-5.0%-pts. / -9.9%-pts.]\n- Significant increase: >+10.0%-pts.\n- Significant decrease: >-10.0%-pts.\nPOST-TAX RETURN ON SALES\n\nGroup net profit as a percentage of Group revenues.\n\nPRE-TAX RETURN ON SALES\n\nGroup profit/loss before tax as a percentage of Group revenues.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE\n\nThe sum of research and non-capitalised development cost and capitalised development cost (not including the associated scheduled amortisation).\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LOCATIONS\n\nThe engineering, IT and process expertise required for the (pre-)development of hardware and software for all BMW Group products and services is combined at the Group\u2019s international research and development locations.\n\nRETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE)\n\nRoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed \u2013 at the end of the last five quarters \u2013 in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.\n\nRETURN ON EQUITY (ROE)\n\nRoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital \u2013 at the end of the last five quarters \u2013 attributable to the Financial Services segment.\n\nTRAINING AND FURTHER EDUCATION\n\nExpenditure for training comprises all costs incurred in the year under report for vocational training within the BMW Group in a total of seven countries, including personnel costs for trainers and apprentices as well as other costs and investments related to vocational training.\n\nThe number of apprentices undergoing training within the BMW Group includes those employed at domestic and international plants in a total of seven countries as well as those working in corporate functions, at Group plants in Germany and international sales companies as well as in the Financial Services segment.\n\nExpenditure for further education includes all costs incurred by the BMW Group\u2019s consolidated companies in connection with ongoing and advanced training. This includes preparation and implementation costs, opportunity costs and investments made in order to provide such training. Costs also include notional depreciation, measured on the basis of asset inventory lists.\n\nVALUE AT RISK\n\nA measure of the potential maximum loss in value of an item during a set time period, based on a specified probability.\nRESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT BY THE COMPANY\u2019S LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES\n\nSTATEMENT PURSUANT TO \u00a7 117 NO.1 OF THE SECURITIES TRADING ACT (WPHG) IN CONJUNCTION WITH \u00a7 297 (2) SENTENCE 4 AND \u00a7 315 (1) SENTENCE 5 OF THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HGB)\n\n\u201cTo the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable reporting principles, the Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the Group, and the Group Management Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of business and position of the Group, together with a description of the principal opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the Group.\u201d\n\nMunich, 9 March 2021\n\nBayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft\n\nTHE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nOLIVER ZIPSE\n\nILKA HORSTMEIER DR.

In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the \u201cOther Information\u201d section of our auditor\u2019s report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n\u2014 the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to \u00a7 [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020, and\n\n\u2014 the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group\u2019s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the \u201cOther Information\u201d section of our auditor\u2019s report.\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\nBasis for the Audit Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with \u00a7 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \u201cEU Audit Regulation\u201d) in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \u201cAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\u201d section of our auditor\u2019s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\nKey Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n1. Measurement of leased products\n2. Valuation of receivables from sales financing\n3. Valuation of provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations and product guarantees\n4. Measurement of YOUR NOW equity investment\n5. Measurement of provision for risks relating to an EU antitrust proceeding\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n1. Matter and issue\n2. Audit approach and findings\n3. Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n1. Measurement of leased products\n\nThe BMW Group leases vehicles to end customers under operating leases (leased products). At the balance sheet date, the figure reported under the \u201cleased products\u201d line item for operating leases was EUR 41,995 million (approximately 19.4% of total assets). Leased products are measured at cost, which is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to the expected residual value (recoverable amount). A key estimated value for subsequent measurement of leased products is the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. The BMW Group uses internally available data on historical empirical values, current market data and market estimates as well as forecasts by external market research institutes. The estimation of future residual values is subject to judgment due to the large number of assumptions to be made by the executive directors and the amount of data included in the determination.\n\nAgainst this background and due to the resulting significant uncertainties with regard to estimates in the context of measuring the residual values of the leased products, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n2. As part of our audit we obtained an understanding of the development of operating leases, the underlying residual value risks as well as the business processes for the identification, management, monitoring and measurement of residual value risks, among other things by inquiries and inspection of documents related to the internal calculation methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system, particularly regarding the determination of expected residual values. This included the evaluation of the propriety of the relevant IT systems as well as the implemented interfaces therein by our IT specialists. In addition, we evaluated the appropriateness of the forecasting methods, the model assumptions as well as the parameters used for the measurement of the residual values based on the validations carried out by the BMW Group. For this purpose, we inquired with the BMW Group\u2019s experts responsible for the management and monitoring of residual value risks and inspected the internal analysis on residual value developments and residual value forecasts as well as the validation results. We examined the mathematically correctness of the forecast values using the key calculation steps.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the methods and processes for determining the expected residual values of leased products underlying the valuation are appropriate and the assumptions and parameters included in the forecast model for the residual value are appropriate as a whole.\nThe Company\u2019s disclosures on the applied \u201cAccounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\u201d are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 5 and on leased products are contained under note 23.\n\nValuation of receivables from sales financing\n\nThe BMW Group offers end customers, dealerships and importers various financing models for vehicles. In this context, current and non-current receivables from sales financing totaling EUR 84,277 million are reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as at the balance sheet date (approximately EUR 38.9% of total assets). Impairment losses amounting to EUR 1,639 million were recognized on these receivables as at the balance sheet date. In order to determine the amount of the necessary valuation allowances to be recognized with respect to receivables from sales financing, the BMW Group, among others, evaluates the creditworthiness of the dealers, importers and end customers, as well as any loss ratios, and risk provisioning parameters are derived based on historical default probabilities and loss ratios.\n\nThe determination of the valuation allowances by the executive directors is subject to a significant degree of judgment due to several value-influencing factors such as the estimation of creditworthiness, the determination of probabilities of default and loss ratios and was therefore of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\nAs part of our audit we obtained a comprehensive understanding of the development of receivables from sales financing, the associated default-related risks as well as the business processes for the identification, management, monitoring and measurement of default risks, among other things by inquiries and inspection of documents on the internal calculation methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system regarding the determination of the impairment loss to recognize. In this context, we also evaluated the relevant IT systems and internal processes. The evaluation included an assessment by our IT specialists of the appropriateness of the systems concerned and associated interfaces to ensure the completeness of data as well as the audit of automated controls for data processing. As part of our audit we assessed in particular the appropriateness of the risk classification procedures as well as the risk provisioning parameters used. For this purpose, we analyzed in particular the validations of parameters that are regularly conducted by the Company. To assess the default risk, we also used targeted sampling of individual cases to examine whether the attributes for assignment to the respective risk categories were suitably available and the impairment losses had been calculated using the parameters defined for these risk categories.\n\nIn our view, the assumptions and parameters used in the measurement of receivables from sales financing were appropriate overall.\n\nValuation of provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations and product guarantees\n\nProvisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees are included in the consolidated financial statements of BMW Group as a material amount in other provisions. The obligations amounted to EUR 6,131 million (approximately 2.8% of total assets) as at December 31, 2020. BMW Group is responsible for the legally required warranty and product guarantees in the respective sales market. In order to estimate the liabilities arising from statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations and product guarantees for vehicles sold, information on the type and volume of damages arising and on remedial measures is recorded and analyzed at vehicle model level. The expected amount of obligations is extrapolated from costs of the past and recognized as a provision in the corresponding amount, if the criteria of IAS 37 have been met. For specific or anticipated individual circumstances, for example recalls, additional provisions are recognized provided they have not already been taken into account.\nThe determination of provisions is associated with unavoidable estimation uncertainties and is subject to a high risk of change, depending on factors such as notification of detected defects as well as claims made by vehicle owners. Against this background, this matter was of particular significance during our audit.\n\nIn order to assess the appropriateness of the valuation method used for the determination of the provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees including the assumptions and parameters, we primarily obtained an understanding of the process for determining the assumptions and parameters through discussions with the responsible employees of the BMW Group. We also evaluated the appropriateness as well as effectiveness of controls for determining the assumptions and parameters. With the involvement of our IT specialists, we checked the IT systems used regarding their compliance. We compared the expenses for claims and technical actions with actual costs incurred in order to draw conclusions on the forecast accuracy. Based on a targeted sample of vehicle models, the mathematically correctness of the valuation model used across the Group was examined. We examined and evaluated the assumptions used by the BMW Group concerning the extent to which the past values were representative of the expected susceptibility of damage, the expected value of damage per vehicle (comprising parts and labor input) as well as the expected assertion of claims from statutory and non-statutory warranties.\n\nIn our view, the method for the valuation of provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees is overall appropriate. Taking into consideration the information available, we believe that, overall, the measurement parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are appropriate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s disclosures on the applied \u201cAccounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\u201d are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 5 and on \u201cOther provisions\u201d are contained under note 33.\n\nMeasurement of YOUR NOW equity investment\n\nIn the BMW Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2020, the YOUR NOW equity investment is reported under the balance sheet item \u201cInvestments accounted for using the equity method\u201d with a carrying amount of EUR 591 million (approximately 0.3 % of total assets). The BMW Group and a competitor have bundled mobility services within YOUR NOW. In the financial year 2020 YOUR NOW generated negative operating earnings amounting to EUR 349 million, which were recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, there was a triggering event at the level of the BMW Group. The Company has identified as a triggering event in particular a significant deviation from target figures and the impacts of the coronavirus crisis regarding the YOUR NOW equity investment. As a result of the impairment test performed, no further write-downs were necessary as at balance sheet date.\n\nThe measurement of the YOUR NOW equity investment, including the performance of the impairment test, depends to a significant degree on the estimates made by the executive directors and their exercise of judgment, which are subject to significant estimation uncertainties. Against this background, this matter was of particular significance during our audit.\n\nAs part of our audit, we examined and evaluated the methodological procedure adopted for the purposes of measuring the YOUR NOW equity investment as well as for performing the impairment test, among other things. We also assessed the appropriateness of the valuation parameters and assumptions on which the measurement was based. We examined the impairment test conducted by the BMW Group based on the occurrence of a triggering event. After comparing the future cash inflows used in the calculation against the underlying budget, we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and sectorspecific market expectations. Moreover, we evaluated the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the impacts of the coronavirus crisis on the YOUR NOW equity investment and examined its consideration in the calculation of future cash inflows. We also assessed the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied and examined the measurement model.\n\nThe valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are overall in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be acceptable.\n\nThe Company\u2019s disclosures on the applied \u201cAccounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\u201d are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 5 and on the YOUR NOW equity investment are contained under note 24.\nMeasurement of provision for risks relating to an EU antitrust proceeding\n\nIn April 2019, the BMW Group was notified by the European Commission of complaints in a pending antitrust proceeding. The European Commission accuses various manufacturers of colluding to restrict competition in the field of innovation. In this connection, as in the previous year, a EUR 1.4 billion provision for litigation and risk provisioning was recognized at the balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements under the balance sheet item \u201cOther provisions\u201d. The risk assessment to be made on developments in the EU antitrust proceeding and the estimation of whether or not a provision must be recognized to cover the risks, and if so, in what amount the current obligation must be measured, is subject to a high degree of uncertainties and characterized by the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors.\n\nIn our view, this matter was of particular significance for our audit due to the significant uncertainties concerning the outcome of the EU antitrust proceeding and the potential effects on BMW AG\u2019s assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance.\n\nWith the knowledge that estimated values result in an increased risk of accounting misstatements and that the executive directors\u2019 recognition and measurement decisions have a direct effect on consolidated result, we evaluated the retention of the carrying amounts, with the involvement of an internal PwC antitrust law expert. Furthermore, we also held regular meetings with the Company\u2019s legal department in order to receive updates on current developments and the reasons for the corresponding estimates. The development of the aforementioned risks arising from the EU antitrust proceeding, including the executive directors\u2019 estimates concerning the potential proceeding outcomes, was provided to us by the Company in writing. In addition, we obtained and evaluated an external legal confirmation as at the balance sheet date.\n\nIn our view, the estimates made by the executive directors regarding the recognition and measurement of the provision for the risks from the EU antitrust proceeding described above and the associated risk provision in the consolidated financial statements are sufficiently documented and substantiated.\n\nThe Company\u2019s disclosures on the applied \u201cAccounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimates\u201d are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 5 and on \u201cOther operating expenses\u201d are contained under note 10.\n\nOther Information\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following non-audited parts of the group management report:\n\n- the statement on corporate governance pursuant to \u00a7 289 f HGB and \u00a7 315 d Abs. 1 HGB included in section \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d of the group management report\n- the subsections \u201cInformation on the Company\u2019s Governing Constitution\u201d, \u201cBoard of Management\u201d, \u201cSupervisory Board\u201d, \u201cShareholders and Annual General Meeting\u201d and \u201cDeclaration of Compliance\u201d listed in the \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d section of the group management report\n- the disclosures marked with \u201c...\u201d of the non-financial statement pursuant to \u00a7 289b Abs. 1 HGB and \u00a7 315d Abs. 1 HGB\n\nThe other information comprises further the remaining parts of the annual report \u2013 excluding cross-references to external information \u2013 with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor\u2019s report.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n\u2014 is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n\n\u2014 otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nResponsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to \u00a7 315 e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group\u2019s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group\u2019s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group\u2019s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with \u00a7 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n\u2014 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n\n\u2014 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n\u2014 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n\n\u2014 Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n\n\u2014 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to \u00a7 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n\n\u2014 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n\n\u2014 Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group\u2019s position it provides.\n\n\u2014 Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\nOTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nAssurance Report in Accordance with \u00a7 317 Abs. 3b HGB on the Electronic Reproduction of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes\n\nReasonable Assurance Conclusion\n\nWe have performed an assurance engagement in accordance with \u00a7 317 Abs. 3b HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the \u201cESEF documents\u201d) contained in the attached electronic file BMW_AG_KA+KLB_ESEF-2020-12-31.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of \u00a7 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format (\u201cESEF format\u201d).

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of an Integrated Group Report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIndependence and Quality Control of the Audit Firm\n\nWe have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other ethical requirements.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards \u2013 in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (\u201cBerufssatzung f\u00fcr Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer und vereidigte Buchpr\u00fcfer\u201d: \u201cBS WP/vBP\u201d) as well as the Standard on Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality control for audit firms (IDW Qualit\u00e4tssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an die Qualit\u00e4tssicherung in der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcferpraxis \u2013 IDW QS 1) \u2013 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n\u00b9 PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH has performed a limited assurance engagement on the German version of the \u201eBMW Group Report 2020\u201c and issued an independent practitioner\u2019s report in German language, which is authoritative. The following text is a translation of the independent practitioner\u2019s report.\nPractitioner\u2019s Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Disclosures on Non-financial Reporting denoted with the symbol \u201c...\u201d of the combined non-financial statement and the Sustainability Disclosures in the sections \u201cDialog with Stakeholders\u201d and \u201cFurther GRI Information\u201d of the Integrated Group Report based on the assurance engagement we have performed.\n\nWithin the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to in the Integrated Group Report.\n\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to allow us to conclude with limited assurance that nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that\n\n\u2014 the Disclosures on Non-financial Reporting denoted with the symbol \u201c...\u201d of the Company\u2019s combined non-financial statement pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 289b Abs. 1 and 315b Abs. 1 HGB for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020, which is integrated into the combined management report contained in the Integrated Group Report, have not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB relevant to these disclosures, or\n\n\u2014 the Sustainability Disclosures in the sections \u201cDialog with Stakeholders\u201d and \u201cFurther GRI Information\u201d of the Company\u2019s Integrated Group Report for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020 have not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the relevant GRI-Criteria.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The assurance procedures selected depend on the practitioner\u2019s judgment.\n\nWithin the scope of our assurance engagement, we performed amongst others the following assurance procedures and further activities:\n\n\u2014 Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and of the stakeholder engagement\n\n\u2014 Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Integrated Group Report regarding the preparation process, the internal control system relating to this process and selected disclosures in the Integrated Group Report\n\n\u2014 Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement of the Integrated Group Report\n\n\u2014 Testing of processes for the collection, control, analysis and aggregation of selected data from various Group sites on a sample basis\n\n\u2014 Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the Integrated Group Report\n\n\u2014 Inquiries of the employees responsible for the information on fleet emissions and fuel consumption contained in the Integrated Group Report and reconciliation of individual data on fleet emissions and fuel consumption with the technical vehicle data\n\n\u2014 Evaluation of the presentation of the disclosures\nAssurance Conclusion\n\nBased on the assurance procedures performed and assurance evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that\n\n\u2014 the Disclosures on Non-financial Reporting denoted with the symbol \u201c...\u201d of the Company\u2019s combined non-financial statement pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 289b Abs. 1 and 315b Abs. 1 HGB for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020, which is integrated into the combined management report contained in the Integrated Group Report, have not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB relevant to these disclosures, or\n\n\u2014 the Sustainability Disclosures in the sections \u201cDialog with Stakeholders\u201d and \u201cFurther GRI Information\u201d of the Company\u2019s Integrated Group Report for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020 have not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the relevant GRI-Criteria.\n\nIntended Use of the Assurance Report\n\nWe issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with the Company.

The emissions listed account for approximately 90% of the BMW Group\u2019s total Scope 1 to Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions exclude climate-changing gases other than carbon dioxide.\n2. Due to new input data from an external service provider, the figures for 2017 were adjusted.\n3. Figure not directly comparable to previous years\u2019 figures. Calculated using EU fleet emissions according to NEDC correlated. Using NEDC correlated values in 2017 would result in a value of 52,933,132 t of CO\u2082. This is equivalent to a reduction of absolute emissions by 0.3% in 2018.\n4. Emissions from BMW Group-owned production sites including BMW Motorrad Berlin as well as administration, development and central distribution centres. VDA factors (updated in June 2019) used since the reporting year 2020.\n5. Includes refuelling of service and function-related vehicles in Germany and at individual international locations (USA, Sweden, France). Private refuelling is not recorded.\n6. Decrease is due to the pandemic-related reduction in travel activities.\n7. Market-based emissions according to GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance. VDA factors (updated in June 2019) used since the reporting year 2020. Scope 2 emissions calculated using the location-based method (total bought-in electricity and heat calculated using VDA factors): 1,250,572 t CO\u2082.\n8. The volume of carbon emissions in 2020 is not directly comparable with the figures reported for previous years, as the scope of analysis has been expanded to include local data from suppliers involved in supplying specified production plants as well as data from service providers involved in distributing vehicles to dealerships in specified markets and spare parts deliveries.\n9. Includes air travel, train travel and rental cars.\n10. The figures from 2020 onwards are not directly comparable with previous years due to the improved data basis. In some cases, figures are extrapolated based on surveys conducted at major national and international BMW Group locations.\n11. Emissions from the upstream value chain and from disposal are calculated from the life cycle assessments in accordance with ISO 14040/44 of representative vehicles of the product lines using the LCA tool GaBi from the company Thinkstep (including the climate-changing gases CO\u2082, CH\u2084, N\u2082O, SF\u2086, NF\u2083). Corresponding to the CO\u2082 emissions, the life cycle assessments show the energy consumption (lower calorific value): around 75,640,609 MWh in the upstream chain and around 502,245 MWh at disposal companies.\n12. The fleet emissions are extrapolated from the average fleet emissions of the main sales markets of the BMW Group. The calculation was based on an average mileage of 150,000 km.\n\n---\n\nGRI 302-2, 305-1, 305-2, 305-3\nENERGY CONSUMPTION IN DETAIL \u00b9, \u00b2\n\n| in MWh | 2016       | 2017       | 2018       | 2019       | 2020       |\n|--------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION | 5,783,841  | 5,852,666  | 5,788,965  | 5,974,625  | 5,714,610  |\n| of which vehicle production | 5,328,856  | 5,362,618  | 5,169,266  | 5,226,227  | 4,946,865  |\n| of which motorcycle production | 85,559     | 95,493     | 89,300     | 120,583    | 114,072    |\n| of which non-manufacturing areas | 369,426    | 394,555    | 530,399    | 627,815    | 653,673    |\n| TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN DETAIL | 2,584,570  | 2,588,409  | 2,513,308  | 2,439,675  | 2,154,899  |\n| Electricity (external source) | 381,340    | 408,735    | 395,609    | 358,992    | 266,112    |\n| Community heating | 1,084      | 1,095      | 1,072      | 1,123      | 1,113      |\n| Community cooling in Mwh | 237,446    | 224,819    | 205,320    | 164,957    | 192,911    |\n| FOSSIL FUELS | 245,899    | 258,380    | 294,724    | 412,451    | 498,299    |\n| Heating oil | 3,698      | 4,450      | 2,888      | 2,205      | 3,660      |\n| Natural gas | 2,575,089  | 2,624,557  | 2,669,457  | 3,005,902  | 3,093,543  |\n| of which CHP losses | 108,536    | 84,166     | 86,787     | 68,560     | 65,065     |\n| NON-FOSSIL FUELS | 220        | 220        | 220        | 68         | 56         |\n| Biogas (landfill gas) | 220        | 220        | 220        | 68         | 56         |\n| of which CHP losses | 220        | 220        | 220        | 68         | 56         |\n| Wood pellets | 394        | 381        | 1,091      | 1,703      | 2,316      |\n| RENEWABLES | 394        | 381        | 1,091      | 1,703      | 2,316      |\n| Solar (photovoltaics) | 394        | 381        | 1,091      | 1,703      | 2,316      |\n\n\u00b9 Energy consumption at BMW Group-owned production sites including BMW Motorrad Berlin (Germany) as well as administration, development and central distribution centres.\n\u00b2 Upper calorific value for fossil fuels.\n\u00b3 Figures since 2018 not directly comparable to previous years\u2019 figures, mainly due to a more refined distinction between production and non-manufacturing areas (e.g. administration, development, central distribution centres).\n\u2074 The decrease was mainly due to the pandemic-related interruption of production at most BMW Group plants.

References to the Global Compact principles have been integrated in the GRI Content Index.\n\nTCFD DISCLOSURES\n\nThe BMW Group follows the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) with a view to providing information on climate-related risks and opportunities as transparently as possible within the framework of corporate financial reporting. The BMW Group reports on these issues both in its own integrated report as well as through its CDP scoring disclosures. The 2020 CDP questionnaire is available on the BMW Group website. The TCFD Index in the appendix to this report provides a compact overview of the key statements in the four TCFD core elements and their location in the BMW Group Report and the CDP questionnaire.\n\nMAIN TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE NFS\n\nThe main topics addressed in the NFS to ensure compliance with \u00a7 289 c and \u00a7 315 c HGB were determined partly on the basis of the results of the materiality analysis updated in 2018 and in line the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and partly on the basis of the BMW Group\u2019s own long-term sustainability goals. For these purposes, consideration was given to the BMW Group\u2019s own business operations, products and services on the one hand and its business relationships (e.g. along the supply chain) on the other. Topics of particular relevance are presented in the combined, separate non-financial statement.\n\nThe order of topics covered is aligned with the long-term sustainability goals of the BMW Group and does not represent any particular weighting of the topics. In accordance with the statutory materiality requirements, information has been in each case with a view to providing an understanding of the BMW Group\u2019s business performance, results of operations and financial position, while also showing the impact of business activities on the non-financial aspects specified in the legislation.\nEXTERNAL AUDIT\n\nThe entire report of BMW AG, comprising the Combined Management Report, the Group Financial Statements, the disclosures on corporate governance and the additional GRI information, has been subject to an annual independent audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (\u201cPwC\u201d or \u201cAuditor\u201d). The external audit serves to underpin the reliability and trustworthiness of the information for the public.\n\nPwC has audited the Group Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report for the year ended 31 December 2020 and issued an unqualified audit opinion thereon.\n\nThose parts of the Combined Management Report, which relate primarily to the NFS pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 289 b and 315b HGB as well as the chapter \u201cDialogue with Stakeholders\u201d and the section \u201cAdditional GRI Information\u201d were subjected to a limited assurance engagement and are marked with the symbol ... In addition, individual parts of the NFS were subjected to a reasonable assurance engagement. The external audit supports the Supervisory Board of BMW AG in the fulfilment of its auditing duties.\n\nPUBLICATION AND SCOPE\n\nThe report is published annually in German and English on the BMW Group website. The GRI Content Index is also available on the website as a separate PDF document. The reporting period covers the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020. The statements made in the report relate to the BMW Group reporting entity. Any deviations from this are marked accordingly. Nothing significant has changed in the reporting period with regard to the organisation of the BMW Group. The global supplier network is subject to continuous change. The 2021 report will be published in spring 2022. GRI 102-10, 102-45, 102-50, 102-51, 102-52, 102-55\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThe report contains various forward-looking statements about future developments which are based on the current status of the BMW Group\u2019s assumptions and forecasts. They are therefore subject to a variety of predictable and unpredictable risks, uncertainties and other factors, so that the actual outcome, including the BMW Group\u2019s net assets, financial position and results of operations, its development or performance could differ considerably. The BMW Group makes no commitment to update such forward-looking statements or to adapt them to future events or developments.\n## TCFD-INDEX\n\n| TCFD Key elements | Key elements of summarised disclosures/Key messages | Reference to chapters in the BMW Group Report 2020 and the CDP questionnaire for 2020 |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GOVERNANCE**    | A. Responsibility of the Board of Management for climate-related risks and opportunities | BMW Group Report 2020: |\n|                   | The highest level of direct responsibility for climate change issues is the Board of Management, which determines the Group\u2019s strategic course with regard to sustainability issues, including addressing climate change. Every proposal considered by the Board of Management must be assessed from a sustainability perspective. The new substance targets for 2030 developed and adopted in 2020 that focus on decarbonisation have been incorporated into the BMW Group\u2019s target controlling system and will be taken into account in the compensation of the Board of Management and top management going forward. | Strategy, Goals and Management System |\n|                   | B. The role of management in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities | Corporate Governance |\n|                   | All Board of Management members bear responsibility for climate change-related issues and ensure that the Group\u2019s strategy with regard to sustainability and climate change is implemented as a systematic driver in all Board areas of responsibility. One focus of the Group\u2019s strategy in the 2020 reporting year was the topic of addressing climate-related risks and opportunities. The impacts of this topic were assessed, internal structures for decision-making and controlling were established with the participation of top management, and project organisations were set up in the relevant Board areas of responsibility. | CDP questionnaire 2020: |\n| **STRATEGY**      | Sustainability is the basic pattern that shapes the BMW Group\u2019s strategy. From beginning to end, activities and plans should comprehensively be examined with regard to their economic, ecological and social impacts and the corresponding decisions taken based on an integrated approach. The BMW Group is firmly convinced that the fight against climate change and the responsible use of resources will determine the future of our society \u2013 and thus also that of the BMW Group. Particularly as a premium manufacturer, the BMW Group aspires to lead the way in promoting sustainability. In addition to the Group\u2019s activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation), addressing the consequences of climate change (adaptation) is also being dealt with and assessed within the framework of the \u201cAdaptation to Climate Change\u201d strategy project. | Strategy, Goals and Management System |\n|                   | A. Climate-related risks and opportunities | Risks and Opportunities |\n|                   | As a globally leading provider of premium automobiles, motorcycles, mobility services and financial services, the BMW Group is exposed to an array of uncertainties and changes. In order to ensure growth, profitability, efficiency and continued sustainability going forward, the BMW Group needs to take well calculated risks and make full use of any opportunities that present themselves. In the context of its \u201cAdaptation to Climate Change\u201d strategy project, the BMW Group is preparing for a broad range of possible consequences and plans to systematically integrate reporting on the opportunities and risks associated with climate change in its Group Report. | Products and Services |\n|                   | | Production, Purchasing and Supplier Network |\n|                   | | CDP questionnaire 2020: |\n|                   | | A: C2.1, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a |\n**STRATEGY**\n\n**Significant opportunities**\n\n- The BMW Group intends to press ahead with the systematic electrification of all its brands and model series. By 2023, it plans to have 25 electrified vehicles on the road. Achieving this aim will provide the Group with an attractive portfolio to respond to the growing customer demand for battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n\n- Smart, scalable vehicle architectures that can be equipped with all available types of drivetrain systems are intended to give the Group the flexibility to successfully implement the shift towards climate neutrality that is both called for politically and aspired to socially.\n\n- The BMW Group\u2019s production system is capable of manufacturing both conventional internal combustion and electrically powered vehicles on a single line, enabling it to respond flexibly to changing customer requirements for various drivetrain systems.\n\n- (The BMW Group is convinced that the ability to produce electric drivetrains, batteries and prototypes for battery cells in-house creates a decisive competitive advantage that enables it...)\n\n  The BMW Group is convinced that the ability to produce electric drivetrains, batteries and prototypes for battery cells in-house gives it a decisive competitive edge that enables it to safeguard its know-how in new technologies, gain crucial system expertise and leverage cost advantages.\n\n- Contracts have been concluded with various battery cell suppliers in order to safeguard the Group\u2019s electrification strategy. Volume flexibility has been written into the contracts to ensure additional latitude in the supply of battery cells.\n\n- The BMW Group has already contractually agreed with its cell manufacturers that only green electricity will be used to produce the fifth generation of battery cells. From the BMW Group\u2019s point of view, establishing the carbon footprint as an award criterion in the supply chain is a key competitive advantage in efficiently reducing carbon emissions in upstream processes.\n\n- The BMW Group is boosting efficiency and cutting costs by switching to lower-carbon processes and technologies in its own production facilities.\n\n- By generating its own electricity from renewable sources, the BMW Group is reducing not only its carbon footprint, but also its dependence on external sources.\n\n- The BMW Group is adapting to the expected consequences of climate change by conducting an assessment and deriving measures required to mitigate the physical risks for BMW-relevant assets (e.g. properties, suppliers, logistics).\n\n**Significant risks**\n\n- As climate change progresses, natural disasters are likely to occur on an increasing scale and impact the BMW Group in a variety of ways, with a negative influence on economic growth in the affected regions, among other factors. Any ensuing drop in consumer purchasing power due to a loss of income and the threat of unemployment would, in turn, have a negative earnings impact for the BMW Group.\n\n- The short-term introduction of more stringent legislation and regulations in the BMW Group\u2019s main markets (EU, USA, China), particularly regarding carbon emissions regulations, could have an effect on the Group\u2019s range of products and services.\n\n- The scale of acute and chronic physical risks (e.g. floods, storms, droughts) to BMW-relevant assets (e.g. properties, suppliers, logistics) could rise.\n\n- There could be a greater risk of interruptions in the supply chain or the inability of individual suppliers to deliver, particularly due to breaches of sustainability or quality standards and the danger of natural disasters.\n\n- The risk of bottlenecks in the availability of raw materials, particularly those required to manufacture battery cells could increase. Moreover, if commodity price risks materialise, they could have an impact on earnings.\n\n- The rising price required to be paid for CO\u2082 emissions in energy-intensive supply chains could result in higher purchasing prices.\n\n- More stringent regulatory requirements for issuers could make the BMW Group less attractive as a sustainable investment.\nB. The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the Group's business activities and its strategic and financial corporate planning\n\nThe necessity to contain climate change has a major impact on both short- and long-term decision-making at the BMW Group. In the year under report, the BMW Group assessed its carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of its vehicles, using the internationally recognised method devised by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI). Decarbonisation targets for the supply chain, production and use phase of its vehicles were developed for the period up to 2030, approved by the Board of Management and registered with the SBTI. From the BMW Group\u2019s perspective, these science-based decarbonisation targets are intended to provide a clearly defined pathway to sustainable growth.\n\nC. Resilience of the BMW Group\u2019s strategy\n\nThe BMW Group conducts stress tests using qualitative and quantitative sensitivity analyses. Product planning, sales volumes and R&D investments all take the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement into account.\n\nA. Group processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks\n\nRisk management is organised as a decentralised, Group-wide network and controlled via a centralised risk management function. Every BMW Group divisional area of responsibility is represented by Network Representatives. Any significant risks reported from within the network, including sustainability- and climate-related risks, are presented for review to the Risk Management Steering Committee, which is chaired by Group Controlling. After review, any risks regarded as significant are reported to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit Committee. In addition, topics that represent opportunities or risks for the BMW Group\u2019s business in the long term are identified by means of an environmental radar that continuously monitors external changes.\n\nApart from reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation), the topic of adaptation (adjustment to the consequences of climate change) was also addressed in line with Group strategy. As part of the strategy project set up for this purpose, key links in the BMW Group\u2019s value chain were singled out (e.g. properties, suppliers, logistics, products) for which the consequences of climate change are likely to be particularly relevant and for which adaptation measures will need to be taken in order to mitigate medium-term climatic changes.\n\nVarious annual time slices as well as climate scenarios are used to determine the risks. Based on the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), three scenarios were defined in order to present and assess climate change-related risks. A low-emission scenario takes a <2\u00b0C pathway into account. Accordingly, all countries worldwide agree to combat climate change and implement rigorous climate protection policies. On the one hand, this scenario means greater transition-related risks for the BMW Group, for example due to stricter carbon emissions regulations in its main markets, but on the other hand it limits physical risks. The second climate scenario chosen by the BMW Group outlines a \u201cmedium\u201d emissions scenario in which moderate emissions levels are assumed. Limited climate protection will lead to a medium level of transitional and physical risk. Another scenario portrays how the world will look if little or nothing is undertaken to protect the climate. This scenario would mean the highest level of emissions and therefore the highest level of physical risk.\n\nB. Group processes for managing climate-related risks\n\nThe efficient management of opportunities and risks is key to responding appropriately to changes that occur in political, economic, technical or legal conditions. The BMW Group has put a comprehensive risk management system in place to manage these risks in a structured manner as they arise. The aim of the risk management system is to identify, assess and actively manage any risks that could threaten the attainment of the Group\u2019s corporate targets. Within that process, any individual and cumulative risks that pose a threat to the BMW Group\u2019s success are monitored and managed. As part of its \u201cAdaptation to Climate Change\u201d project, the BMW Group is discussing the integration of sustainability and, above all, climate-related risks in Group-wide risk management processes.\n\nRisks are classified both according to their potential impact on earnings (worst-case scenario) and according to the risk amount (average earnings impact, taking into account the probability of occurrence).\n\nAs part of the existing natural hazard assessment process for properties and suppliers, current climate change-related hazards are also taken into account and assessed accordingly. The consideration of future medium-term physical risks is being investigated within the context of a current strategy project.\n\nC. Integrating processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks within the Group\u2019s general risk management system\n\nAlongside comprehensive risk management, sustainability constitutes a core strategic principle of the BMW Group. Risks resulting from sustainability aspects that could have an impact on the BMW Group are generally identified via the Group-wide risk management network. When analysing sustainability-related opportunities and risks, the physical risks associated with climate change (e.g. disruption of supply chains due to natural hazards) and transition-related risks (such as the ability to meet emissions requirements) are also assessed.\n### Key Sustainability Indicators and Targets\n\n**A. Key sustainability indicators the Group uses to assess climate-related risks and opportunities**\n\nThe BMW Group Report provides an overview of key sustainability indicators that the BMW Group uses to measure, monitor and manage its sustainability targets. The key sustainability indicators here are carbon emissions per vehicle produced and carbon emissions (g CO\u2082/km) generated by the new vehicle fleet (EU including Norway and Iceland).\n\n**B. Disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions**\n\nThe BMW Group discloses its Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions within the framework of its carbon footprint reporting process.\n\n**C. Targets according to which the Group addresses climate-related opportunities and risks**\n\nThe BMW Group has set itself the following carbon reduction targets per vehicle produced throughout their life cycle for 2030 (base year 2019): \u2013 20% supply chain; \u2013 80% production; \u2013 40% use phase.\n\n---\n\n**Reference to chapters in the BMW Group Report 2020 and the CDP questionnaire for

Financial Statements).\n2 In addition, prior year figures were adjusted due to changes in the presentation of selected items that are of minor importance overall.\n3 Excluding Husqvarna, deliveries up to 2013: 59,776 units; production up to 2013: 59,426 units.\n4 Since the reporting year 2020, a new definition for workforce size has been applied (see Glossary). To enable better comparability, the value for 2019 was adjusted accordingly (2019 before adjustment: 133,778 employees).\n5 Proposal by management.\nFINANCIAL CALENDAR\n\n2021\n\n17 March 2021\nBMW
