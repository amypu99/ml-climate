I also wish to applaud the courage and dedication of medical professionals and other essential workers who have put their own lives at risk to be of service to others.\n\nWe at Hitachi are committed to prioritizing the health and safety of all our stakeholders, including our customers, partners, and employees and their families. Our operations have been sustained by employees who are encouraged to work from home whenever possible to prevent the spread of infection. We are now seeking ways to adapt to the \"new normal\" by transitioning to shifts based on remote work for a wide range of job categories and promoting workstyles that are aligned with employees' type of work and role. One unique initiative to promote employee communication has been an experiment enabling closer online contact using an application that measures happiness levels. Our support measures for COVID-19 to date include provision of free medical equipment and supplies, donations by executives and employees, loans through nonprofit organizations, and support for infectious diseases research. Hitachi will continue to direct its resources to tackling the global challenge of COVID-19.\n\nThe 2021 Mid-term Management Plan announced in fiscal 2019 outlines Hitachi's strategy for achieving a sustainable world as a global leader in the Social Innovation Business through improvements in social, environmental, and economic value as well as contributions to people's quality of life and enhanced customer value. COVID-19 has highlighted the challenges confronting society and Hitachi, but the goals we have set out in the management plan remain unchanged. As employees shift increasingly to remote work and the digitalization of our economy accelerates through contactless technologies and automated production, we will contribute to addressing society's challenges through our Social Innovation Business.\n\nOur most prized source of problem-solving prowess is the mindset of our employees. This was the impetus for holding a \u201cMake a Difference!\u201d idea contest, where employees were challenged to devise new ways of responding to the crisis caused by COVID-19 and thereby deepen their awareness of their links with society and its values. Some of the proposals have already been implemented, and others will follow. In advancing our business in these uncertain times, we will actively engage with our employees, highlighting the importance of the social, environmental, and economic value central to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As digitalization progresses, people are increasingly seeking out \u201csharing\u201d rather than \u201cownership,\u201d leading to a new set of values built on a sharing economy. In such a society, it becomes all the more important to have a deep understanding of other people. Enhancing our resilience, then, will require each and every employee to relate to society\u2019s issues as their own, consider the needs and feelings of others, and vigorously spearhead changes in advancing the Social Innovation Business.\n\nOf the many challenges confronting society, addressing climate change and other environmental issues is Hitachi\u2019s top priority. As the first step toward becoming a leader in creating environmental value and spearheading a decarbonized society, we announced our commitment this year to achieve carbon neutrality at Hitachi Group business sites by fiscal 2030. The knowhow we accumulate will also be offered as solutions to our customers in advancing our activities toward this goal.\n\nOver the past 110 years since its founding, Hitachi has grown by addressing the challenges confronting society. We will continue to offer solutions to such challenges through close dialogue with our stakeholders.\n\nToshiaki Higashihara\nPresident & CEO\nHitachi, Ltd.\nExecutive Officer\u2019s Message\n\nLeading the Transformation Toward Sustainable Lifestyles\n\nThe many social issues that the coronavirus pandemic has brought to the fore have prompted us to rethink the ways Hitachi should help meet those challenges. We have given renewed thought to how we can be of benefit to society and what we must do to fulfill our mission. We need to do more than simply adapt to the \u201cnew normal\u201d of living with COVID-19 but accelerate a shift to employment policies that enable our valuable human capital to achieve their full potential, such as through telecommuting and skills-based hiring, as well as by embracing diversity and inclusion. Our efforts to achieve a human-friendly Society 5.0*1 and to lead the transformation toward more sustainable lifestyles will be focused on our Social Innovation Business, aimed at enhancing social, environmental, and economic value.\n\nWe have implemented three major sustainability-related initiatives during fiscal 2019 through the first half of fiscal 2020.\n\nThe first was to step up our efforts to disclose non-financial information, holding our first ESG Briefing in fiscal 2019. After President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara gave an overview of the course Hitachi is taking in his opening remarks, an independent director and executive officers provided details regarding our governance measures, strategy for human capital, and environmental initiatives. We will be upgrading both the quality and quantity of our ESG disclosures going forward as well as continually strengthening our initiatives in these areas.\n\nThe second was in the area of climate change. Until now our efforts have focused on achieving our long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050, which includes a CO2 reduction target of 80% throughout the value chain by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010). To move more vigorously toward these goals, we introduced an internal carbon pricing system in fiscal 2019 and announced our aim of attaining carbon neutrality for in-house manufacturing by fiscal 2030. To move more vigorously toward these goals, we introduced an internal carbon pricing system in fiscal 2019 and announced our aim of attaining carbon neutrality for in-house manufacturing by fiscal 2030. We are working with our customers, partners, and other stakeholders to achieve a decarbonized society.\n\nOur third initiative has been to promote the visualization of social and environmental value. To help build a sustainable society through our Social Innovation Business, our 2021 Mid-term Management Plan calls for the enhancement of social, environmental, and economic value for our customers through solutions in five sectors, namely, IT, energy, industry, mobility, and smart life. In fiscal 2019, we reexamined our businesses to identify how they could best help achieve the SDGs. Through quantification and other means, we tried as much as possible to visualize the social and environmental value each business was generating. We also focused our efforts on ascertaining our businesses\u2019 social and environmental impact, both positive and negative. This information will allow us to offer solutions that are more sustainable and to provide even greater social, environmental, and economic value for our customers.\n\nThe 2030 timeline for achieving the SDGs is only a decade away. As the officer responsible for sustainability and government & external relations, I remain keenly aware of the importance of multi-stakeholder capitalism,*2 working closely with the governments of many countries and actively promoting dialogue with stakeholders in the social sector to achieve our goal of a decarbonized, digital society.\n\nAdhering to our foundational Corporate Credo of contributing to society through the development of superior, original technologies and products, our 300,000 employees around the world will continue striving to build a sustainable and human-centered world as envisioned by Society 5.0.\n\n*1 Society 5.0: A proposal for a new super-smart, human-centric society from the Japanese government. It aims to achieve both economic development and the resolution of social issues through the closer integration of cyberspace (virtual reality) and the physical universe. The moniker denotes the next stage in human evolution from the hunter-gatherer (Society 1.0), agrarian (Society 2.0), industrial (Society 3.0), and information (Society 4.0) societies.\n\n*2 Multi-stakeholder capitalism: A concept aimed at achieving sustainable growth with the interests of many different stakeholders in mind, rather than focusing on shareholder profits.\n\nHitoshi Ito\nVice President and Executive Officer\nHitachi, Ltd.\nHitachi Group Identity\n\nHitachi\u2019s Mission is to contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products. This Mission has been carefully passed on to generations of employees and stakeholders throughout our 110-year history. Our Values reflect the Hitachi Founding Spirit of Harmony, Sincerity and Pioneering Spirit, which was shaped by the achievements of our predecessors in the company as they worked hard to fulfill the Mission. Our Vision was created based on our Mission and Values. It is an expression of what Hitachi Group aims to become in the future as it advances in its next stage of growth. Our Mission, Values and Vision combine to form the Hitachi Group Identity.\n\nBased on the Hitachi Group Identity, and continuously considering the next generation, we promote corporate activities with a view to the medium and long term informed by sensitivity to the needs of a changing society. The Mid-term Management Plan is our action plan to realize the Hitachi Group Vision; by integrating our management and sustainability strategies, we seek to enhance the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nThe implementation of the plan is a way for us to fulfill our responsibilities as a good corporate citizen through robust, diverse governance; the Pioneering Spirit and strong ethical stance of our employees; and operations that help address social issues. We operate and pursue our activities in line with the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, the guidelines for ethical behavior and decision-making shared by all executives and employees of the Hitachi Group.\n\nHitachi promotes brand education through training tools and courses based on the idea that social issues can be solved if each and every one of its employees understands and embodies the Hitachi Group Identity.\n\nOne way we promote understanding of and familiarity with the Hitachi Group Identity and the Hitachi Brand is through the annual Inspiration of the Year Global Award, which recognize remarkable activities that contribute to enhancing the value of the Hitachi Brand by demonstrating the Hitachi Group Identity. In fiscal 2019, the award saw 211 applications from Hitachi Group employees around the world. Projects that represented the practice of the Hitachi Group Identity and contributed to a sustainable society by increasing social, environmental, and economic value were selected from various regions for the Grand Prix, including \u201cMaking the Sea Beautiful Again! Water Infrastructure Business in Papua New Guinea\u201d and \u201cUsing AI in Providing Smart Building Solutions in Singapore.\u201d The Grand Prix-winning projects were recognized at the Global Awards Ceremony and shared with all employees through our intranet.\n\n\u201cHitachi Group Identity Movie\u2014I am Hitachi,\u201d a movie featuring the Grand Prix-winning projects, was unveiled on our website, allowing a wide range of people inside and outside the Group to see how Hitachi Group employees around the world are endeavoring to improve people\u2019s quality of life every day while holding the Hitachi Group Identity close to their heart.\nHitachi practices sustainable management, placing sustainability at the center of our business strategy and\u2014in our 2021 Mid-term Management Plan ending in fiscal 2021\u2014setting ourselves the goal of contributing to the realization of a sustainable world as a global leader of Social Innovation Business. To that end, our 2021 Mid-term Management Plan identifies five sectors where we can increase social, environmental, and economic value simultaneously as well as enhance our customers\u2019 corporate value and people\u2019s quality of life: IT, energy, industry, mobility, and smart life. Additionally, in order to increase the three kinds of value simultaneously, we will expand our Social Innovation Business through collaborative creation with our partners around the world by providing Lumada, a solution that accelerates digital innovation, as a cyber-physical system allowing the cyber and physical spaces to interact.\n\nWe continue to pursue the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, further merging sustainability and business to contribute to the resolution of social issues through initiatives like Society 5.0 and Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n### Solutions Contributing to Enhanced Social/Environmental Value in Five Sectors\n\n| Sector | Social/Environmental Value Being Created | Relevant SDGs |\n|--------|----------------------------------------|---------------|\n| IT     | Contributing to India\u2019s economic development by expanding payment services to over 400 million people | 11 |\n| Energy | Managing 25% of the world\u2019s substations and providing stable energy to around 1.8 billion people | 7 |\n| Industry | Providing a safe and secure water environment to 70 million users per day by providing water supply and sewerage systems | 6, 11 |\n| Mobility | Providing railway services that are safe, secure, pleasant, and environmentally conscious to 18.5 billion passengers per year | 11 |\n| Smart Life | Contributing to improvements in people\u2019s quality of life by performing 20 billion blood tests and other diagnostic tests per year | 3, 11 |\nHitachi, Ltd.\u2019s Executive Sustainability Committee comprises President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara and other members of the Senior Executive Committee, along with the CEOs of every business unit. The committee discusses and reaches decisions on important policies and measures related to sustainability, shares progress and results, and finds ways to connect these to further improvements and new initiatives.\n\nSustainability Promotion Meetings attended by sustainability strategy promotion officers from business units (business promotion division head-class), also established under the committee, formulate long-term corporate strategies focusing on ESG (environmental, social, and governance) to promote specific measures for advancing sustainability, including contribution to achieving the SDGs.\n\nTo review and discuss CSR initiatives, CSR Manager Meetings are regularly held by CSR and social contribution officers from business units and Group companies. Global and Regional CSR Meetings for the Americas, Europe, China, Southeast Asia, India, and Australia are also held regularly.\n\nTo discuss and implement specific measures to achieve long-term environmental targets, Eco-Management Meetings, whose members are environmental promotion officers from business units and Group companies, work together with Sustainability Promotion Meetings. Global and Regional Environmental Meetings are also held regularly, allowing environmental initiative officers from regional headquarters outside Japan to share common directions and promote environmental initiatives.\n\nAdditionally, the Sustainability Promotion Division holds regular dialogue with stakeholders in each region in cooperation with regional headquarters. Through such dialogue, we endeavor to grasp global social issues promptly, extensively, and deeply, incorporating them into the issues our management deals with. At the same time, this dialogue lets us safeguard our corporate responsibility in a global society and make continued efforts to improve as we strive to achieve sustainable management and a sustainable society.\n\nWe have adopted a committee system to separate the responsibilities for management oversight from the execution of business operations. Under this system, the Audit Committee conducts an audit of sustainability-related operations once a year. Reports on sustainability-related material issues are made to the committee by Hitachi executive officers.\nExecutive Sustainability Committee Meetings\nHitachi\u2019s Executive Sustainability Committee meets twice a year to discuss and reach decisions on important policies and measures related to sustainability, share progress and results, and find ways to connect these to further improvements and new initiatives.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, the Executive Sustainability Committee held meetings in April and December. At the April meeting, in preparation for the May launch of the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, the committee confirmed that creating social, environmental, and economic value as part of our management strategy would be pursued, and, alongside quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the social and environmental value to be created by each business, considered specific initiatives toward increasing environmental value.\n\nAt the December meeting, in order to create social, environmental, and economic value, the committee considered and made decisions on visualization and evaluation methods for social and environmental impacts as well as important policies and measures related to the environment, including our response to climate change.\n\nSetting Key ESG-Related KPIs\nAs part of promoting sustainability, we have established KPIs for key ESG challenges, and promote activities to help achieve them.\n\nIn May 2020, we unveiled a new KPI: to achieve carbon neutrality in our places of business (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030.\n\nESG Briefing\nIn September 2019, we held our first ESG Briefing at which we explained our environmental strategy, human capital strategy, and governance initiatives to institutional investors, analysts, and the media. At the beginning of the briefing, President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara explained the improvement in social, environmental, and economic value called for by the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan and clarified the direction of the entire company. Environmental and human capital strategy were explained by the executive officers responsible for these areas, while governance was explained by an independent director.\n\n| Key ESG-Related KPIs |\n|----------------------|\n| **KPI** | **Result in FY 2019** | **Target** | **Page** |\n| Products and services | | | |\n| Reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit (base: FY 2010) | 19% | FY 2021 20% or higher | P. 25 |\n| | | FY 2030 50% | |\n| | | FY 2050 80% | |\n| Business sites (factories and offices) | | | |\n| Reduction rate of total CO2 emissions (base: FY 2010) | 17% | FY 2021 20% or higher | P. 25 |\n| | | FY 2030 100% (carbon neutral) | |\n| | | FY 2050 (Maintain 100%) | |\n| Reduction rate of water use per unit in Hitachi Group (base: FY 2010) | 26% | FY 2021 26% or higher | P. 25 |\n| | | FY 2050 50% | |\n| Reduction rate of waste and valuables generation per unit in Hitachi Group (base: FY 2010) | 14% | FY 2021 12% or higher | P. 25 |\n| | | FY 2050 50% | |\n| Digital talent | 30,000 | FY 2021 37,000 | P. 81 |\n| Data scientists | Approx.1,000 | FY 2021 3,000 | P. 81 |\n| Top-class AI talent | 306 | FY 2021 350 | P. 72 |\n| Ratio of female executive and corporate officers | 5.0% | FY 2020 10% | P. 84 |\n| Ratio of non-Japanese executive and corporate officers | 8.8% | FY 2020 10% | P. 84 |\n| Number of female managers in Japan | 700 | FY 2020 (twice the number at the end of fiscal 2012) | P. 84 |\nContribution to the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)\n\nThe SDGs and Hitachi\u2019s Social Innovation Business\n\nWe consider the SDGs an important initiative for realizing a sustainable society and improving people\u2019s quality of life through solving global social and environmental issues. We have significantly contributed to achieving the SDGs through our Social Innovation Business, which also serves as a source of sustainable growth for us.\n\nAccordingly, through the provision of innovative solutions and products in our Social Innovation Business, we will strive to create social, environmental, and economic value as part of our management strategy. We will also strive to reduce negative social and environmental impacts resulting from our business and seek a deeper understanding of business risks arising from social and environmental changes to ensure greater robustness against them.\n\nHitachi\u2019s Priority SDG Issues\n\nAt the Executive Sustainability Committee meetings chaired by President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara, the committee members considered the 17 SDGs and the opportunities and risks they represented. After this, they identified 5 Goals where we can make a particularly significant impact through our key businesses, and 6 Goals that we can contribute to through our entire corporate activities. We view the latter 6 Goals as relevant to our entire business and management strategies, making an impact on corporate sustainability.\n\nBecause we are active in a broad range of business fields, we believe we can contribute extensively to the achievement of the SDGs other than the 11 Goals identified. Understanding that all SDGs are mutually related, we will endeavor to contribute to the achievement of all 17 SDGs both directly and indirectly.\nRoad Map for Achieving the SDGs\n\nDeveloping a sustainable society as defined by the SDGs will lead to sustainable growth for Hitachi, too. We believe that we are providing value not only to the companies and consumers that are our direct customers but also to society more broadly. This is the essence of our Social Innovation Business. The products and services that we provide are all closely linked to social sustainability. We aim to be a global leader in sustainability through our efforts to help achieve the SDGs.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we launched an initiative exploring ways to build a framework for assessing social and environmental impacts brought about by business activities, in order to make our efforts to create social and environmental value closely linked to the SDGs more appealing to our customers and society in a concrete manner\u2014one of the goals included in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan. Using key businesses outlined in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan as examples, we have developed an impact evaluation methodology for social and environmental value that can be used across the entire Group, and are now working to establish an impact evaluation framework. To determine the guidelines for the methodology, a series of discussions were held at meetings of the working group made up of staff from corporate divisions of the Hitachi Group. The guidelines also reflect feedback through exchanges of opinions with stakeholders in Europe and other regions that lead in impact evaluation initiatives, as well as discussions with business units and Group companies. Each business unit used the guidelines to assess the impacts of the social and environmental value created through business activities and develop business plans for fiscal 2020 based on the impacts. Going forward, we will further improve the guidelines so that they can also be used for exploring new business possibilities and evaluating the impact of existing businesses. This approach will enable us to grasp the positive and negative social and environmental impacts of our business activities and offer more sustainable businesses to our customers. In this way, we will realize the three kinds of value outlined in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\n- Increase understanding through sustainability messages from the CEO, symposiums, workshops, newsletters, etc.\n- Work with planning divisions and other relevant departments at business units and key Group companies to clarify how their businesses are linked to the SDGs in terms of business opportunities and risks.\n- Incorporate the vision of Hitachi\u2019s future business and growth originating from achieving the SDGs and sustainability (solving social issues) in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan business strategy, based on the knowledge that realizing a sustainable society will make sustainable growth possible for Hitachi.\n- Promote management focusing on social, environmental, and economic value.\n- Explore building a framework for assessing the impact of non-financial value created by the five focus sectors set out in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan.\n- Expand application to consideration of new businesses and impact evaluation for existing businesses.\n- Promote establishment of a collaborative system with sales divisions to enhance sustainability.\n\nThe measures will be taken in collaboration with business units, major Group companies, corporate-related departments, and global sites (regional strategies).\nIdentifying Social Impacts with Respect to Goals to Contribute to Through Business Activities\n\nIn fiscal 2019 Hitachi urged business units and Group companies to promote visualization of social and environmental impacts in order to create the social, environmental, and economic value called for in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan.\n\nSpecifically, after choosing their key businesses, each business unit and Group company selected the relevant items from the \u201cList of Social and Environmental Impacts,\u201d and sorted them by positive and negative. They then identified the stakeholders involved in each impact, and summarized them in a logic model.\n\nThis helped to visualize what kind of impacts Hitachi and its customers have on society, enabling them to maximize positive impacts while minimizing negative impacts.\n\nIn fiscal 2020 we are promoting efforts to create social and environmental value by expanding the application of qualitative and quantitative assessment of impacts visualized using these logic models.\n\n### Identifying Social Impacts: One Example (Cashless Payment Services in Developing Countries Such as India)\n\n| Contributing to the achievement of SDGs | 1.4: \u201cBy 2030 ensure that all men and women, particularly the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership, and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology, and financial services including microfinance\u201d |\n|---|---|\n| To Society Impact on society | Providing cashless payment services in developing countries  \n- Providing cashless payment services for developing countries in Asia.  \nIndia: Providing payment services via ATMs and POS. By providing payment services at 41,000 ATM machines, 16,000 CRM machines, and 1.1 million POS terminals, we contribute to the economic development of 1.3 billion people. |\n| To Customers Impact on stakeholders, such as customers of customers | Improving citizens\u2019 QoL (quality of life) by diversifying financial service infrastructure  \n- By expanding cashless payments, we reduce crime (e.g., theft, purse snatching, robberies), which is a social problem especially in developing countries.  \n- By expanding payment infrastructure and providing day-to-day digital payments, we promote more agility and efficiency in economic activity to improve citizens\u2019 QoL. |\n| To Business Impact on direct customers | Creating new businesses by combining data with payments  \n- By combining data about the flow of money in payments and flow of goods in sales channels, we can create new businesses by analyzing the value-chain data connecting individuals to banks. This strengthens existing businesses as a value-added service. |\n\n| Name of key business | Business overview |\n|---|---|\n| Cashless payment services in developing countries such as India | India: ATM and POS payment services. Acquiring business and data linkage business via JV with large national bank SBI. |\nEngagement and Initiatives\n\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nHitachi's Approach to Engagement\n\nHitachi promotes its Social Innovation Business with efforts to perceive the social issues in each country or region, followed by collaborative creation with customers, national and local governments, academic and research institutes, and other stakeholders to resolve them. We strive to enhance the value of human capital\u2014indispensable management resources for conducting business\u2014and place importance on direct dialogue between employees and senior management. Partly in recognition of the growing interest in ESG investment, we are also active in dialogue with shareholders and investors.\n\n| Stakeholders | Main Roles | Main Divisions | Means of

Public interest is growing in how corporations are taking in stakeholders\u2019 voices to improve their businesses, and we will continue to globally develop and promote ways of capitalizing on the opinions of the members of society with whom we engage in our business activities.\n\nStakeholder Dialogues\n\nHitachi organizes stakeholder dialogues in countries and regions around the world to invite opinions on social challenges from stakeholders representing specialized knowledge platforms and ensure that their insights are reflected in the business activities conducted at each of Hitachi\u2019s global businesses and business units.\n\n| Theme                                      | Venue            | BU/Group company |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Measuring impacts of the Social Innovation Business | Brussels, Belgium | Hitachi Europe   |\n| IoT 4SDGs: What Can the Digital Transformation and IoT Achieve for Agenda 2030? | Brussels, Belgium | Hitachi Corporate Office, Europe |\n| Role of business in furthering the SDGs agenda of India: e-Education and Urban Transportation | New Delhi, India | Hitachi India    |\nMain Initiatives and Groups in Which Hitachi Is Involved\n\nBased on its Corporate Credo, which is to \u201ccontribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products,\u201d Hitachi has advanced its Social Innovation Business in order to help realize a sustainable society.

In concrete terms, we participate in international standardization activities in fields such as, in the environmental field, supporting the environmentally friendly design of electrical, electronic, and information communications systems (IEC TC 111, ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 39, ITU-T SG5 WP2); in the clean energy field, smart energy (IEC SyC Smart Energy) and power storage systems (IEC TC 120); in manufacturing and technology, smart manufacturing (ISO/IEC JWG 21, IEC SyC SM) and electronics assembly (IEC TC 91); and, in health and safety, water and sewage services (ISO TC 224) and biotechnology (ISO TC 276). Additionally, by contributing to international standardization efforts by consortia and other bodies, and providing solutions consistent with international standards, we support the development of sound global markets and facilitate innovation to resolve social issues.\n\nStructure for Promoting International Standardization Activities\n\nAs part of its efforts toward international standardization activities, Hitachi commits employees to serve in key positions such as technical committee chairperson and secretary at international standardization organizations like the IEC and ISO. Additionally, the Hitachi Group Standardization Committee was established to coordinate the efforts of all Hitachi Group companies toward international standardization. The Steering Committee*1 of this body determines priority themes and promotes standardization activities by establishing working groups for each theme.\n\n*1 Steering Committee: Headed by the executive officer overseeing R&D, this entity includes chief technology officers of Hitachi business units and key Group companies. The committee is responsible for decisions on cross-departmental and companywide standardization projects.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we selected Society 5.0 as one priority theme. In concert with our global stakeholders, we actively participated in international standardization activities which will contribute to Society 5.0\u2019s realization.\n\nExternal Assessment of Hitachi's International Standardization Activities\n\nHitachi\u2019s international standardization work is well regarded. In fiscal 2019, we were honored by such bodies as the IEC, the IEC Activities Promotion Committee of Japan, the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), and the Telecommunication Technology Committee (TTC).\nMain Groups in Which Hitachi Participates\n\nHitachi\u2019s Social Innovation Business is particularly intertwined with the public interest. As part of developing that business on a global scale, we view government institutions and related organizations in Japan and other countries around the world as important partners, both as customers and supporters. Our Government & External Relations Group leads our efforts to strengthen ties with these bodies. The Group also works with the Hitachi Corporate Office in Washington DC; the Hitachi Corporate Office, Europe; and other business locations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region and Japan. Dealing with governments and organizations as a unified Group lets us not only seek mutual benefit with local communities but also explore new business opportunities for Hitachi within each country\u2019s unique social issues and policies.\n\nIn Japan, we are increasingly asked for proposals by the Japanese government. By making requests directly as well as proposing solutions through economic organizations and industrial bodies, we help build a better society.\n\nParticipation in Government Councils by Hitachi Executives\n\n| Council | Participant | Activities |\n|---------|-------------|------------|\n| Council on Investments for the Future (Cabinet Secretariat) | Executive Chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi as a private sector expert | \u2022 Making proposals in areas including the use of data, open innovation, and development of human capital to realize \u201cSociety 5.0,\u201d Japan\u2019s growth strategy |\n| Committee for the Formulation of New Strategies Related to Deploying Infrastructure Outside Japan (Cabinet Secretariat) | President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara as a private sector member | \u2022 Making proposals on new infrastructure development measures that assume business models using digital technologies and co-creation with local partners |\n| Industrial Structure Council/Trade Committees (METI) | President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara as a council committee member | \u2022 Making proposals on using data to realize a human-centric society, as envisaged for Society 5.0, from the commerce and trade perspective |\n\nParticipation in Business and Industry Associations\n\n| Group | Participant | Activities |\n|-------|-------------|------------|\n| Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) | Executive Chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi as chair | \u2022 Making policy recommendations for achieving the SDGs through realizing Society 5.0 under the theme of \u201cSociety 5.0 for SDGs\u201d \u2022 Promoting Japan-led value-creating digital transformation (DX) with close collaboration among industry, government, and academia around the world to formulate systems and rules |\n| Communications and Information Network Association of Japan (CIAJ) | President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara as a senior steering committee member | \u2022 Promoting information and communication technology solutions that could contribute to resolving a range of social issues by exchanging views and opinions with relevant ministries and agencies |\n| Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) | President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara as vice chair | \u2022 Examining and making proposals on promotion of digital technology and data use and market creation under the mission to achieve Society 5.0 \u2022 Offering insights into paradigms of international legislation, agreements, and standards to develop digital trade and strengthen international competitiveness |\n| Japan Electrical Manufacturers\u2019 Association (JEMA) | President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara as vice chair | \u2022 Promoting the sustainable development of electrical manufacturing by submitting opinions on various governmental and administrative policies and promoting product safety awareness, international standardization and compatibility evaluation, statistical research work, and the development of human capital for STEM fields |\n| Japan-US Business Council | Executive Chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi as an Executive Committee member | \u2022 Exchanging opinions and proposing policies regarding various issues in Japan-US economic relations from the point of view of the entire Japan-US economic world |\n| National Association of Manufacturers | Hitachi Corporate Office in Washington DC | \u2022 Lobbying and making policy proposals, as the largest association of manufacturers in the United States, to support the international competitiveness of member corporations |\n| Japan Business Council in Europe (JBCE) | Hitachi Corporate Office, Europe as CSR Committee chair | \u2022 Making policy proposals to contribute to the further development of EU\u2013Japan relations and the EU economy, as the body representing Japanese corporations in the EU |\nHitachi actively pursues a range of activities aimed at developing a more sustainable society.

In response to the 2015 adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in September 2016 we established our Environmental Vision and long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050. In order to achieve these long-term targets, we drew up our Environmental Action Plan, a set of short-term targets that are updated every three years. Implementation of the Environmental Action Plan for 2021, covering fiscal 2019\u20132021 and formulated in line with the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, is currently underway, and we are steadily accumulating achievements as we work to meet the detailed KPIs that the plan includes.\n\nOur environmental strategy, centered on the Environmental Vision and our long-term environmental targets, is deliberated over by the Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the president and CEO, and advanced by the Hitachi Group as a whole.\n\nEnvironmental Vision\n\nHitachi will resolve environmental issues and achieve both a higher quality of life and a sustainable society through its Social Innovation Business in collaborative creation with its stakeholders. We also aim to achieve a decarbonized society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature\u2014the components of a sustainable society\u2014in accordance with this Vision.\n\nLong-Term Environmental Targets: Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050\n\nFor a decarbonized society\n\nCO2 emissions per unit through the value chain\n80% reduction by fiscal 2050, 50% reduction by fiscal 2030 (compared to fiscal 2010)\nAchieve carbon neutrality by fiscal 2050 at business sites (factories and offices)\n\nFor a resource efficient society\n\nBuild a society that uses water and other resources efficiently with customers and society\n50% improvement of efficiency in use of water/resources by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010 in the Hitachi Group)\n\nFor a harmonized society with nature\n\nMinimize impact on natural capital\n\nProgress in Reaching Long-Term Environmental Targets\n\nThe quantitative targets of the Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 are specified in the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 (covering fiscal 2019\u20132021). Progress toward major targets is being made, as shown in the table below, and we are generally on track. We will continue increasing our efforts to achieve these long-term targets.\n\n| Goals | Activities |\n|-------|------------|\n| Fiscal 2019 result | Fiscal 2021 target | Fiscal 2030 target | Fiscal 2050 target |\n| Reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit from use of products and services (base: FY 2010) | 19% | 20% or higher | 50% | 80% |\n| Reduction rate of total CO2 emissions (base: FY 2010) | 17% | 20% or higher | 100% (carbon neutral) | (Maintain 100%) |\n\nNote: The reduction rate of total CO2 emissions is an indicator that includes such variables as the amount of CO2 emissions reduced due to self-consumption of energy, the amount of renewable energy purchased, and the amount of reduction using non-fossil fuel energy certificates.\n\nEfforts Toward Achieving a Decarbonized Society\n\nEnhanced Efficiency in the Use of Water\n\n| Goals | Activities |\n|-------|------------|\n| Fiscal 2019 result | Fiscal 2021 target | Fiscal 2030 target | Fiscal 2050 target |\n| Reduction rate in water use per unit (base: FY 2010, Hitachi Group) | 26% | 26% or higher | - | 50% |\n\nEnhanced Efficiency in the Use of Resources\n\n| Goals | Activities |\n|-------|------------|\n| Fiscal 2019 result | Fiscal 2021 target | Fiscal 2030 target | Fiscal 2050 target |\n| Reduction rate in waste and valuables generation per unit (base: FY 2010, Hitachi Group) | 14% | 12% or higher | - | 50% |\n\nNotes: See the referenced pages for details on the figures cited.\n\n- In fiscal 2019, slowdowns in factory operations due to COVID-19 may have resulted in CO2 and other emission reductions.\nEnvironmental Action Plan\n\nTo achieve its Environmental Vision and the Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 long-term environmental targets, Hitachi draws up an Environmental Action Plan containing indicators and targets for the three-year period covered by the Mid-term Management Plan and promotes its steady implementation.\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 (Fiscal 2019\u20132021)\n\nWe are pressing forward with environmental activities based on the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 formulated in line with the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan. The table below outlines the targets for fiscal 2019\u20132021, as well as the results for fiscal 2019. GREEN 21 is used as a system for evaluating and managing the achievement made over the three years for each goal.\n\n| Item | Indicators | Fiscal 2019 targets | Fiscal 2019 results (achievement level) | Fiscal 2020 targets | Final fiscal year (2021) targets |\n|------|------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Promote environmental human capital development | Environmental human capital development of the Hitachi Group | 20% | 26% | 50% | 80% |\n| Enhance global environmental management | Implementation rate of voluntary environmental audits (number of implementing sites/number of sites outside Japan) | 20% | 26% | 50% | 80% |\n| Reduce CO2 emissions of products and services | Reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit (base: FY 2010) | 19% | 19% | 20% | 21% |\n| Address climate change risks and opportunities | Identification and review of risks and opportunities | | | | |\n| Reduce CO2 emissions of business sites (factories and offices) | Reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit (base: FY 2010) | 7% | 5% | 8% | 9% |\n| Reduce CO2 emissions from transportation (shipping) | Reduction rate of transportation energy consumption per unit (Liquefied) (base: FY 2010) | 9% | 7% | 10% | 11% |\n| Water circulation doctrines and offshores | Enhance efficiency in the use of water | 23% | 26% | 24% | 26% |\n| Resource circulation doctrines and offshores | Enhance efficiency in the use of resources | 10% | 14% | 11% | 12% |\n| Chemical substances (factories and offices) | Reduction rate in chemical atmospheric emissions per unit (base: FY 2010) | 16% | 21% | 17% | 18% |\n| Ecosystem preservation | Calculation of negative impact (environmental impact assessment of business activities) | | | | |\n| Ecosystem preservation | Calculation of positive impact (forest conservation activities) | | | | |\n| Ecosystem preservation | Promotion of ecosystem preservation activities | | | | |\n\n*1 Reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit refers to reductions in CO2 emissions from just Hitachi\u2019s consumption of energy.\n*2 This is a target for Japan only. Targets in other countries are set on a voluntary basis.\nEnvironmental Action Plan Achievement\nEvaluation System: GREEN 21\n\nGREEN 21 is used as a system for evaluating and managing our achievements made over three-year periods toward the targets set in our Environmental Action Plan.\n\nGREEN 21 converts the level of achievement toward the Environmental Action Plan targets at each of the approximately 200 major manufacturing sites classified as category A into green points (GPs), then makes an evaluation on a category-by-category basis. A perfect score for any category is 100 GPs. Points are awarded for meeting the Environmental Action Plan\u2019s annual targets and, as an added incentive, for particularly ambitious activities. Representing progress in terms of GPs shows how much each site has achieved in each category, and allows sites to be compared with each other, the results of which are in turn used in the Environmental Action Plan\u2019s PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycles.\n\nThe Sustainability Promotion Division also uses the results of the GREEN 21 evaluation as a condition for awarding its Eco-Factories & Offices Select certification for business sites that promote activities demonstrating a high level of environmental consciousness and produce notable results in that area.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nFrom fiscal 2019, progress has been evaluated for individual categories (environmental management, a decarbonized society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature) newly created based on the Environmental Action Plan for 2021. The total score for all the categories was 177 GPs, exceeding the fiscal 2019 benchmark of 160 GPs. One factor behind the higher score was progress made in water risk assessment as part of our efforts to build a resource efficient society.\nTo achieve our Environmental Vision and reach our long-term environmental targets, we are enhancing environmental governance by building a global structure to support environmental decision making and implementation at Hitachi, Ltd. and consolidated subsidiaries (a total of 815 companies as of March 31, 2020).\n\nImportant items related to environmental initiatives are deliberated by the Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the president and CEO of Hitachi, Ltd., and attended by top Hitachi executives. Members meet twice a year to discuss material environment-related policies and measures, including those in response to climate change, to share progress reports and achievements, and to set the course for further improvements and new initiatives.\n\nWe have adopted a committee system to separate the responsibilities for management oversight from the execution of business operations. Under this system, the Audit Committee of independent directors conducts an audit of sustainability-related operations once a year. Reports on climate change and other environment-related material issues are made to the committee by Hitachi executive officers.\n\nTo develop ways to achieve our long-term environmental targets and reduce environmental compliance risks, the three-year Hitachi Group Environmental Action Plan is formulated in line with the Mid-term Management Plan by environmental promotion division heads from business units and major Group companies participating in Eco-Management Meetings. Targets (and measures to achieve them) in the Environmental Action Plan that affect not only our environmental strategy but also our business strategy\u2014like those to reduce the CO2 emissions of our products and services\u2014are determined jointly by the Eco-Management Meetings and Sustainability Promotion Meetings, attended by business promotion division heads. A progress report concerning important targets in the Environmental Action Plan is made to the Executive Sustainability Committee, and instructions from committee members are reflected in actual environmental activities.\n\nGroup-wide efforts to advance environmental activities are undertaken outside Japan as well. Environmental officers are assigned to China, the rest of Asia, the Americas, and Europe to share information on the state of progress of our environmental activities and on the latest environmental regulations in each country and region. Respective Regional Environmental Meetings are also held once or twice a year.\nEnvironmental Management System\n\nEnhancing Our Environmental Management System\n\nHitachi has globally applicable criteria for environmental management classification to conduct environmental management properly and efficiently in accordance with the environmental load and compliance risk levels of Group business sites, both large and small. We assign a score for each classification item, such as the amount of power consumed, the volume of waste generated, and whether or not legal restrictions apply. Each Group business site is classified into one of three categories: A, B, and C. Environmental management is then conducted based on the respective level of risk. Of our approximately 1,000 business sites, about 200 major manufacturing sites are classified as category A. These sites account for more than 90% of the Group\u2019s total environmental load.\n\nThe business units and Group companies with category A sites participate in Eco-Management Meetings to draw up the Environmental Action Plan, which is then disseminated throughout the business units and Group companies by environmental strategy officers, chosen from among the heads and general managers of those organizations. These business units and Group companies also formulate their own environmental action plans based on Hitachi Group\u2019s Environmental Action Plan and strive to achieve their targets.\n\nIn addition to adhering to the in-house environmental management system, all our global category A manufacturing sites have acquired third-party certification, such as ISO14001.\n\nCategories by Criteria for Classification of Environmental Management\n\n| Categories | Setting targets based on the Environmental Action Plan and reporting environmental load data to Hitachi, Ltd. headquarters | Reporting environmental load data to Group environmental strategy officers | Reporting violations of environmental laws and regulations to Hitachi, Ltd. headquarters and responding to the management classification survey |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Category A | \u25cb                                                                                                               | \u25cb                                                                      | \u25cb                                                                                                                                |\n| Category B | \u2013                                                                  | \u25cb                                                                      | \u25cb                                                                                                                                |\n| Category C | \u2013                                                                  | \u2013                                                                      | \u25cb                                                                                                                                |\n\nCollecting and Monitoring Environmental Load Data to Improve Environmental Practices\n\nTo conduct environmental management efficiently and effectively, we collect environmental load data using the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS). The system, which supports three languages (Japanese, English, and Chinese), monitors and registers items in about 20 categories, ranging from environmental load data on items such as energy use, water use, and waste generation, to whether an item falls under relevant environmental laws and regulations, to environmental accounting. We have also set up an international help desk to support the system\u2019s operation and promote understanding of environmental management.\n\nThe collected data is aggregated and analyzed to implement a PDCA cycle for environmental measures, such as determining environmental management classification into the categories A, B, and C; identifying environmental management issues; and sharing instructive examples within the Group. GREEN 21 uses the data registered in the system to calculate green points (GPs) for evaluating the level of target achievement. Approximately 200 manufacturing sites classified as category A aggregate and analyze data biannually on such key items as energy, water, and waste materials.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nIn fiscal 2019, data from about 1,000 business sites in 63 countries, including factories, research laboratories, and offices, was registered in the system to estimate the environmental load of the entire Hitachi Group.\nChemical Substance Management System\n\nTo collect and manage data on chemical substances in materials, parts, and products from our suppliers, Hitachi operates A Gree\u2019Net, a green procurement system compatible with the chemSHERPA*1 format, to grasp what chemical substances are used in our products\u2014from design and development, procurement, and production to quality assurance and shipping\u2014and to respond to legal and regulatory frameworks at shipping destinations.\n\nTo properly manage chemical substances used in our business operations, we have introduced a database for chemical substance management called CEGNET, which keeps track of the latest laws and regulations and our own voluntary regulations and supports searches for new substance risks. The system also collects and aggregates data on the amount of chemical substances handled, emitted, and transferred in our operations, helping to reduce the volume of chemicals that we handle and emit to the environment.\n\nApproximately 1.34 million parts and products with chemical substances are registered in A Gree\u2019Net as of March 31, 2020. This is around 200,000 less than the previous fiscal year due to a decrease in the number of Hitachi Group companies as a result of changes in our business portfolios.\n\nWe held 13 briefings on chemSHERPA tools and A Gree\u2019Net for suppliers using the system at Healthcare Kashiwa, Omika Works, Kasado Works, Shimizu Works, Mito Works, and Hitachi IE Systems between July 2019 and March 2020. The briefings were attended by 1,276 people and helped to deepen understanding of these tools and this system.\n\n*1 chemSHERPA: A shared transmission scheme throughout the supply chain to ensure proper management of chemical substances in products and continuing compliance with the ever-growing requirements of major global laws and regulations like the REACH regulation and RoHS directive.\nReducing the Environmental Burden Through \u201cEco-Factories & Offices Select\u201d Certification\n\nHitachi has implemented an \u201cEco-Factories & Offices Select\u201d certification program for business sites that promote activities demonstrating a high level of environmental consciousness and produce notable results in that area. This helps raise the environmental awareness of employees and promote environmentally conscious activities at our business sites.\n\nBased on certification criteria that were developed for our manufacturing (factory) and nonmanufacturing (office) divisions globally, we certify factories that actively engage in improvements to achieve efficient production and offices that have been environmentally designed. Superior policies from certified factories and offices are shared with the entire Group, with other locations encouraged to implement them as well. To maintain and raise the level of environmental awareness through Eco-Factories & Offices Select, certified factories and offices are re-evaluated every fiscal year, and only those that meet the evaluation requirements have their certification renewed.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, of our approximately 1,000 facilities, 6 were newly certified, 2 were recertified, and 64 had their certifications renewed. The total number of certified factories and offices was 72.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nIn fiscal 2019, of our approximately 1,000 facilities, 6 were newly certified, 2 were recertified, and 64 had their certifications renewed. The total number of certified factories and offices was 72.\n\nEnvironmental Education for Employees\n\nHitachi believes that promoting greater environmental awareness and understanding among employees is essential to efforts to energize its environmental activities. Toward that end, we offer general education using e-learning for all Group employees, from new hires to executive officers. We also provide specialized Hitachi Group training on environmental risks and compliance with environment-related laws and regulations for working-level employees in charge of environmental management and internal environmental auditors. Particularly in China, where we have more than 30 category A manufacturing sites, we provide training on compliance with the country\u2019s increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we created new e-learning materials for general education with a view to sustainability in line with the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan. These materials will be rolled out globally starting in fiscal 2020. An environmental management training program scheduled for March 2020 in China was postponed due to COVID-19.\n\nEnvironmental Education and Training System\n\n| Target | Introductory | Beginning | Intermediate | Advanced |\n|--------|--------------|-----------|--------------|----------|\n| All employees | Introductory training for new employees | Online e-learning: Eco-Mind education (General topics: Global environmental issues, environmental law, etc.) | Online e-learning: Eco-Mind education (Hitachi Group topics: Environmental policy, Environmental Action Plan, etc.) | |\n| Working-level employees | Basic environmental management course for working-level employees (management of waste, air/water quality, and hazardous materials; development and operation of management systems; etc.) | Education for Eco-Factories | Eco-Product development training | |\n| Internal environmental auditors | ISO 14001 auditor brush-up training | ISO 14001 auditor certification training | ISO 14001 senior auditor certification training | |\nEnvironmental Governance\n\nEnvironmental Education in Fiscal 2019\n\n| Contents of training | Target | Number of participants |\n|----------------------|--------|------------------------|\n| Hitachi Group training on recent amendments to laws and operational procedures as well as basic environmental management | Employees working in air, water quality, and waste management | Japan: 150 people from 33 companies, China: 68 people from 41 companies |\n| Environmental management training program to reduce environmental risks in China and raise the knowledge of working-level employees | Working-level employees | Postponed due to COVID-19 |\n\nEnvironmental Compliance\n\nIn order to better ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and region and minimize environmental risks, Hitachi sets and monitors compliance with voluntary management criteria that are more stringent than regulatory requirements. If we find a violation or receive a complaint, we take steps to enhance environmental risk management by sharing the causes and countermeasures throughout the Group and preventing a recurrence of similar incidents. As part of our measures to address the pollution of soil and groundwater, we are examining the soil and water for any contamination at business sites where hazardous chemical substances are being or were once used. If contamination is found, we will conduct cleaning and monitoring activities until decontamination is complete.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we designated 15 business sites that committed an environmental violation in the past three years as high-risk business sites. The relevant business units and Group companies began providing guidance to these sites to strengthen compliance activities. Through enhanced guidance to these high-risk business sites, compliance management has improved outside Japan and the number of relevant legal and regulatory violations decreased.\n\nImplementation Status of Internal Environmental Audits\n\n| Implementing division | Target | Frequency |\n|-----------------------|--------|-----------|\n| Corporate division of Hitachi, Ltd. (Sustainability Promotion Division) | Business units, headquarters of Group companies, and business sites classified as category A in our environmental management classification | Usually every three years |\n| Corporate divisions of business units and Group companies (environment divisions) | Major business sites and subsidiaries of business units and Group companies*1 | Usually every three years |\n| Overseas business sites of business units and Group companies that are classified as category A in our environmental management classification*2 | Usually every three years |\n| ISO 14001-certified sites (audit teams) | Divisions within business sites | Usually every year |\n\n*1 According to the Hitachi Group Global Audit Standards, which specify matters concerning internal audits conducted by business units and Group companies.\n*2 According to the Environmental Action Plan.\n\nNumber of Regulatory Violations and Complaints (Hitachi Group)\n\n![Graph showing the number of regulatory violations and complaints from 2015 to 2019.](image-url)\nEfforts to Achieve a Decarbonized Society\n\nHitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 contains long-term reduction targets for CO\u2082 emissions per unit of 50% by fiscal 2030 and 80% by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010 levels) throughout Hitachi\u2019s value chain.\n\nThe value chain for our products and services encompasses all stages from the procurement of raw materials and parts to production, transportation, use, disposal, and recycling. In May 2020 we announced an even more ambitious CO\u2082 reduction target of achieving carbon neutrality, which will mean net zero emissions, at our business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030.\n\nApproximately 90% of our value-chain emissions result from the use of our products and services after they are sold, and reducing these emissions will be crucial to reducing CO\u2082 emissions across the value chain. However, CO\u2082 emissions from the use of sold products and services are greatly influenced by changes in product sale price and business portfolios. We have established an indicator for providing products and services that produce less CO\u2082 from among products and services offering equivalent value, and, recognizing the importance of this matter, have set and continue to manage reductions goals for our main products and services on the basis of CO\u2082 emissions per unit. Specifically, by fiscal 2030, we aim to reduce CO\u2082 emissions per unit by 50% for products and services at the usage stage and contribute to reducing global CO\u2082 emissions through energy systems that do not emit CO\u2082 at the operational stage and expanding our new decarbonization business using digital technology such as OT and IT.\n\nAdditionally, in response to growing investor interest in the long-term impact of climate change on financial performance and corporate operations, we actively disclose climate-related information in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and also engage in dialogue with investors.\n\nObjectives for CO\u2082 Emissions per Unit from Products and Services in Use and Approach to Avoided Emissions\n\nTo reduce CO\u2082 emissions from the use of our products and services, which make up the largest proportion of emissions in our value chain, we have established target reduction rates of CO\u2082 emissions per unit from products and services while in use. These rates are based on fiscal 2010. Given the unique qualities of the wide range of businesses we engage in, for each product or service subject to this initiative, we calculate the reduction rate of CO\u2082 emissions per unit with CO\u2082 emissions as the numerator and function size*1 as the denominator, and work toward overall reduction.\n\nWe also have high expectations for specific long-term CO\u2082 reduction countermeasures such as sales of renewable energy systems with zero emissions while in use and the use of technological innovation to replace existing products or services with new versions that provide the same value but emit less CO\u2082 while in use.\n\nThe Guidelines on Calculating CO\u2082 Emission Reductions for Hitachi Group Products and Services*2 specify the following three methods for calculating different types of CO\u2082 emission reductions. Figures considered reductions for products and services while in use under the GHG Protocol, a global standard for CO\u2082 emission reduction disclosure, are calculated using method (1). Methods (2) and (3) are for avoided emissions.\n\n1. Energy-saving feature enhancements\n   Set a reduction rate of CO\u2082 emissions per unit (compared to fiscal 2010) based on efficiency enhancements such as energy-saving feature enhancement in products and services. Every year, calculate reductions in CO\u2082 emissions considering the production volume of the relevant year.\n\n2. Reduction through new systems and solutions based on technological innovation\n   Calculate avoided emissions as reductions in CO\u2082 emissions due to the adoption of new systems and solutions that emit less CO\u2082 while providing equivalent value to existing products, services, and solutions.\n\n3. Reduction through the deployment of non-fossil energy systems\n   Calculate avoided emissions as reductions in CO\u2082 emissions due to the introduction of renewable and other non-fossil energy systems, as compared to grid-supplied electricity (using the average emissions factor of the base year, fiscal 2010).\n\n*1 Major functions of products correlated with CO\u2082 emissions.\n\n*2 The Guidelines are based on various standards, including the Guidance on Quantifying Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions from the Baseline for Electrical and Electronic Products and Systems (IEC TR62726) issued by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and calculation methods established by the government or industrial associations.\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society Through the Decarbonization Business\n\nExpanding the Decarbonization Business\n\nTo achieve a decarbonized society set out in its Environmental Vision, Hitachi is pursuing decarbonization business that contributes to reducing CO\u2082 emissions, including business to provide products and services with enhanced energy-saving features, business to introduce renewable energy, and business to offer solutions to improve efficiency and reduce CO\u2082 emissions through digitalization, such as the use of Lumada. We will expand the decarbonization business by supplying solutions in the five business areas of IT, energy, industry, mobility, and smart life, and help the world mitigate and adapt to climate change. In the IT sector, we will develop work style innovation solutions and other digital technologies to help improve the working environment for individual employees. In the energy sector, we will promote wider use of renewable energy through increased efficiency of power transmission and distribution. In the industry sector, we will improve efficiency of industrial equipment like compressors and transformers used at production sites. In the mobility sector, we will not only work to enhance the efficiency of elevators for buildings and their security and safety functions through remote monitoring but also to improve the ease of their maintenance. Finally, in the smart life sector, we will contribute to energy management in smart cities and developing, producing, and providing electrification parts for automobiles.\n\nDecarbonization Business: A Hitachi Focus\n\n- **IT solutions**\n  - Finance and public-oriented solutions\n  - Promoting digital solutions\n  - Data center\n  - Developing smart data centers\n  - Servers/storage\n  - Enhancing energy-saving features of servers and storage\n\n- **Energy solutions**\n  - Power grid solutions\n  - Enhancing efficiency of power transmission/distribution\n  - Energy management\n  - Advancing smart energy management to reduce peak electricity demand\n  - Power generation\n  - Promoting power generation systems using wind and other non-fossil energy sources\n\n- **Industry solutions**\n  - Smart logistics\n  - Improving energy-saving features through fully IT-enhanced logistics\n  - Factory automation\n  - Enhancing energy efficiency through shorter lead times\n  - Water business\n  - Enhancing efficiency of water and sewage systems\n  - Industrial products\n  - Enhancing efficiency of industrial products\n\n- **Mobility solutions**\n  - Railways\n  - Enhancing energy-saving features of rolling stock\n  - Developing smart operating systems\n  - Enhancing maintenance service efficiency through rolling stock monitoring\n  - Elevators\n  - Enhancing energy-saving features of elevators and escalators through replacement\n  - Enhancing energy efficiency through total building solutions\n\n- **Smart life solutions**\n  - Smart cities\n  - Reducing CO\u2082 through comprehensive urban energy management solutions\n  - Vehicle electrification\n  - Promoting electrification through electric powertrain systems\n  - Home appliances\n  - Enhancing energy efficiency of home appliances\n  - Promoting connected home appliances\n  - Smart therapies\n  - Enhancing energy-saving features of medical devices\nAchieving CO\u2082 Emission Reductions During the Use of Products and Services\n\nHitachi set a target for fiscal 2019 of 19% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions per unit from products and services compared to the base year of fiscal 2010, and our actual rate of reduction in fiscal 2019 was 19%. This is due to an increase in sales of high energy-saving products, including industrial equipment and equipment used for social infrastructure.\n\nImproving Environmental Performance of Products and Services Through Environmentally Conscious Design Assessments\n\nWe conduct independently developed Environmentally Conscious Design Assessments for all products and services involving a design process to steadily improve environmental performance throughout the Group. We identify 30 environmental impact items that may cause climate change, resource depletion, and ecosystem degradation across the entire life cycle of products and services, assess the environmental burden reduced through our business activities in multifaceted ways, and strive for further reductions.\n\nInitiatives for Improving Environmental Performance of Products and Services\n\n- Promoting environmentally conscious process: In accordance with the IEC 62430* criteria, promote environmentally conscious process in designing and developing products and services including by meeting environmental regulatory requirements and ascertaining the environment-related needs of our stakeholders within our existing management system.\n- Implementing Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs): For our main, priority products, quantitatively evaluate their burden on the global environment in such areas as the consumption of mineral resources, fossil fuels, and water resources, as well as their impact on climate change and air pollution, disclose the results to our stakeholders, and utilize them in improving the design of next-generation products.\n\n* The standard developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission concerning environmentally conscious design for electrical and electronic products.\n\nReducing CO\u2082 Emissions Throughout the Value Chain\n\n| Project | Department, Group company | Activity |\n|---------|---------------------------|----------|\n| Reducing CO\u2082 emissions using IT | Systems & Services Business, Hitachi, Ltd. | Reducing CO\u2082 emissions by 42% through JP1/Client Process Automation IT products |\n| New G-Series air compressors | Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems | Reducing CO\u2082 emissions by about 6% through improvement in air compressor efficiency |\n| Participation in the Carbon Footprint Communication Program | Services & Platforms Business Unit, Hitachi, Ltd. | New verification and approval of Hitachi Virtual Storage Platform 5000 Series enterprise storage (four models in series) |\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\n- FY 2010 (base year)\n  - CO\u2082 emissions from use of products\n    - Function size* = 100%\n  - FY 2019 reduction target: 19%\n  - FY 2019 reduction: 19%\n  - CO\u2082 emissions from use of products\n    - Function size* = 81%\n\n* Major functions of products correlated to CO\u2082 emissions.\nContributing to a Decarbonized Society at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)\n\nCO\u2082 Emission Reductions at Business Sites (Factories and Offices) and Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030\n\nHitachi is working toward achieving its target of reducing CO\u2082 emissions from our business sites (factories and offices) by 50% compared to fiscal 2010 by fiscal 2030, as set out in Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050, our long-term environmental targets.\n\nTo accelerate these efforts, in 2020 we announced an additional goal of realizing carbon neutrality by fiscal 2030 at all business sites (factories and offices). We call this goal \"Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030.\"\n\nUnder Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030, we aim to be carbon neutral by effectively reducing emissions by 100% by fiscal 2030 compared to fiscal 2010, instead of the original 50% reduction target. The following initiatives will help us achieve the new target.\n\nMajor Initiatives for Reducing CO\u2082 Emissions at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)\n\n**Factories**\n- Improve equipment efficiency by introducing and upgrading to high-efficiency equipment\n- Reduce energy use during production by raising efficiency through the use of Lumada and production technologies cultivated over long years of experience\n- Optimize equipment operation and stop energy waste by installing smart meters\n- Review product designs and processes\n\n**Offices**\n- Build new facilities with high energy efficiency\n- Combine and integrate existing facilities\n- Install energy-saving equipment and optimize equipment operation in collaboration with building owners\n\n**Factories and offices**\n- Install renewable energy systems\n- Use electricity from renewable sources\n- Adopt the non-fossil fuel energy certificate*1 system\n- Introduce off-balance-sheet solar power generation for self-consumption\n- Promote investment in carbon-reduction equipment through adoption of the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) framework\n\n*1 Credits assigned to energy certified as having been produced from renewable sources. Purchasers of such credits can offset their conventional energy use instead of implementing their own reduction measures.\n\nToward the goal of Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030, we have formulated a plan to make three existing factories in fiscal 2020 and a total of more than seven factories in fiscal 2021 carbon neutral. We believe that the technologies and experiences developed through efforts to achieve our carbon neutrality targets will help us offer business proposals accurately responding to our customers\u2019 decarbonization needs, thereby greatly contributing to expanding our new business opportunities.\n\nIntroducing the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing Framework\n\nTo promote CO\u2082 reduction at our business sites (factories and offices), in fiscal 2019 we started operating the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing*1 (HICP) framework, which provides sites with incentives to invest in necessary new equipment.\n\nThe HICP framework is an internal system that aims to achieve CO\u2082 reduction effectively. It helps visualize CO\u2082 reduction from investment in equipment at factories and offices and encourage investment in new equipment that drives decarbonization through energy-saving and other measures as an extension of the established decision-making process on investment.\n\nSpecifically, with reference to emissions trading and carbon taxes globally, we establish company-internal carbon prices, convert into monetary value the effect of CO\u2082 reduction due to investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization, add this to the value of energy reduction effects, and use the result to evaluate the effect of our investment. By applying incentives like these, we aim to further expand our investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization.\n\nAs the climate change issue deepens, we anticipate risks like increased burdens from carbon taxes and new emissions trading frameworks to emerge. By incorporating those risks into our equipment investment decisions, we can not only make investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization a higher priority, but also minimize the future risks of climate change and make ourselves more resilient. The introduction of the HICP framework is a key part of this process.\n\nEstablishing and implementing the HICP framework resulted in additional investment in energy-saving equipment. Such equipment did not receive investment before due to low returns, but it qualified under the HICP framework as it is expected to help reduce CO\u2082 emissions. Fiscal 2019 saw 35 cases of investment in energy-saving equipment with a total investment of \u00a5260 million, contributing to an annual reduction of 1,356 tons of CO\u2082 emissions. The annual amount of CO\u2082 emission reductions from our business sites improved 2% compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n*1 Internal carbon pricing: An in-house tool to assess in monetary terms the amount of carbon generated or reduced in order to voluntarily make investment decisions and conduct risk management.\nAchieving a Decarbonized Society\n\nContents Management Social Introduction\n\nEnvironmental Governance Assurance\n\nHitachi Sustainability Report 2020\n\nInvestment effect in monetary terms\n\nCO2 reduction effects\n\nEnergy reduction effect\n\nBefore introducing HICP framework\n\nAfter introducing HICP framework\n\nSet internal carbon prices based on future risks like increased burden from carbon taxes and emissions trading\n\nConvert effects of CO2 reduction from investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization into monetary value\n\nEvaluate effect of investment by adding monetary effect of CO2 reduction to previously calculated monetary value of effects of energy reduction through investment\n\nIncrease priority of investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization\n\nRenewable energy\n\nHigh-efficiency equipment\n\nAt Hitachi, the achievement of environmental targets for individual business sites (factories and offices) set by the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 is measured by CO2 emissions per unit. Because we conduct business in various sectors, the KPI of CO2 emissions per unit for each business site is calculated using the site\u2019s CO2 emissions as the numerator and its activity amount*1 as the denominator.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, the reduction rate of CO2 emissions per unit was 5% against a target of 7% (compared to the base year of fiscal 2010). Part of the reason for not hitting the target was a lower efficiency of facility use due to a decrease in sales. There were also some business divisions that could not achieve expected reductions in CO2 emissions per unit due to a failure to appropriately respond to a reduction in the fixed power allocation linked to sales.\n\nWe report the total CO2 emissions from our entire Group, including CO2 emissions from power plants selling electricity. Total CO2 emissions in fiscal 2019 decreased by approximately 599 kt-CO2 compared to fiscal 2018*2 due to the sale of our power plants and a drop in sales. CO2 emissions by region, excluding those from power plants, fell as a result of reorganization of business sites and a decline in sales in Japan. In the Americas, a materials company that became a reporting company in fiscal 2016 accounts for a large portion of CO2 emissions, and we will look into ways to promote the use of inexpensive renewable energies.\n\n*1 A value closely related to CO2 emissions at each business site (for example, production quantity, output, building floor space, and number of employees).\n\n*2 The CO2 electrical power conversion factor for total CO2 emissions is market-based.\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\n| Activity amount | CO2 emissions*1 |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| 4,703 kt-CO2    |                 |\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\n| Activity amount | CO2 emissions |\n|-----------------|---------------|\n| 4,441 kt-CO2    |               |\n\n*1 CO2 emitted within the organization (Scopes 1 and 2).\n\nNotes: \u2022 As the CO2 electrical power conversion factor in calculations of CO2 emissions per unit, a unified factor of 0.530 kgCO2/kWh is applied across the entire Hitachi Group.\n\n\u2022 The Environmental Action Plan\u2019s management values do not include amounts for our power plants in fiscal 2010 (base year) or fiscal 2019.\nReducing Transportation Energy Consumption\n\nAs part of our efforts to reduce energy output during transportation as well as at our business sites (factories and offices), we have established targets for the reduction of transportation energy use per unit for each business unit and Group company in Japan. Outside Japan, these targets are voluntary. Our business sites are promoting a modal shift to highly efficient transportation methods, improving truck loading ratios and taking other measures to reduce transportation energy consumption, and switching to the use of eco-cars for in-house operation. Considering a modal shift from truck to rail transportation a high priority, we are working toward \u201cEco Rail Mark company\u201d and \u201cEco Rail certified product\u201d certifications from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. Transitioning from truck to railway transportation is expected to reduce CO2 emissions per unit to one-eleventh of its current level, and we plan to continue expanding our use of railways for long-distance transportation.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, CO2 emissions from transportation within Japan for the Hitachi Group were 88.4 kt-CO2, 14.4 kt-CO2 less than the previous fiscal year. To reduce CO2 emissions, we actively worked to improve efficiency when loading products for transportation and increase our use of coordinated transportation, reducing CO2 emissions by more than 10% compared to fiscal 2018.\n\nEco Rail Mark Initiatives\n\n| Company | Certification |\n|---------|--------------|\n| Hitachi, Ltd. | Eco Rail Mark company*1 |\n| Hitachi-Denmon Terminal Solutions | Eco Rail Mark company*1 |\n| Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems | Eco Rail certified product*2 |\n\n*1 A mark conferred on companies using railways for more than 15% of freight land transportation covering 500 km or more; for 15,000 tons or more in volume per year; or for more than 15 million ton-kilometers in volume \u00d7 distance per year.\n\n*2 A mark conferred on products using railways for more than 30% of freight land transportation covering 500 km or more in terms of volume \u00d7 distance.\n\nIntroducing Renewable Energy\n\nWe are promoting the use of solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy at our business sites. Going forward, we will accelerate these efforts, aiming to raise the share of renewable energy in our total electricity consumption to 2% by fiscal 2030.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Hitachi generated a total of 18,022 MWh of renewable energy for its own use, which is 2.6 times the amount generated in the previous fiscal year. Renewable energy generated by equipment installed at business sites (factories and offices) accounted for 0.3% of the electricity consumed by the entire Hitachi Group.\n\nMajor Business Sites Using Renewable Energy\n\n| Company | Energy Generated |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| Hitachi Computer Products (America) | 11,325 MWh/year of wind power used |\n| Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery (India) | 12,629 MWh/year of solar power generated |\n\n*1 Includes 1,070 kt-CO2 (fiscal 2016), 1,163 kt-CO2 (fiscal 2017), 1,112 kt-CO2 (fiscal 2018), and 950 kt-CO2 (fiscal 2019) emitted by a materials company that became a reporting company in fiscal 2016.\n\n*2 Emissions from power plants selling electricity in Japan are included in the CO2 emissions data for fiscal 2017 and onward.\n\nNotes: \u2022 Starting from fiscal 2019\u2019s calculations, Scope 2 emissions were changed from a calculation method using a unified Group-wide electrical power conversion factor to a market-based calculation method, and past data was recalculated based on this. Regarding CO2 electrical power conversion factors: in Japan (including power plants), adjusted conversion factors for individual power businesses based on the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures are used; overseas, the latest values for each fiscal year supplied by the International Energy Agency (IEA) as conversion factors for individual countries are used.\n\n\u2022 Energy-related CO2 emissions in fiscal 2019 were 1,489 kt-CO2 (Scope 1) and 2,885 kt-CO2 (Scope 2).\n## Energy Savings in Eco-Factories & Offices\n\n| Project                                                                 | Department, Group company                  | Activity                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Promoting measures for carbon neutrality                               | Hitachi Automotive Systems, Hitachi High-Tech Manufacturing & Service | Reduction in CO\u2082 emissions of about 820 t-CO\u2082 by increasing use of renewable energy |\n| Increasing use of renewable energy with off-balance-sheet solar power generation systems for self-consumption |                                             |                                                                          |\n| Reducing CO\u2082 by increasing efficiency of cupola furnaces and utilizing unused energy through heat recovery | Hitachi Metals                              | Reduction in CO\u2082 emissions by 15% compared to previous fiscal year through initiatives including increased efficiency of cupola furnaces and heat recovery |\n\n[https://www.hitachi.com/environment/casestudy/2019/case04.html](https://www.hitachi.com/environment/casestudy/2019/case04.html)\n\n[https://www.hitachi.com/environment/casestudy/2019/case05.html](https://www.hitachi.com/environment/casestudy/2019/case05.html)\nClimate-related Financial Information Disclosure (Based on TCFD Recommendations)\n\nIn June 2018, Hitachi announced its endorsement of the recommendations by the Financial Stability Board (FSB)\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The following contains key climate-related financial information in line with the TCFD\u2019s recommendations.\n\nGovernance\n\nHitachi sees climate change and other environmental issues as important management issues. A report to the Board of Directors in 2016 was followed by the establishment and announcement of long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 containing CO2 reduction targets for fiscal 2030 and fiscal 2050.\n\nThe Board of Directors discusses the Group\u2019s sustainability strategy, including climate change measures, as a key component of management strategy. The Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the president and CEO and staffed by heads of corporate divisions and business units, meets twice a year to discuss and reach decisions on material environment-related policies and measures, including those in response to climate change, and to set the stage for implementation. In addition, the Audit Committee of independent directors conducts an audit of sustainability-related operations once a year, and Hitachi executive officers report on climate-related material issues to the committee during the audit.\n\nAs for activities outside the company, in 2019 an executive officer in charge participated in the TCFD Study Group on Implementing TCFD Recommendations for Mobilizing Green Finance Through Proactive Corporate Disclosures, launched by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, and helped compile its report. Hitachi also participates in an industry-government-academia initiative called the TCFD Consortium\u2014comprising 164 companies and other organizations\u2014as a member of its Steering Committee and contributed to the formulation of TCFD Guidance 2.0, announced in July 2020.\n\nIdentification and Assessment of Climate-related Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe Hitachi Group operates a broad array of businesses around the world, with each business having its own set of risks and opportunities. We are responding to the impact of climate change by assessing climate-related risks and opportunities in accordance with TCFD classifications. We make sector-specific assessments of risks and opportunities for important business sectors that have a relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate change. Our assessments are also categorized according to time span, namely, short term, medium term, and long term, as defined below.\n\nTime Spans for Assessing Climate-related Risks and Opportunities\n\n| Time span | Reason for adoption |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| Short term | Over the next three years from fiscal 2019 to 2021 |\n| Medium term | Through fiscal 2030 |\n| Long term | Through fiscal 2050 |\n\nWe are responding to climate change by fulfilling our responsibilities as a global company in achieving a decarbonized society. Taking note of the total CO2 reductions required globally under the RCP 2.6*1 and RCP 8.5*2 scenarios of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we have established long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 based on our Environmental Vision calling for CO2 reductions throughout our value chain of 50% by fiscal 2030 and 80% by fiscal 2050, compared to fiscal 2010.\n\nIn May 2020 we announced an even more ambitious CO2 reduction target of achieving carbon neutrality, which will mean net zero emissions, at our business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030.\n\n*1 A Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario under which, at the end of the 21st century, the increase in global temperatures from preindustrial levels is kept below 2\u00b0C.\n\n*2 An RCP scenario that assumes that emissions will continue to rise, resulting in an approximately 4\u00b0C rise in global temperatures compared to preindustrial levels.\nClimate-related Risks\n\nAs for climate-related business risks, we have followed the TCFD\u2019s classification in considering (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy in the 2\u00b0C scenario and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change in the 4\u00b0C scenario, which assumes that efforts to reduce global CO\u2082 emissions have failed.\n\n(1) Risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy (applying mostly to the 2\u00b0C scenario)\n\n| Category          | Major risks                                                                 | Time span       | Main initiatives                                                                 |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Policy and legal  | Increased business costs from the introduction of carbon taxes, fuel/energy consumption taxes, emissions trading systems, and other measures | Short to long term | Avoid or mitigate increases in business costs, such as from carbon taxes, by further enhancing production and transport efficiency and promoting the use of non- or low-carbon energy sources |\n| Technology        | Loss of sales opportunities due to delays in technology development for products and services | Medium to long term | Contribute to reducing CO\u2082 emissions by developing and marketing innovative products and services that lead to the achievement of long-term environmental targets and expanding the decarbonization business. Promote the development of low-carbon products by implementing Environmentally Conscious Design Assessments when designing products and services |\n| Market and reputation | Impact on sales due to changes in market values or assessment of our approach to climate issues | Medium to long term | In the light of rising investor and market interest in climate change and growing expectations of the business sector, clearly identify the reduction of CO\u2082 emissions in our management and business strategy by incorporating reduction targets for fiscal 2021 in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan in line with our long-term environmental targets |\n\n(2) Risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (4\u00b0C scenario)\n\n| Category          | Major risks                                                                 | Time span       | Main initiatives                                                                 |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Acute and chronic physical risks | Climate-related risks to business continuity, including increased severity of typhoons, floods, and droughts (acute risks) as well as rising sea level and chronic heat waves (chronic risks) | Short to long term | Take into account the possibility of flood damage when deciding on the location or equipment layout of a new plant. Measures tailored to the water risks of each manufacturing site will be strengthened in the future based on the results of a water risk assessment now being conducted |\n\nClimate-related Opportunities\n\nCO\u2082 emissions during the use of our products and services by our customers account for approximately 90% of total emissions in our value chain. To achieve the CO\u2082 reduction targets set forth in our long-term environmental targets and 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, Management Plan, it is essential that we reduce emissions during use. Developing and providing products and services that emit zero or very little CO\u2082 during their use will not only satisfy customer needs but also help meet society\u2019s demands for reduced emissions. This represents a business opportunity for us in the short, medium, and long term and constitutes a major pillar of the Social Innovation Business that we are promoting as a management strategy.\n\nClimate-related opportunities\n\n| Category          | Major opportunities                                                                 | Main initiatives                                                                 |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Products/services and markets | Increased corporate value and revenue from expanded sales of products and services with innovative technology that can contribute to the mitigation and adaptation of climate change | Develop and market products and services that contribute to a decarbonized society, expand the decarbonization business, and promote the development of innovative devices and materials that contribute to reducing the environmental burden. Create solutions that leverage Hitachi\u2019s strengths in operational technology (OT), IT, and products, as well as expertise in R&D (high-efficiency, energy-saving products; high-efficiency production systems using digital technology; power generation systems using non-fossil energy that do not emit CO\u2082; environment-friendly mobility; and building of smart, environmental cities) |\n| Resilience        | Provision of solutions to address climate-related natural disasters                | Provide disaster-mitigation solutions, such as high-performance fire-fighting command systems. Provide construction machinery that enables speedy recovery efforts |\nResponding to Climate Scenario Risks and Opportunities for Each Business\n\nHitachi operates a broad array of businesses, with each business having its own set of risks and opportunities. We therefore selected businesses that have a relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate change and examined the business impact of and responses to the 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios. Under the former, our assessments were premised on there being stronger measures and regulations for decarbonization envisioned by the IPCC\u2019s RCP 2.6 scenario. By assuming somewhat tighter regulations and an earlier target date for CO2 reductions, we can prepare ourselves for the 1.5\u00b0C scenario. Under the latter, we focused on being increased climate-induced natural disasters as a result of lax regulations, as projected by the RCP 8.5 scenario.\n\nIn selecting the businesses that have a relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate change, we took many different factors into account and chose those with (1) relatively high CO2 emissions from the use of products and services, (2) a relatively high need for fossil fuels during the use of products and services, and (3) high sales volume within the Group. The businesses we selected using these criteria were railway systems, power generation and power grids, IT systems, industrial equipment, automotive systems, and construction machinery. Our assessment of the major climate-related risks and opportunities for these businesses are outlined in the following table:\n\n### The Business Environment, Major Risks and Opportunities, and Strategies under the 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C Scenarios\n\n| Target businesses | Railway systems | Power generation and power grids | IT systems | Industrial equipment | Automotive systems | Construction machinery |\n|-------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Business environment:** | Global demand for transport systems that emit less CO2 per distance covered will grow with tighter CO2 emission regulations in each country and region. | Business environment: Global demand for electricity generated from renewable energy, nuclear power, and other non-fossil sources will grow with tighter CO2 emission regulations in each country and region. | Business environment: Demand for energy-saving, high-efficiency IT solutions will grow with tighter CO2 emission regulations in each country and region. | Business environment: Global demand for energy-saving industrial equipment will grow with tighter CO2 emission regulations in each country and region. | Business environment: Electric vehicles will rapidly spread with tighter laws and regulations on fuel efficiency and environmental standards, and increases in fossil fuel prices. Markets for alternative, non-fossil technologies like hydrogen, and biofuel vehicles will expand. | Business environment: Demand for electric and biofuel carbon-fuel construction machinery will grow with tighter laws and regulations on the use of fossil fuels. Environmental regulations for these other fossil fuels will increase, and demand for construction machinery will grow with tighter laws and regulations on the use of fossil fuels. |\n| **Risks:** | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative products and solutions that contribute to zero-emissions. | Delays in the construction of power networks enabling the mass introduction of renewable energy with large output fluctuations. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative products and solutions that contribute to zero-emissions. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative products and solutions that contribute to zero-emissions. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative products and solutions that contribute to zero-emissions. | Competitiveness will decline if there are delays in the development of innovative products and solutions that contribute to zero-emissions. |\n| **Opportunities:** | Demand will grow for railways, which emit less CO2 per distance covered. There will be a shift in energy-saving railcars from conventional models, and the efficiency of railway services will be improved through digital utilization. Data usage will also boost demand for new mobility services. | Business environment: The cost competitiveness of non-fossil energy will increase, and demand for renewables, nuclear, and other non-fossil energy will increase as the expansion of energy suppliers pushes up the price of fossil fuels. Natural disasters caused by climate change will rise sharply. | Business environment: Demand for new high-efficiency technology will expand as multiple IT systems in response to natural disaster BCPs will result in increased energy consumption. Demand will also grow for social and public systems to reduce damage from natural disasters. | Business environment: Typhoons, floods, and other natural disasters caused by climate change will rise sharply. | Business environment: Fuel efficiency laws and regulations will remain lax globally, and internal combustion engine vehicles will remain a major mode of transport. The modal shift will be slow, as conventional automobiles and motorcycles will remain predominant. Typhoons, floods, and other natural disasters caused by climate change will rise sharply. | Business environment: Natural disasters caused by climate change will rise sharply, boosting demand for construction machinery to support speedy and safe recovery efforts. |\n\nContinued on next page \u25bc\nThe business environment and major risks and opportunities under 2\u00b0C scenario\n\n**Risks:**\n- The high frequency of natural disasters will increase damage to production facilities, women working environments, and disruption supply chains, leading to delays in deliveries and the procurement of parts.\n- Natural disasters will exacerbate damage to production facilities, women working environments, and disruption supply chains, leading to delays in deliveries and the procurement of parts.\n- Natural disasters will exacerbate damage to production facilities, women working environments, and disruption supply chains, leading to delays in deliveries and the procurement of parts.\n- Natural disasters will exacerbate damage to production facilities, women working environments, and disruption supply chains, leading to delays in deliveries and the procurement of parts.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n- Transport systems more resilient to natural disasters (on account of increased use of air conditioning). Demand will increase for disaster-resistant power generation and transmission/distribution technologies.\n- Opportunities: Demand will increase for warmer weather leads to increased use of air conditioning. Demand will increase for disaster-resistant power generation and transmission/distribution technologies.\n- Opportunities: Demand will increase for warmer weather leads to increased use of air conditioning. Demand will increase for disaster-resistant power generation and transmission/distribution technologies.\n- Opportunities: Demand will increase for warmer weather leads to increased use of air conditioning. Demand will increase for disaster-resistant power generation and transmission/distribution technologies.\n\n**Non-environmental related factors (4\u00b0C scenario)**\n\n**Risks:**\n- Economic growth will be undermined, and population growth around the world, moving the railway business contribution as an efficient form of public transport for large numbers of passengers, regardless of climate conditions. Market size in Japan will remain flat, but the Asian market overall will see substantial growth.\n- Long-distance travel will decrease as the global pandemic will prompt a shift to remote, contactless, and online travel, and encourages remote work. The decline in demand, though, will not be as severe as for air transport.\n- Competition will grow as major railway manufacturers in various countries will expand their business to meet global demand\n\n**Opportunities:**\n- Further digitization globally will exponentially increase the volume of data collected, accumulated, and analyzed. Experience with the global pandemic will prompt a shift to remote, contactless, and online travel, and encourages remote work. The decline in demand, though, will not be as severe as for air transport.\n- New services and businesses utilizing big data technology will be further applied to enhance the stability and efficiency of the power supply\n- Digitalization, infrastructure renewal, population decline, and worker shortages will lead to the automation market in industrial countries.\n- The global pandemic forces people to stay at or work from home, demand will grow for factory automation enabling a handful of workers to operate a factory. The industrial market in energy, especially electricity, mainly in developing countries.\n\n**Response to business risks under 2\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C scenario**\n\n- Continue to strengthen the railway business, as global demand for railways will increase under either scenario.\n- Specifically, develop and market more energy-saving railcars and battery-powered railcars for non-electrified sections. Strengthen railway services through digitalization, such as dynamic route planning, passenger demand, and new mobility services.\n- Given the increasing frequency of natural disasters, take risk assessment into account when deciding the location and equipment layout of a new plant. Keep an eye on the supply chain in strengthening our ability to respond to business disruption risks in accordance with our BCPs.\n- Impact on part of \u00a5931.3 billion in railway systems business sales (FY 2019)\n- Impact on part of \u00a5580.3 billion in railway systems business sales (FY 2019)\n- Impact on part of \u00a5104.4 billion in industry Sector's industrial products business sales (FY 2019)\n- Impact on part of \u00a581.1 billion in automotive (Hitachi Automotive Systems) sales (FY 2019)\n\n**Response to future business risks (Business opportunities)**\n\n- Promote R&D of electrification technology and other alternative technologies to enhance response to new markets, such as for electric vehicles.\n- Promote R&D of electrification technology and other alternative technologies to enhance response to new markets, such as for electric vehicles.\n- Promote R&D of electrification technology and other alternative technologies to enhance response to new markets, such as for electric vehicles.\n- Promote R&D of electrification technology and other alternative technologies to enhance response to new markets, such as for electric vehicles.\n\n**Financial information (sales volume of each target sector)**\n\n- Impact on part of \u00a5931.3 billion in railway systems business sales (FY 2019)\n- Impact on part of \u00a5580.3 billion in railway systems business sales (FY 2019)\n- Impact on part of \u00a5104.4 billion in industry Sector's industrial products business sales (FY 2019)\n- Impact on part of \u00a581.1 billion in automotive (Hitachi Automotive Systems) sales (FY 2019)\n\nWe believe that by paying close attention to trends and developments in our business fields and strategically developing our business, we have high climate resilience in the medium to long term under either the 2\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C scenario.\nRisk Management\n\nThe Hitachi Group evaluates and monitors climate-related risks for each business unit and Group company as part of a process of assessing risks and opportunities in accordance with the Environmental Action Plan, updated every three years. The results are tabulated by the Sustainability Promotion Division of Hitachi, Ltd., and their importance is checked at Sustainability Promotion Meetings. Those risks and opportunities perceived as being particularly important for the Group as a whole are deliberated by the Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the president and CEO of Hitachi, Ltd.\n\nMetrics and Targets\n\nOur environmental activities are managed through the Environmental Action Plan, whose metrics and targets are updated every three years, including those to measure and manage climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nWe use the reduction rate of CO\u2082 emissions per unit compared to fiscal 2010 to set targets and monitor progress across our many Group products and services in the value chain. Under the current Environmental Action Plan for 2021 (covering fiscal 2019\u20132021) as well, we have established annual targets and monitor progress for each business unit and Group company.\n\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3) across our value chain are calculated based on GHG Protocol standards, and we have published annual figures since fiscal 2012. Given the nature of our business, some 90% of our total CO\u2082 emissions come from the use of sold products in Scope 3. CO\u2082 emissions can fluctuate greatly, though, due to changes in sales volume and our business portfolio. To advance CO\u2082 reductions during the use of sold products and services, therefore, we set targets and monitor progress for the reduction rate of CO\u2082 emissions per unit. In other words, for products and services featuring equivalent value, we focus on metrics to provide customers and society with those that emit less CO\u2082. At the same time, we will make an exerted effort to not only reduce per unit but also total CO\u2082 emissions from our business sites (factories and offices).\nAchieving a Resource Efficient Society\n\nEfforts to Achieve a Resource Efficient Society\n\nApproach\n\nThe issues of water and resource scarcity, triggered by rising water demand and population growth\u2014resulting in higher volumes of resources collected, extracted, used, and eventually emitted as waste\u2014are common concerns for the entire world. Hitachi's business operations will respond to these issues by working with our customers and society to help build a society that uses water and other resources efficiently. We have set a fiscal 2050 target of improving the usage efficiency of water and other resources by 50% compared to fiscal 2010 levels. We will create higher economic value using less water and other resources and pursue production activities with a low environmental burden.\n\nInitiatives to Achieve a Resource Efficient Society\n\n- Responding to water risks\n- Shifting to a circular economy\n- Enhancing efficiency in the use of water\n- Enhancing efficiency in the use of resources\nBuilding a Water Efficient Society\n\nHitachi's Approach to Water Risks\n\nEmbracing the importance of developing region-specific risk measures that take the respective water stress levels into account, Hitachi strives to better understand the water issues faced by some 200 business sites around the world, which are classified as category A in our environmental management classification. To this end, we identify water risks at each site by using our Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) and such globally recognized tools for water risk assessment as the Aqueduct, developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI); the Water Risk Filter, developed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the German development finance institution DEG; and the Flood Hazard Map of the World produced by the European Union. To identify water risks, we analyze and evaluate water risks for each business unit and Group company, per country and region, and for the entire Group using approximately 50 assessment items, including physical risks like water stress that may affect water resources and quality or cause water damage; regulatory risks leading to higher water and discharge costs or new taxes; and reputation risks that can negatively affect communication with stakeholders, thereby implementing measures based on the nature and characteristics of each region and business.\n\nIn December 2019, we released the Water Risk Guidelines, which stipulate policies on how to identify and respond to water risks at each region and business area, taking into consideration the impacts of water risks on our business. The guidelines were developed with reference to Setting Site Water Targets Informed by Catchment Context, published in August 2019, and are shared among the Hitachi Group together with the checklist to identify water risks and case studies of measures taken at our business sites.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\n1. Water stress occurs when demand for water outpaces availability. The maximum volume of available water supply per capita is used as an index to measure levels of scarcity. The minimum volume of water required for living, agriculture, industry, energy, and the environment is considered to be 1,700 cubic meters per person per year, and regions below this level are said to experience water stress. According to the WRI Aqueduct risk analysis, when the ratio of total annual water withdrawn to average annual water supply within an area is 80% or more, it is defined as extremely high risk.\n\n2. A guide created by members of UN Global Compact, CEO Water Mandate, Pacific Institute, WRI, WWF, and other global institutions with the aim of helping companies set effective site water targets.\nActions and Achievements\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we set a target of a 23% reduction (over the base year of fiscal 2010) for water usage per unit and achieved a 26% reduction. The volume of water used declined by 20.9 million cubic meters, or 40% from the base year. Our measures to reduce water usage include more stringent management of water intake using flowmeters, leakage control by installing above-ground water pipes, circular use of cooling water, and reuse of purified waste water.\n\nImproving Water Use Efficiency\n\n| Project | Department, Group company | Activity |\n|---------|---------------------------|----------|\n| Reducing groundwater use by recycling cupola furnace cooling water | Hitachi Metals | About 40% reduction in groundwater use by installing new water tanks and cooling towers to cool the furnaces |\n| Reducing water use by visualizing groundwater flow | Hitachi Global Life Solutions | Water conservation efforts including the introduction of a power-monitoring system that automatically measures the flow of groundwater |\n\nProducts and Services that Contribute to Resolving Water Issues\n\nHitachi will provide customers with a wide range of water-related products and services, thereby contributing to resolving water issues through its global business operations.\n\nThe Republic of South Africa (South Africa) suffers from a serious water shortage. Hitachi is engaged in a demonstration project of RemixWater,*1 an integrated seawater desalination and water reuse system in the city of Durban in cooperation with the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). In fiscal 2019, we started operating the system at the demonstration site of a wastewater treatment plant in the city. In this demonstration project, we construct desalination facilities aiming to produce 6,250 tons*2 of product water meeting potability standards from seawater and treated and discharged wastewater every day, while saving 30% more energy*3 compared to conventional seawater desalination systems*4 and reducing the impact on the nearby marine environment. We plan to introduce this technology in South Africa and to other regions with serious water shortages, thus contributing to the development of water infrastructure and industry.\n\n*1 RemixWater is a registered trademark of Hitachi in Japan.\n*2 This corresponds to a water supply population of about 25,000.\n*3 Hitachi estimates for RemixWater in case of converting 100,000 m3/day at 3.5% seawater salinity.\n*4 Conventional systems desalinate by filtrating seawater through a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. High pressure is needed to permeate the RO membrane, leading to high energy consumption.\n### Hitachi\u2019s Water-related Products and Services\n\n| Activity field                  | Products or services (Implementation to date)                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Creating water resources       | Wastewater recycling systems                                                                                   |\n|                                | Seawater desalination systems                                                                                 |\n| Developing water infrastructure| Water and sewage treatment, etc. (over 200 sites in about 40 countries and regions)                           |\n|                                | Water purification plants (approximately 720 plants in Japan)                                                  |\n|                                | Sewage treatment plants (approximately 900 plants in Japan)                                                   |\n|                                | Comprehensive digital solutions for water and sewage treatment operators                                       |\nBuilding a Society That Uses Resources Efficiently\n\nHitachi's Approach to Transition to a Circular Economy\n\nTo help build a recycling-oriented society, Hitachi will advance a shift from the conventional linear economy to a circular economy. We will develop closed-loop recycling and servicizing*1 business models through utilization of recycled materials, manufacturing that is oriented to resource saving and long product life, reduction and recycling of factory waste, refurbishing*2 and remanufacturing,*3 and recycling of end-of-life products. These are advanced at each stage of the value chain, namely, procurement, development and design, production, distribution and sales, use, and disposal.\n\n*1 Servicizing: Providing customers with the function of a product rather than selling them the product itself.\n*2 Refurbishing: Servicing end-of-use products to a condition conforming to new-product standards.\n*3 Remanufacturing: Restoring end-of-use products through disassembly, washing, component replacement, and other work to a condition equivalent to new products.\n\nEfficient Use of Resources Throughout the Value Chain\n\nDisposal\nCollection of end-of-use products, recycling, remanufacturing\n\nProcurement\nUse of recycled materials, closed-loop recycling\n\nDevelopment & Design\nEnvironmentally conscious design, resource saving, long product life\n\nProduction\nEffective use of factory waste, closed-loop recycling, reduced packaging\n\nDistribution & Sales\nReuse, sharing, servicing, reduced packaging\n\nUse\nRepair, reuse, refurbishing, sharing\n\nActivities Related to Use and Disposal of Products\n\nIn Japan, Hitachi has built its own product recycling network providing services near our customers to collect and recycle such end-of-life products as supercomputers, mainframes, and other computing machines; communication equipment like network devices and telephone switchboards; and information equipment like ATMs, though collecting and recycling of these products are voluntary and not legally required of manufacturers.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nWe collected a total of 15 tons of end-of-life personal computers and monitors, including all-in-one computers, of which 12 tons were recycled, achieving a resource recycling rate of 80%.\n\nThe total weight of recyclable materials*1 recovered from four types of end-of-life home appliances collected was approximately 86 kt, of which some 77 kt were recycled. By product type, the recycling rate for refrigerators and freezers was 80%, exceeding by 10% point the legal requirement of 70% and that for washing machines and dryers was 93%, exceeding by 11% point the legal requirement of 82%.\n\n*1 Recyclable materials: Parts and materials recovered from the four types of end-of-life home appliances (air conditioners, TVs, refrigerators and freezers, and washing machines and dryers) and recycled by putting them to use in houses or by selling them or transferring them free of charge to others who will use them. The data is aggregated from Hitachi Global Life Solutions and Hitachi-Johnson Controls Air Conditioning.\n\nBy-Product Recycling Activities\n\n- Large-capacity storage unit\n  Clean, check, and refurbish parts of the used device replaced by a new one for use as our warranty-backed maintenance parts (US)\n\n- Construction machinery\n  Remanufacture used units at recycling plants as high-function, reasonably priced units which have functions equivalent to those of new ones (Japan, China, Australia, and six other countries)\n\n- Electric components for automobiles\n  After collecting malfunctioning components from dealers and repair shops, disassemble, check, clean and restore, reassemble, and inspect those components and market them as products featuring the same performance as new ones (Japan)\n\n- Industrial equipment (pumps, motors, distribution boards, transformers, refrigeration equipment, and air conditioners)\n  Collect and reuse end-of-life products as resources (Japan)\n\n- Home appliances\n  Recycle the four types of end-of-use home appliances (air conditioners, TVs, refrigerators and freezers, and washing machines and dryers) at our 19 recycling plants as part of cooperative efforts among five companies*1 in response to the 2001 Home Appliance Recycling Law (Japan)\n\n*1 Hitachi Global Life Solutions; Sharp Corp.; Sony Corp.; Fujitsu General Ltd.; and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.\nPlastic Recycling Activities\n\nHitachi Global Life Solutions, the major consumer of plastic in the Hitachi Group, uses plastic in parts for washing machines and refrigerators and packing materials for ceiling lights. The company procures recycled plastic materials produced within the Hitachi Group using plastic parts recovered from end-of-life home appliances and plastic containers as well as purchasing recycled plastics from materials manufacturers.\n\nDuring fiscal 2019, a total of 1,163 tons of recycled plastic materials from end-of-life home appliances were used as parts for home appliances and packing materials.\n\nActions and Achievements\n\nFor fiscal 2019, we set a target of a 10% reduction (from a base year of fiscal 2010) for waste and valuables*1 generated per unit, bettering this by achieving a 14% reduction. The amount of waste and valuables generated was reduced by 208 kt or 14% compared to the base year. We strived to reduce waste by installing recycling facilities within our business sites as well as through closed-loop recycling, whereby the by-products and scrap from the production process are reused as resources by other business sites, and repeated use of packing and cushioning materials during transport.\n\nUnder the Zero Emission*2 initiative, which seeks to minimize landfill disposal, 67 business sites out of 167 target business sites achieved their zero waste emissions goal*3 in fiscal 2019.\n\n*1 Waste and valuables: Materials generated through business activities. Each country has a legal definition of waste, and in Japan, the term refers to refuse, bulky refuse, ashes, sludge, excreta, waste oil, waste acid and alkali, carcasses, and other filthy and unnecessary matter, which are in solid or liquid state according to the Waste Management and Public Cleansing Law. Valuables, meanwhile, are those materials left over after business activities other than waste, and can be sold or transferred free of charge to other parties as items of value.\n\n*2 Zero emissions: The principles and methods advanced by United Nations University in 1994 aimed at eliminating waste from human activity as much as possible while maximizing the use of resources and achieving sustainable economic and manufacturing activities.\n\n*3 Zero waste emissions goal: Defined as a final disposal rate (landfill disposal/waste and valuables) of less than 0.5% in any given fiscal year.\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\nReduction in Waste and Valuables Generation*1 per Unit (Hitachi Group)\n\n| FY 2010 (base year) | FY 2019 reduction target: 10% |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Amount generated    | Activity amount               |\n| 1,434 kt            | 1,226 kt                      |\n| 100%                | 86%                           |\n\nFrom base year 14% reduction\n\nWaste and Valuables Generation*1 (Hitachi Group)\n\n| Year | Japan | Rest of Asia (excluding China and Japan) | China | Americas | Europe |\n|------|-------|------------------------------------------|-------|----------|--------|\n| 2015 | 618   | 98                                       | 335   | 455      | 461    |\n| 2016 | 618   | 98                                       | 335   | 455      | 461    |\n| 2017 | 618   | 98                                       | 335   | 455      | 461    |\n| 2018 | 618   | 98                                       | 335   | 455      | 461    |\n| 2019 | 618   | 98                                       | 335   | 455      | 461    |\n\n*1 The total amount of waste and valuables generated in manufacturing processes plus that generated in offices and other nonmanufacturing business.\n\n*2 Includes 675 kt (fiscal 2016), 675 kt (fiscal 2017), 689 kt (fiscal 2018), and 601 kt (fiscal 2019) of a materials company that became a reporting company in fiscal 2016.\n## Efficient Use of Resources\n\n| Project                                      | Department, Group company | Activity                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Recycling of waste sand                      | Hitachi Metals            | Reduction in the amount of waste sand generated in the process of manufacturing casting products by about 4,000 tons through recycling |\n| Recycling polishing sludge with an abrasive powder compression system | Hitachi Automotive Systems | Recycling about 360 tons of polishing sludge that had been disposed of as industrial waste annually by introducing an abrasive powder compression system |\nAchieving a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nEfforts to Achieve a Harmonized Society with Nature\n\nTo adequately preserve the ecosystem and achieve a harmonized society with nature so that we may continue to enjoy nature\u2019s benefits, we have established targets to minimize our impact on natural capital as part of our long-term environmental targets.\n\nWe classify the emission of greenhouse gases and chemical substances into the atmosphere and the generation of waste materials as negative impact activities. Providing products and services that contribute to ecosystem preservation and undertaking social contribution activities to protect the environment through the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems are categorized as positive impact activities. We will strive to minimize the difference between them by 2050.\n\nBy quantifying Hitachi\u2019s positive and negative impact activities across the value chain, we are advancing initiatives to reduce our negative impact and maximize our positive impact.\n\nA Timetable for Minimizing Impact\n\n- Negative impact\n- Positive impact (ecosystem preservation activities)\n- Positive impact (contributions through products and services)\n\nInitiatives to Minimize Impact on Natural Capital\n\nHitachi has identified and quantified the negative impact our business activities have on natural capital with the aim of reducing such impact. According to our estimates, approximately 40% of our negative impact in fiscal 2019 was related to climate change, and 20%, respectively, to waste materials, resource consumption, and urban air pollution. These results suggest that we need to further reduce our environmental load to minimize our impact on natural capital, such as by increasing the energy efficiency of our products and services, advancing factory efficiency, using resources more effectively, and properly managing chemical substances.\n\nAs for our positive impact activities, we have been advancing social contribution activities like forest conservation and business activities that directly contribute to ecosystem preservation, such as building water treatment plants. We are also looking to quantify the impact of these activities.\n\nWe estimate the benefits gained through our forest conservation activities (flood prevention, water impoundment, water purification, soil loss prevention, and carbon fixation) on an ongoing basis using evaluation methods commonly used in forestry-related public works projects.\n\nTo enable the evaluation of forest conservation efforts, in fiscal 2019 we built a framework to collect data on forest areas targeted for conservation activities through the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS).\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\n- Waste materials 18%\n- Resource consumption 18%\n- Climate change 36%\n- Urban air pollution 19%\n- Ecotoxicity 5%\n- Other 4%\n\nNote: Calculated using version 2 of the Life-cycle Impact Assessment Method based on Endpoint Modeling (LIME2).\n\nScope of Negative Impact Calculations\n\nhttp://www.hitachi.com/environment/data/method.html\nManaging and Reducing Chemical Substances\n\nManaging Chemical Substances\n\nHitachi believes that control and reduction of chemical substances like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the causes of urban air pollution, are important to minimizing our impact on natural capital. Based on this belief, Hitachi formulated the Regulations for Environmental CSR-Compliant Monozukuri to manage chemical substances at all stages of its operations\u2014from design and development, procurement, and production to quality assurance and shipping. Chemical substances in our products are divided into two categories, prohibited substances and controlled substances, for separate management to respond to legal and regulatory frameworks at shipping destinations. With regard to chemical substances used in our business operations, we reduce risk by assigning three ranks to the use of such substances: prohibited, reduced, and controlled, as well as by educating chemical substance handlers and managers on laws and regulations and on proper risk assessment.\n\nManaging Chemical Substances in Our Products\n\nHitachi designates the chemical substances in our products requiring management as Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances. With the basic principle of taking as our model the standards of the EU, where regulations are stringent, we determine and manage controlled chemical substances extensively, regardless of export destination, type of industry, or purpose of use. Specifically, we distinguish between prohibited substances (Level 1), which are basically illegal to use inside and outside Japan in products (including packaging) but which might be found in products from suppliers, and controlled substances (Level 2), which includes substances we are required to track and manage the use of and substances requiring attention to recycling or appropriate disposal methods. The list of managed substances and levels is revised when necessary based on updates to the EU\u2019s REACH*1 and other regulations, with the aim of adding substances to the list of Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances six months before they are officially regulated.\n\nBecause perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), its salts, and PFOA-related substances were to be added to the list of restricted substances in the EU\u2019s POPs Regulation*2 in July 2020, we designated them as prohibited substances in a January 2020 revision. As a result, the list of Voluntarily Controlled Chemical Substances now contains 23 prohibited substance groups and 21 controlled substance groups.\n\nManaging Chemical Substances in Our Business Operations\n\nWe have been cutting emissions of chemical substances from our factories and other sites through stricter management, such as by expanding the number and scope of controlled chemical substances. Information on our efforts has been translated into English and Chinese and shared globally with Hitachi Group members. We also follow legally prescribed procedures in measuring and managing emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx),*1 whose measurement is required under the laws and regulations of our business site locations, and are advancing efforts to further restrict emissions.\n\nWe comply with Japan\u2019s Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) Law*2 through Group-wide monitoring of chemical substances released into the atmosphere or into public waters, removed outside our plants as waste, or discharged into sewage systems, reporting the results to local governments for each office or plant. Although some substances are exempt from reporting due to their small quantities, our policy is to aggregate and manage data on the handling, emission, and transfer of all PRTR substances totaling 10 kilograms or more per year.\n\nInitiatives in fiscal 2019 to reduce emissions of chemical substances included switching from paints containing VOCs to water-soluble and powder paints as well as expanding their use and altering the painting and washing processes. These efforts enabled us to successfully achieve our target of reducing atmospheric emissions of chemical substances per unit by 16% compared to fiscal 2010.\n\n*1 Emissions of SOx and NOx: Calculated by multiplying their concentration and exhaust volume.\n*2 PRTR Law: Act on Confirmation, etc. of Release Amounts of Specific Chemical Substances in the Environment and Promotion of Improvements to the Management Thereof.\nEnvironmental Action Plan for 2021 Management Values\n\n**Reduction in Atmospheric Emissions of Chemical Substances per Unit (Hitachi Group)**\n\n- **FY 2010 (base year)**\n  - Emissions: 4,982 t\n  - Activity amount: 100%\n\n- **FY 2019**\n  - Emissions: 3,886 t\n  - Activity amount: 79%\n\n  *21% reduction from base year, FY 2019 reduction target: 16%*\n\n*1 A value closely related to atmospheric emissions of chemical substances at each business site (for example, substances handled, sales, and output).\n\n**Reducing Atmospheric Emissions of Chemical Substances (Hitachi Group)**\n\n| Year | Japan | Rest of Asia (excluding China and Japan) | China | Americas | Europe |\n|------|-------|----------------------------------------|-------|----------|--------|\n| 2015 | 3,615 | 113                                    | 1,272 | 2,561    | 1,130  |\n| 2016 | 4,380 | 1,687                                  | 1,292 | 3,183    | 1,199  |\n| 2017 | 4,391 | 1,718                                  | 1,340 | 3,101    | 1,206  |\n| 2018 | 4,392 | 1,718                                  | 1,340 | 3,101    | 1,206  |\n| 2019 | 3,886 | 1,365                                  | 1,130 | 2,807    | 1,130  |\n\n*1 Since fiscal 2016, the scope of controlled chemical substances has been expanded from 41 to 50 substances.\n\nNote: Atmospheric emissions of VOCs and other chemical substances are calculated from the content rate included in the ingredients.\n\n**Reducing Chemical Substances in Our Business Activities**\n\n| Project | Department, Group company | Activity |\n|---------|---------------------------|----------|\n| Reducing VOC emissions | Hitachi Construction Machinery | Reduction of VOC emissions by changing paints for construction machinery and installing new systems in China |\n| Reducing VOC emissions | Hitachi Automotive Systems | Reduction of atmospheric emissions of VOCs by installing a VOC emissions treatment unit |\n\n[Case Study](https://www.hitachi.com/environment/casestudy/2019/case10.html)\n\n[Case Study](https://www.hitachi.com/environment/casestudy/2019/case11.html)\nPreserving Ecosystems\n\nInitiatives to Preserve Ecosystems\n\nAt Hitachi, we seek to reduce the burden (negative impact) on natural capital caused by business activities and to promote the positive impact, such as by undertaking social contribution activities to protect nature and providing products and services that help preserve the ecosystem, thereby minimizing our impact on natural capital by fiscal 2050 and realizing a harmonized society with nature.\n\nHitachi created an Ecosystem Preservation Activities Menu citing the specific activities to be undertaken to promote the preservation of the ecosystem, including not only CO\u2082 emission reductions, resource recycling, and chemical substances management but also activities that are difficult to quantify but are nonetheless important, such as the protection of rare species and efforts to make biodiversity a criterion when making investment decisions.

This gives us a good grasp of emission hotspots in our value chain and thereby establish effective targets and reductions measures. CO\u2082 accounts for almost all of Hitachi\u2019s GHG emissions, with there being negligible release of other gases, making it all the more important to focus on CO\u2082 reduction efforts.\n\nAn extremely high share (over 80%) of our value chain emissions comes from the use of the products and services we sell. We thus believe that we can make a major contribution to decarbonization through our business operations by giving priority to enhancing the efficiency and energy-saving features of our products and services.\n\nScope 1\nDirect emissions from in-house fuel use and industrial processes\n1.53 Mt-CO\u2082e (1.4%)\n\nScope 2\nIndirect emissions from production of electricity and heat purchased by the company\n2.89 Mt-CO\u2082e (2.6%)\n\nScope 3: Upstream\nOther indirect emissions not covered by Scope 1 and 2\n10.2 Mt-CO\u2082e (9.2%)\n\nScope 3: Downstream\nOther indirect emissions not covered by Scope 1 and 2\n95.91 Mt-CO\u2082e (86.8%)\n\nTotal GHG Emissions\n110.53 Mt-CO\u2082e\n\nIn-house: Within the scope of the company\u2019s organizational boundaries.

The Research & Development Group is focusing on developing top-class digital talent in the field of AI, and intends to increase the number of employees meeting this description from 306 as of the end of fiscal 2019 to 350 by fiscal 2021.\n\nR&D Expenditure\n\n| Year | R&D Expenditure (billion yen) | R&D Expenditure as % of revenue |\n|------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2015 | 333.7                         | 3.3%                            |\n| 2016 | 3,239                         | 3.7%                            |\n| 2017 | 332.9                         | 3.6%                            |\n| 2018 | 323.1                         | 3.4%                            |\n| 2019 | 293.7                         | 3.4%                            |\n| 2020 (planned) | 264.0 | 3.5%                            |\nIntellectual Property\n\nHitachi's 2021 Intellectual Property Mid-term Management Plan\n\nIntellectual property (IP) is a key element of Hitachi's business strategy. Hitachi will promote IP activities to create solutions that enhance value for customers in line with the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, globally deploy the created IP, and contribute to resolving social issues related to the SDGs and Society 5.0 through IP activities.\n\nRegarding solution creation, our Intellectual Property Division takes an active role, by taking part in the solution development process and developing new collaborative creation methods (Patentathons) using patent information as a catalyst to drive solution creation. It also supports the promotion of open innovation activities designed to create solutions, such as Ideathons and Hackathons, from the intellectual property side.\n\nRegarding global deployment of the IP we have created, the division will contribute to the globalization of Hitachi's business by strengthening international patent applications (PCT applications) that cover inventions that were developed through open innovation with our customers and partners in addition to inventions from our own R&D activities.\n\nRegarding solving social issues, in fiscal 2019 Hitachi introduced the \"IP for society\" concept, in which it promotes the use of IP in certain highly public domains to maintain and evolve social norms. Moving forward, we will consider further ways to contribute to resolving social issues through IP, including contributions to combating the spread of COVID-19 through measures such as allowing free use of IP related to products that prevent the spread of infection.\n\nAchievements Since FY 2019\n\nUnder the Social Innovation Business, Hitachi has formulated and implemented an IP strategy that consists of two pillars: IP strategy for competitiveness and IP strategy for collaboration.\n\nIP strategy for competitiveness is centered on acquiring and utilizing patents and other IP rights. \"IP Master Plans\" customized for the nature of each business are formulated and implemented to enforce competitiveness.\n\nIP strategy for collaboration is an IP strategy based on collaboration. As opportunities for collaborative creation with our customers and partners increase through the use of our IoT platform, Lumada, we have expanded the scope of our IP activities to include not only copyrights, patents, and trade secrets but also information assets such as data and information, and are using IP to promote partnerships and build ecosystems.\n\nGlobal IP activities have changed rapidly in recent years due to the emergence of gigantic platform companies and advancement of open innovation. From fiscal 2020 onward, we will evolve our IP strategy by closely examining the circumstances of the \"new normal\" post COVID-19, as well as political, economic, social, and technological trends.\nFramework for IP Activities\n\nWe currently have IP offices in Santa Clara and Detroit in the United States, Beijing in China, London in the United Kingdom, and Singapore to cover our globalized business.\n\nAs a control tower for developing and implementing new IP activities based on the focus sectors and regions for investment under the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, in fiscal 2019 we established the IP Strategy Department within the Intellectual Property Division. The new department plays a central role as a hub in forming a global talent network and works closely with major sites around the world, as well as building close ties with our newly established Corporate Venturing Office in addition to our Strategy Planning Division, the Government and External Relations Group, and the Corporate Brand & Communication Division in Hitachi, Ltd.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, a Data Science Group was launched within the IP Strategy Department. The new group is responsible for cultivating IP data scientists who can use IP AI tools to perform comprehensive analysis of IP information (such as patents) along with non-IP information (such as market and R&D information) and propose management and business strategies by showing present business standings and future projections.\n\nAchievements Since FY 2019\n\nReward System for Employee Inventions\n\nWe motivate employees in the R&D field with an ample reward system for new inventions. To make this reward system as fair and transparent as possible, we set standards to evaluate inventions and disclose these standards to employees. We also have a mechanism for receiving inquiries about the rewards, as well as opinions on the reward system.\n\nWe have established a special department within the Intellectual Property Division to plan and operate this system, while an internal Invention Management Committee made up of R&D, legal affairs, personnel management, and IP experts ensures that the system operates effectively across the whole Group.\n\nInternal Rewards for Inventors\n\n| Invention Information System | System allowing inventors to check the evaluation standards used to calculate rewards for inventions |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Arbitration Committee for Invention Rewards | Committee to which inventors can appeal if they disagree with the amount they have been awarded |\n| Business Contribution Awards Annual Top 100 | President\u2019s awards to the top 100 inventors based on patent rewards received |\n| Patent Contribution Awards Top 50 | Ranking of the top 10 young inventors under 35 years of age based on patent rewards received within five years of their joining Hitachi |\n\nAwards for IP Activities\n\nAt the Intellectual Property Achievement Awards for fiscal 2020, sponsored by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry and the Japan Patent Office, Hitachi, Ltd. received the Award from Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry along with high praise for the establishment of our IP strategies for competitiveness and collaboration as well as our active engagement in IP activities to resolve social issues in advance of competitors. This was our first award since receiving the Award from Commissioner of the Japan Patent Office 28 years ago in 1992, and our first time winning the more prestigious Award from the Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry.\n\nClarivate Analytics also included Hitachi in its Derwent Top 100 Global Innovators for the ninth consecutive year, and the Japan Institute of Invention and Innovation presented Hitachi with the fiscal 2019 Imperial Invention Prize for our design of the Class 800 high-speed train for the UK. This is the third consecutive year that we have received high honors from the National Commendation for Invention, a prestigious Japanese award for invention established in 1919, and the first time that the Imperial Invention Prize, the highest prize offered by the National Commendation for Invention, has been awarded in recognition of outstanding design. Hitachi, Ltd. has received the Imperial Invention Prize eight times in total, more than any other recipient.\n\nProtecting Our Designs and Brand\n\nProtecting Hitachi\u2019s designs and brand is crucial for promoting our Social Innovation Business and supporting our global operations. We take resolute measures against such infringements as making and selling counterfeit goods copying our designs or carrying the Hitachi brand and illegally applying for or registering trademarks similar to the Hitachi brand.\n\nIn recent years, we are taking action to identify counterfeiting networks, whose manufacturing methods and sales channels have become more sophisticated and diverse. We are also working with e-commerce site operators on countermeasures against online counterfeit sales.\nIn order to engender innovation and create new value in a global and digital era, Hitachi is working on attracting, retaining, and developing diverse talent, and transforming its organization to drive sustainable business growth. With due attention paid to respecting the rights of employees, equality of opportunity, occupational health and safety, and employee well-being, we strive to build good relations between employees and the company, including promoting work environments that make employees feel proud and happy to work at Hitachi, and engage in active dialogue regarding employee treatment and career advancement.\n\nIn recognition of the \u201cnew normal\u201d in light of the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, not only are we promoting diverse working styles as a driver of telecommuting innovation, in order to improve productivity and allow employees to use their abilities to the utmost, we are also implementing job descriptions, performance management, and other systems to clarify the role of, expectations for, and output of each employee\u2019s position, and accelerate the pivot to job-based human capital management.\n\n### Core initiatives\n- Develop global human capital\n- Promote people analytics\n- Ensure fair evaluation and compensation\n\n### Goals and KPIs\n- Promoting global human capital management in order to hire, promote, and develop diverse human capital\n\n### Achievements in FY 2019\n- Accelerated the pivot to job-based human capital management in light of the COVID-19 pandemic\n- Undertook initiatives to protect employees from transmission and support telecommuting\n- Trained People Analytics in certain business divisions\n- Established a training system for digital transformation and a range of digital talent training programs targeting different positions\n- Strengthened recruitment at the Indian Institutes of Technology and other top-class universities around the world\n### What we are doing\n\n#### Core initiatives\n\n- Review our systems and operations in light of the Statement on Diversity and Inclusion\n- Expand hiring of people with disabilities\n- Promote work-life reform\n- Enhance work-life management support systems\n- Develop support systems that meet diverse employee needs\n- Establish occupational health and safety management systems\n- Prevent work-related accidents\n- Provide support for staying mentally and physically healthy\n- Respect the rights of employees\n- Foster employee-management dialogue\n\n#### Goals and KPIs\n\n- Achieving a 10% ratio of both female and non-Japanese executive and corporate officers by fiscal 2020\n- Increasing the number of female managers in Japan to 800 by fiscal 2020 (twice the number at the end of fiscal 2012)\n- Promotion of work-life management\n- Achieving zero fatal accidents by the end of fiscal 2021, reducing lost-time accidents globally by 50% compared to the previous year\n- Deepening mutual understanding through dialogue between employees and management\n\n#### Achievements in FY 2019\n\n- Held the 6th Hitachi Group Women Leaders\u2019 Meeting\n- Held the 4th Global Women\u2019s Summit\n- Strengthened support for balancing work and nursing care with initiatives such as a seminar for all employees aged 40 and over on how to balance work and nursing care\n- Launched a child-care matching service in collaboration with company-led nurseries\n- Established the Safety Management Division\n- Established the Health and Productivity Management Promotion Office (in April 2020)\n- Engaged in continuous employee-management dialogue\n\n#### Key SDGs\n\n- Human Capital\n- Core initiatives\n- Diversity and inclusion\n- Work-life management\n- Occupational health and safety\n- Freedom of association and collective bargaining\n\n---\n\n**Hitachi Sustainability Report 2020**\n\n**Contents**\n\n**Introduction**\n\n**Management**\n\n**Environmental**\n\n**Social**\n\n**Governance**\n\n**Assurance**\n\n**Hitachi Sustainability Report 2020**\nGlobal Human Capital Management\n\nDeveloping Global Human Capital\n\nHitachi\u2019s 2021 HR Strategy, based on its 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, is designed to allow the company\u2019s diverse global team to grow through their work, feel proud and happy about working at Hitachi, respect diverse values, and contribute to the creation of safe and vibrant workplaces each in their own way. Alongside this, we are striving to cultivate a common Hitachi Group Identity in all employees worldwide, along with the values of Harmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit that comprise the Hitachi Founding Spirit, so that we can work as One Hitachi across countries, regions, and divisions to contribute to society. To this end, we are advancing a variety of enhanced measures around the four key concepts of \u201cTalent,\u201d \u201cCulture,\u201d \u201cOrganization,\u201d and \u201cHR Transformation.\u201d\n\nIn recognition of the \u201cnew normal\u201d in light of the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we are also making telecommuting standard for a wide range of positions. As well as promoting diverse working styles as a driver of telecommuting innovation, in order to improve productivity and allow employees to use their abilities to the utmost, we are implementing job descriptions, performance management, and other systems to clarify the role of, expectations for, and output of each employee\u2019s position, and accelerate the pivot to job-based human capital management.\n\nDeveloping Global Human Capital Structure\n\nIn order to become a world leader in the Social Innovation Business, we believe it is important to maintain high engagement across countries and regions as well as companies and establish diverse human capital and a working environment that maximizes personal and organizational performance. Based on this idea, we have developed a global human capital management strategy. We hire, promote, and develop human capital via global human capital management that uses unified performance evaluation criteria and offers a common leadership development program for employees around the world.\n\nIn addition, as a way of integrating the various existing measures for the management of global human capital, we have built a platform containing an array of information about the skills, career orientations, and other aspects of our human capital. We use the platform for globally optimized placement, identifying and nurturing management leaders of the future, and strengthening manager-employee communication.\n\nFrom fiscal 2019, Levent Arabaci, general manager of our global human capital division has also served as chief transformation officer of global operations. Initiatives he has led in this role include using global shared services to standardize and optimize shared work within the Group, drastic operational reforms on the back of increased diversity, business process re-engineering using cutting-edge digital technologies within and outside the company, and optimal deployment of talent.\n\nAdditionally, in order to change the awareness and behavior of employees as we seek to reinvent ourselves as a global leader in the Social Innovation Business, we reconsidered our competencies. Our new focus will be on competencies in line with both Hitachi\u2019s Corporate Credo and the Founding Spirit. These will be used as shared behavioral objectives to unite diverse human capital and organizations as we seek to raise awareness of Hitachi\u2019s corporate culture globally.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nFrom fiscal 2019, Levent Arabaci, general manager of our global human capital division has also served as chief transformation officer of global operations.

Evaluations have tended to be based on the experience or intuition of the evaluator. However, with People Analytics, which uses IT such as AI and data analysis, optimal initiatives based on objective indicators and analysis can be promulgated. Not only does this allow the human resources to follow the development of each and every individual employee, it can also contribute to management by activating human capital.\n\nIn concrete terms, this means conducting a survey based on a unique psychological scale constructed under the academic guidance of the University of Tsukuba, then making use of AI in analyzing the awareness of individuals and job assignment and behavioral data arising from the survey\u2019s results. This makes it possible to provide individual employees with insight encouraging a change in behavior, streamline human capital placement, and otherwise formulate more effective and precise human resources initiatives.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, as well as trialing People Analytics in certain business divisions, we formulated a plan for expanding the scope of its implementation. From fiscal 2020, we will expand its deployment to more business divisions in Japan. We will also begin planning for a global rollout of People Analytics across the entire Group.\n\nEnsuring Fair Evaluation and Compensation\n\nWe believe that a fair global system of employee evaluation and compensation is essential for attracting diverse and highly engaged human capital regardless of nationality. Accordingly, we have established a Global Compensation Philosophy shared by all Group companies based on the principles of ensuring market competitiveness, pay for performance, and maintaining transparency.\n\nWe have developed a performance-based compensation system for full-time, regular employees that is fair and competitive in the context of the labor market for each national or region industry. Each employee\u2019s compensation is set based on an annual performance review. Feedback on this review is also provided as fuel for further development.\n\nWe ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and region in which we operate when determining compensation. Starting pay for new graduates in Japan\u2014which accounts for about half of the Group\u2019s full-time, regular employees\u2014is roughly 20% higher than the weighted average of Japan\u2019s regional minimum wages.\n\nConducting a Global Employee Survey\n\nWe conduct an annual global employee survey called Hitachi Insights as a way of measuring employee engagement. In September 2019, the survey was administered for the seventh time. Around 200,000 employees worldwide were sent the survey in one of 14 different languages, and roughly 180,000 responses were received. This represents a response rate of 87%, the highest since the survey was first performed in 2013. Results continue to improve, with an overall approval rating of 61% (1% higher than last year, 7% higher than 2013) and an engagement indicator of 60% (unchanged from last year, 7% higher than 2013). Moving forward, senior management and managers on site will confirm the survey results for their own organizations and, through communication with team members, take concrete action through the PDCA cycle, further enhancing the level of engagement.\n\n*1 Hitachi uses the term \u201cengagement\u201d to refer to employees\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s strategies and policies, as well as their job satisfaction and desire to take actions on their own initiative to bring about results.\nPromoting the \u201cMake a Difference!\u201d Idea Contest\n\nHitachi believes that changing the awareness of each and every employee is necessary for achieving the corporate reforms needed to steadfastly uphold our medium- to long-term vision. We therefore launched the \u201cMake a Difference!\u201d idea contest for all employees around the theme of the \u201cI will\u201d mindset. This is designed to encourage participant growth, not only through a change in perspective as their ideas are linked to real experience in creating new businesses, but also by providing an opportunity for employees to think for themselves, make decisions, and see a project through to completion. For some prize-winning ideas, the verification experiment process has already begun. In fiscal 2019, 741 ideas were received.\n\nCountermeasures Against the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nAmid the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, ensuring the health and safety of all employees is our highest priority as we strive to prevent the spread of the virus. As well as promoting telecommuting for, in principle, all positions except those requiring a physical presence for society to function, we are undertaking initiatives to protect employees from transmission and support telecommuting.\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s impact is global, and our countermeasures in each region are informed by the conditions around regional headquarters. Hitachi Europe surveyed telecommuting employees to find out what they needed, and developed an action plan to provide it. At Hitachi India, an e-learning course on COVID-19 was created and shared to raise awareness of the virus and how employees can prevent its spread.\n\nWe also used the \u201cMake a Difference!\u201d platform to gather ideas globally across the Group for new workstyles or ways Hitachi employees could come together as one and contribute to society. This project, titled \u201cChallenge to COVID-19,\u201d attracted some 1,430 ideas from around the world.\n\nOne proposal involving support via crowdfunding for small business owners affected by the pandemic has already been adopted. Regarding the other proposals, after discussion with relevant divisions, the decision was made to divide them among 15 themes for further consideration of their feasibility. In concrete terms, regarding social contribution activities, we will promote activities such as providing online education to children; as contributions utilizing Hitachi\u2019s technology, we are preparing for the implementation of systems and products leading the way to a new lifestyle predicated on prevention of infection.\n\nHitachi, Ltd.\u2019s Main Policies Supporting New Workstyles for the \u201cNew Normal\u201d\n\n| Support for employees based on immediate risk of transmission | Financial support for purchases necessary to prevent transmission | 3,000 JPY per month per person toward the cost of telecommuting or, if working at the office, preventing transmission via masks, disinfectant, etc. |\n| Financial support for purchase of telecommuting equipment | Financial support for the purchase of IT devices, work desks, chairs, and other equipment for telecommuting |\n| Establishment of Novel Coronavirus Countermeasure Allowance | For employees who work in environments where risk of transmission is thought to be high, an allowance of 500\u20131,000 JPY per day depending on the level of risk |\n| Deployment of Inbound Medical Assistance Services for foreign employees working in Japan | In addition to a 24-hour, year-round call center offering medical assistance in 16 languages for foreign employees and their families in Japan, including referrals and appointments to medical facilities and arrangements for emergency transport and hospitalization, translation via telephone and other services |\n| Main policies for supporting medium- to long-term telecommutings | IT environment improvements | Improvement of remote access environment, lending laptops for telecommuting, etc. |\n| | Appropriate health support for long-term telecommuters | Remote counseling by occupational physicians and other medical staff, provision via intranet of information for staying mentally and physically healthy, etc. |\n| | Provision of tools for stimulating communication | Using Hitachi\u2019s unique \u201chappiness level,\u201d which measures people\u2019s feelings of contentment, to stimulate communication |\nTalent Development\n\nHitachi's Approach to Talent Development\n\nHitachi has traditionally placed great emphasis on developing talent, including the establishment of the Apprenticeship Training School, predecessor of today's Hitachi Industrial Skills Academy, in 1910, the year of Hitachi's own founding. The pedagogical principles established in 1959 as our Educational Guidelines emphasized the spirit of y\u016bshiki (guidance through assistance) and jiky\u014d (endeavor through one's own efforts).\n\nThat spirit has been inherited to the present day. In addition to on-site training through work tasks, we are also expanding education globally across the Group to improve individual capabilities, skills, and specialties. We will continue to support the growth of each and every individual employee with the goal of developing talent who can contribute to resolving social issues.\n\nManagement-level Leadership Development\n\nHitachi believes that innovation in talent management to resolve the diverse challenges of global society is essential to increasing social, environmental, and economic value, making it vital to develop the management-level leadership who will drive this innovation and change. For this reason, we approach management-level leadership development as a medium- to long-term initiative with the president and CEO and Nominating Committee playing a central role.\n\nWhen developing candidates for appointment in the next and subsequent term to executive positions including president, CxO, and division head, several hundred candidates are selected from the Hitachi Group's human capital around the world and given both on-the-job training (OJT), including stretch assignments, and off-the-job training (Off-JT) such as external training and coaching.\n\nWe also select a \u201cFuture 50\u201d of around 50 outstanding emerging employees as future candidates for management-level leadership. By giving this Future 50 tough assignments and opportunities for direct discussion with independent directors, we accelerate their development in a focused manner.\n\nGlobal Management Training\n\nWe are globalizing our talent development programs in accordance with global talent management strategy to develop management-level human capital.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we launched the Global Group Executive Development Course (Global GEC) for new leaders of Hitachi subsidiaries outside Japan. This e-learning course, attended by 100 people in fiscal 2019, fosters a basic understanding of Hitachi\u2019s management and provides the latest information for advancing our Social Innovation Business. We are continuously developing new programs to foster human capital.\n\nManagement Training Currently Offered Globally\n\n- **Global Leadership Acceleration Program for Key Positions (GAP-K)**: Selective training held for 3 months in India and Japan to accelerate development of future management candidates. Attended by 30 people from 8 countries.\n- **Global Advanced Program for Leadership Development (GAP-L)**: Held twice a year with the aim of developing the superior leadership, mindset, and skill necessary to drive Hitachi's global development. Attended by around 60 local leaders from 19 countries expected to perform well in overseas subsidiaries.\n- **Global Leadership Acceleration Program for Managers (GAP-M)**: Ready to Lead (R2L): Leadership training with globally unified content for general managers and new managers. In fiscal 2019, held in 8 regions and attended by around 3,000 participants.\n\nNumber of Participants of Global Management Training Programs\n\n| Year | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 3,362| 3,320| 3,821| 3,844| 4,063|\n\n(people)\nDeveloping Digital Talent\n\nTo accelerate our Social Innovation Business using digital technologies, we are working to develop human capital that can lead a digital transformation. We are increasing the amount of digital talent across the entire Hitachi Group from 30,000 employees in fiscal 2019 to 37,000 in fiscal 2021. At the end of April 2020, we had around 2,000 data scientists with specialist knowledge of data analysis, including AI, IoT, and the utilization of big data, and we are aiming to increase that number to 3,000 by fiscal 2021 as we expand our global digital solutions.\n\nAiming to further develop and strengthen our digital talent, we consolidated our various training institutes into the Hitachi Academy in April 2019, and are currently constructing a training system for developing human capital to drive digital transformation. In fiscal 2019, we established a training system for digital transformation and a range of digital talent training programs targeting different positions, focusing on developing world-leading human capital and digital talent in order to accelerate our Social Innovation Business. We also strengthened recruitment at the Indian Institutes of Technology and other top-class universities around the world.\n\nThrough a development policy that combines knowledge and skill obtained by participating in training with OJT, we will strengthen our digital talent development along the twin axes of broader fundamental training and specialist development.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\n- Providing Younger Employees with Overseas Experience Activities\n  - Hitachi maintains a broad array of programs to systematically cultivate and secure people who can succeed in global business. To develop the careers of people capable of understanding and adapting to local cultures and lifestyles, we offer a program enabling younger employees in Japan to live and work in another country. We have dispatched more than 5,000 Group employees in total, allowing them to take part in over 80 programs designed to promote understanding of other cultures and to engage in language studies, local field studies, and internships, as well as to provide opportunities to work with local people to resolve social issues. In fiscal 2019, we moved to encouraging employees to engage in opportunities for leadership training to accelerate the development of employees ready to take on global challenges.\n\n- Career Development Support in Japan Activities\n  - Hitachi has developed a broad range of career development support that focuses on employees\u2019 \u201cinternal careers,\u201d namely, their individual values and views on the significance and meaning of their work. By ensuring that individuals can fulfill their potential and maximize their creativity and linking individual growth to positive outcomes and growth for the organization, we enhance our corporate value. Along with promoting self-understanding and fostering strong individuals with the independence and autonomy to think and act for themselves, we are also providing support to create a framework that will capitalize on the engagement and motivation of individual employees and to enhance mutual understanding as a way of fostering the teamwork needed to enhance organizational strength and performance.\n\n  - Recognizing the importance of maximizing individual and organizational performance as we seek to become a major global player, we implement Global Performance Management (GPM) grounded in diversity and the individual, thereby promoting career development with respect for each employee\u2019s individuality and personal aspirations.\n\n  - In concrete terms, based on the idea that the center of career development is the work that employees perform daily in the workplace, we implement a cycle aimed at the growth of each employee through a process in which goals for daily tasks are set and then pursued, followed by evaluation of the results to formulate the next objectives. We call this Global Performance Management, and it includes the following initiatives.\nGlobal Performance Management\n\n| Performance planning | After consulting with their supervisors to reach a consensus on short-term objectives, employees work with supervisor guidance and support. At the end of the fiscal year, they consult with supervisors on whether these objectives were met and set new ones for next fiscal year. |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Career consultation  | Employees meet with supervisors to discuss medium- and long-term career plans regarding such matters as requests for transfers or overseas postings.                                                                 |\n\nWe also provide direct support for individual career development through a career development program that supports workplace communication. This program is the Hitachi Career Development Workshop (H-CDW). Through self-analysis work, participants consider the direction they should proceed in, their career goals, and their career path, and then engage in self-directed efforts to develop their career and abilities. Around 13,900 people have participated in the program so far (as of March 31, 2020), with a focus on technicians, managers, and researchers in their 30s. In addition to those programs, Hitachi also offers programs targeting specific age groups, such as career education for younger employees and training for middle-aged or older employees to help them prepare for the changes ahead in their careers.\n\nWe also operate a Career Counseling Center as part of our career development support. At the center, employees can speak with professional counselors about any concerns they have regarding their work, their career, or interpersonal relationships, in order to help them seek a solution themselves.\n\nInitiatives at Regional Headquarters to Develop Employee Skills\n\nHitachi is a company with global operations, so its skills development programs are implemented primarily by its regional headquarters in keeping with the focus of each region\u2019s business operations and cultural environment. Through these efforts, we seek to identify and nurture the human capital who will become Hitachi\u2019s leaders globally across the Group.\n\n- **Hitachi America, Ltd.**: An individualized e-learning platform is used alongside a Global management training program for employees aspiring to become global leaders. HR business partners work with managers at Hitachi Vantara Corp.\u2014the core of Hitachi\u2019s digital solutions\u2014to assess employee skills and capabilities while helping employees set and achieve their personal goals.\n\n- **Hitachi Asia Ltd.**: A regional program to enhance the knowledge and skills needed to grow Hitachi\u2019s business in Asia is implemented in addition to making full use of Global management training courses and an e-learning platform for general employees. Training roadmaps to develop employee knowledge, skill sets, and competencies are created to achieve optimal work performance.\n\n- **Hitachi (China) Ltd.**: The growth of all employees is promoted through a training system catering to different levels of development, enabling workers to develop the specialized and comprehensive skills they need to perform their jobs. Global training materials and the e-learning platform for general employees are expanded with content to help employees acquire the skills and knowledge.\n\n- **Hitachi Europe Ltd.**: Employees across Europe can develop their skills through classroom lectures and online classes, enabling them to acquire professional qualifications in cultural awareness, presentation skills, and IT desktop skills. Global management training and other programs bring together Hitachi leaders in Europe, helping build an important network in support of One Hitachi.\n\n- **Hitachi India Pvt. Ltd.**: L&D Committee consists of senior executives and meets twice a year to discuss training programs. Employees are encouraged to build skill sets by making full use of Global management training courses and the e-learning platform for general employees. Advances through self-learning were made while employees worked from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the top-performing employees were honored by Hitachi India.\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nToward Achieving Diversity and Inclusion\n\nHitachi has composed a Statement on Diversity and Inclusion and strives to create an environment where diverse human capital can exercise its potential to the fullest. Furthermore, we continually review our systems and operations in light of this statement.\n\nStatement on Diversity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity and Inclusion Open Our Future\n\nDiversity is the wellspring of our innovation and our growth engine. Hitachi regards personal differences\u2014such as gender, nationality, race, religion, background, age, and sexual orientation\u2014as well as other differences, as facets of people\u2019s individuality. By respecting our employees\u2019 individualities and positioning them as an advantage, Hitachi frames its diversity and inclusion as conducive to both the individual\u2019s and the company\u2019s sustainable growth. With a diverse workforce, strong teamwork and broad experience in the global market, we will meet our customers\u2019 needs.\n\nDiversity Management Promotion Framework\n\nHitachi has created a Diversity & Inclusion Development Center to promote its diversity initiatives, including support for diverse human capital and work-life management. The center acts as a secretariat managing the Advisory Committee and Diversity Development Council, which are operated jointly by Hitachi, Ltd. and 15 Group companies. The Advisory Committee ensures follow-through on our diversity management policy, while the Diversity Development Council discusses specific activities and shares best practices. Both meet every six months.\n\nGroup companies and business sites are also advancing diversity management in accordance with their challenges and circumstances. To this end, they have set up their own diversity-promotion organizations and projects, such as those to help develop women\u2019s careers, in order to enhance initiatives geared to the challenges faced by individual workplaces.\n\nAmong global diversity initiatives, the achievement of gender equality across the entire Group has been identified as needing particular attention, and initiatives like our Global Women\u2019s Summit are underway across the Group.\n\nWe also hold regular meetings to exchange opinions on diversity with labor unions.\n\nHitachi Diversity Structure\n\nAdvisors:\nExternal directors\n\nAdvisory Committee:\nChief Human Resource Officer (CHRO)\nExecutive officers and general managers in charge of personnel affairs and labor administration in Group companies\nGeneral managers in charge of personnel affairs and labor administration in business units\n\nHitachi Group Diversity Development Council\nSection managers in charge of personnel affairs and labor administration in Group companies, business units, and business groups/sites\n\nDiversity & Inclusion Development Center (dedicated organization)\nHuman Capital Group\n\n* Participating enterprises (15 companies as of March 2020): Hitachi Chemical, Hitachi Metals, Hitachi Construction Machinery, Hitachi High-Tech, Hitachi Urban Investment, Hitachi Industrial Products, Hitachi Automotive Systems, Hitachi Global Life Solutions, Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems, Hitachi Systems, Hitachi Solutions, Hitachi Insurance Services, Hitachi Life, Hitachi Capital, Hitachi Transport System\n\nOrganizations and projects at companies and business groups/sites to advance diversity (including issues related to women in workplace)\n\nAround 50 projects\nKPIs for Promoting Diversity\n\nWith the aim of increasing diversity among executive officers and managers, Hitachi, Ltd. has created the following two key performance indicators (KPIs). These demonstrate our commitment both internally and to the world to supporting diverse human capital and enhancing diverse management.\n\nGoals for Hitachi, Ltd. (KPIs)\n\n- Achieve a 10% ratio of both female and non-Japanese executive officers and corporate officers by fiscal 2020.\n- Increase the number of female managers in Japan to 800 by fiscal 2020 (twice the number at the end of fiscal 2012).\n\nTo achieve these goals, as well as reinforcing existing programs, we introduced the Hitachi Group Women\u2019s Career Success Survey to highlight progress with initiatives and outstanding issues in each business division and to set numerical targets for each division, strengthening our management commitment. We will also boost women\u2019s individual ambitions and morale through programs such as the Hitachi Group Women Leaders\u2019 Meeting and the Roundtable Conference with Female Independent Directors, which support female employees at the supervisory level and above. We intend to create an environment where as many women as possible are able to optimize their potential in management positions.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nThe 6th Hitachi Group Women Leaders\u2019 Meeting was held in February 2020. The meeting was attended by 31 women newly appointed to managerial positions in Hitachi Group companies within Japan. A lecture by an external expert and a roundtable on the theme \u201cProactive Career Building and Behavioral Change\u201d promoted a lively exchange of views between participants, and each participant announced a personal action plan and statement to further encourage behavioral change at the workplace.\n\nAlongside these efforts, we are working to change the mindset of managers and male staff regarding gender parity and examining our working style as a whole with the aim of transforming our corporate culture. Employee compensation is set according to each individual\u2019s roles and achievements, with no divisions or differences based on gender or age.\nRatios for Male/Female and Japanese/Non-Japanese Directors (Hitachi, Ltd.) (as of July 2020)\n\n| Item          | Total | Male | Female | Japanese | Non-Japanese |\n|---------------|-------|------|--------|----------|--------------|\n| Directors     | 13    | 11   | 2      | 7        | 6            |\n| Ratio (%)     | 84.6  | 15.4 | 53.8   | 46.2     |              |\n\nBasic Salary and Total Individual Compensation for Female and Male Managers at Hitachi, Ltd.

To encourage attendance by as many employees as possible, the summit takes place at a different country of the world each year. The meeting for fiscal 2019 was held in October in Japan\u2014the fourth country, following the United Kingdom, the United States, and Singapore\u2014and was attended by around 180 executives and employees from 17 countries and regions. During the meeting, President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara and a female independent director made speeches, and panel discussions were held featuring prominent leaders from regional offices. At workshops and networking dinners, participants deepened their engagement with each other, exchanging information and career advice. Newly added this year were a program for both male and female employees and a panel discussion involving male executives, offering all participants, male or female, an opportunity to consider gender parity in the workplace.\n\nExpanding Hiring of People with Disabilities\n\nHitachi, Ltd. and Group companies in Japan have worked hard to employ people with disabilities, such as by holding a special hiring fair and study meetings for Group companies to share information. We have also worked to expand the range of employment opportunities for people with disabilities, coordinating with special subsidiaries to develop new positions for such individuals in IT. As a result, as of June 2020 the employment ratio of people with disabilities was 2.33% at Hitachi, Ltd.*1 and 2.38% for the entire Group in Japan. Both of these figures exceed Japan\u2019s legally required employment rate of 2.2%.\n\nB-BBEE Initiatives in South Africa\n\nAs Hitachi expands its business in South Africa, it pursues activities aligned with the country\u2019s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE)*1 policies to create employment and economic development. As of the end of fiscal 2019, Hitachi Construction Machinery Southern Africa has achieved a B-BBEE rating of level 4, while Hitachi Vantara has reached level 5.\n\n*1 B-BBEE: Companies and organizations in South Africa are scored on their B-BBEE initiatives and contributions and rated on a scale from level 1 (highest) to 8 or as being \u201cnon-compliant.\u201d\nWork-Life Management\n\nHitachi goes beyond \u201cwork-life balance,\u201d in which employees are simply urged to balance work and private life, to promote \u201cwork-life management,\u201d which encourages employees to proactively take charge of improving the quality of both their work and private lives. We believe that practicing work-life management will enrich employees\u2019 work and private lives, enhance professionalism, and build personal character, resulting in both individual and organizational growth over the long term. Based on this philosophy, we have established systems to support work-life reforms and a balance between employees\u2019 work and private lives.\n\nPromoting Work-Life Reform\n\nHitachi, Ltd. promotes a companywide work-life reform initiative, \u201cHitachi Work Life Innovation,\u201d to develop workstyles allowing talent from diverse backgrounds to work with enthusiasm and demonstrate strong performance.\n\nIn order to put work-life reform into practice, it was determined that reform of administrative operations at the company\u2019s headquarters was necessary. To that end, we implemented a review of our own business operations and processes.\n\nToday, 70% of all full-time, regular Hitachi employees take advantage of our telecommuting and satellite office work programs, including managerial-level employees, flex workers, and career-track employees who need to balance work with child care or nursing care. The programs do not require the applicants to come into the office for a certain amount of time, nor are there any limitations on the number of times for doing so, allowing employees to work from wherever they need to be for child care or nursing care. If posted away from their families, they can work from their family home. We are also rolling out location-free work for managerial-level employees, allowing them to perform their duties from anywhere when approved by the company. To further enhance our telecommuting and satellite office work programs, since fiscal 2020 we have added balance between work and medical care as grounds for program use, and made the programs available to all employees meeting the necessary conditions.\n\nWork-Life Innovation Initiatives at Hitachi, Ltd.\n\n| Initiative | Key components |\n|------------|----------------|\n| Top commitment | Send message within company |\n| Review of operations and processes | Reform administrative operations at headquarters, Clarify rules for outgoing email, Use support tool designed to optimize meeting durations and participant numbers and improve meeting efficiency |\n| Strengthening of workplace management | Increase operational transparency using in-house consultants (experience-oriented approach), Improve attendance management system for compliance rule enforcement |\n| Promotion of time- and location-independent work practices | Expand telecommuting program, Create environments where internal wireless local area network (LAN) can be accessed safely, Distribute around 30,000 IT tools to support paperless and online meetings, Roll out location-independent work for managerial-level employees, Expand satellite office network (88 sites as of March 2020, with over 50,000 monthly users across the entire Hitachi Group) |\n| Companywide promotional tactics | Put up posters, create intranet site, Share best practices by giving awards |\n\nEnhancing Work-Life Management Support Systems\n\nHitachi, Ltd. introduced and expanded an array of programs to support work-life balance, striving to create a more friendly working environment. We have distributed an Allowance for Balancing Child Care and Work; launched \"Hokatsu Concierge,\" an information-providing service supporting the search for a nursery; and provided a child-care matching service in collaboration with company-led nurseries. Through these kinds of support, we offer an environment where work and parenting can be balanced with peace of mind.\n\nAdditionally, with Japan\u2019s society continuing to age, it is expected that more employees will be involved in caring for their elderly family members. We have, therefore, declared the years from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2020 a period to focus on reinforcement of work and nursing care balance support, and are expanding programs. We have established a new \u201cPoints for Balancing Nursing Care and Work\u201d system strengthening financial support for employees. We also conducted awareness surveys and work-life support seminars to encourage employees and provide information to prepare for this issue, emphasizing the importance of balancing work with nursing care and conveying practical know-how on the topic.\nSometimes employees quit their job unexpectedly due to caregiving obligations when better information on nursing care might have helped them balance those obligations with work. To prevent such outcomes, Hitachi, Ltd. held a seminar for all employees aged 40 and over on how to balance work and nursing care. Anticipating that their families might also need such information, we also created the Handbook on Balancing Work and Caregiving, which includes the basic information provided in the seminar along with case studies on using support systems and services, and distributed a copy to each employee\u2019s home.\n\nIn Japan, to support a more balanced approach between work and parenting, in fiscal 2020 we launched a child-care matching service in collaboration with company-led nurseries. This service enables employees who are looking for a nursery for their children to apply for admission to a company-led nursery, created with the help of the Cabinet Office\u2019s support program, thereby expediting an early return to work for employees on maternity or child-care leave.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nIn-House Child-Care Centers\n\nHitachi, Ltd., in collaboration with its labor union, has set up in-house child-care facilities with capacity for approximately 70 children in its Yokohama Office as a way to support employees in balancing work with child care.\n\nSupport Systems that Meet Diverse Employee Needs\n\nTo respond to the diverse lifestyles and needs of its employees, Hitachi, Ltd. has provided a wide range of support through welfare benefits that includes a Cafeteria Plan program, housing support such as dormitory and family housing and a housing allowance system, allowances for balancing work with child care and nursing care, a property accumulation promotion system, an employee stock ownership program, retirement and pension plans, group insurance, a consolation payment system, internal sales, cultural and physical education activities, and employee cafeterias.\n\nThe Cafeteria Plan allows employees to select the benefits they receive, depending on individual lifestyles and needs, from a list of options, such as skills development, child care, nursing care, health promotion, and donations. Employees can use their Cafeteria Points to select the type of support they need when they need it.\n\nFor our retirement and pension plans, defined contribution and defined benefit plans have been introduced across the Hitachi Group in response to the diversification of lifestyles among the elderly and the changes in forms of employment.\n\nStarting in fiscal 2020, we expanded the scope of our support systems to recognize same-sex partners of employees. Considering the intent of laws around equal pay for equal work, we are expanding the scope of some support systems to cover limited-term contract employees as well.\nInitiatives at Regional Headquarters to Create a Good Working Environment\n\nThe Statement on Diversity and Inclusion guides Hitachi\u2019s endeavors to create work environments that allow our diverse range of human capital to work with enthusiasm and to support workstyles that are conducive to each employee achieving their full potential. Region-specific policies are also implemented by our regional headquarters.\n\n- **Hitachi America, Ltd.**: Initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion include a mentor program and webinars to share the experiences of employee role models. Of the employees promoted between January and early August 2020, 36% were women. New hires during the same span were about one-third women, and half were ethnic minorities. Nearly 30% of minority employees have reached the level of director or higher.\n\n- **Hitachi Asia Ltd.**: Efforts to make Hitachi Asia the best place to work in Asia include providing equal opportunities for all employees and creating workplaces that foster and retain outstanding human capital. Emphasis is placed on employee engagement aimed at promoting teamwork and recognizing the importance of human capital diversity. The concerns of employees\u2019 families are also considered, such as by offering flexible working hours to enable a better work-life balance and providing fringe benefits for family members.\n\n- **Hitachi (China) Ltd.**: Activities are being promoted to strengthen inter-divisional cooperation. A group of mainly younger employees are asked to introduce their division\u2019s work to workers in other divisions to deepen understanding and encourage collaborative creation across divisions. The activities were launched in fiscal 2019 with the participation of 27 employees, and the network built through these activities has contributed to smoother business operations. Plans for fiscal 2020 include increasing the frequency of meetings and holding them online.\n\n- **Hitachi Europe Ltd.**: In addition to conducting a Global Employee Survey, Hitachi Europe independently implements a survey targeting employees who choose to leave the company. Their reasons are analyzed, and measures to reduce attrition are formulated. Support is provided to employees\u2019 philanthropic activities, with auctions and sporting events being organized to benefit a charity selected by a vote among employees each year. An online program was implemented in Germany to promote the health of employees working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n- **Hitachi India Pvt. Ltd.**: To ensure the safety of female employees, those traveling on business or leaving work after 7:00 p.m. in the summer and 6:00 p.m. in the winter are permitted to use the company car or a taxi. Measures to support employees working from home during the COVID-19 outbreak are being expanded, such as by using a cellphone app offering online meditation and yoga sessions.\nOccupational Health and Safety\n\nBasic Principle for Occupational Health and Safety\n\nEnsuring the health and safety of all employees is the basic principle underlying the Hitachi Group Health and Safety Policy, which is shared by all Hitachi Group companies around the world. Employees work together to create healthy, safe, and secure work environments that aim to be accident free.\n\nHitachi Group Health and Safety Policy\n\n\"Health and Safety Always Comes First.\"\n\nPolicies\n\nIn accordance with our mission, \"Contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products,\" the Hitachi Group will endeavor to ensure safe and healthy workplaces under the principle of \"Health and Safety Always Comes First.\"\n\nTo accomplish this, we will:\n\n1. Continually be involved in health and safety activities in order to prevent work-related injuries and sickness by designating the health and safety of employees as management's top priority.\n2. Comply with the local laws and regulations in each company regarding health and safety.\n3. Develop a safe and comfortable work environment by encouraging employees to maintain their own health and taking a proactive stance on health and safety activities in the workplace.\n4. Require an understanding of Hitachi's principle and the promotion of health and safety awareness from all business partners of the Hitachi Group.\n5. Contribute to the creation of a safe and pleasant society by emphasizing activities that make health and safety a top priority in all of Hitachi's business activities.\n\nRevised November 2013\n\nEstablishing Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems\n\nHitachi, Ltd. is committed to building an organization in which employees can promote safety activities of their own accord. To this end, in April 2019, we established a Safety Management Division that reports directly to the president. This division holds an annual Safety Strategy Congress, attended by safety officers from each Group company and representatives from each division, to set budgets and objectives for companywide safety strategy, review ongoing efforts to improve occupational health and safety management systems, and share the clear commitment from top management to make protecting the health and safety of employees their top priority. The state of occupational health and safety management, including important health and safety issues, is reported regularly to the Senior Executive Committee and meetings of Group company presidents.\n\nIn addition, the Safety Strategy Promotion Council, attended by safety department managers from each business unit and Group company, examines the promotional frameworks for safety activities and education in each division alongside standards to be shared across the Group.\n\nIn Japan, a health and safety commission\u2014composed of business owners, labor union officials, and employees\u2014is convened at each business site every month to discuss and share information related to such issues as work-related accident cause analysis and countermeasures and health and safety activities in light of the situation regarding employees who have taken sick leave.\n\nIn fiscal 2019 senior management at Hitachi, Ltd. held one-on-one meetings with the CEOs of each business unit and Group company presidents to reinforce their commitment to health and safety management.\n\nWe also introduced an Incident Investigation System as a tool for analyzing occupational accidents to be commonly used across the Hitachi Group and intend to roll it out globally.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\n- In fiscal 2019 senior management at Hitachi, Ltd. held one-on-one meetings with the CEOs of each business unit and Group company presidents to reinforce their commitment to health and safety management.\n\nGoals for Hitachi, Ltd. (KPIs)\n\n- Achieving zero fatal accidents by the end of fiscal 2021; reducing lost-time accidents globally by 50% compared to the previous year.\nTo prevent work-related accidents among employees, Hitachi sets and applies its own safety standards to be observed at manufacturing sites around the globe as well as advancing health and safety measures tailored to the operations of individual companies. In particular, under the Safety Management Division, we have worked to improve our safety measures in terms of both policy, by examining and improving our risk assessment frameworks, and technology, by using IT and digital technology to prevent accidents.\n\nAdditionally, because the risk of accident is higher for workers not yet accustomed to their work or environment, employees and temporary workers receive individual health and safety training and on-the-job training before work begins, to help prevent accidents by ensuring that they understand work procedures and dangers. We are also working to build an education system that meets the requirements of the occupational health and safety management system integrated across the Group\u2019s operations worldwide. At each business site, the system will provide training for safety administrators at each organizational level and safety training for specific hazardous work activities as appropriate for organizational structure or business type.\n\nOn occasions of business restructuring, we share the details of the health and safety management frameworks and initiatives of the organizations to be merged in advance, and, paying all due respect to the organizational cultures on both sides, ensure that safety is always preserved during the execution of a smooth business launch.\n\nInitiatives to Prevent Work-related Accidents\n\n| Target | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| Hitachi Group Key Safety Management Designation System | Group companies and business sites that have experienced serious work-related accidents. Under the leadership of top executives, target companies and business sites take on both management-driven and bottom-up initiatives to formulate specific plans, and the progress of these plans is monitored by safety officers, who also lead initiatives to prevent recurrence. |\n| Hitachi Group Health and Safety Portal System | In Japan. Based on each accident\u2019s severity, analysis of its causes and examples of countermeasures are registered in the system and shared with the entire Group as part of our knowledge base to be used globally. By analyzing detailed accident information from multiple perspectives aggregated by the system, similar accidents can be prevented. |\n| Incident Investigation Database | Entire Group. An Incident Investigation Database was built to analyze accidents and formulate future countermeasures in accordance with the Incident Investigation System established in 2019. The database is currently operational for Japan, and we intend to roll it out globally. |\n\nCurrent Work-related Accident Situation\n\nUnfortunately, during fiscal 2019, we had four fatal work-related accidents. Although the number of lost-time accidents decreased by 23% compared with the previous fiscal year, improvement is required. Taking an honest view of our present situation, we are continuously striving to improve our health and safety management systems, reviewing our risk management to make it more effective and enhancing our employees\u2019 ability to determine the cause of accidents.\nInitiatives to Improving Employee Health\n\nHitachi believes that health is the foundation for employees being able to work with energy and peace of mind. The basic principle of the Hitachi Group Health and Safety Policy, shared by all Group companies globally, is that \u201cHealth and Safety Always Comes First.\u201d Based on this principle, we strive as one to create working environments that allow workers to do their jobs without anxiety over their mental or physical health. In particular, within Japan, we are promoting support for identifying employees struggling with physical and mental issues, not just work-related but also private, and work with the Health Insurance Society to promote the individual support provided to each employee.\n\nIn Japan, occupational healthcare workers, human resources divisions, and the Health Insurance Society work together to promote a range of health support and appropriate health promotion management in accordance with Japan\u2019s Industrial Safety and Health Act.\n\nIn order to advance employee health and promote health management, in fiscal 2019 the results of a third-party external evaluation conducted in the previous fiscal year were brought together with on-site reports for review and discussion by in-house occupational healthcare staff. Going forward, we will strive to further strengthen the foundation of health management, with the Health and Productivity Management Promotion Office, established in April 2020, playing a central role in improving health systems and policies in cooperation with the human resources division and the Health Insurance Society.\n\nHealth Support Initiatives in Japan\n\n- Occupational healthcare provided by occupational physicians, nurses, and other occupational healthcare personnel both at health-management centers located at individual business locations and regional health-management centers serving multiple business locations\n- Health maintenance measures provided based on periodic medical exams and other examinations to prevent serious disease\n- Medical interviews and advice to prevent mental and physical disorders among employees working long hours\n- Consultations and guidance by occupational healthcare workers to address employees\u2019 health concerns and encourage regular exercise\n\nHitachi Group\u2019s Global Safety Figures (Occurrence Rate*)\n\n| Region                  | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |\n|-------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n|

financial support for medical exams by the Health Insurance Society, and encourages employees aged 35 and over in particular to receive the general physical and other exams specified in law, as well as targeted screening based on their age, in order to promote early diagnosis and treatment.\n\nFurthermore, as a response to metabolic syndrome, in addition to special health guidance made compulsory for the Health Insurance Society, we actively promote policies to prevent and control conditions such as diabetes, cerebral strokes, and myocardial infarctions. Additionally, each year on May 31, World No Tobacco Day, we run an anti-smoking campaign aimed at employees.\n\nTo prevent employees from infectious diseases at overseas destinations, the Health Insurance Society has established financial support frameworks for vaccinations against conditions such as hepatitis A, tetanus, and cholera, as well as flu vaccinations for employees and their families to prevent the flu spreading in workplaces. As an initiative to prevent employees falling ill or suffering from serious conditions, we encourage vaccination in the early stage of each illness\u2019s spread. These programs are used by around 120,000 employees and family members each year.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, as part of our efforts in Japan to encourage male employees of the generation not covered by a national MR vaccination program as children to receive an antibody test for and vaccination against measles and rubella\u2014both of which are now free of charge\u2014we introduced an incentive point system in cooperation with the Health Insurance Society.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nIn fiscal 2019, as part of our efforts in Japan to encourage male employees of the generation not covered by a national MR vaccination program as children to receive an antibody test for and vaccination against measles and rubella\u2014both of which are now free of charge\u2014we introduced an incentive point system in cooperation with the Health Insurance Society.\n\nMedical Exam and Screening Attendance Rates\n\n| Year | General physical exam*1 | Breast cancer screening*2 | Uterine cancer screening*3 | Stomach cancer screening*4 | Intestinal cancer screening*4 | Lung cancer screening*5 |\n|------|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2015 | 91.0                    | 81.5                      | 79.0                      | 81.4                      | 81.3                        | 76.9                   |\n| 2016 | 92.9                    | 81.4                      | 79.7                      | 80.6                      | 81.3                        | 76.4                   |\n| 2017 | 92.9                    | 81.4                      | 79.7                      | 80.6                      | 81.3                        | 76.4                   |\n| 2018 | 92.9                    | 81.4                      | 79.7                      | 80.6                      | 81.3                        | 76.4                   |\n| 2019 | 92.9                    | 81.4                      | 79.7                      | 80.6                      | 81.3                        | 76.4                   |\n\n*1 Men and women aged 35 and over.  *2 Women aged 30 and over.  *3 Women aged 25 and over.  *4 Men and women aged 30 and over.  *5 In FY 2016\u20132017, men and women aged 50 and over; from FY 2018, changed to men and women aged 35 and over.\n\nHealth Promotion Initiatives for Employees and Their Families\n\nTo encourage healthy lifestyles among employees and their families, the Hitachi Health Insurance Society has established a portal site for individuals entitled \u201cMy Health Web.\u201d\n\nBy providing information on health exam results and a system of incentive points allowing employees to receive rewards for entering health-related activities, the site raises health awareness, helps employees understand the state of their own health, and offers a range of support for adopting a healthier lifestyle.\n\nOur health promotion initiatives for fiscal 2019 included an Autumn Walking Campaign using the pedometer function on \u201cMy Health Web.\u201d The program ran for around three months and had some 21,000 participants. A ranking chart for participants was presented on the website, encouraging them to compete over daily results as they improved their health.\nSince 2008, Hitachi has been working with the world\u2019s leading nuclear power plant vendors to develop voluntary, private principles of conduct covering the exportation of nuclear power plants and reactors. The \u201cNuclear Power Plant and Reactor Exporters\u2019 Principles of Conduct\u201d were formally revealed on September 15, 2011. They were adopted by all involved in its development, and we have also indicated our adherence to them.\n\nRegarding our employees and other persons employed at nuclear sites under the Hitachi Group umbrella, we perform exposure management based on our internal management systems, and perform evaluation of radiation damage (dose management).\n\nFor health management in particular, our management indicators for radiation exposure are stricter than those set by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. We monitor physical and mental health along with exposure dose even for employees of partner companies, and an occupational physician from Hitachi visits sites to perform examinations and offer health advice.\n\nSupport for Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nHitachi is taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the health and safety of employees and their families globally across the Group.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. adopted a sweeping work-from-home policy in March 2020 and maintained a telecommuting rate of 80% during Japan\u2019s state of emergency. In addition to establishing in-house procedures to deal with infections among employees, we adhere to government guidelines in preventing the spread of infection. Should an employee test positive, we instruct everyone in the same workplace to stay at home and monitor their health, and we also disinfect the workplace.\n\nWe are expanding our efforts to address a broad array of mental and physical health concerns among long-term telecommuters. For example, we provide remote healthcare counseling, offer tips on staying healthy while working from home, support foreign employees seeking medical services in Japan, and ensure the human rights of infected employees.\n\nPromoting Collabo-Health*1\n\nAs well as carrying out individual health improvement initiatives according to their own unique characteristics, Group companies in Japan strive to maintain and improve the health of employees by taking full advantage of the services offered by the Health Insurance Society. Initiatives are evaluated on an annual basis, with recognition of the most accomplished companies and business sites within the Group heightening the motivation among business owners and employees to pursue such activities.\n\n*1 Collabo-Health: A concept involving insurers like the Health Insurance Society proactively working with business owners, with a clear division of labor and a good working environment, to effectively and efficiently improve the health of insured persons (employees and their families), including with preventive strategies.\n\nHealth and Safety Considerations for Nuclear Businesses\n\nSince 2008, Hitachi has been working with the world\u2019s leading nuclear power plant vendors to develop voluntary, private principles of conduct covering the exportation of nuclear power plants and reactors. The \u201cNuclear Power Plant and Reactor Exporters\u2019 Principles of Conduct\u201d were formally revealed on September 15, 2011.

We monitor physical and mental health along with exposure dose even for employees of partner companies, and an occupational physician from Hitachi visits sites to perform examinations and offer health advice.\nFreedom of Association and Collective Bargaining\n\nRespecting the Rights of Employees\n\nThe Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct call for the upholding of the fundamental rights of employees in line with the principles of the United Nations Global Compact.\n\nIn concrete terms, in Japan, where labor unions are recognized, we espouse the three fundamental rights of labor unions (to organize, to bargain collectively, and to act collectively) as seen in the collective agreement between the CEO of Hitachi, Ltd. and the representative of the Hitachi Workers Union. The union has 23,847 members out of 37,701 employees as of October 31, 2019.\n\nRespecting the Rights of Employees System\n\nThe relationship between employees and management at Hitachi, Ltd. and Group companies in Japan is stable with healthy ongoing dialogue. At Hitachi, Ltd., the Central Management Council, the Business Units Management Council, and the Business Sites Management Council work to enhance mutual communication between employees and management, contributing to smooth management and business development, and improving working conditions for union members.\n\nWe also hold Hitachi Group management meetings to share information and exchange views and opinions on Group business conditions among the Federation of Hitachi Group Workers Unions (FHWGU). Group companies outside Japan also actively pursue dialogue with individual labor unions and their representatives in accordance with the laws and regulations in each country and region to deepen mutual understanding of employee working conditions and treatment as well as business conditions.\n\nNotification of Work-related Transfers and Reassignments\n\nThe collective agreement between Hitachi, Ltd. and the Hitachi Workers Union states that any transfer or reassignment of an employee for work-related reasons should adequately take into consideration the situation of the employee, as well as requiring the company to promptly inform the Hitachi Workers Union of the decision. More specifically, in cases of large-scale transfers or reassignments, the company will consult with the labor union regarding the basic issues involved.\n\nCooperating to Improve Health and Safety\n\nHitachi, Ltd. and the Hitachi Workers Union are dedicated to improving health and safety levels through employee-management cooperation. This includes signing a collective agreement on the promotion of, among other things, health and safety mechanisms, a health and safety committee, education and training programs, and health checks for employees.\n\nThe committee works to ensure a healthy and safe work environment through initiatives that include planning and tracking health and safety activities each year, reviewing measures to prevent industrial accidents, and sharing information on whether employees have received their annual health check-ups.\nHitachi understands that respecting human rights in business activities is not only essential for corporate sustainable development, it is also a responsibility that all companies must fulfill. In 2013, to clarify corporate responsibility with respect to human rights, we established the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy based on Hitachi\u2019s Corporate Credo and Group Vision and designating it one of the highest codes governing our internal regulations.\n\nUnder the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, we pursue initiatives to ensure respect for human rights not just within Hitachi itself but for everyone in our supply chain or otherwise involved with our business activities, products, or services. As well as implementing global training and awareness-raising activities and establishing grievance mechanisms to address employee concerns throughout the Hitachi Group, in recent years we have focused on human rights due diligence (HRDD), working to construct frameworks and systems for recognizing and reducing human rights risks.\n\n### Core initiatives\n- Ensure awareness of Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy\n- Raise human rights awareness among executives and employees\n- Recognize human rights risks and construct frameworks and systems for reducing them through HRDD\n- Raise human rights awareness among suppliers, including issues around child labor and forced labor\n\n### Goals and KPIs\n- Training program on respect for human rights: Attendance by each employee at least once every three years (equivalent to a yearly participation rate of 33%)\n\n### Achievements in FY 2019\n- Consolidated general consultation and reporting systems (contact points) for harassment and human rights issues into Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline\n- Distributed human rights message from President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara on Human Rights Day\n- Revised e-learning program on business and human rights\n- Conducted human rights training session for executives titled \u201cCurrent Perspective About AI Ethics\u201d\n- Identified human rights risks to be addressed by entire Group\n- Conducted CSR procurement seminars for suppliers in Southeast Asia\nRespect for Human Rights Throughout the Value Chain\n\nHitachi Group Human Rights Policy\n\nHitachi believes that respecting human rights is its responsibility as a global company and indispensable in conducting business. To this end, in May 2013 we formulated the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy. The Senior Executive Committee reviewed and approved this policy, designating it one of the highest codes governing our internal regulations. During the formulation of the policy, Hitachi held stakeholder dialogues, inviting representatives from the European Commission, the International Labour Organization (ILO), NGOs, and external companies, as well as lawyers specializing in human rights issues, and the opinions and suggestions of these attendees are reflected in the final policy. In the policy, we clarify our understanding of human rights as being, at a minimum, those outlined in the International Bill of Human Rights*1 and the ILO\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This policy shapes Hitachi\u2019s approach to meeting the responsibility to respect human rights, including implementing human rights due diligence*2 in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,*3 providing appropriate education to employees, adhering to laws and regulations in all the regions and countries where we operate, and seeking ways to honor the principles of international human rights when faced with conflicts between internationally recognized human rights standards and national laws. In accordance with the policy, we use opportunities such as our e-learning program on human rights and messages from President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara on Human Rights Day to continuously raise awareness among all employees. The policy is also included in the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines for our policy of respecting human rights, including the rights of children.\n\nHitachi\u2019s approach to meeting the responsibility to respect human rights, including implementing human rights due diligence*2 in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,*3 providing appropriate education to employees, adhering to laws and regulations in all the regions and countries where we operate, and seeking ways to honor the principles of international human rights when faced with conflicts between internationally recognized human rights standards and national laws.

The policy is also included in the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines for our policy of respecting human rights, including the rights of children.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. has a Corporate Human Rights Promotion Committee to gauge the impact of business activities on human rights and to deliberate on mechanisms and policies for preventing human rights violations, thereby improving Group-wide human rights awareness. The executive officer in charge of human resources chairs this body, whose members include representatives from corporate divisions. Policies decided through these deliberations are shared with business unit and business site committees, led by business unit presidents and division heads to prevent human rights violations.\n\nHitachi, Ltd.

We are planning to merge the general consultation and reporting systems (contact points) for harassment and human rights issues at the business sites of each business unit and Group company into this hotline in fiscal 2020. These efforts will clarify who to contact to discuss human rights issues, make it easier for employees and those working with us to access these services, and promote the Group-wide effort globally by establishing an environment, including a grievance mechanism, that helps Hitachi grasp and identify violations of human rights.\n\n*1 International Bill of Human Rights: Collective name for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenants on Human Rights adopted by the United Nations.\n*2 Human rights due diligence: An ongoing process to identify and assess potential and actual human rights negative impacts, take appropriate action to prevent or mitigate potential impacts, track the effectiveness of actions to address impacts, and communicate externally.\n*3 Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Included in the March 2011 \u201cReport of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie\u201d (A/HRC/17/31).\nRaising Human Rights Awareness Among Executives and Employees\n\nHitachi conducts regular group training and seminars and uses videos to educate employees in each business site and Group company. The target is for each employee to attend these sessions at least once every three years (equivalent to a yearly participation rate of 33%). In fiscal 2019, the participation rate came to approximately 65% at Hitachi, Ltd. and around 60% among Group companies in Japan. Through these and other trainings and activities to raise awareness, we are communicating to our employees the importance of respecting human rights in each of their roles.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we revised the e-learning program on business and human rights offered to all Hitachi employees around the world. The goal of the program is to deepen understanding of the definition of and international standards for human rights as well as corporate responsibility to respect them. It helps improve understanding and shows how human rights relate to business activities by introducing case studies involving discrimination, forced labor, and human rights issues at suppliers.\n\nExecutive officers from Hitachi, Ltd. also participate in annual officer training sessions on human rights. In fiscal 2019, Hiroshi Nakagawa, group director of the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP), gave a presentation on \u201cCurrent Perspective About AI Ethics.\u201d He spoke about the impacts AI development has had on human rights as well as ethical guidelines for AI published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Cabinet Office of Japan.\n\nIn Japan, where a revised labor law designed to prevent power harassment took effect in June 2020, we are raising awareness of the issue of harassment through seminars for executives and workplace discussion sessions for all employees as well as trainings for different levels and employees transferred abroad.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we analyzed and reassessed a wide variety of information, including the results of our HRDD to date; human rights issues specified in Hitachi\u2019s codes and guidelines; information, advice, and inquiries from non-governmental organizations, the media, and experts; items on assessments of corporate efforts by international initiatives; and the results of self-checks by suppliers and Group companies. Taking these results into account, we identified forced labor and migrant labor as human rights risks that the Hitachi Group as a whole should work to address. Forced labor and migrant labor are issues of high concern that are increasingly the subject of legislation around the world. From fiscal 2020 onward, we will carry out specific measures globally across the Group and explore the establishment of human rights risks management systems at individual business sites.\n\nImplementation Status of Activities to Raise Awareness of Human Rights\n\n| Target | Details | Number of participants |\n|--------|---------|------------------------|\n| All Hitachi Group executives and employees | Distributed a human rights message by President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara on Human Rights Day | 251,085 executives and employees |\n| All Hitachi Group executives and employees | Implemented an e-learning program on business and human rights (completed by employees roughly once every three years; contents revised in fiscal 2019; provided in 15 languages) | A total of more than 160,000 Group executives and employees globally (as of March 2020) |\n| Executive officers of Hitachi, Ltd. | Attended a presentation on \u201cCurrent Perspective About AI Ethics\u201d by Hiroshi Nakagawa, group director of the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project | 34 |\n\nHuman Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) Initiatives\n\nIn our Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, we pledged to develop mechanisms for and to continue the implementation of human rights due diligence (HRDD). We are working to improve our business processes. For example, our CSR procurement guidelines reflect the results of HRDD risk assessments performed in our procurement divisions.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we analyzed and reassessed a wide variety of information, including the results of our HRDD to date; human rights issues specified in Hitachi\u2019s codes and guidelines; information, advice, and inquiries from non-governmental organizations, the media, and experts; items on assessments of corporate efforts by international initiatives; and the results of self-checks by suppliers and Group companies. Taking these results into account, we identified forced labor and migrant labor as human rights risks that the Hitachi Group as a whole should work to address. Forced labor and migrant labor are issues of high concern that are increasingly the subject of legislation around the world.

Recognizing the growing risks of forced labor amid the ongoing globalization of business, Hitachi also developed an e-learning program for all Group executives and employees on the subject of human rights. The program draws on specific case studies to convey the importance of preventing forced labor and human trafficking problems before they occur.\n\nHitachi\u2019s CSR procurement guidelines for suppliers also clearly forbid the use of child labor or forced labor. As part of our efforts to raise awareness all along the supply chain, we distributed these guidelines to tier 1 suppliers and conducted CSR procurement seminars in China and Thailand.\n\nHuman Rights Awareness Initiatives Targeting Suppliers and Procurement Personnel\n\n| FY     | Target                                      | Initiatives                                                                 |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2016   | Employees responsible for procurement and human resources in Southeast Asia | Held a four-part webinar*1 series led by speakers from NGOs and businesses implementing advanced countermeasures |\n| 2016   | Suppliers in China                          | Held CSR procurement seminars to explain the Hitachi Group\u2019s CSR activities and respect for human rights |\n| 2017   | Suppliers in Malaysia                       | Conducted on-site visits and interviews regarding the working and living conditions of migrant laborers, who are considered at high risk of bonded labor and other issues |\n| 2017   | Suppliers in China                          | Held CSR procurement seminars to explain the SDGs and other recent sustainability trends, as well as how environmental and labor issues, including human rights, are linked to business risks |\n| 2018   | European Group companies                    | Procurement personnel from European Group companies formed the Responsible Supply Chain Working Group |\n| 2018   | Suppliers in China                          | Held CSR procurement seminars to explain Hitachi Group CSR policies and activities as well as the severity of human rights risks |\n| 2019   | European Group companies                    | Created a webinar titled \u201cImplementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\u201d for procurement personnel in the working group mentioned above |\n| 2019   | Suppliers in Thailand                       | Held CSR procurement seminars to explain forced labor by providing case studies |\n\n*1 Webinar: A portmanteau word combining \u201cweb\u201d and \u201cseminar,\u201d used to refer to an interactive seminar held online.\n\nResponse to Technical Intern Training Program Issues\n\nIn 2018, the Organization for Technical Intern Training, a legal entity whose establishment was approved by competent ministers conducted on-site inspections at Hitachi, Ltd. and 10 Group companies. These inspections identified violations of the Act on Proper Technical Intern Training and Protection of Technical Intern Trainees, and the relevant companies were provided with recommendations for improvement regarding intern training. Additionally, in September 2019, Hitachi, Ltd. received an order for improvement from the Immigration Services Agency of Japan and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare regarding the construction of its systems for carrying out proper technical intern training according to authorized plans. Companies that received such recommendations or orders for improvement have already taken corrective measures. We have taken further strict measures to ensure that no further violation will take place throughout the entire Group, such as constructing Group-wide policies, guidelines, and check systems for technical intern training. We continue to strive to carry out appropriate technical intern training in accordance with relevant laws and the aims of the Technical Intern Training Program and with due consideration for human rights on the basis of the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy.\nAs business becomes more and more globalized, there is a growing possibility of procurement risks in the supply chain creating management problems. As an enterprise that engages in businesses activities in many regions around the world, Hitachi strives to identify and mitigate these risks in advance as much as possible. Hitachi emphasizes sustainability in the value chain, and suppliers are selected strictly in accordance with the Hitachi Group Global Procurement Code. Additionally, in order to share our CSR procurement policies, we not only distribute the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines to approximately 30,000 suppliers around the world and ensure their awareness but also conduct CSR Monitoring (self-checks) and CSR audits to minimize procurement risks. To address the conflict mineral issue, Hitachi formulated the Hitachi Group Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy to promote responsible procurement in line with international guidelines.\n\nFurthermore, embracing the Hitachi Founding Spirit of \u201cHarmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit,\u201d we adhere to basics and ethics and put right and wrong before profit and loss, with all employees sharing our policy of making quality and reliability our top priority, thereby strengthening our quality assurance activities.\n\n### Why it matters\n\nAs business becomes more and more globalized, there is a growing possibility of procurement risks in the supply chain creating management problems.

Based on the framework of our CSR and green procurement guidelines, this is our highest code for procurement activities. It calls on Group companies and suppliers to give due consideration to human rights, labor practices, safety, ethics, quality, and security in the supply chain. All Group companies follow the code, and we share global supply chain issues within the Group as we engage in procurement activities. Suppliers, too, are selected strictly in accordance with the code\u2019s provisions.\n\nProcurement activities are also carried out according to the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines, which were revised based on the results of human rights due diligence performed by procurement divisions and version 5.1 of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA, formerly called EICC) Code of Conduct. We plan to revise these guidelines regularly in the future to ensure that they always reflect global demands regarding corporate supply chain management.\n\nCSR Supply Chain Management Framework\n\nGiven the global reach of Hitachi\u2019s business, procurement risks throughout the supply chain are growing. The Hitachi Group is working hard to identify and mitigate these risks beforehand as much as possible.\n\nCSR supply chain management, responsible minerals procurement, and green procurement policies and initiatives are discussed within Hitachi\u2019s Value Chain Integration Division, which reports directly to the president of Hitachi, Ltd. Policies and initiatives adopted after this discussion are shared throughout the Group through the Hitachi Group CSR/BCP Procurement Committee, which includes members from business units and CSR/BCP Procurement Committees at key Group companies.\n\nTo address the issue of chemical substances in products, we recommend management with chemSHERPA*1-CI/AI, a common scheme that facilitates transmission of information on chemical substances in products throughout the supply chain.\n\n*1 chemSHERPA: A standard developed by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to facilitate the management of chemical substances in products by creating a shared transmission scheme throughout the supply chain. The chemSHERPA-CI standard is applicable to chemical substances contained in chemical products and chemSHERPA-AI to those contained in molded products.\nStrengthening Global Partnerships\n\nA key element of the Hitachi Group Vision is to improve the competitiveness of our value chain based on partnerships with our suppliers. In order to promote procurement based on local production for local consumption in line with our business policy of international expansion, we have appointed procurement officers to oversee local procurement in China, the rest of Asia, Europe, and the Americas. These officers carry out activities such as CSR audits, CSR monitoring (self-checks), and CSR procurement seminars in their respective regions to strengthen our response to CSR-related risks.\n\nLocal procurement officers are also responsible for addressing environmental risks in China. Through the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, an environmental NGO, the officers obtain information about polluting enterprises made public by China\u2019s central and regional government bodies. They use this information not only for screening businesses who have transactions with these enterprises but also for urging the enterprises themselves to make improvements.\n\nSharing Procurement Policies with Suppliers\n\nTo share procurement policies with the approximately 30,000 suppliers of Hitachi business units and Group companies, we are undertaking the following initiatives.\n\nDistributing the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines\n\nTo ensure that the guidelines are strictly followed, we make them available in Japanese, English, Chinese, and Thai and distribute them to approximately 30,000 suppliers around the world. We also request acknowledgment of suppliers\u2019 understanding in writing.\n\nDistributing the Green Procurement Guidelines\n\nWe distribute guidelines that define our basic position on procuring environmentally friendly parts and products as well as our requirements of suppliers. The guidelines set out requirements for environmental conservation, including building an environmental management system and acquiring certifications. There are also requirements for reducing the environmental impact of products supplied to Hitachi, such as conserving resources and energy, recycling, managing chemical substances in products, and fully disclosing related information. In fiscal 2019, we revised these guidelines to ban four types of phthalates in line with the EU\u2019s RoHS directive.\n\nRate of Local Procurement of Materials for Main Regions\n\n- **China**: 90%\n- **Rest of Asia**: 71%\n- **Europe**: 78%\n- **Americas**: 69%\nImplementing CSR Procurement\n\nHitachi engages in the following initiatives to promote and pursue CSR procurement based on its CSR supply chain management philosophy.\n\n**CSR Monitoring (Self-Checks)**\n\nWe ask key suppliers to conduct CSR Monitoring (self-checks) using checklists based on the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines. After collecting and analyzing the results, we provide feedback for related business operations to suppliers, and then work with those involved in the operations to resolve issues related to the suppliers. We are also reinforcing our onboarding procedures for new suppliers in Japan, including providing them with the guidelines and asking them to complete a checklist.\n\n**Implementation of CSR Audits**\n\nHitachi, Ltd. has been auditing the manufacturing bases of its and Group companies\u2019 suppliers in China and the rest of Asia. For these audits, we engaged external evaluators such as the experienced CSR auditing company Intertek Certification.*1 Our audits are based on the international SA8000 certification standard developed by Social Accountability International (SAI), an American CSR evaluation institution. These audits investigate our workplace practices, and an RBA-recognized auditor checks suppliers\u2019 CSR initiatives from the perspectives of labor and human rights, health and safety, the environment, and ethics. Suppliers needing improvement were requested to submit improvement action plans, and Hitachi, Ltd., together with Group companies, will work with and advise the suppliers until they complete the planned improvements.\n\n**Violations in FY 2019**\n\nIn fiscal 2019, audits were conducted of 12 Chinese suppliers. Though there were no significant violations, the following minor problems were identified with some suppliers, who were accordingly asked to remedy the issues.\n\n- Failure to comply with legal working hours, including overtime: 8 suppliers\n- Failure to conduct staff training, including fire safety measures, evacuation drills, and emergency response to hazardous chemicals: 7 suppliers\n- Failure to renew permit for discharging pollutants: 1 supplier\n\n*1 Intertek Certification: With a presence in over 100 countries across the globe, the Intertek Group provides a wide array of certification services in every industrial field.\n\n**Holding CSR Procurement Seminars**\n\nIn order to share the philosophy of Hitachi among our suppliers, we provide suppliers directly with information in a face-to-face format. Specifically, we hold a CSR Procurement Seminar for Hitachi Group partners in China.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we held a CSR seminar for suppliers in Thailand attended by 77 participants from 59 companies. At the seminar, our first in Southeast Asia, we explained our Group-wide CSR procurement initiatives and activities, CSR procurement activities in ASEAN, CSR-related laws and regulations in Thailand, and promotion of ethical employment. Feedback from participants included comments such as \u201cI was pleased to gain necessary information and knowledge about CSR,\u201d \u201cThe seminar taught me the importance of working together on CSR initiatives,\u201d and \u201cMore companies will participate if the next seminar like this is held in an industrial park.\u201d We believe that the seminar helped participants deepen their understanding of our efforts on CSR and green procurement activities.\n\nA seminar was also scheduled for China in February 2020, but was cancelled due to the spread of COVID-19.\n\n**CSR Procurement Activities Implementation Status**\n\n| Activities                  | FY 2019 |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| CSR monitoring (self-checks) | 291     |\n| CSR audits                  | 19      |\n| Supplier seminars           | 59      |\nIncreasing Green Purchasing of Office Supplies\n\nWe are improving our green purchasing rate*1 by using a Group-wide online procurement system called the E-sourcing Mall. This system has a range of environmentally conscious products and promotes procurement by clearly labeling these products. In fiscal 2019, our green purchasing rate reached 84%.\n\n*1 Green purchasing rate: The ratio, by monetary value, of products with the Eco Mark among all products purchased subject to the Act on Promoting Green Procurement.\n\nResponse to the Conflict Mineral Issue\n\nIn fiscal 2013, Hitachi formulated its Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy, declaring its stance and commitments regarding conflict minerals. The policy was revised in fiscal 2016 to explicitly lay out measures to be implemented to ensure responsible procurement, including inquiries based on international guidelines, so that procurement of components incorporating conflict minerals does not benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries. Expanding the scope of corporate responsibilities for the procurement of minerals is a global trend, with companies increasingly expected to address the overall risks to human rights as well as conflict risks, and recognize responsibilities that extend beyond the countries adjoining Congo to a wider area where risks are high. We are currently revising our Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy in this respect.\n\nSales divisions, business groups, plants, procurement divisions, and other divisions within individual business units and Hitachi Group companies work together to respond to investigation requests and inquiries relating to conflict minerals. We also strive to grasp developments in conflict mineral-related laws and regulations in each country and region and what global society demands of enterprises, working to share information within the Group.\n\nEach Hitachi business unit and Group company investigates its use of conflict minerals and reports the results to customers when requested. Supply chain investigations are carried out with the cooperation of the relevant entities\u2019 sales, procurement, and CSR divisions. In addition, Hitachi, Ltd., a member of the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA)\u2019s Responsible Minerals Trade Working Group, has been addressing the conflict minerals issues with other members of the association.\n\nIn 2018, Hitachi, Ltd. and six key Group companies (Hitachi Metals, Hitachi Chemicals, Hitachi High-Technologies, Hitachi Construction Machinery, Hitachi Automotive Systems, and Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems) performed investigations and replied to a total of 1,874 requests from customers.\n\nHitachi Group Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy\n\nProcurement Policy\n\nThe policy for procurement departments in all Hitachi Group companies has always been and will continue to be to ensure that procurement activities do not result or aid in conflicts within the same region and that the armed groups described above do not benefit from those activities, while continuing responsible procurement activities of minerals that are not related to the conflicts in the region based on local laws. Additionally, we will continue to support the practice of due diligence based on the \u201cOECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas\u201d among companies. With these in mind, Hitachi Group would like to request all our suppliers to utilize the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template developed by RBA/GeSI to continue checking the country of origin and supply chain of minerals, and also to procure from the CFS (Conflict Free Smelter)*1 listed within.\n\n*1 CFS (Conflict Free Smelter): A list of smelters who have been identified as \u201cnot being involved in the conflict within the same region\u201d by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), an organization that was founded by the RBA/GeSI, which is a group that aims to solve the conflict minerals problem.\n\nHitachi\u2019s Conflict Minerals Response Framework\n\nHeadquarters\n\nIndividual BUs/Group companies\n\nSupply chain due diligence by individual BUs/Group companies\n\n*1 3TG: Collective term for four commonly used conflict minerals: tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold.\n\n*2 May differ depending on business unit or Group company.\nQuality and Product Safety Management\n\nHitachi's Approach to Quality Assurance Activities\n\nAs stipulated in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, we uphold a philosophy of providing products and services that our customers can use with confidence by meeting their specifications and quality requirements. The Quality Assurance Standards in our corporate regulations also set out our basic principles for quality assurance activities.\n\nEmbracing the Hitachi Founding Spirit of \u201cHarmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit,\u201d we adhere to basics and ethics and put right and wrong before profits and losses, with all employees sharing our policy of prioritizing quality and reliability above all else. We are strengthening the organization and management, technology, and human capital aspects of our quality assurance activities in every process\u2014from planning and development to design, manufacturing, testing, delivery, and maintenance. Furthermore, under our approach of making prevention the duty of quality assurance, we are working beyond reoccurrence prevention and striving toward preventing incidents from occurring in the first place.\n\nOur unique practice of OCHIBO-HIROI, which means \u201cgleaning\u201d in English, involves analyzing and learning from failure to further develop our technologies. When an incident occurs, we not only investigate the technical causes but also thoroughly discuss the process, framework, and motivating factors leading up to occurrence, along with ways to prevent reoccurrence, in order to improve our product reliability and customer satisfaction.\n\nFramework for Quality Assurance and Quality Assurance Activities\n\nTo ensure full control over quality governance, Hitachi has separated the quality assurance division from the manufacturing division in every business unit and Group company, creating a framework for activity in which its customers\u2019 safety and trust are the top priorities. In order to strengthen this framework further, we have made BU and Group company quality assurance divisions independent of business divisions and reinforced their report lines to the Quality Assurance Division at our head office, establishing systems for close information sharing between the two sides. We are also strengthening governance by giving greater authority to the Quality Assurance Division at our head office.\n\nRegarding our services business, which continues to grow in scale, we have established a Service and Software Quality Enhancement Division and are sharing quality activities and current challenges, while also enhancing the reliability of our embedded software as the field becomes more advanced and complex by applying our solutions division\u2019s software development capabilities and expertise in strengthening reliability to our product divisions (embedded software development divisions).\n\nTechnical Law Compliance Activities\n\n- Distribute product regulations worldwide, along with amendment trends and enforcement dates, among Hitachi Group companies.\n- Clarify product-specific laws (the product-specific laws map); continuously improve regulatory compliance activities and processes based on our product compliance management system.\n\nProduct Safety Activities\n\n- Use Guide for Preparing User Instruction Manuals to improve risk communication with our customers.\n- Make the safety of our customers\u2019 life, health, and property the top priority in product development and verify safety at every step, from development and production to sales and maintenance.\n- Conduct risk assessments from a wide perspective in collaboration with related business units and research laboratories.\n- Ensure safety by reducing risks through design (fundamental safety design), protective measures (safeguards), and usage information (product manuals), in order of priority.\n\nGlobal Quality Assurance Activities\n\n- Build Hitachi quality by applying our fundamental principles for quality assurance activities globally and preparing Global Quality Assurance Standards, thereby understanding the situation regarding incidents globally through a unified set of rules.\nHandling Product Incidents\n\nWhen a product incident occurs, the division responsible acts swiftly to resolve the problem. In case of a severe incident, we report to government agencies in line with legal requirements and disclose the incident information to customers on our website and through other communication channels. At the same time, we promptly submit a status report to top management, ensuring fast and appropriate action at all companies across the Group.\n\nIn case we determine that retroactive action is necessary, we notify customers via newspaper advertising and websites in order to carry out the necessary repair or replacement program.\n\nQuality and Reliability Education\n\nWe conduct field-specific technical lectures for engineers engaged in monozukuri craftsmanship at a range of levels from basic to expert.\n\nEach business unit also conducts specialized technical courses regarding manufacturing, quality assurance, and maintenance at their quality assurance training centers.\nCustomer Satisfaction\n\nStructure for Reflecting Customers\u2019 Voices\n\nThe sales and marketing divisions at Hitachi, Ltd. use customer input in developing management, product, and solution strategies. We identify key customers who will help grow our business, then assign an account manager to each one. These account managers serve as customers\u2019 \u201cportals\u201d into Hitachi Group companies in Japan, and the whole Group works with them to build closer relations with customers, including the following initiatives for improving customer satisfaction (CS).\n\nInitiatives for Improving CS\n\n| Initiative | Location | Outline |\n|------------|----------|---------|\n| Executive seminars | Headquarters and branches in Japan | Engage in direct dialogue with customers to learn their expectations of Hitachi and opinions about product strategies, and use this knowledge to create sales activity proposals based on customer needs |\n| Hitachi Social Innovation Forum | Global | Accelerate collaborative creation with customers in Hitachi\u2019s Social Innovation Business |\n| Technology Community program | R&D sites in Japan | Create opportunities for researchers to speak directly with customers and contribute to collaborative creation of new businesses based on customer needs and Hitachi technology |\n\nProviding Customer Support Online\n\nHitachi offers comprehensive global customer support on its website to respond to customer inquiries, opinions, requests, and complaints. We also conduct training courses like our Web Inquiry Responsiveness Improvement Course to improve our handling of these inquiries.\n\nCustomer Support Activities in Fiscal 2019\n\n| Activities | Structure |\n|------------|-----------|\n| Inquiries to comprehensive customer support | 4,017 |\n| Web Inquiry Responsiveness Improvement Course attendees | 31 (858 in total since fiscal 2009) |\n\nImproving CS in Home Appliances\n\nThe Home Appliances Customer Satisfaction Division provides services and solutions to improve quality of life for people of all ages and regions of residence. In Japan, these initiatives are carried out under the slogan, \u201c360\u00b0 Happiness: Encircling People and All Their Dreams for the Future.\u201d\n\nOur call center and website handle about 2.13 million customer inquiries, repair requests, and complaints about washing machines, refrigerators, and other appliances per year.1 We have undertaken a number of initiatives to better respond to inquiries and to reflect customer feedback in our monozukuri craftsmanship, including improving the contact success rate by using outsourcing; creating a database of customer feedback, including consultations, inquiries, and complaints; and enhancing our website\u2019s FAQ section.\n\nWe also conduct semiannual customer service evaluation surveys at approximately 90 service centers in Japan. Based on the answers, we improve services through CS training courses and other programs.\n\nWith the expansion of Hitachi\u2019s markets, 12 sales offices and manufacturing sites have been opened mainly in Asia and the Middle and Near East. We are also working on unifying management of operations outside Japan.\n\n*1 Since fiscal 2013, technical inquiries from suppliers and parts orders have been excluded from these statistics.\n\nCustomer Contact Cases, Call Completion Rate (12-Month Average)\n\n| (Cases per month) | (%) |\n|-------------------|-----|\n| 100,000           | 80  |\n| 80,000            | 80  |\n| 60,000            | 60  |\n| 40,000            | 40  |\n| 20,000            | 20  |\n\n- White goods (electric home appliances and other products) (left scale)\n- Brown goods (electronic equipment) (left scale)\n- Call completion rate (right scale)\nResults of Evaluation Survey for Customer Repair Services (CS)\n\n| Year | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Score (%) | 97.3 | 97.4 | 97.3 | 97.3 | 96.5 |\n\nFlow of Customer Service\n\nAdvertising Activities\n\nBecause Hitachi, Ltd. believes that advertising activities must show proper consideration for society as a whole as well as complying with laws and regulations, it has established a set of Advertisement Guidelines, which it follows and updates in line with social developments.\n\nTo ensure that these guidelines are strictly followed even at business locations outside Japan, where languages and customs vary, an Advertising Material Checklist is included. All items on the checklist are confirmed when creating advertisements.\nUnder the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan that aims to enhance social, economic, and environmental value through the Social Innovation Business, we are actively promoting social contribution activities that will help create social and environmental value and contribute to the sustainable development of both society and business.\n\nBased on the belief that we, as a company aiming to resolve social issues through innovation, have an important mission to foster not only our human capital but also those who will contribute to society in the field of science and technology more broadly, our focus in recent years has been on activities related to STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education, which has gained attention as a tool for fostering human capital capable of using cutting-edge technologies to enhance their creativity, expressivity, and problem-solving skills.\n\nAs a global company, we also support volunteer activity among employees, because it is essential for employees to actively volunteer their time to address local issues and needs if we are to build trust with local communities and grow together with them as a good corporate citizen.\n\n| Core initiatives | Goals and KPIs | Achievements in FY 2019 |\n|------------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| \u2022 Work with all employees and other diverse stakeholders to develop next-generation human capital and promote empowerment in the areas of STEAM, the environment, and community engagement | \u2022 Developing next-generation human capital | \u2022 Reviewed our policy on social contribution activities based on the belief that we have an important mission to foster human capital who will contribute to society in the field of science and technology |\n| \u2022 Promote social contribution activities through the Hitachi Global Foundation | \u2022 Forging good relationships with local communities | \u2022 Added a new grant category for humanities and social sciences to the Kurata Grants |\nSocial Contribution Activities\n\nPolicy on Social Contribution Activities\n\nIn order to achieve the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, Hitachi is committed to creating social and environmental value through the Social Innovation Business. At the same time, we are actively promoting social contribution activities in regions where we operate, conscious of the fact that these activities will help create social and environmental value as well, contributing to the sustainable development of both society and business. In fiscal 2019, we reviewed our policy on social contribution activities based on the belief that we, as a company aiming to resolve social issues through innovation, have an important mission to foster not only our human capital but also those who will contribute to society centered on the field of science and technology. We also provide our employees with opportunities to actively volunteer their time in response to the needs and challenges of local communities, as well as supporting those communities through donations and pro bono activities. We believe this is essential in forging good relationships with local communities and growing together with them as a good corporate citizen.\n\nPolicy on Social Contribution Activities\n\nNurturing People, Connecting to the Future\n\nAt Hitachi, our Corporate Mission, \u201cto contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products,\u201d is the basis for everything we do. We believe it is our pursuit to contribute to solving societal and environmental issues and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by accelerating our Social Innovation Business, as well as undertaking corporate citizenship activities. Central to this goal are people: people in our business, people in our local and global communities, and people who are our future. Ultimately, it is individuals that have the ability to create innovation, bring social impact, and deliver social good to society.\n\nTherefore, the Hitachi Group is committed to investing in, developing, nurturing, and empowering future generations, together with our employees and diverse stakeholders in the following areas:\n\n- STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics)\n- The environment\n- Community engagement\n\nFunding for Social Contribution Activities\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Hitachi and the Hitachi Global Foundation provided over 1.8 billion yen in funding toward social contribution activities worldwide, including initiatives to cultivate a younger generation of talent and financial donations and other support for disaster-struck areas. Additionally, 88,134 Hitachi Group employees (around 30% of the total) participated in social contribution activities.\n\nHitachi spends around 2 billion yen annually on social contribution activities, but that amount has been shrinking due to a decrease in the number of consolidated Group companies and revised data-gathering measures. However, fiscal 2019 marked the largest number of employees participating in social contribution activities since we started gathering this data in fiscal 2016.\n\nHitachi Group employees are contributing to society through community-based activities in various forms and areas, such as cleaning up around our business sites, visiting and donating goods to welfare facilities, and participating in charity events. Many employees make full use of their knowledge and skills acquired through work for their contribution to society, such as running workshops for schoolchildren on a wide range of themes, from science and the environment to career education, and implementing programs aimed to support non-profit organizations through pro bono activities.\n\nBreakdown of Funding for Social Contribution Activities in FY 2019\n\n- Human development: 40.6%\n- Community support: 26.4%\n- Environment: 2.8%\n- Other: 30.2%\n\n*1 Japan: Hitachi, Ltd., 153 Group companies, and the Hitachi Global Foundation.\nOutside Japan: 234 Group companies.\nFunding includes monetary and in-kind donations, independently organized programs, participation or dispatch of employees, community use of facilities, and employee donations; excludes personnel costs incurred from the participation or dispatch of employees.\nSpecific Examples of Social Contribution Activities\n\nHitachi promotes human development activities centered on fostering the next-generation of human capital as a priority area for social contribution activities. We are actively working on a wide range of issues at global and local community levels and implementing programs to support development of next-generation leaders and science and engineering human capital.\n\nThe cultivation of IT talent in particular is a global challenge amid the rapid development of IT using AI and big data. In recent years, we have therefore been focusing on activities related to STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education, which has gained attention as a tool for fostering human capital capable of utilizing cutting-edge technologies to enhance their creativity, expressivity, and problem-solving skills.\n\nSpecific Examples of Social Contributions\n\n| Activity | BU/Group company | URL |\n|----------|------------------|-----|\n| STEAM education | | |\n| STEM education to develop engineers in the United Kingdom | Hitachi Rail | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIlxAs41l2s |\n| Activities to support science education with electron microscopes | Hitachi High-Tech | https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/global-science-edu/ |\n| Programming workshop for elementary schoolchildren | Hitachi Consulting | http://www.hitachi.com/sustainability/sc/report/archives/0460.html |\n| Science workshop on the theme of water | Hitachi, Ltd. | http://www.hitachi.com/sustainability/sc/report/archives/0461.html |\n| Hitachi scholarship program for the Asian University for Women | Hitachi, Ltd. | \u2014 |\n| Environment | | |\n| Ecosystem preservation activities in the Hitachi IT Eco Experimental Village | Shikoku Hitachi Group | \u2014 |\n| Sato-umi activities | Shikoku Hitachi Group | \u2014 |\n| Support for environmental education programs targeting young people | Hitachi Construction Machinery Southern Africa | \u2014 |\n| Community support | | |\n| Hitachi Young Leaders Initiative | Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi Asia Ltd. | http://www.hitachi.com/sustainability/sc/education/next-generation/ |\n| Skill development program for youth employment | Hitachi India | \u2014 |\n| Participation in Walk for Millions | Hong Kong Hitachi Group | \u2014 |\nContributing to Society Through the Hitachi Global Foundation\n\nInheriting the intention of Namihei Odaira, the founder of Hitachi, to contribute to society through business activities, we wholeheartedly embrace the importance of social contributions. Since 1967, we have established five foundations, including one for supporting scientists and another for supporting development of university lecturers in Southeast Asia. These formed the basis of today\u2019s Hitachi Global Foundation, which was established in 2015 through a merger of the existing five foundations. In accordance with Odaira\u2019s aspirations, the Hitachi Global Foundation conducts social contribution activities centered on the three pillars of \u201cpromotion of academic research, science and technology,\u201d \u201chuman development,\u201d and \u201cbuilding multicultural symbiotic and diverse societies\u201d based on the recognition of current social issues.\n\nA new grant category of humanities and social sciences was added to the Kurata Grants, a research fund established originally for the advancement of natural sciences and engineering, to support researchers exploring issues faced by our advanced scientific and technological society today.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\n- Program supporting researchers who engage, in pursuit of solutions to social challenges, in creative and pioneering research in the natural sciences and engineering, or in unravelling the complex challenges faced by advanced technological societies and exploring the underlying philosophical and historical elements through research in the humanities and social sciences\n- Total number of grants awarded as of end of fiscal 2019: 1,429\n- Program promoting the development of science and engineering human capital aimed at Japanese schoolchildren in the upper grades of elementary school, aiming to cultivate personality traits (creativity, curiosity, independence, and challenging spirit) and abilities (problem finding and solving ability) required for future human resources in science and technology, in order to create innovators who will take a leading role in resolving social issues\n- Total number of schools and students participating as of end of fiscal 2019: 10 schools, 737 students\n- Program supporting science and engineering education for women through raising interest in science and engineering careers among female junior high and high school students\n- Program urging a new understanding among everyday citizens of the importance of constructing \u201cmulticultural symbiotic and diverse societies,\u201d defined as active, diverse, and inclusive societies that are lively and unified and where diverse viewpoints and values are mutually accepted across differences in attributes like gender, nationality, age, abled or disabled status, and sexual orientation\n\nSpecific Examples of Hitachi Global Foundation Activities\n\n| Pillar | Activity | Details |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| Promotion of academic research, science and technology | Kurata Grants | Program supporting researchers who engage, in pursuit of solutions to social challenges, in creative and pioneering research in the natural sciences and engineering, or in unravelling the complex challenges faced by advanced technological societies and exploring the underlying philosophical and historical elements through research in the humanities and social sciences.

In this way, we contribute both to the company\u2019s own sustainable growth and the development of the economy as a whole.\nHitachi views the expansion of long-term and overall shareholder returns as an important management objective. Hitachi and its Group companies maintain good relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, and we recognize that these relationships make up an important portion of our overall corporate value. Accordingly, we are striving to establish a system that will facilitate the maintenance of these relationships and improve our corporate value, primarily through the implementation of measures focused on promoting constructive dialogue.\n\nTo advance these efforts effectively, we are working to improve our corporate governance by ensuring thorough separation between the oversight and execution of management, establishing a swift business execution system, and striving to achieve highly transparent management.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\nHitachi views the expansion of long-term and overall shareholder returns as an important management objective.

We have established a Nominating Committee, a Compensation Committee, and an Audit Committee, which are mostly made up of, and are chaired by, independent directors. The system we have in place to ensure transparency in management separates the oversight and execution of management, facilitates the full exercise of supervisory functions and enables discussions and reports to be conducted appropriately within these three committees.\n\n**POINT 2**\n\n**Independence of the Board of Directors**\n\nWe increased our number of independent directors, including non-Japanese directors, in 2012. Our Board of Directors, which is chaired by an independent director, has 13 members, including 10 independent directors, 2 directors who are also serving as executive officers and 1 director who is not serving as an executive officer. In addition, we have established a system that facilitates the full exercise of supervisory functions by maintaining separation between the oversight and execution of management.\n\n**POINT 3**\n\n**Enhanced Collaboration Through Tripartite Audits**\n\nHitachi\u2019s Audit Committee and internal audit section collaborate with third-party accounting auditors to strengthen its \u201ctripartite auditing,\u201d which aims to increase the effectiveness of internal controls.\nAdministrative Performance of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors approves the basic management policy for the Hitachi Group and supervises the execution of the duties of executive officers and directors in order to sustainably enhance corporate value and shareholders\u2019 common interests.

They also indicated the board of directors\u2019 overall effectiveness was satisfactory due in part to its active discussions aimed at medium- to long-term strategies. The Nominating Committee, which was primarily focused on points related to management strategy, including the Mid-term Management Plan. |\n| The Board of Directors will continue to conduct discussions concerning business strategies for each sector. At the same time, it will discuss the progress of our Mid-term Management Plan as well as accounting improvements for circumstances surrounding COVID-19. We are strengthening collaboration between the Board of Directors and the Nominating Committee while further contributing to CEO succession planning (for example, expanding reports made to the Board of Directors through the Nominating Committee, enhancing coaching for successive and next-generation candidates). |\n| While accounting for circumstances surrounding COVID-19, we are improving our operational support system through the continuous sharing of information obtained through independent directors\u2019 visits to Hitachi Group business premises and event participation. We will achieve further improvements related to the composition and content of materials, as well as to their preliminary provision. |\n\nAdministrative Performance of the Three Committees\n\n| Nominating Committee | Audit Committee | Compensation Committee |\n|----------------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| The Nominating Committee has the authority to determine proposals submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for the election and dismissal of directors. The Nominating Committee consists of four directors, three of whom are independent directors. It also determines director candidates and holds preliminary hearings concerning the appointment and dismissal of executive officers, including the CEO. In fiscal 2019, the Nominating Committee held meetings on eight days. |\n| The Audit Committee has the authority to audit the execution of duties of directors and executive officers and to decide on proposals submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for the election and dismissal of accounting auditors. The Audit Committee consists of five directors, including four independent directors and one standing Audit Committee member. In fiscal 2019, the Audit Committee held meetings on 15 days. |\n| The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine remuneration policies for directors and executive officers and remuneration for individuals (including amounts of remuneration) based on these policies. Composed of four directors, including three independent directors, the committee strives to ensure objectivity, transparency, and fairness in the remuneration determination process. In addition, the Compensation Committee verifies and reviews details of the process used for determining remuneration for individuals, including assessments concerning basic remuneration amounts, evaluations of progress made toward individual targets, and performance appraisals that are tied to short-term incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee held meetings on four days. |\n\nCEO Appointment, Dismissal, and Succession Plan\n\nHitachi\u2019s Board of Directors decides upon the appointment and dismissal of executive officers, including the CEO, with the goal of constructing an optimal business execution system for management. Decisions regarding the appointment or dismissal of executive officers are based upon proposals made to the Nominating Committee, while decisions related to the position of CEO are made based on preliminary deliberations and proposals from the Nominating Committee. As stipulated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our basic policy concerning CEO appointments and dismissals requires that individuals serving in the position of CEO have extensive experience and achievements in the field of company management. They must also be considered optimally capable for conducting management aimed at achieving Hitachi\u2019s goals of continuously raising its corporate value and further serving the common interests of its shareholders.\n\nRegarding our CEO Succession Plan, as the speed of change accelerates, we are striving to build a system that enables us to appropriately and promptly secure and develop (both internally and globally) necessary management personnel who will provide leadership that will allow us to realize our growth strategies. We are also concentrating on providing training for selected employees while targeting the early development of candidates for future management positions. Accordingly, we are developing next-generation leaders capable of acting authoritatively and resolutely by establishing forums where participants can discuss what is necessary for Hitachi\u2019s future growth and make recommendations to management.\n\nIn addition, we have identified a group of about 50 employees from around the Hitachi Group with next-generation development potential. People in this \u201cFuture 50\u201d group are selected on merit, regardless of age, gender, or nationality. They are given challenges to help expand their horizons and build their perspectives through tough assignments, including different types of work and internal and external training opportunities. The Future 50 group members receive one-on-one mentoring opportunities with independent directors to benefit directly from their extensive business experience and global perspectives. Our aim is to develop mindsets so that we can develop people for important positions in the future.\nDirector and Executive Officer Compensation\n\nBasic Policy\n- Compensation shall be such that it enables the Company to attract necessary personnel to achieve an improvement in corporate value through global business growth.\n- Compensation shall be commensurate with roles and responsibilities of each Directors and Executive Officers.\n- Compensation for Directors shall be such that it enables them to exercise functions of supervision of management effectively.\n- Compensation for Executive Officers shall be such that it enables them to contribute to sustained improvement in corporate value through the execution of business and employs an appropriate balance between short-term performance and medium- and long-term performance.\n- The level of compensation shall be determined taking into account compensation levels at other companies as well as economic and market trends.\n- The Compensation Committee utilizes external experts to gain expert advice and an objective viewpoint, if necessary, for considering the details and amounts of compensation.\n\nCompensation Structure\n\n(1) Directors\nCompensation for directors is basic remuneration as fixed pay.

The higher the position an executive officer holds, the higher the proportion of variable pay in total annual compensation.\n\nIf it is found that an executive officer has engaged in misconduct during his/her term of office, executive compensation shall be such that it enables the Company to attract necessary personnel to achieve an improvement in corporate value through global business growth.\n\nCompensation to Executive Officers (FY 2020)\n\nBasic remuneration : short-term incentive compensation : medium- and long-term incentive compensation = 1:1:1 ratio\n\n| Fixed pay | Total remuneration | Variable pay |\n|-----------|--------------------|--------------|\n| Basic remuneration | Short-term incentive compensation | Medium- and long-term incentive compensation |\n\nShort-term incentive compensation\n- The amount of short-term incentive compensation is decided within the range of 0 to 200% of a basic amount set according to the relevant position by adjusting that amount to reflect financial results and individual performance.\n\nMedium- and long-term incentive compensation\n- The shares of restricted stock are granted in order to propel management from a medium- and long-term perspective and to provide incentives to bring about a sustainable increase in enterprise value by further promoting senior management\u2019s shared values with shareholders through the holding of shares during their term of office.\n\nThe shares of restricted stock are granted in order to propel management from a medium- and long-term perspective and to provide incentives to bring about a sustainable increase in enterprise value by further promoting senior management\u2019s shared values with shareholders through the holding of shares during their term of office.\n\n*1 The rates used for \u201cother executive officers\u201d apply when \u201cexecutive officers forming the Senior Executive Committee\u201d are in charge of business units or businesses.\n\n*2 Number of shares whose transfer restrictions are lifted = Number of granted shares \u00d7 \\( \\frac{(TSR/TOPIX \\text{ Growth Rate Ratio} \\times 1.25) - 0.5}{100} \\)\n\nPlease refer to Compensation to Directors and Executive Officers on pp. 93\u201398 of the Annual Securities Report (The 151st Business Term).\nInternal Controls over Financial Reporting\n\nTo ensure the reliability of its consolidated financial reporting, the Hitachi Group is establishing and implementing relevant internal controls. We evaluate their effectiveness by adhering to standards for the evaluation of internal controls related to financial reporting that are generally accepted as fair and reasonable.\n\nFurthermore, we have established a J-SOX Committee with the goal of raising the effectiveness of these internal controls. This committee evaluates internal control effectiveness and establishes frameworks designed to improve and strengthen them.\n\nEnhanced Collaboration through Tripartite Audits\n\nIn pursuit of sustainable growth in corporate value, Hitachi\u2019s Audit Committee and internal audit section collaborate with third-party accounting auditors to strengthen its \u201ctripartite auditing,\u201d which aims to increase the effectiveness of internal controls. Our Audit Committee takes the lead in this regard as the three parties communicate closely to share risk information and assessments concerning risk response while securing transparency and ensuring appropriate checks and balances.\nBuilding a More Effective and Efficient Auditing System\n\nOur Audit Committee formulates audit plans in accordance with its risk-based approaches and conducts audits for each consolidated business unit. Audit Committee members meet directly with business unit heads before the internal audit section's audits are carried out. These members then inform the internal audit section about concerns and issues related to the implementation of business strategies aimed at achieving sustainable growth that require attention. At this time, Hitachi also verifies matters that carry high levels of risk in terms of quality, measuring these risks through employee awareness surveys and thorough implementation of business strategies. Hitachi's internal audit section performs regular internal audits at each business site and location. This section reports directly to the CEO and is independent from organizations that are subject to its audits. The internal audit section also formulates audit plans based on past audit records and the most recent business circumstances. Additionally, this section performs audits upon receiving direction from the Audit Committee, ensuring their effectiveness. The internal audit section at Hitachi is responsible for confirming the legality and appropriateness of all business operations, including those related to accounting, production management, sales, purchasing, IT systems, compliance, and human resources. Furthermore, acting on behalf of our management team, the internal audit section confirms that employees are well versed in the ideas and policies of our management, that their operations are being carried out based on these ideas and policies, and that business strategies are being implemented in a way that will efficiently lead to sustainable growth.\n\nTo further raise audit effectiveness, we implemented a \"chief auditor system\" in five sectors (IT, Energy, Industry, Mobility, Smart Life) in April 2019. Through this action, we built an internal control system spearheaded by chief auditors and enhanced collaboration with the executive vice presidents who manage each sector and with the Audit Committee. Although these chief auditors do not act as legal agents under the Companies Act, they still assume responsibility for governance in each sector. They also function as a reporting line for statutory auditors at Hitachi subsidiaries who are legal agents under the Companies Act and are working to improve the efficiency of our internal control systems.\n\nWhen conducting business audits, we use IT systems to expeditiously search for reference information contained within materials submitted prior to audit in an attempt to improve efficiency. We are currently building a system that will allow our internal audit section to share information with professional accounting auditors using the Lumada platform's data lake and expect it to be complete in fiscal 2020. When reading audit reports submitted by the internal audit section, our CEO must be able to quickly understand the issues identified by these reports and make prompt judgments concerning whether immediate action is required. In the future, our internal audit section will continue to maintain its transparency and independence while working to improve audit efficiency as one member of our tripartite audit system.\n\nOur accounting auditors perform audits that focus on the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements. First, they adopt a risk-based approach in response to the group's overall financial status. Applying this approach, they then determine the scope and methods of the audit, formulate an audit plan, and share opinions with the Audit Committee. Next, based on the audit plan, they perform audits on each of the five sectors and the business units they comprise, enabling effective and efficient understanding of data related to Hitachi's finance department and each of its business segments. If, during the auditing process, our accounting auditors discover a degree of risk that could impact future financial statements significantly, or issues that, even if monetarily small, could have a large qualitative effect, they share information related to these risks and issues and progress on response from related divisions with the Audit Committee and internal audit section. They also work to improve and raise the effectiveness of audits by submitting \"management letters\" containing points of concern and improvement suggestions through the finance department. Recently, they have also been working to raise the efficiency of checks on the accuracy of numerical figures by using IT systems to investigate all cases, rather than performing test-checking through sampling.\nWith the globalization of the economy, borderless corporate activities\u2014spanning countries and regions with different governmental and economic frameworks, trade practices, and sets of values\u2014are increasingly vital. Spreading understanding of and respect for norms among all Hitachi Group employees is a fundamental management issue as we seek to rigorously implement fair business practices and avoid risks around the globe. Hitachi addresses this partly through the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct and the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance, which spell out decision-making procedures and actions for all Hitachi Group executive officers and employees.\n\nAdditionally, with stricter regulations in countries and regions around the world regarding important business practices such as bribery prevention and adherence to competition law, Hitachi has formulated in-house regulations in line with international standards, and is sharing these regulations and enforcing thorough compliance throughout the Group.\n\n**Core initiatives**\n- Comply with the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct\n- Implement the Hitachi Global Compliance Program (HGCP)\n- Prevent antisocial transactions\n- Prevent bribery and corrupt practices\n- Comply with competition law\n- Carry out strict export control\n- Implement thorough tax compliance\n\n**Goals and KPIs**\n- Compliance reporting achievements: 459 reports\n- Thorough implementation of prevention of bribery and corrupt practices and compliance with competition law\n\n**Achievements in FY 2019**\n- Formulated the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance\n- Conducted a compliance risk survey of 821 Group companies\n- Launched a Group-wide internal reporting system called the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline\n- Had more than 170,000 employees, including executive officers, complete an e-learning program on prevention of bribery and corrupt practices and compliance with competition law\n- Conducted training sessions to prevent violations of competition law for general managers from sales divisions more likely to be exposed to compliance risks\nHitachi, Ltd. has formulated the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, which all executives and employees across the entire Group pledge to uphold. The Codes of Conduct are translated into 13 languages and shared with Hitachi Group executive officers and employees around the world. An e-learning tool has also been made available in Japanese and 13 other languages to reinforce understanding of the Codes of Conduct. Additionally, the Hitachi Group performs an annual employee survey on awareness of matters such as business ethics and compliance as part of its efforts to cultivate a healthy corporate culture.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we explored ways to ensure a deeper understanding among all executive officers and employees of the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct and clearly share the ideas on corporate ethics and compliance that must be shared across the entire Hitachi Group. The result of this process was the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance, established in April 2020 to further emphasize to Hitachi executive officers and employees the importance of acting in accordance with corporate ethics and following compliance procedures. The code has been translated into 14 languages and shared with executive officers and employees around the world.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we conducted a compliance risk survey of 821 Group companies worldwide with the aim of implementing the compliance program based on risk management classification applicable throughout the Hitachi Group. Based on the survey results, we will allocate resources to high-risk operations and regions, thereby securing the effectiveness of the program as we strive to take thoroughgoing measures according to risk levels.\n\nCompliance Reporting System\n\nTo prevent and promptly address illegal or inappropriate activity and enhance its ability to self-regulate, Hitachi has instituted an internal reporting system allowing direct reports to be made regarding actual or suspected compliance violations. This system can be used not only by employees within the Hitachi Group but also by temporary staff and business partners, such as suppliers and distributors. The facts related to all reports are subject to thorough investigation and checking, and people who have identified themselves in the reports are informed of the investigation results. We make every effort to deal with situations as appropriate, including taking remedial action where necessary. In fiscal 2019, we received 459 reports from all Group companies worldwide.\n\nIn addition, we have implemented the Channel to the Board of Directors system to allow all Hitachi, Ltd. employees to directly report problems anonymously or under their real names to Hitachi directors in cases where they see any illegality or extreme inappropriateness in business conduct by division heads, executive officers, or other management personnel.\nIn fiscal 2019, to further strengthen the Group\u2019s governance and compliance, we integrated internal reporting systems within the Group into a Group-wide system called the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline. Launched in April 2020, the new system enhances our reporting system capacity by offering 24/7 service in multiple languages both online and via telephone.\n\n**Prevention of Antisocial Transactions**\n\nTo cut off all relationships with organized crime groups and other antisocial forces, in the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct we have laid out provisions stating that we will never engage in antisocial transactions under any circumstances, and will refuse any improper demands and unfair deals. We conduct eligibility checks on new as well as existing business partners and, in Japan, include antisocial force rejection clauses in contracts so that if it is determined that a business partner belongs to an antisocial force, we can promptly void the contract and end the relationship. The entire Hitachi Group acts decisively to eliminate approaches from antisocial forces in partnership with external specialist institutions (the National Center for the Elimination of Boryokudan or the police).\n\n**Policies for Preventing Bribery and Corrupt Practices**\n\nPreventing bribery and corrupt practices is a major challenge for any company today. Hitachi established rules against bribery and corruption for the HGCP along with guidelines indicating specific spending thresholds for entertainment, gifts, and other arrangements provided to public officials. We also have policies banning facilitation payments and requiring due diligence procedures for business partners. With anti-corruption regulations growing stricter in recent years around the globe, we also expend great effort ensuring that we are in strict compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and all other relevant laws and regulations in the countries and regions where we do business.\n\n**Educational Activities for Preventing Bribery and Corrupt Practices**\n\nTo ensure awareness of the HGCP rules and policies concerning prevention of bribery and corruption and compliance with competition law, we developed a global e-learning program about them and made it available in 15 languages\u2014including Japanese, English, and Chinese\u2014for use by Group companies worldwide.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, more than 170,000 employees across the Hitachi Group, including executives, completed the e-learning program. To raise awareness of compliance, we asked participants to pledge to adhere to compliance rules.\n\n**Competition Law Compliance Policy**\n\nHitachi engages in business based on the principles of conformance with the law and business ethics and fair and open competition. We included business standards and guidelines related to these principles in the HGCP, in addition to rules concerning competition law.\n\n**Preventing Violations of Competition Law**\n\nAs with our initiatives against bribery and corrupt practices, we are developing educational activities globally using e-learning material available in 15 languages\u2014including Japanese, English, and Chinese\u2014while at the same time ensuring that we comply with the HGCP\u2019s rules concerning competition law and other related business standards and guidelines. To enhance awareness of ethical principles and practices globally, we created a global version of our standards regarding contact with competitors. We also provide a collection of case studies on competition law and other topics for workplace discussion to Group companies in three languages\u2014Japanese, English, and Chinese\u2014to raise employee awareness.\n(1) Group companies strictly comply with all relevant laws and implement tax management when pursuing their business activities, bearing in mind such international tax-compliance standards as the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as that body\u2019s Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).\n\n(2) Group companies effectively, continually, and proactively manage tax-related issues as socially responsible organizations, while maintaining Hitachi brand value and seeking to maximize shareholder value.\n\n(3) Group companies build sincere and positive relations of trust with the tax authorities in the regions where the companies do business, and strive to maintain and develop those relations.\n\n**Tax Compliance Initiatives**\n\nTo ensure risk management for taxation in response to globalization, Hitachi follows relevant tax-related regulations applicable to the Group as a whole as well as rules for transfer pricing management. We also manage transfer pricing in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the laws and regulations on transfer pricing in each country or region where Group companies are located.\n\n**Violations of Laws and Regulation**\n\nIn fiscal 2019, there were no incidents in which Hitachi violated or was penalized under laws or regulations regarding bribery or corrupt practices. One of our Group companies, however, was found to have violated a competition law in an international deal involving automobile parts. We take this incident seriously and are striving to prevent recurrence of such violations by revising our organization and policies and enhancing education and audits. Regarding tax compliance, Hitachi acts in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and did not have any significant fines or nonmonetary sanctions for noncompliance with tax laws and regulations.\nSocial and environmental issues, including climate change, resource depletion, the curtailment of business activity due to significant disasters, and social instability due to growing inequality, are having a substantial impact on corporate value creation and business models. Amid such a drastic change in the business environment, companies must have a clear understanding of opportunities and risks and take appropriate measures if they are to achieve sustainable growth.\n\nHitachi launched an Investment Strategy Committee to strengthen the quantitative risk management of its investments. The Executive Sustainability Committee deliberates the social and environmental impact of our business activities to clarify any negative impact our business has on society and the environment and to identify countermeasures. Meanwhile, we remain actively engaged in promoting our own sustainable growth while contributing to the realization of a sustainable society by seeking out business opportunities contributing to the resolution of global issues, including those relevant to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Society 5.0. In addition, we are enhancing our business continuity plans (BCPs) to ensure that the impact of risks does not disrupt our business and thereby significantly affect society.\n\nSince fiscal 2019, along with disclosing key information based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we have also been promoting climate change responses.\nAddressing Risks and Opportunities\n\nRisks and Opportunities\n\nUnder the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, which began in fiscal 2019, we will expand our business while leveraging the company\u2019s competitive advantages. We plan to invest \u00a52.0\u20132.5 trillion in focus areas over the three-year period ending in fiscal 2021. A solid risk management system is indispensable for seizing growth opportunities and implementing aggressive management.\n\nHitachi established the Investment Strategy Division in 2017 and the post of Chief Risk Management Officer (CRMO) in April 2020 to better understand risk and take appropriate action. The company in the same year established the Executive Sustainability Committee to focus on the company\u2019s policies regarding social and environmental issues. Our efforts in this area also included a move to identify issues that could be seen as business opportunities, as well as the negative effects on society and the environment from our business activities and the measures Hitachi is taking to address them.\n\nRisk Management System\n\nThe business environment is changing day by day, impacted by the continued advance of information and communications technology, as exemplified by IoT, and geopolitical risks arising from complex shifts in political and economic conditions around the world. Hitachi aims to create new revenue opportunities while controlling risks. To do this, we maintain a clear understanding and analysis of the operating environment, taking into account social issues, as well as our competitive advantages and management resources, and conduct risk management with an eye toward the many risks the company should be prepared for as well as opportunities for growth.\n\nIn April 2020, we established the new post of CRMO to formulate and execute risk management policies and strategies for the entire Hitachi Group. We also established the Hitachi Group Corporate Ethics and Compliance Code to clearly share ideas regarding corporate ethics and compliance that should be shared throughout Hitachi, as we work to further ensure that all Hitachi executives and employees act in complete compliance with corporate ethics.\nTo accelerate the global Social Innovation Business amid structural changes and increasing uncertainty in the world economy, it is increasingly important to understand investment risks and opportunities (e.g., M&A and orders for projects) and to take appropriate measures. As shown in the flowchart below, with regard to individual investment decisions (e.g., execution, business plan changes and disposals), under the ultimate authority of the Board of Directors and depending on the scale and content of the projects, Hitachi delegates authority to the Senior Executive Committee (which, in principle, meets twice per month) and respective business units to facilitate flexible and appropriate decision-making. In addition, regarding important matters to be deliberated by the Senior Executive Committee, prior to deliberations, discussions are held with the Investment Strategy Committee*1 advisory body, whose findings, including pros and cons, are reported to Senior Executive Committee members, including the President.\n\n*1 Investment Strategy Committee: Consists of 10 members from the finance department and other relevant corporate divisions (as of March 31, 2020), including the Executive Officers in charge of Investment Strategy and Management Strategy as chairman and vice chairman.\n\nAfter making an investment, Hitachi regularly monitors the business objectives and achievement status of the project, considering changes in the external environment. In principle, each business unit ensures flexibility, but Headquarters may also be involved depending on the level of importance. Also, regarding changes in business plans and the disposal or reorganization of important investment targets, discussions are held by the Senior Executive Committee as in the execution stage. For investment targets whose business is not progressing as planned, Hitachi established a framework to deliberate on the pros and cons of continuing business, including withdrawal as an option, so as to improve capital efficiency.\n\nThrough the above process, Hitachi will further strengthen asset profitability and risk tolerance while ascertaining risks before and after investments are made.\n\nHitachi calculates the maximum risk (Value at Risk) assumed by statistical methods according to the type of assets held on the Group\u2019s consolidated balance sheet.\n\nConsidering total consolidated net assets and other factors, we visualize the surplus capacity of growth investments to monitor growth opportunities and ensure that risks are not excessively unbalanced compared to Hitachi\u2019s consolidated management strength.\n\nIn addition, by analyzing risk conditions in each country and sector and the outlook for future trends, Hitachi gains a quantitative understanding of risk concentrations in specific countries and sectors in comparison with profitability.\nUnderstanding and Responding to Risks and Opportunities Related to Sustainability\n\nSocial and environmental issues, including climate change, resource depletion, the curtailment of business activity due to significant disasters, and social instability due to growing inequality, are having a substantial impact on corporate value creation and business models. Amid such drastic changes in the business environment, companies must have a clear understanding of opportunities and risks and take appropriate measures if they are to achieve sustainable growth over the long term.\n\nHitachi can gain a clear understanding of sustainability-related risks, and accordingly take appropriate actions, thanks to the efforts of the Executive Sustainability Committee and other related committees. We remain actively engaged in promoting our own sustainable growth while contributing to the realization of a sustainable society by seeking out business opportunities contributing to the resolution of important domestic and overseas issues, including those relevant to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Society 5.0.\n\n### Major Risks and Opportunities\n\n| Major risk factors | Details on risks and opportunities | Company actions |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Fluctuations in product supply and demand, exchange rates, and resource prices; insufficient raw materials and components | \u2022 Price fluctuations, including for products, exchange rate impact, and excess inventory \u2022 Exchange rate impact and price fluctuations, including for raw materials and components \u2022 Impact from significant disasters on the supply chain \u2022 Shrinking demand and impact on the supply chain caused by the spread of COVID-19 | \u2022 Build close relationships with multiple suppliers \u2022 Ensure an appropriate response to changes in demand in each region by promoting a local production and local consumption model for products and services \u2022 Strengthen resilience to business interruption risks by formulating BCPs at domestic and major overseas facilities |\n| Rapid technological innovation | \u2022 Overdose competitiveness if development of cutting-edge technology or application of a product/service does not progress as expected \u2022 Reduction or elimination of existing market due to technological innovation | \u2022 Promote open innovation through industry-academia-government cooperation \u2022 Secure and develop digital talent \u2022 Strengthen Lumada \u2022 Foster an innovation ecosystem through the above |\n| Securing human resources | \u2022 Impact on new hires and worker retention due to increased competition to hire and retain highly skilled workers | \u2022 Develop advanced technology to generate new business opportunities |\n| Occupational health and safety | \u2022 Impact on business due to inability to create healthy, safe, and secure work environments \u2022 Impact on business activities from employees infected with COVID-19 | \u2022 Establish a global occupational health and safety system that includes lessons learned from global operations, the entrenchment of global norms, and the sharing of success stories |\n\n### Risk Factors\n\nWe conduct business on a global scale across a broad range of business areas and utilize sophisticated, specialized technologies to carry out our operations. Thus, we are exposed to a wide range of risks related to our operations. The following risks are based on the assumptions we consider reasonable as of the date this report was issued.\n\nFor more information on business risks and other risks, please refer to our 151st Annual Securities Report.\n| Major risk factors | Details on risks and opportunities | Company actions |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| M&A, investment in new projects, etc. | \u2022 Failure related to insufficient management of projects involving M&A aimed at strengthening the Social Innovation Business, investment in new projects, R&D investment/CAPEX, and large-scale orders | \u2022 Carry out strategy formulation in business units and phase-gate management in various councils and approval meetings |\n| | \u2022 Build a foundation for growth through the acquisition of new management resources | \u2022 Analyze and discuss market trends, other company trends, technological trends and potential risks at Investment Strategy Committees, Business Strategy Meeting, Senior Executive Committees, Board of Director and Audit Committee meetings |\n| Geopolitical risks | \u2022 Impact on Hitachi Group\u2019s overseas businesses due to political, economic and social trends | \u2022 Regularly update our understanding of global political and economic trends, analyze the impact on our business and swiftly implement countermeasures on a Group-wide basis |\n| Tighter laws and regulations | \u2022 Tighter laws and regulations regarding investment, exports, and customs duties | \u2022 Operate personal information protection systems in line with Hitachi\u2019s personal information protection policy |\n| | Example: Impact on business activities from the introduction of new laws and regulations related to the protection of personal data, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe | \u2022 Identify businesses subject to the GDPR, assess risk, implement appropriate safety management measures in line with those risks, and conduct worker training |\n| Compliance | \u2022 Loss of trust and a decline in corporate value as a result of corporate behavior that deviates from social norms and violates laws, including relating to bribery and anti-competitive activities | \u2022 Implement Group-wide compliance programs based on Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct as highest principles |\n| Product quality and responsibility | \u2022 Loss of trust and claims for damages due to defects or a deterioration in product and service quality because of the increased complexity/sophistication of products or services, or the diversification of production sites or suppliers | \u2022 Strengthen the quality assurance system |\n| | \u2022 Strengthen measures to prevent bribery and violation of competition laws | \u2022 Engage in activities aimed at preventing accidents |\n| Climate change/significant disasters | \u2022 Impact on business activities due to measures in line with the tightening of international regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of energy and resources | \u2022 Engage in activities aimed at ensuring compliance with laws and regulations related to technology |\n| | \u2022 Impact on business activities, from production to sales, due to a significant disaster affecting major facilities in Japan or overseas | \u2022 Ensure intensive risk assessment |\n| | \u2022 Expand the decarbonization business by offering climate change-related solutions | \u2022 Implement measures for handling product accidents |\n| | \u2022 Strengthen measures to achieve the CO2 reduction targets in Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 | \u2022 Conduct quality and reliability-related training |\n| Information security | \u2022 Computer viruses or other factors adversely affecting information systems | \u2022 Achieving a Decarbonized Society |\n| | \u2022 Expand revenue opportunities through increased demand for information security measures | \u2022 Climate-related Financial Information Disclosures |\n| | \u2022 Respond to increased demand for IT solutions in line with the expansion of remote work | \u2022 Business Continuation Initiatives |\n| | \u2022 Promote cybersecurity strategies through risk management and value creation | \u2022 Hitachi Integrated Report 2020 (P. 28) Creation of Social and Environmental Value |\n| | \u2022 Enhance technological and product development for digital environments | http://www.hitachi.com/IR-e/library/integrated/index.html |\n| | \u2022 Respond to increased demand for IT solutions in line with the expansion of remote work | |\nHitachi's Thinking on BCPs\n\nGiven the close relation of our business to social infrastructure, we are enhancing our business continuity plans (BCPs) to ensure that the impact of risks does not disrupt our business and thereby significantly affect society. The Hitachi Group Guidelines for Developing Business Continuity Plans (Overview) and the Hitachi Group Guidelines for Developing Business Continuity Plans (By Department) were issued in Japanese, and then translated into English and Chinese for distribution to all Hitachi Group companies to enhance preparedness for major disasters and other risks.\n\nRegarding infectious diseases, we released the Hitachi Group Guidelines for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness in Japanese, English, and Chinese. In fiscal 2019, they served as a useful tool in dealing with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nWe have also appointed personnel with responsibility for risk-response policies at our main overseas bases. Around 300 overseas Group companies prepared BCPs to strengthen their ability to respond to business risks, including major disasters, infectious diseases, political instability, social disruption, and acts of terrorism.\n\nResponding to COVID-19\n\nA COVID-19 task force led by the president of Hitachi, Ltd. was established at Group headquarters to provide instructions on preventive measures to Group companies worldwide. Similarly, each Group company formed its own task force to secure the safety of their employees and business continuity while helping to maintain social infrastructure through its business operations.\n\nOur regional headquarters around the world gather local information as well as sharing information on the measures taken by Hitachi Group companies in their respective regions.\n\nBCP Initiatives in Japan\n\n- Created BCPs for both major earthquakes and novel strains of influenza as appropriate to each business operation (fiscal 2011).\n- Conducted earthquake drills simulating a major seismic event (annually).\n- Conducted initial response drills simulating a major earthquake in the suburbs of Tokyo (2018).\n- Developed action plans including setting up substitute headquarters in the Kansai region in case our Tokyo headquarters temporarily cease to function (2017); conducted drills to set up substitute headquarters (2019).\n- Conducted drills to set up an earthquake task force on a remote-work basis, on the assumption that a major seismic event had occurred on a holiday, shutting down traffic (2019).\n\nProcurement BCPs Initiatives\n\nTo minimize the impact of disasters that may occur, the procurement divisions in business units and key Group companies in Japan have created procurement BCPs that (1) standardize and use generic parts to make procurement as flexible as possible; (2) cultivate multiple suppliers; (3) distribute production across several locations; (4) budget inventory strategically; and (5) consider substitute products.\n\nWe held desktop exercises to see whether or not procurement BCPs would be effective against earthquakes and held group discussions about what should be done during and after such disasters, seeking further improvements.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, all major Group business sites in Japan with production lines (192 sites in total) took steps to strengthen the procurement BCPs.\n\nIn January 2020, we introduced the Procurement BCPs Management System for our business partners in Japan to efficiently share information among Hitachi Group companies in time of a disaster.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nImproving Safety for Employees Sent to Dangerous Regions\n\nThe president of Hitachi, Ltd. strengthened our policy of ensuring the safety of employees sent to countries and areas at higher risk of conflicts, terrorism, and other threats. Survey missions of in-house and outside experts are sent beforehand to such areas. After employees are dispatched, we conduct additional local surveys every six months to confirm the effectiveness of our safety policies.\n\nHitachi is also contributing to safety measures at other Japanese corporations operating outside Japan. To help enhance collaboration between the private and public sectors in this area, we participate in the Council for Public-Private Cooperation for Overseas Safety organized by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and take part in public-private exercises to counter terrorism and kidnapping.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, against the threat of terrorism expanding around the world and the COVID-19 pandemic, we employed a range of safety measures, including providing timely alerts to employees. This underscores our commitment to ensuring the safety of our employees working around the globe.\nEven as the development of IoT creates new value, cyberattacks are growing increasingly sophisticated and widening in focus from traditional IT to encompass the IoT/OT field as well. The risks for corporations include leaks of information, operational stoppages, and even direct disruption to business, making information security one of the most critical issues companies face. The development of Hitachi\u2019s Social Innovation Business has highlighted the vital importance of information security governance as a key management issue, and measures are being put in place to address it.\n\nWith the arrival of the digital age due to advances in IT and the internationalization of socioeconomic activity, privacy risks have also increased. Data associated with individuals, including location information and purchase history, has come to be known collectively as \u201cpersonal data.\u201d The use of personal data can be expected to create value going forward, but protecting this data and showing due consideration for privacy is essential. Hitachi not only implements comprehensive personal information management, strictly adhering to all relevant laws and regulations in every country and region where it does business, it also aims to create value by using personal data safely and securely while keeping privacy protected.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\nEven as the development of IoT creates new value, cyberattacks are growing increasingly sophisticated and widening in focus from traditional IT to encompass the IoT/OT field as well.

The Japan Business Federation\u2019s Declaration of Cyber Security Management also placed emphasis on cyber security measures as a critical management challenge from the aspects of both value creation and risk management. Hitachi approaches the issue of information security governance based on the same concept.\n\nAt the same time, as a global company, we regard cyber security risk as one of our management risks. Accordingly, to allow us to declare both internally and externally Group policies for addressing this risk, we have formulated Information Security Policies in line with our corporate management policies and based on our cyber security risk management.\n\nWe have our data centers and other divisions ISMS-certified by the ISMS Accreditation Center in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System international standard. This certification has been received by 7 divisions of Hitachi, Ltd. and 27 divisions of 21 Group companies.*1\n\n*1 As of July 31, 2020.\n\nInformation Security Policies\n\n1. Formulation and continuous improvement to information security management regulations\n2. Protection and continuous management of information assets\n3. Strict observance of laws and standards\n4. Education and training\n5. Incident prevention and management\n6. Assurance of fair business practices within the corporate group\n\nFramework for Promoting Information Security\n\nChaired by the CISO, the Information Security Committee determines all policies and procedures for information security and personal information protection. These decisions are conveyed to all Hitachi Group business sites and companies, and are implemented by the relevant information security officers.\n\nInformation Security Management\n\nHitachi reinforces its information security in line with its Global Information Security Administration Rules, which conform to the international ISO/IEC 27001 standard. These rules are globally distributed by the headquarters of Hitachi, Ltd. and its Group companies. Other measures include actively promoting the use of shared security services and related support for information security provided by regional headquarters in the Americas, Europe, Southeast Asia, China, and India.\n\nThe Information Security Committee determines policies and procedures for information security and personal information protection. The Information Security Promotion Council and other bodies convey decisions internally and to other companies in the Hitachi Group. Information security officers at business sites and companies ensure that these decisions are implemented in the workplace.\n\nDetails of our information security initiatives are contained in our Information Security Report.\nAs cyberattack methods become more diversified, our business is at a higher risk of damage from incidents taking place in a broader range of areas. To address this risk, in fiscal 2019 we expanded the scope of our risk management from the security of the internal IT environment used by our existing OA to launch a new series of cyber security risk management activities. We are currently working to reduce business risk by expanding our efforts in the environments where products and services are developed, produced, and manufactured as well as the supply chain and the process of developing products and services.\n\nAchievements in FY 2019\n\nSecurity Monitoring\nIn Hitachi, the Security Operation Center (SOC) monitors security on a 24/7 basis so global-scale cyberattacks can be detected and countermeasures initiated right away. The Incident Response Team (IRT) collects and develops threat intelligence*1 and manages the response to any security incidents.\n\nPreventing Information Leaks\nHitachi takes the following IT steps to prevent information leaks: encrypting devices; using thin clients;*1 employing electronic document access control and expiration processing software; maintaining ID management and access control by building an authentication infrastructure; and filtering e-mail and visited websites. In response to the recent spate of targeted e-mail attacks and other cyberattacks, we are participating in an initiative to share information between the private sector and the government. We are also enhancing our IT organization by adding more layers to our leak prevention procedures.\n\nTo prevent leaks from our suppliers, we review their information security measures based on Hitachi\u2019s own standards before allowing them access to confidential information. We also provide tools to suppliers (procurement partners) for security education and for checking business information on computers. In addition, we require suppliers to check and remove business information from personal computers.\n\nEducation on Information Security\nHitachi holds annual e-learning programs on information security and personal information protection for all executive officers and employees. Nearly all of the roughly 40,000 employees at Hitachi, Ltd. participate in these programs. We offer a variety of courses that have different goals and are tailored to different target audiences, including new employees, new managers, and information system administrators. We also implement simulation training to educate employees about malicious targeted e-mail attacks and other cyberattacks. Employees are sent examples of targeted e-mail to heighten their awareness of security through direct experience.\n\nOur educational programs, shared within the Group, provide Group-wide education on information security and personal information protection.\n\nThorough Information Security Audits and Inspections\nThe Hitachi Group has developed its approach to security based on the \u201cplan-do-check-act\u201d (PDCA) cycle for its information security management system. We conduct annual information security and personal information protection audits at all Group companies and business units.\n\nThe president of Hitachi, Ltd. appoints officers to conduct independent audits. These officers are not allowed to audit their own units, underlining our commitment to fairness and objectivity in auditing. There are 196 Hitachi Group companies in Japan, including Hitachi, Ltd., that conduct audits in the same way as Hitachi, Ltd., and all results are subject to confirmation. For Hitachi Group companies outside Japan, we use a \u201ccommon global self-check\u201d approach to ensure Group-wide auditing and inspections. We implement Confirmation of Personal Information Protection and Information Security Management annually for the voluntary inspection of Hitachi, Ltd. business unit workplaces. We conduct monthly Confirmation of Personal Information Protection and Information Security Management assessments at 629 operations (as of March 2020) that handle important personal information. This regular control mechanism ensures ample safety management and implementation.\n\n*1 Threat intelligence: An approach to countering cyberattacks using knowledge of new threats gathered from a range of information on cyber security.\n\n*1 Thin client: A terminal with the minimum necessary software. Thin-client computing significantly enhances cyber security by storing applications and data on the server.\nPersonal Information Protection\n\nPersonal Information Protection Policy\n\nHitachi, Ltd.\u2019s Personal Information Protection Policy sets out its corporate philosophy and principles on personal information protection. The policy is disseminated to all executive officers and employees, as well as being publicly available.\n\nA personal information protection management system based on the policy has also been established. Through the rollout of the system, as well as the safe handling of personal information, programs for all employees, and periodic audits, we are ensuring protection of personal information.\n\nPrivacy Mark*1 Certification\n\nHitachi, Ltd. received Privacy Mark certification. The entire Hitachi Group is committed to personal information protection, with 39 Hitachi Group companies having received the Privacy Mark as of March 31, 2020.\n\nHitachi also strives to safeguard personal information globally at Group companies outside Japan based on each company\u2019s personal information protection policy and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations as well as the expectations of society at large.\n\nThere were no cases of personal information leakage during fiscal 2019.\n\n*1 Privacy Mark: A third-party certification established in April 1998 that is granted by the assessment body Japan Information Processing Development Corporation to businesses that have taken appropriate security management and protection measures related to personal information.\n\nResponding to Personal Data Protection Laws Around the World\n\nWith the increasing risk of privacy violation in recent years due to the advent of the digital age following advances in IT and the globalization of socio-economic activities, lawmakers are actively seeking to create and modify relevant laws and legislation in countries and regions around the world. The Hitachi Group pays close attention to relevant laws and legislation on a global basis, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), making efforts to comply with them across the Group. It also monitors relevant legislation and social trends and takes action in response when necessary.\n\nManagement Framework for Customer Information\n\nHitachi\u2019s customer relations management framework, HiCRM, has been deployed at approximately 200 Group companies to collect and accurately manage customer and transaction information Group-wide, in addition to serving as a marketing tool. HiCRM covers more than 80% of the orders received across the whole Group, with the database enabling us to formulate more effective sales strategies and offer collaborative solutions by multiple businesses. Going forward, we will consider rolling out the system more aggressively across the Group.\n\nPrivacy Protection Initiatives by Hitachi\u2019s IT Sector\n\nWe are taking proactive steps on privacy protections to ensure that personal data is used safely and securely.\n\nIn Hitachi\u2019s IT sector, which leads our digital business, we have assigned a personal data manager responsible for managing privacy protection and established a privacy protection advisory committee to support risk assessments and develop countermeasures based on knowledge and expertise of privacy protection. In accordance with the policies set by the committee, our employees implement privacy impact assessments for processes where personal data will be handled and take measures to prevent privacy violations. When employees find it difficult to assess risks on their own, or conclude that risks of privacy violation are high, the privacy protection advisory committee will extend support to deal with the case and help reduce risks. In fiscal 2019, we dealt with 190 privacy protection cases of this sort.\n\nIn order to leverage the expertise built on these experiences when conducting business with our customers, we have made publicly available a whitepaper on Hitachi\u2019s privacy protection initiatives in the use of personal data. Furthermore, Hitachi regularly conducts consumer opinion surveys on the use of consumer data in big data businesses to understand changing consumer perceptions and take them into consideration when updating privacy protection measures.\nOnline Content Management\n\nInformation Management Policies on the Use of the Web and Social Media\n\nHitachi has been active in promoting initiatives to deepen customer understanding of its Social Innovation Business through its corporate website and social media accounts. To protect our brand and avoid violating the rights of others, including human rights, in implementing these initiatives, we have established the Hitachi Social Media Policy for global use, which stipulates usage policies. To raise awareness of this policy, an e-learning tool on approaching the use of social media and addressing associated risks is available in Japanese, English, and Chinese.\n## Governance Data\n\n### Corporate Governance\n\n#### Leadership Demographics\n\n|                        | Total | Male | Female | Japanese | Non-Japanese |\n|------------------------|-------|------|--------|----------|--------------|\n| Directors*1            | 13    | 11   | 2      | 7        | 6            |\n| Executive officers*2   | 33    | 33   | 0      | 31       | 2            |\n| Executive and corporate officers*3 | 70    | 65   | 5      | 64       | 6            |\n\n*1 As of July 2020.\n*2 Including 10 independent directors (four from Japan and six from outside Japan).\n*3 Including fellows.\nTo enhance the reliability of the data disclosed in the Hitachi Sustainability Report 2020, we have received independent assurance of key environmental and social performance indicators by KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd.
