Each day, their ingenuity, passion, and dedication enable our employees as well as customers of all types \u2013 households, companies, and entire communities \u2013 to be more sustainable. They enable E.ON to remain a highly successful and responsible company in a continually evolving environment. That\u2019s why we call them Sustainability Enablers. We invite you to meet five of them and read about their projects, their ideas, and what sustainability means to them. They\u2019re actively addressing a range of environmental and social issues, from using data analytics to tackling climate change to fostering an inclusive work culture. But they all share a commitment to enabling a better future for our company and our customers.\n\nFranz V\u00f6lkl\n\nSustainability requires special people, and we have them.\n\nLaura Hield-Ryder\n\nListening to other people\u2019s experiences has reminded me to be kind to myself.\n\nJuan Zamphiropolos\n\nMunicipalities want to be sustainable cities, and that means monitoring their energy consumption and identifying ways to reduce it.\n\nMichael Wahl\n\nI want E.ON to enable a sustainable economy while also being an exemplary environmental steward.\n\nFlore de Durfort\n\nHaving the right ideas often begins by asking the right people the right question.\n\n\u00a9Irmgard Sinnesbichler\nWhat does your role at E.ON Digital Technology (EDT) involve?\nIncubation, as the name suggests, is about providing the right conditions for something \u2013 in our case, new technologies and new data-driven business models \u2013 to develop and, eventually, hatch. I\u2019m responsible for identifying the ones that are most promising, prioritising them according to their potential, and giving them the space and resources to mature. The aim is to transform a great idea into a scalable, high-impact product. Monetisation, on the other hand, is about ensuring that E.ON systematically maximises the value from its data. Our Global Advanced Analytics and AI team works to ensure that E.ON isn\u2019t only a company that has lots of data and an AI department. But that we\u2019re also a company that has data in its DNA: our business decisions are data-driven, and we use data to generate business growth \u2013 inside E.ON and elsewhere. This approach leads to a lot of product ideas, many of which promote sustainability.\n\nOne of the products you\u2019ve incubated at EDT is E.ON Rooftop. What is it and how does it promote sustainability?\nE.ON Rooftop combines and manipulates data to automatically quantify the rooftop solar potential of any building anywhere in Europe. It therefore answers a question that millions of customers ask themselves: does installing solar panels on my roof make practical, financial, and environmental sense? We\u2019re making it available as an application programming interface and believe it will enable a large number of use cases across all E.ON markets and business units. E.ON Rooftop is trained to segment satellite imagery, to estimate a building\u2019s usable roof area, its orientation, and the solar irradiance at its location, and to calculate the building\u2019s annual potential solar output, the optimal solar array for this particular rooftop as well as the financial attractiveness of the investment. And E.ON Rooftop can do this for the roof of any structure \u2013 a home, an apartment building, a hospital, a factory, even an entire municipality \u2013 anywhere in Europe. It\u2019s therefore an important way in which E.ON is enabling Europe to become climate-neutral. By bundling and manipulating data in a unique way, we\u2019ve created a tool that empowers customers to make meaningful decisions about being more sustainable and more energy-autonomous. And prevented E.ON from having to rely on third parties for this strategic capability. The first use cases are scheduled for launch in the first quarter of 2021, and the team is very excited about it.\n\nWhere do the ideas for new products and services come from?\nHaving the right ideas often begins by asking the right people the right questions. This means talking to colleagues, industry peers, the research community, and especially customers. A lot of what we do is user research. A user\u2019s problem is\nmuch more powerful than an idea. Take e-mobility. Electric cars are available in all vehicles classes: subcompacts, saloons, SUVs, even sportscars. All of these models are cleaner, quieter, and often cheaper to operate than their combustion-engine counterparts. The question, therefore, is why in the world are more people not embracing e-mobility? In such cases, we conduct user research to find out what\u2019s preventing them from switching and use the findings to develop a value proposition and, eventually, a product. The result in this case was the E.ON E-Mobility Coach, a web app that enables customers to understand what switching to e-mobility would feel like. What E.ON Rooftop does for buildings, the E-Mobility Coach does for transport: it enables potentially millions of customers to make an important facet of their lives climate-friendlier. Both products are great examples of how data analytics, AI, and a user-centric perspective are responsible for the most impactful things taking place in the energy sector.\n\nYou\u2019ve told us about two ideas you\u2019ve successfully hatched. What are you developing now? Our pipeline has a lot of exciting projects. My two favourites are the Sustainability Mirror and Grid Carbon Intensity. The idea behind the Sustainability Mirror is to empower people to find out how sustainable their neighbourhood is, why, and, most importantly, what they can do to make positive difference. It\u2019s a web application based on an open-source, data-driven sustainability index that we codeveloped with one of our research partners, the LMU Munich. Its purpose is to help position E.ON as an enabler for citizens to find out what they can do to live more sustainably. The aim of Grid Carbon Intensity is to develop a model able to estimate, in real time, how green the power is that\u2019s flowing through our distribution grids. Good data-based solutions often increase transparency and thus raise customers\u2019 awareness. In this case, making clear to our customers the hours of the day when their electricity is greenest will empower them to shift energy-hungry tasks \u2013 like running dishwashers, washers, and driers and charging their e-cars \u2013 to these hours.\n\nWhat motivates you and your team to be creative? Shaping a better tomorrow! Our Global Advanced Analytics and AI team brings together more than 60 data specialists with highly sought-after skills. They all could find a new job in a second. When I ask them why they joined and remain at E.ON, the most frequent response is that they care about the energy transition. They want to work for an industry that can make a meaningful difference in the future of their community and, indeed, the entire planet. We shouldn\u2019t underestimate the power of this motivation. I believe people give their best when they see a clear connection between their work\u2019s macroeconomic impact and their values. I feel I have a personal responsibility to ensure that the members of my team see the big picture and are aware of the positive impact their work is having on the energy world.\n\nSustainability is key to many of your projects at work. What about off the job? I try to be a responsible consumer. For example, I challenged myself to buy almost everything I need for my one-year-old son second-hand: clothes, furniture, and toys. I also don\u2019t own a car and instead use public transport or my bike, which is how I take my son to day care. But sustainability isn\u2019t just about the planet. It\u2019s also about people. That\u2019s why I ensure that I find the time to be there for my son and watch him grow. I\u2019m a woman and mother with a professional career. So diversity and gender equality are important issues for me, particularly as a manager: I have several women in my team, and I try to make sure they feel empowered. I also make it a priority to develop female talent at E.ON.\nMichael Wahl was born in Illingen, Germany, in 1963. He joined Westnetz in Saarbr\u00fccken in 1987 as deputy head of high-voltage overhead lines. In 1992 he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Saarbr\u00fccken University of Applied Sciences and was promoted to department head. Michael\u2019s favourite part of his job is ECM. Outside work, his biggest hobby is car-nival, a multi-week festive period before Lent celebrated in some parts of Germany. Michael is president of his carnival club\u2019s board and helps plan numerous events. He and his family live in Heusweiler, which is located about 15 kilometres north of Saarbr\u00fccken.\n\nHow does Ecological corridor management (ECM) around power lines differ from conventional practices?\nThe conventional approach is reactive: simply accept the types of vegetation near power lines, let them grow until they get within about three metres of the conductors or other energized components, and then, after obtaining approval from the natural resources or forestry agency, cut them all down. This cycle would then run its course again. And again. This creates large open spaces and destroys ecosystems. The new approach is proactive, smarter, and more sustainable. For example, removing fast-growing trees like poplars and birch gives slower-growing trees like beech and oak as well as bushes access to more sunlight and thus the opportunity to flourish. This creates biotopes and new habitats.\n\nYou\u2019re breaking up the poplar monopoly.\nExactly. Having a slower-growing mix of trees not only lengthens the intervals between trimming, which saves us money. It also tangibly increases the biodiversity of both flora and fauna. We can further enhance biodiversity by leaving the cuttings on the ground when we trim, as long as doing so poses no hazard to the power lines or our operations. The cuttings provide nesting opportunities for small mammals, which may attract larger animals. Similarly, new wildflowers attract insects which then attract birds. In short, ECM is good for our business and creates added value for nature: it transforms a mostly monoculture forest into a rich habitat.\n\nWhen did you get involved in ECM?\nIn 1992 when I was still responsible for high-voltage operations and maintenance in Westnetz\u2019s grid territory in southwest Germany. A forester at Corporate Functions in Essen had chosen our grid territory for an ECM pilot project. I was initially sceptical because I felt the segments they\u2019d targeted were too small, too far apart, and too topographically diverse for the forestry contractor to manage them cost-effectively. Over the next five to ten years, however, we expanded the size of the ECM zones, which made the approach economically and technically viable.\n\nWhat are the keys to successful ECM?\nHaving the right plan for the vegetation in a particular area and, just as importantly, having maintenance crews who understand \u2013 and buy into \u2013 ECM techniques. Employees and contractors need to be trained, and a few may need to be convinced. I\u2019ve presented ECM to a number of grid operators...\noutside E.ON. If management and crews embrace it, it\u2019s usually successful. If they\u2019re half-hearted, many run into difficulties. Ultimately, ECM is like any new process adopted by an organisation: belief and commitment are essential to success.\n\nIt sounds like it\u2019s also the difference between a short-term and a long-term perspective.\n\nThat\u2019s right. ECM requires up-front investments: in surveying current vegetation, designing a plan to manage it, and training the maintenance crews. Those investments won\u2019t be recouped immediately. It will take time before ECM\u2019s advantages \u2013 like the longer intervals between trimming I mentioned a moment ago \u2013 to appear in a grid operator\u2019s bottom line. But the savings in maintenance costs are real and should show up within three to four years. So maybe you just need a medium-term perspective.\n\nWhat are your biggest achievements?\n\nMaking an environmentally friendly approach to maintenance attractive from a business and operational standpoint as well. That Westnetz\u2019s grid is robust and reliable even in severe weather is due in part to ECM. A storm may knock down trees, but they\u2019re no longer tall enough to damage our power lines. So ECM not only lowers maintenance costs, it also reduces our expenditures to restore power and clean up after storms. Another achievement is the recognition we\u2019ve received from nature conservation groups and other organisations. The German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU), Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND), Environmental Action Germany (DUH), and a number of universities have shown great interest in our work and want to see it adopted across Germany.\n\nWhat\u2019s ahead for you and ECM?\n\nI\u2019d really like to see ECM extended to all those segments of E.ON\u2019s overhead power lines where it makes environmental and economic sense, initially in Germany and eventually in our service territories in other countries as well. All in all, we\u2019re talking about thousands of hectares. It\u2019s a huge opportunity. Our grids are becoming steadily smarter and thus even better able to accept more renewable energy and to orchestrate the complex energy flows of a decentralised energy world. At the same time, I think we should do our best to sustainably manage the biospheres under and near our power lines. In sum, I want E.ON to enable a sustainable economy while also being an exemplary environmental steward.\n\nDo you embrace sustainability when you\u2019re not in a forest?\n\nI do my best to conserve resources, which probably comes from my farming background. We tried to avoid waste and repair things instead of throw them away. Conservation is in my DNA and affects how I work too. I do as much as I can digitally and look carefully for other options before I take a business trip. The restrictions brought on by the pandemic, however, made me realise that I actually hadn\u2019t looked carefully enough and that there were even more opportunities to complete tasks virtually. I plan to continue making use of these opportunities even after the restrictions are relaxed.\nWhy and when did you start the Parent Network?\nI have two children of my own and a step son. When I had my second child, I was determined to maintain the network I\u2019d established at work, to stay in touch with what was going on, and to remain aware of emerging opportunities because after parental leave I wanted to try a new role. Well, even though I\u2019d discussed all this with my line manager and senior leaders prior to going on leave, putting it into practice turned out to be very difficult. Returning to work was hard as well, and overall I encountered a lack of support and understanding. So in 2019, with the help of E.ON UK\u2019s diversity and inclusion team, I set up a network for colleagues in similar situations. The aim was to provide support for parents, build understanding and empathy across the business, and reinforce the awareness of line managers, particularly those who weren\u2019t themselves parents.\n\nHow has the network changed and grown since its inception?\nIt was initially called the New Parent Network, and that was its focus. Back then, the HR guidelines for parent leave were hard to understand. We provided support to new parents and their supervisors so they both knew what to think about and clarify before a colleague went on leave. In 2020 we changed the name to the Parent Network to make it clear we welcome parents with children of any age. The network has grown to more than 200 colleagues. The feedback over the years has been inspiring. A typical comment is: \u201cWithout the Parent Network, I couldn\u2019t have coped with the first three months after returning from maternity leave.\u201d\n\nWhat issues do the members of the network discuss?\nMaternity, paternity, child care, work-life balance, school applications, adoption. Pretty much every aspect of parenting. Of course, attitudes toward parenting are continually evolving, so there are always new aspects being brought to light. We also talk about issues like mental health, racism, diversity, and LGBT+. The network is extremely inclusive and has parents from all backgrounds, so it serves as a forum for these conversations as well. We don\u2019t necessarily find solutions. That\u2019s not our role. But we can be a sounding board that passes information about emerging social issues to the HR team or senior leaders, who can then think about how the company might want to respond.\n\n2020 was an uncommon year, presumably for the network as well.\nWithout a doubt. My children, for example, were at home with me for ten weeks. Combining home office with home schooling was one of the most stressful times of my life. Colleagues across the network had similar experiences, and some were stretched to the very limit. Keeping the\nconversation going during lockdown provided crucial support for hundreds of parents across E.ON UK. In fact, in 2020 the Parent Network may have been more valuable than ever. So much was unprecedented, from the stressful (preparing to restart solar operations after the initial lockdown with constant distractions from young children for me and key members of my team) to the comic (having a Teams meeting temporarily commandeered by an insistent five-year-old who wants to show off her artwork). Being able to share these experiences was very comforting. In April, during the height of the first lockdown, E.ON CEO Johannes Teyssen called me to tell me I\u2019d received the Diversity Champion Award. He has four children himself, and we talked about what a tough time it was for parents. Even though it was a conversation with the CEO of a huge corporation, it could\u2019ve been between any two parents.\n\nDo you think the Parent Network has even greater potential?\nThe network is a place where parents can post concerns and get a response from the group. But several network members and I decided it would also be useful to create an opportunity for colleagues \u2013 particularly those who may be uncomfortable posting to a large group or face special challenges \u2013 to get one-on-one support. So in 2020 we launched Parent Buddies, a team of eight local champions to whom colleagues can turn. We hope to expand the initiative in 2021. I\u2019ve also wondered whether it would be possible to expand the Parent Network to E.ON units outside the United Kingdom. I think parents across E.ON would benefit from sharing experiences with those from other countries and cultures. How did parents at, say, E.ON Romania and E.ON Hung\u00e1ria deal with the lockdown? I\u2019m sure we could learn from each other.\n\nHas your experience with the Parent Network affected your life outside work?\nDefinitely. For one thing, the different perspectives of other parents have enriched my interactions with my own family. A lot of information about Black Lives Matter was posted on the network in 2020. I shared it with my children and husband, which has brought a broader range of views into our lives. Also, the network\u2019s very positive reception across E.ON UK has given me a confidence boost. In addition, listening to other people\u2019s experiences has reminded me to be kind to myself. As parents we can be hard on ourselves, particularly during the lockdown. The network helps me remember that we\u2019re all facing similar challenges.\nJuan Zamphiropolos was born in Asuncion, Paraguay, in 1986. He has a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from the Czech Technical University in Prague and an MBA degree from the Technical University of Berlin. Since joining E.ON Czech as a project manager in 2013 he has focussed primarily on smart metering, data analytics, and telecommunications. In January 2020 Juan became head of business development at E.ON Czech. He oversees product development, grant management, and public affairs. In his free time Juan enjoys running and biking. He lives in Prague.\n\nYou work with smart meter analytics. What\u2019s that?\nLet\u2019s start with the smart meter itself. Your parents\u2019 analogue electricity meter \u2013 the one with the disk that rotated at a mesmerizingly slow speed \u2013 could only do one thing: tell how much electricity had passed through it since it was installed. A smart meter, by contrast, is digital and measures consumption in real time. It can also send its measurements remotely to our analytics platform, which crunches the data to yield insights that we can provide to our customers: a breakdown of their consumption into active and stand-by, alerts about anomalies in their usage, and graphics showing how their energy consumption is evolving. We\u2019re currently testing these capabilities with selected customers in our grid territory and plan to launch the product in 2021.\n\nDoes this information affect consumption?\nOur customers are mostly businesses and municipalities that have several premises connected to our grid. Our product gives them an overview of their overall electricity consumption and also the consumption of each individual building. Customers can use this information to compare consumption across their premises. This could help them identify machinery, devices, or appliances that are consuming more than they\u2019re supposed to, thereby enabling customers to take steps to reduce consumption. In the case of devices that are operated infrequently, for example, it might make sense to power them down completely between uses.\n\nWhat kind of customers are interested in analytics?\nAmong businesses and municipalities, it so far mostly attracts those that are more environmentally oriented. But we think smart meters will catch on. It\u2019s like e-mobility: a first-mover on the block has to buy an electric car before the neighbours ask themselves whether they might want to go electric too. Municipalities want to be sustainable cities, and that means monitoring their energy consumption and identifying ways to reduce it. We have cooperative arrangements with a number of municipalities in the Czech Republic. One, for example, is using our online tool to monitor energy usage in all of its public buildings and street lighting. The granularity of the data enables the city to take specific actions to reduce consumption, like switching to LED light fixtures or installing heat pumps.\n\nIn what other areas could analytics be valuable?\nAnother application is for energy communities \u2013 an apartment building or several households that receive their energy from the same low-carbon source, like solar panels on one or more of the buildings. The idea is to share energy and use it as...\na community. Analytics show who is consuming when and how much and maps this against how much energy is being produced. This information is essential for linking actors together and creating a functioning community. For example, a customer doesn\u2019t have to own a roof or make a big up-front investment in order to support solar energy. Energy communities are part of the emerging sharing economy, and I think they have huge potential.\n\n**How readily has your organisation embraced sustainability?**\nDifferent industries evolve at different rates. Think about how much telecommunications changed between 1960 and 2010: from copper-wire landlines to billions of smart phones. Electricity grids, by contrast, changed relatively little. But now, thanks to digital technology, they\u2019re evolving dynamically. In rural areas of the Czech Republic, electricity grids may not yet be the internet of energy. But the trend is clearly in that direction. And even the oldest of the old hands at our distribution system operator (DSO), E.ON Distribuce, realise that sustainability is the new normal.\n\n**What\u2019s your next project?**\nOne of the most exciting projects I\u2019m currently involved in aims to connect the grids of two E.ON DSOs, Bayernwerk in southeast Germany and E.ON Distribuce in the southwest part of Czech Republic. Currently, the principal cross-border connections between the two countries are high-voltage transmission lines. Our project aims to connect the two countries\u2019 grids primarily at intermediate voltage. It would also involve upgrading equipment, deploying smart technology, and improving the DSOs\u2019 data-sharing capabilities. Doing this will increase reliability, reduce line losses, make both systems smarter, and enhance their ability to integrate renewables. In March 2021 we\u2019re submitting it as a project of common interest (PCI), a category of project that supports the interconnectivity of Europe\u2019s energy system and thus qualifies for EU funding. We\u2019re already conducting a similar PCI linking E.ON Distribuce in the Czech Republic and ZSD in Slovakia, so we have a lot of experience to draw on.\n\n**Sustainability is integral to your work. What about off the job?**\nI try to take small steps. Many have to do with the prefix \u201cre-\u201d: reuse, repair, recycle, repurpose. We\u2019re brought up in a consumerist, throwaway society. But repairing an item consumes far fewer resources than buying a new one, and reusing an item consumes none at all. So before I throw something out I consider whether it could be repaired or put to another use. If not, I try to find a new owner for it. After all, something that has become useless for me may be very useful for someone else.\nFranz V\u00f6lkl\n\nFranz V\u00f6lkl was born in Weiden, a small town about 85 kilometres northeast of Nuremberg. After completing a master\u2019s degree in energy and process technology at TU Munich, he joined E.ON subsidiary Bayernwerk in 2011 as project engineer, focusing first on biogas plants and later on cogeneration. Franz and his family live in Munich, where on weekends he enjoys beekeeping.\n\nUrban energy autonomy\nSustainability Enabler Franz V\u00f6lkl\n\nThe Werksviertel-Mitte district near Munich\u2019s East Train Station has undergone a radical transformation. Over the past five years, the roughly nine-hectare industrial area has morphed into a vibrant, multi-use urban space that brings together businesses and residences, commerce and culture. Franz V\u00f6lkl, project engineer of E.ON subsidiary Bayernwerk Natur, is in charge of giving Werksviertel-Mitte a largely autonomous supply of sustainable energy.\n\nWhat makes Werksviertel-Mitte energy-autonomous?\nTo start, two technologically advanced gas-fired combined-heat-and-power (CHP) units. They supply electricity and heat to the 15 buildings that make up Werksviertel-Mitte. Their efficiency is impressive. When cogenerating heat, they transform about 90 per cent of the fuel they consume into energy. For comparison, the average thermal power plant in Europe is only about 50 per cent efficient. But you don\u2019t see the CHP units. They\u2019re tucked away in the basement of Building 1, below a hipster caf\u00e9 and a bar. We\u2019re exploring whether to supplement the CHP units with solar panels. That would make Werksviertel-Mitte entirely self-sufficient with low-carbon energy. Enabling individual buildings to meet their own energy needs is something that Bayernwerk Natur and several other E.ON companies do all the time. Doing it for an entire district has been something special.\n\nWhat was Werksviertel-Mitte like before the transformation?\nWell into the 1990s, it was all about potatoes. Pfanni, a German food manufacturer now owned by Unilever, made dumplings and mashed-potato powder here. When Pfanni left, artists built studios in former warehouses; many are still here. Later, nightclubs and discos moved in. In 2015, with much of the industry gone from the district, the city decided to reconceive it and hired us to design a sustainable energy plan for it. Our approach is holistic, which means we try to orchestrate the production and consumption of all energy types \u2013 electricity, heating, and cooling \u2013 so that they\u2019re as efficient as possible. A restaurant\u2019s walk-in refrigerator, for example, produces waste heat. We capture this heat and pipe it to another user in Werksviertel-Mitte. By matching users with complementary thermal energy needs, we reduce the amount of new energy that has to be produced. Low-carbon on-site energy production combined with smart usage: this is what the energy transition looks like up close.\n\nSmart in terms of technology too, right?\nExactly. Werksviertel-Mitte has about 1,000 electricity and 50 heat and cooling delivery points, many of them with meters or sensors connected to a central energy control system. It\u2019s a bit like a formula 1 car sending data in real time to the team\u2019s engineers at the pit wall. Similarly, our system knows what\u2019s happening at most of the radiators and sockets in Werksviertel-Mitte. It also remotely controls some equipment to better harmonise production with consumption. One challenge is that the district is already growing, and the energy supply has to grow with it. For example, a large\ncommercial kitchen moved in that prepares food for day care centres and schools around Munich. It needs so much electricity that we had to give Werksviertel-Mitte a new, larger transformer station. Being part of Bayernwerk and the E.ON Group gives us flexibility to make these kinds of changes swiftly and efficiently.\n\nWhat else has Bayernwerk Natur done?\nWe\u2019ve installed about 200 on-site generating units at companies, housing complexes, and public buildings across Bavaria. We\u2019re responsible for operating and maintaining all of them. Our team of engineers, technicians, sales people, and office staff totals about 100 people. We know the region well and can serve all classes of customers, from real estate developers to big industrial companies. Many of them have the ambition \u2013 or are required by law \u2013 to become more sustainable. So our business is growing well. Our good reputation comes from the success of our projects and the dedication of our people, many of whom go out of their way \u2013 sometimes even at night and on weekends \u2013 to meet customers\u2019 needs. Sustainability requires special people, and we have them.\n\nWhat have you learned from these projects?\nA lot. For example, we\u2019ve become very good at estimating how much energy a new building or new tenant will need. A project like Werksviertel-Mitte involves a lot of metering and data analysis, so we\u2019ve built up a storehouse of knowledge in these areas as well. Thanks to E.ON\u2019s partnership with RWTH Aachen University, we receive scientific support and also work with its research teams to explore topics like energy-smart building technology. Regulatory knowledge and sales experience are important too. It\u2019s the whole package \u2013 successful track record, knowledgeable team, and advanced technology \u2013 that convinces customers to entrust us with making them more sustainable. One day I\u2019d like to put it all together to enable a city district to be completely carbon-neutral.\n\nWhat role does sustainability play in your life away from work?\nFirst and foremost, I\u2019d say that nature plays a big role. I grew up on a farm in a heavily forested part of Bavaria, and interacting with wood has always been important to me. I built myself a small house out of wood. I also chop the wood that heats the house. It\u2019s a great counterpoise for my work in the city. As for sustainability, I find that it\u2019s a popular topic. If I were an insurance salesman, no one would probably be very interested in my work. By contrast, people want to hear about sustainable energy, and almost everyone has an opinion. Ideally, these discussions will help set some of my friends and acquaintances on their own sustainability journey.\nContents\n\nIntroduction\nForeword ................................................................. 15\nSustainability strategy and material topics ............... 17\n\nBusiness areas\nReliable and smart grids ........................................... 24\nLower-carbon households ........................................ 30\nCleaner companies, greener communities ............... 35\nCustomer experience .............................................. 39\nCloseup on: Strategy and innovation ....................... 44\n\nEnvironment\nClimate protection .................................................. 48\nEnvironmental management .................................. 57\n\nSocial\nOccupational health and safety ............................... 66\nDiversity and inclusion .......................................... 74\nWorking conditions and employee development ....... 78\nData protection and product safety ......................... 84\nBusiness resilience management ......................... 88\nCloseup on: Covid-19 .............................................. 90\n\nGovernance\nGood corporate governance .................................. 94\nCompliance and anti-corruption ............................ 98\nHuman rights and supplier management ................. 102\nStakeholder engagement ..................................... 107\nCommunity involvement ..................................... 111\nCloseup on: Tax ..................................................... 113\n\nAppendix\nReport profile ....................................................... 116\nGreen Bond reporting ........................................... 118\nGRI content index ................................................ 123\nSASB index .......................................................... 129\nESG figures .......................................................... 137\nUN Global Compact ............................................. 141\nAssurance Report ................................................ 143\nDear readers,\n\nLast year E.ON celebrated its twentieth birthday. Two decades of systematic focus: from a broadly diversified conglomerate to a global energy company to Europe\u2019s pacesetter in sustainable energy. Along the way, we exited large-scale fossil-fuelled power generation and, more recently, renewables. The latter may have surprised some people. But today E.ON\u2019s strategic course is more sustainable than ever.\n\nThe decarbonisation of industry, transport, and heating is becoming the centrepiece of the energy transition. More sectors need to be powered by green electricity, and more fossil energy needs to be displaced. E.ON\u2019s energy networks and innovative customer solutions are ideally positioned to propel these trends. We\u2019re a major infrastructure company of the new energy world, building the platform for Europe to reach its climate targets and for the energy transition to succeed. The 2020 financial year reaffirmed that we\u2019re on the right course.\n\nCovid-19 pandemic and sustainability \u2013 now more than ever\n\nCorona, which was and remains a profound global crisis, also presented E.ON with enormous challenges in 2020. I\u2019m proud of how our employees responded. Thanks to their dedication and flexibility, E.ON was able to keep critical infrastructure \u2013 more than 1 million kilometres of energy grids in six European countries \u2013 up and running at all times. Our people were always available for our customers. And while carefully complying with social-distancing restrictions, they continued to design and install innovative energy solutions across all our businesses. Throughout the pandemic, our employees enabled the new E.ON\u2019s sustainability journey to stay on course.\n\n2020 tested our company\u2019s resilience. I\u2019m immensely grateful that we\u2019ve withstood this test well. At the same time, the pandemic has validated and even reinvigorated E.ON\u2019s commitment \u2013 and Europe\u2019s commitment \u2013 to the energy transition. The Green Deal is Europe\u2019s pledge to be carbon-neutral by 2050 across all aspects of life. This makes sustainability crucial for society\u2019s future. E.ON \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s largest grid and customer-solutions companies \u2013 helps enable this transformation. We help our partners and customers to achieve their climate targets. And we\u2019re leading by example.\nWe enable sustainability \u2013 sustainably\nE.ON helps provide access to affordable, reliable, and clean energy. Helps communities and entire cities become more sustainable. And helps protect the earth\u2019s climate. Simply put: our core businesses contribute to a more sustainable future. We\u2019ve endorsed the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since their adoption in 2015. And in 2020 we decided to redouble our efforts and set even more ambitious climate targets. E.ON now intends to be carbon-neutral by 2040 and eliminate its Scope 3 emissions by 2050.\n\nOur climate targets are just one example of how environment, social, and governance (ESG) considerations are becoming increasingly central to our Group. They now provide important guidance for E.ON\u2019s strategic course and are integral to our decision-making processes: from risk assessment and capital allocation to workplace culture and management performance. For example, the new E.ON is now Germany\u2019s largest issuer of green bonds, meeting the increased demand for sustainable investment opportunities. Responsible corporate governance \u2013 toward people and the environment \u2013 is what we expect of ourselves and our enterprise partners. Similarly, our employees, our customers, and, increasingly, the capital market expect it from us.\n\nIn line with its own values and the expectations of sustainable finance, E.ON puts a special emphasis on transparency. That\u2019s why in 2019 we became an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which is developing consistent, comparable, and accurate climate-related financial risk disclosures. In 2020 we intensified our efforts to manage the interface between sustainability and risk management and will continue along this path in 2021.\n\nOur core business: sustainable technologies for ambitious climate targets\nOur goal is to bring green technologies to market. To do so, we\u2019ll invest more than \u20ac6.6 billion over the next three years to modernise our energy networks in Germany. Power and gas distribution networks are the backbone of tomorrow\u2019s energy system and help decarbonise all sectors of the economy. We\u2019re therefore actively fostering digitisation and innovation at our networks as well as propelling the development of important future technologies like green gas. For example, we\u2019re conducting a number of pilot projects to test integrating green hydrogen into the gas grid and partnering with industrial companies to develop industrial-scale hydrogen solutions.\n\nE.ON propels the transition to a zero-carbon future by helping make Europe\u2019s cities and regions more sustainable. Our flagship project is to supply an entire district in Malm\u00f6, Sweden \u2013 300,000 residents and hundreds of businesses \u2013 with 100% renewable energy by 2030. The transition to low-carbon industry is well under way as well. For example, we recently commissioned Europe\u2019s largest rooftop solar array at an Audi facility in Gy\u0151r, Hungary.\n\nOur people: pioneers of the energy transition\nBehind all these achievements are our people. The integration of innogy\u2019s employees has enriched our company\u2019s storehouse of knowledge and experience. The diversity of our teams \u2013 in terms of background, qualifications, and culture \u2013 is integral to our success. It will foster creativity, innovation, and agility.\n\nRegrettably, despite our comprehensive and continually enhanced safety measures, five people died while working for us in 2020. Further improving our safety performance will therefore remain a top priority going forward. In 2020 our company successfully navigated the challenges of the pandemic. We created a safe workplace for those employees whose presence was essential. The majority, however, spent much of the year working from home \u2013 without in any way slowing our progress toward an even more sustainable energy supply. In the annual employee survey, employees\u2019 feedback on E.ON\u2019s handling of the pandemic was very positive.\n\nSustainability at E.ON: ambitious and transparent\nThe new E.ON\u2019s sustainability journey will continue in the coming year as well. We want you \u2013 our customers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders \u2013 to assess our progress. This report, a sort of logbook of our journey, enables you to do so. It describes our performance and improvements clearly and openly. We invite you to read where our journey took us in 2020 and let us know what you think of it. The feedback we receive from rating agencies in 2020 was very positive. We\u2019re particularly proud of the A rating E.ON received from CDP, a non-profit organisation dedicated to meaningful climate disclosures. It represents independent testimony to our systematic actions to reduce emissions, limit climate risks, promote a low-carbon economy, and report transparently. Sustainability is an essential part of the new E.ON\u2019s identity and the key to our success.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDr. Johannes Teyssen\nAccelerating the transition to a sustainable energy world\n\nThe energy system is steadily becoming more distributed, digital, and decarbonised. And more sustainable. Our core businesses \u2013 energy networks and customer solutions \u2013 are helping make it happen. Our grids are getting progressively smarter, which enables them to integrate more renewable energy and manage increasingly complicated energy flows in real time while remaining reliable. Years of work continually increasing our networks\u2019 proportion of underground cabling has made them even less exposed to extreme weather and further enhances their reliability. Our innovative solutions help customers of all sizes \u2013 from families and small businesses to big manufacturers and entire cities \u2013 to conserve energy, generate their own green energy, and thus reduce their carbon footprint. In 2020 we developed and adopted a new and even more ambitious sustainability strategy.\n\nSustainability: embedded in our corporate strategy\n\nThe innogy takeover successfully closed in 2019. Effective January 1, 2020, innogy\u2019s operations are no longer managed and disclosed as a separate segment but rather integrated into Energy Networks, Customer Solutions, and Corporate Functions/Other. E.ON\u2019s current strategy was subjected to a verification process early in 2020. It was affirmed to be a suitable strategic framework for the energy-policy, social, and technological challenges that currently prevail. Nevertheless, E.ON intends to use the period through year-end 2021 \u2013 while continuing to integrate innogy \u2013 to sharpen the company\u2019s focus in line with its current and reaffirmed strategy, analyse exogenous factors, and determine their impact on strategic development. One key area for strategic focus is sustainability.\n\nThe energy transition has become a central part of public discourse. Sustainable energy is not only the basis for economic and social development but also a key factor in environmental and climate protection. E.ON\u2019s energy networks provide a high degree of supply security and thus make an important contribution to Europe\u2019s economic growth and social stability. This is an important social responsibility, especially in times of crisis. E.ON\u2019s networks also serve as a central platform for the energy transition. Our customer and infrastructure solutions business makes an important contribution as well. It offers customers of all sizes \u2013 households, companies, and cities \u2013 solutions for the transition to climate neutrality. Consequently, sustainability is a key principle of E.ON\u2019s strategy, which fosters value creation and provides benefits for people and the environment.\n\nTo underscore sustainability\u2019s importance, in 2020 we initiated a process in which we revised E.ON\u2019s material topics and identified three focus dimensions that are the core elements of our new sustainability strategy.\nIdentification of our material topics and sustainability strategy [GRI 102-46](#)\n\nThe process by which we identified our material topics and focus dimensions consisted of three initial steps, which are described below.\n\n1. **Step one: stakeholder expectations and ESG analysis**\n   The starting point of our analysis was the materiality matrix from 2019. Based on it, we reviewed and evaluated the events and developments that affected E.ON in 2020. They included the successful closing of the innogy takeover, Fridays for Future and other social movements, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic, which had a considerable impact. Our analysis considered policy developments, such as the EU Green Deal, the EU Taxonomy Regulation, and the German National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights. We also conducted an in-depth analysis of our environment, social, and governance (ESG) performance based on ESG ratings and looked at competitors\u2019 best practices.\n\n2. **Step two: interviews with outside experts**\n   We conducted 13 interviews with a variety of outside experts. They included academics, NGO representatives, and investors, to name just a few. We talked to them about climate change, health and safety, crisis management, social issues, and other topics related to sustainability. The interviews deepened our understanding and constituted the outside-in perspective of our materiality analysis. They helped us evaluate which topics were material for E.ON in 2020 and which to integrate into our new sustainability strategy.\n\n3. **Step three: Sustainability Council workshop**\n   The E.ON Sustainability Council, on which there were a number of personnel changes in 2020, provided the inside-out perspective in our materiality analysis. Council members responded to a written survey in which they assessed the relevance of each of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for E.ON (see also \u201cOur commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals\u201d below). They then participated in a workshop to discuss the results of the desk research, the expert interviews, and the survey. The workshop validated the research results and defined a set of three focus dimensions on which the sustainability strategy is based. This strategy was approved by the Management Board in August 2020 and by the Supervisory Board in September 2020.\nMaterial topics\nThe findings of our materiality analysis in 2020 are charted on the materiality matrix below. The horizontal axis indicates the topics\u2019 relevance to outside stakeholders (outside-in), the vertical axis our impact on the topics (inside-out). We classify as material those topics that are at least highly relevant for stakeholders and that we have at least a high ability to influence. We thus identified ten topics as material. A circle\u2019s size in the matrix reflects the degree to which the corresponding topic supports the SDGs.\n\nThe chapters of this report describe how we manage our material topics and the progress we\u2019ve made. Some chapters address more than one topic.\n\nFor example, data protection, information security, and product safety are combined in the chapter entitled \u201cData protection and product safety.\u201d The topic \u201csustainable customer solutions\u201d is subdivided by customer segment and described in two chapters: \u201cLower-carbon households\u201d and \u201cCleaner companies, greener communities.\u201d We also determined which GRI standards our material topics correspond to. For example, human rights and supplier management correspond to GRI 412: Human rights assessment. On the first page of each chapter we indicate the relevant GRI standard or standards. The description of our management approach is guided by GRI 103: Management Approach.\nOur new holistic sustainability strategy\n\nIn setting E.ON\u2019s strategic course, the company identified key topics for the sustainability of its business and its role in society: climate protection, health and safety, diversity and inclusion, and good corporate governance. ESG aspects are systematically embedded into E.ON\u2019s central steering and management processes. The integration of sustainability is thus an essential element of E.ON\u2019s 2020 corporate strategy initiative. It serves as the basis for E.ON to make good on its commitment to enable a climate-friendly energy world and to ensure its own future viability. It enhances E.ON\u2019s ability to create sustainable value, mitigate risks, access capital markets (which are increasingly oriented toward sustainable finance), and proactively shape shareholders and stakeholders\u2019 perception of the Group\u2019s position. The following focus dimensions and corresponding guiding statements were developed together with E.ON\u2019s Sustainability Council and approved in August 2020 by the Supervisory Board\u2019s Innovation and Sustainability Committee:\n\nWE enable Europe to become carbon-neutral. Climate protection is a key driver of E.ON\u2019s future growth. E.ON\u2019s core business is to operate energy networks that serve as the platform for the energy transition and to provide sustainable customer solutions that help cities, companies, and residential customers become climate-neutral. In late March 2020 E.ON pledged to achieve climate neutrality by 2040 (and to cut its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by roughly 75 per cent by 2030) and to reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 (and by 100 per cent by 2050). These objectives set a course that is both ambitious and realistic: a reduction path that implies a consistent alignment with the new energy world in line with E.ON\u2019s strategy. An emphasis on sustainable energy is therefore inherent to E.ON\u2019s strategic focus areas.\n\nWE care for our people and foster a diverse, inclusive culture. The diversity of E.ON\u2019s people is the foundation for sustainable innovation, continual improvement, business success, and growth. We want to increase E.ON\u2019s diversity from many perspectives, including experience, education, nationality, and the proportion of women in management positions. We\u2019ve also set ambitious targets for improving the health and safety of our colleagues and contractors and for preventing accidents. E.ON\u2019s new HSE Strategy and new People Strategy, both of which were adopted at the end of 2020, focus on these issues and provide answers to what priorities we intend to set and how we\u2019ll achieve our targets.\n\nWE take sustainability as the guiding principle in business. Sustainability is the basis for our actions. The integration of sustainability aspects into the company\u2019s core processes was therefore a key initiative in 2020. It ensures that E.ON\u2019s strategic and operational decisions, actions as a company, and external communications reflect our commitment to be Europe\u2019s leading sustainable energy company. But ESG aspects were already integral to many processes. E.ON has always viewed strategic decisions, capital allocation, and M&A projects in the context of sustainability. Due to sustainability\u2019s increasing relevance, ESG risks (such as climate and human rights risks) are factored into E.ON\u2019s enterprise risk management (ERM) system.\nOur commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals\nThe United Nations\u2019 SDGs of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provide a blueprint for a better and more sustainable future. Adopted in 2015, the 17 SDGs and 169 subgoals address a wide range of global challenges. We recognise the SDGs\u2019 importance and fully support them. Our Management Board underscored this support by issuing a self-commitment to the SDGs in June 2018. E.ON\u2019s core businesses enable it to have the biggest impact on the SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 13 (Climate Action).\n\nDecentralised implementation\nEach business unit\u2019s management team is responsible for taking action to enhance sustainability and meet the sustainability targets it set for its unit. This decentralised approach enables the units to contribute to our group-wide targets for issues like climate protection and corporate governance, while also tailoring their actions to their own specific needs. Each unit has sustainability staff who reinforce awareness, coordinate projects and initiatives, and monitor progress toward targets. They share information at regular intervals with our Sustainability Council and the Sustainability team at Corporate Functions.\n\nSustainability incentives for executives\nImplementing our sustainability strategy effectively and consistently requires the active support of our organisation\u2019s entire leadership. To encourage and reward this support, a portion of our corporate officers\u2019 and senior executives\u2019 variable compensation is determined by their unit\u2019s achievement of its sustainability targets. The targets, which vary somewhat by unit, are expressed in quantitative metrics. For example, we measure customer loyalty by asking customers to rate their willingness to recommend E.ON and our services. Members of our Management Board have individual annual targets for the E.ON Group\u2019s sustainability performance in areas such as occupational safety, customer loyalty, and workplace diversity.\nEnable Europe\u2019s carbon neutrality\n\nBusiness areas\n2020 Highlights\n\nIn February 2020 E.ON and Volkswagen Group Components unveiled a new, battery-equipped, ultra-fast charging station that can extend an electric vehicle\u2019s range by about 200 kilometres in just 15 minutes.\n\nWe established a Global Customer Leadership team. Its purpose is to strengthen the customer\u2019s voice and propel customer centricity in all of our markets.\n\n\u20ac60 million is the budget of Smart Quart, a project that explores how individual neighbourhoods can achieve a climate-neutral energy supply by using smart network technology to balance the production and consumption of renewable energy. The project, which also incorporates innovative hydrogen technology, got under way in January 2020.\n\n22,110 metric tonnes of carbon emissions will be avoided each year through the use of two organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power plants in Kirchweidach, Germany. The plants will be powered by zero-carbon geothermal energy.\n\nBusiness areas\n\nEnergy networks like ours are where the energy transition is happening. In addition, our individually tailored solutions enable our customers to live with greater comfort while doing their part to make the energy world smarter and more sustainable.\nSmarter grids, greener communities\n\nDistribution grids used to do one thing: take electricity from big power stations and deliver it to homes and businesses. Today they do much more: They manage complex energy flows from an already large and rapidly growing number of devices both big and small, including wind farms and rooftop solar panels, utility-scale battery storage systems, and home heat pumps. In short, distribution grids are where the energy transformation is happening. But this is just the beginning. In the years ahead, energy networks will become the internet of energy, connecting prosumers and continually creating new possibilities for a more sustainable world. At E.ON, we\u2019re deploying new technologies today to enable our energy networks to perform this role efficiently, reliably, and cost-effectively \u2014 and the cities and communities they serve to be more sustainable. [\u2192 GRI 103-1]\nOur approach\n\nAn important objective of our corporate strategy is to upgrade our grids to meet the challenges of the new energy world so that in future we can continue to ensure a reliable electricity supply for our customers at a reasonable cost. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making our grids smarter by equipping them with sensors and command-and-control technology and by augmenting them with a digital layer. This will enable us to choreograph energy flows even more deftly and to monitor our grids in real time and with much greater granularity than today. As is described in greater detail below under \u201cSpecific actions,\u201d smart-grid technology makes it possible for us to avoid or delay some grid expansion.\n\nGoing forward, smart grids will serve as the platform for the innovative technologies and business models that are essential to the success of the energy transition: active demand management, virtual power plants, energy storage devices, peer-to-peer energy sales and sharing, to name just a few. Our innovation efforts include developing new approaches for flexible local power systems. For example, we\u2019re testing such approaches in three demonstration projects in Sweden and Germany as part of InterFlex, a European research project that began in 2017.\n\nOne thing the energy transition can\u2019t succeed without is the decarbonisation of the transport sector. This will require a mass conversion to electric vehicles (EVs). One benefit of the smart-grid technology we\u2019ve deployed to facilitate the integration of renewables is that our grids will be able to handle the connection of numerous EV charging points without expensive grid expansion.\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nOur distribution system operators (DSOs) are responsible for safe and reliable grid operations and for the resolution of outages in their network territory. Their network control centres oversee operations. Our DSOs take certain measures, like investing in grid automation, to keep outages as infrequent and brief as possible. In doing so, they adhere to their respective internal operating guidelines as well as to laws and regulatory requirements.\n\nA member of the E.ON Management Board oversees our Energy Networks segment. Under his leadership, three departments at Corporate Functions actively manage Energy Networks\u2019 DSOs. This includes strategic development, capital allocation, controlling, and so forth.\n\nIn case of widespread outages, our business resilience management system stipulates responsibilities and processes in accordance with the instructions contained in our Incident and Crisis Management Policy.\n\nSpecific actions\n\nEach year our DSOs design investment and maintenance plans for their networks. The investment budget for these plans is reviewed and approved by the E.ON Management Board. The plans\u2019 purpose is to ensure that all of our network customers are connected and have a reliable energy supply. Our DSOs are responsible for implementing these plans. Our investments always emphasise efficiency and reliability as well as smart technologies. We choose solutions that make technical as well as business sense.\n\nA smart-grid technology called dynamic line rating (DLR) enables us to use more of the capacity of our existing lines. As the electricity flowing through an overhead power line increases, the line gets hotter, expands, and sags, which could pose a hazard. Line heat is reduced \u2013 and thus line capacity is increased \u2013 by cool air and wind. To ensure safety and reliability, lines are assigned a maximum capacity based on conservative estimates of ambient air temperature and wind speed. DLR replaces these estimates with accurate, real-time data from weather stations and temperature sensors placed at intervals along the lines. Our network control centres use the data to calculate, minute by minute, the maximum amount of power the lines can carry without overheating. We use DLR in segments of our grids in Germany and Sweden with lots of wind power. It enables us to accept more renewable energy without costly grid expansion (at the cost, however, of somewhat higher line losses). Hansewerk, one of our DSOs in Germany, has used DLR since 2014, thereby increasing its line capacity by up to 50 per cent.\n\nVoltage-regulated distribution transformers (VRDTs) are another smart-grid technology that reduces the need for new lines. They automatically recognise voltage fluctuations and balance them out by altering the transmission ratio between low and intermediate voltage while under load. This enhanced flexibility means that more renewable power can be fed into the grid. We began using VRDTs in our grids in Germany in 2013. We also install them in smaller quantities in our grids in other European countries.\nWe\u2019ve operated the E.ON Virtual Power Plant (VPP) in Germany since 2013. It aggregates numerous distributed generation units, consumption points, and storage devices. We use it to market reserve and balancing power, which helps to stabilise the grid and enables the customers who make their capacity available to our VPP to earn extra money on their assets.\n\nIn addition to these, there are several other smart-grid technologies that we\u2019re currently testing, rolling out, or already using at our DSOs.\n\nGoals and performance review\nOur DSOs record all planned and unplanned outages in their networks. They use these data to calculate the system average interruption duration index (SAIDI), which measures the average outage duration per customer per year, and the system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI), which measures the average number of outages per customer per year.\n\nWe disclose the SAIDI and SAIFI of our fully consolidated DSOs by country. The figure for Germany, for example, is the average of our DSOs there. Our SAIDI and SAIFI in Germany are calculated according to the method prescribed by the German Federal Network Agency (known by its German acronym, BNetzA). This calculation is based on outages that are also verified by the BNetzA. These figures can therefore be deemed official. All the countries in which we operate grids now have quality regulations. The respective regulatory agency reviews and validates grid operators\u2019 outage reports. Our SAIDI and SAIFI figures for a particular country therefore reflect the methodology stipulated by its regulatory agency.\n\nBy the end of the data-collection period, no regulatory agency had completed the process of validating 2020 outages. Because this report is supposed to contain final, service-quality figures that have been officially audited (by the BNetzA in Germany and the relevant regulatory agencies elsewhere), it publishes figures for the previous year on the next page.\n\nA group of experts at our DSOs in Germany and six other countries shares information about service quality on a regular basis. They analyse the key factors in maintaining uninterrupted network service and share ideas and best practices, thereby fostering continual improvement at our network operations across Europe.\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t use SAIDI and SAIFI for management control purposes, these figures provide us with important information on the reliability of our networks. At regular intervals, the DSOs inform the E.ON Management Board member responsible for network operations about their security of supply. All E.ON DSOs include their SAIDI in their quarterly performance report to the E.ON Management Board.\n### SAIDI power\n\n| Country          | 2020 Scheduled | 2020 Unscheduled | 2020 Total | 2019 Scheduled | 2019 Unscheduled | 2019 Total | 2018 Scheduled | 2018 Unscheduled | 2018 Total |\n|------------------|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|------------------|------------|\n| Germany          | 7              | 16               | 22         | 8              | 17               | 25         | 9              | 15               | 24         |\n| Sweden           | 25             | 121              | 146        | 22             | 100              | 122        | 28             | 70               | 98         |\n| Hungary          | 117            | 61               | 178        | 128            | 59               | 187        | 126            | 65               | 191        |\n| Czech Republic   | 145            | 47               | 192        | 154            | 50               | 205        | 157            | 78               | 235        |\n| Romania          | 288            | 358              | 646        | 339            | 465              | 804        | 262            | 522              | 783        |\n| Slovakia         | 143            | 65               | 208        | 176            | 79               | 255        | 178            | 87               | 266        |\n| Poland           | 9              | 44               | 53         | 11             | 56               | 68         | 9              | 70               | 79         |\n\n1 Figures are for the respective previous year: 2020 for 2019, 2019 for 2018, and so forth.

As in previous years, our grids in Germany were our most reliable.\n\n### SAIFI power\n\n| Country          | 2020 Scheduled | 2020 Unscheduled | 2020 Total | 2019 Scheduled | 2019 Unscheduled | 2019 Total | 2018 Scheduled | 2018 Unscheduled | 2018 Total |\n|------------------|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|------------------|------------|\n| Germany          | 0.1            | 0.3              | 0.4        | 0.1            | 0.3              | 0.4        | 0.1            | 0.3              | 0.4        |\n| Sweden           | 0.2            | 1.2              | 1.4        | 0.1            | 1.1              | 1.2        | 0.2            | 0.9              | 1.1        |\n| Hungary          | 0.4            | 0.8              | 1.3        | 0.4            | 0.9              | 1.3        | 0.4            | 0.9              | 1.3        |\n| Czech Republic   | 0.6            | 0.8              | 1.4        | 0.6            | 0.9              | 1.4        | 0.6            | 0.8              | 1.4        |\n| Romania          | 0.9            | 3.6              | 4.6        | 1.1            | 5.1              | 6.1        | 0.8            | 6.1              | 6.9        |\n| Slovakia         | 0.5            | 1.2              | 1.7        | 0.6            | 1.4              | 2.0        | 1.2            | 0.9              | 2.1        |\n| Poland           | 0.2            | 0.8              | 1.0        | 0.04           | 0.9              | 1.0        | 0.11           | 1.0              | 1.1        |\n\n1 Figures are for the respective previous year: 2020 for 2019, 2019 for 2018, and so forth. Prior-year figures were adjusted to reflect a new calculation methodology. Totals may deviate due to rounding.\n\n2 DSO in which we have a 49 per cent stake.\nProgress and measures in 2020\n\nRenewables\u2019 share of the energy mix continues to increase in all the countries where we operate grids. In 2020 we continued to test and deploy technology that will enable our grids to accept more green energy while continuing to operate reliably.\n\nEUniversal\nEUniversal is an EU-funded project in Germany, Poland, and Portugal that\u2019s exploring technologies to ensure a reliable energy supply even if a much greater proportion of electricity comes from intermittent renewables. The idea is to enhance the flexibility of distribution grids by introducing a Universal Market Enabling Interface (UMEI). The project in Germany was started by innogy and is now being conducted by E.ON, which is testing an aggregator that combines a variety of flexibility sources on an online platform. Grid operators can use the platform to access flexibility options to prevent grid congestion. The project started in February 2020 and will end in July 2023.\n\nSmartQuart\nSmartQuart, a five-year project that ends in 2024, is exploring how individual neighbourhoods can achieve a climate-neutral energy supply. The idea is to use smart network technology to balance the production and consumption of renewable energy within a neighbourhood and, if a surplus is available, to share it with nearby neighbourhoods. The ultimate aim: to render the use of fossil fuels superfluous. The project, which also incorporates innovative hydrogen technology, is being conducted in three representative municipalities: a sparsely populated rural town (Kaisersesch in Rhineland-Palatinate) and two densely populated urban areas (Essen and Bedburg in North Rhine-Westphalia). SmartQuart, whose consortium of project partners is led by E.ON, is part of \u201cReallabore der Energiewende,\u201d a programme conducted by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy to test innovative technologies and solutions for the energy transition on a large scale and under real-life conditions.\n\nGreen hydrogen: smart production\nIn mid-2020 E.ON and industrial conglomerate thyssenkrupp entered into a partnership to produce climate-friendly hydrogen \u2013 which in the decades ahead will gradually replace fossil fuels in many processes \u2013 using surplus renewable electricity. Thyssenkrupp manufactures electrolysers that transform water into hydrogen. Under the partnership, the electrolysers will be remotely controlled by the E.ON Virtual Power Plant (see \u201cSpecific actions\u201d above). The electrolysers will operate when there\u2019s surplus renewable electricity in the grid that would otherwise have to be exported to another grid segment to prevent overload; they\u2019ll remain idle on days when renewable electricity is sparse. The partnership will increase the production of green hydrogen, help to keep the grid stable, and create an additional source of income for electrolysis operators, who receive compensation for the flexible production arrangement.\n\nGreen hydrogen: smart transport\nAvacon, an E.ON DSO in north-central Germany, conducted a pilot project in 2020 to test raising the hydrogen admixture in its gas distribution network to 20 per cent. The project\u2019s purpose is to show that it\u2019s possible to inject a significantly higher percentage of hydrogen into the gas network than is allowed under current regulations. The findings will serve as the blueprint for the future use of hydrogen in gas distribution networks and are to be incorporated into Germany\u2019s regulatory framework.\n\nEUsysflex\nEUsysflex is another project aimed at ensuring a reliable energy supply amid the ongoing increase in intermittent renewables. It has subprojects in seven countries. The project in Germany, which was started by innogy and is now being overseen by E.ON, involves testing distributed flexibility resources. It runs through October 2021.\nIELECTRIX\nIndian and European local energy communities for renewable integration and the energy transition \u2013 IELECTRIX for short \u2013 is a \u20ac10 million EU-funded project to develop mobile storage solutions for renewable energy to promote decentralised energy communities. The project, which began in May 2019 and runs through October 2022, involves 15 participants from eight EU countries as well as TATA Power DDL, a DSO in India. In 2020 E.DIS, a project participant and E.ON DSO in northeast Germany, put its mobile solution into operation in Friedland, a small town located about 140 kilometres north of Berlin. Like in many rural areas in northern Germany, the wind and solar farms around Friedland produce far more electricity than its residents consume. Ideally, this green energy is transported to large consumption centres like Berlin. But on blustery days when output is high, power lines become congested. To prevent overloads and outages, wind farms have to curtail their output and sometimes shut down entirely. This is where E.DIS\u2019s mobile storage solution comes in: a utility-scale lithium-ion battery that can store up to 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and has a power output of up to 500 kilowatts. Stored electricity is fed back into the grid when the wind dies down. The system can be moved to areas where line congestion is particularly frequent. Solutions like this help to harness as much renewable energy as possible until grid capacity is expanded.\n\nPartnership with SAP\nIn 2020 E.ON began deploying SAP S/4HANA, a cloud solution that will enable its energy suppliers, DSOs, and metering points to share billing and other information faster, more accurately, and more easily. This will significantly enhance E.ON\u2019s ability to respond to customer requests swiftly and efficiently. It will also reduce costs by more than 40 per cent. The system is scheduled to go live in mid-2022.\n\nThe table below shows our system lengths at the end of 2020.\n\nSystem length at year-end\n\n| Thousand kilometres | Power 2020 | Power 2019 | Gas 2020 | Gas 2019 |\n|---------------------|------------|------------|----------|----------|\n| Germany1             | 705        | 351        | 101      | 52       |\n| Sweden               | 139        | 138        | n/a      | n/a      |\n| Hungary              | 133        | 85         | 18       | 18       |\n| Czech Republic       | 66         | 66         | 5        | 5        |\n| Romania              | 82         | 82         | 23       | 23       |\n| Slovakia2            | 50         | 39         | n/a      | n/a      |\n| Total                | 1,176      | 760        | 147      | 97       |\n\n1Includes innogy from 2020 onward.\n2Figures for Germany are for the respective previous year: 2020 for 2019, 2019 for 2018, and so forth.\n3DSO in which we have 49 per cent stake.\nSustainability begins at home\n\nIn 2020 the restrictions imposed in response to the coronavirus dramatically increased the amount of time people spent at home. But even when the pandemic is past, it\u2019s likely that the home will remain a bigger focal point of people\u2019s lives. This makes E.ON\u2019s commitment to enhancing homes\u2019 sustainability and comfort even more relevant. We empower residential customers to produce their own green energy and store it. Our individually tailored solutions enable them to use energy more efficiently, in many cases save money, and emit less carbon. Digitalisation is accelerating this process. It creates new opportunities \u2013 like digital energy management and smart-home technology \u2013 to make energy consumption transparent and to use machine learning to optimise it. The mass deployment of these technologies will require smart grids and smart meters. In addition, our customers increasingly want solutions that render transport less dependent on fossil fuels and thus less carbon-intensive. [\u2192 GRI 103-1]\nOur approach\n\nWe want to be the partner of choice for sustainable energy and mobility solutions. We intend to achieve this by offering individually tailored products and services that incorporate the latest technology while at the same time trying to standardise successful solutions across the countries where we operate so that we can deliver them at a lower cost.\n\nWe have solutions for residential customers (B2C) that enable them to produce their own green energy and become more energy-autonomous. These include heat pumps, solar panels, battery storage systems, and virtual storage accounts. We also offer easy-to-use online energy audits and apps that help residential customers better understand their energy consumption and identify ways to reduce it. In the majority of our markets we offer smart-home devices and home energy-management systems that enhance homeowners\u2019 comfort while reducing their climate impact.\n\nSmart meters are a key enabler for digital energy-management solutions. An EU Directive from 2009 stipulates that, to the degree technically and financially feasible, all customers should have a smart meter. Member states must transpose this directive into national law. Germany\u2019s Act on the Digitalisation of the Energy Transition of 2016, for example, specifies that all customers who consume at least 6,000 kWh of electricity annually or have grid-connected generating capacity of at least 7 kW or use interruptible electric devices must be equipped with a smart meter within eight years of the date the German Federal Office for Information Security issues a market declaration after certifying essential components (see \u201cGoals and performance review\u201d below).\n\nBy offering E-Mobility solutions to all kinds of customers, E.ON Drive is making transportation more sustainable. Our main offerings consist of electric-vehicle (EV) charging solutions for homes and businesses as well as public charging infrastructure for cities and municipalities. Our deep experience as an energy-solutions provider ensures that our customers can manage the EV charging process efficiently and that charging infrastructure is optimally integrated into their existing energy system. In addition, we\u2019re building a network of ultra-fast charging (UFC) stations along motorways in seven European countries in order to make longer EV journeys viable. Whenever possible, electricity at our charging stations comes from renewable sources. E.ON Drive has three business lines: International Technology Provision, E-Mobility Solutions, and Charging Network Operations.\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nOur Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Commercial, who is a member of the E.ON Management Board, has overall responsibility for the customer-oriented businesses that comprise our Customer Solutions segment. Our regional units have B2C sales teams that develop and market energy and E-Mobility solutions for their specific customer groups. These teams tailor their offerings to their customers\u2019 individual needs and the particularities of their market. We offer B2C solutions in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, and Romania.\n\nOur distribution system operators (DSOs) across Europe, which are part of our Energy Networks segment, are responsible for installing smart meters in their service territories; the exception is the United Kingdom, where our retail organisation provides them to its customers. German law created two roles for the provision of smart meters. The first role, the basic metering provider, is responsible for the mass rollout of the standard smart meter mandated by German law. At E.ON, this role is performed by our DSOs. The second role, the competitive metering service provider, offers the standard smart meter as well as other metering solutions. At E.ON, this role is performed by our regional energy utilities. In addition, E.ON subsidiaries act as smart meter service providers for municipal utilities and regional energy suppliers in Germany.\n\nE.ON Solutions designs E-Mobility solutions, forges partnerships with industry players, and enlarges our E.ON Drive network of UFC stations. Under the E.ON brand, we have E-Mobility teams in ten countries: the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Italy, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania. Together with innogy, we offer E-Mobility solutions in 25 countries. Cross-regional and cross-functional teams at Corporate Functions coordinate our sales and solutions activities across Europe and provide technical, commercial, and strategic support.\n\nE.ON\u2019s innovation team works closely with the business units to explore emerging opportunity spaces and adjacent markets to grow our energy-solutions business. Our areas of interest include advanced E-Mobility solutions, energy-smart buildings, local renewable-energy systems, and next-generation solutions for residential and commercial customers.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2]\nSpecific actions\nE.ON Plus enables residential customers in Germany to bundle two or more energy contracts for power or gas and allows them to benefit from 100 per cent green energy at no extra charge. By meeting additional conditions they can receive an annual discount of \u20ac60 per contract. E.ON contracts throughout Germany are eligible. Moreover, customers can bundle their own contracts or participate in E.ON Plus with family members, friends, or neighbours. E.ON Plus electricity is certified green by T\u00dcV S\u00fcd.\n\nWe offer a number of apps that enable residential customers to visualise their energy consumption, which is the first step toward identifying ways to reduce it. These include the E.ON SEE app in the United Kingdom, the E.ON app in Sweden, and the Regelneef app from Energiedirect, our retail subsidiary in the Netherlands. In 2019 we launched the E.ON Home app, which enables users to control all their energy devices. We added new features in 2020 (for details, see \u201cProgress and measures in 2020\u201d below).\n\nE.ON Drive is involved in a variety of E-Mobility infrastructure projects like CEF, FAST-E, and EAST-E; the latter is a private-sector initiative to expand Central Europe\u2019s EV charging infrastructure. In addition, our roaming agreements give EV drivers in Germany access to more than 20,000 charging points nationwide. We also partner with other companies to provide EV-sharing solutions to business customers and cities. Our solutions make it easy for them to switch to E-Mobility and enable residents, customers, employees, and guests to embrace low-carbon mobility. Looking further ahead, we\u2019re exploring ways to aggregate connected EV batteries into a virtual energy storage system that can be remotely controlled to help stabilise the grid.\n\nGoals and performance review\nOur goal is to provide customers with pioneering energy solutions for the energy world of today and tomorrow. We want to help them save money, use less energy, recycle energy where possible, and thus emit less carbon dioxide. For the latter, we\u2019ve set a target: by 2030 we intend to reduce our customers\u2019 carbon emissions by 50 per cent relative to 2016.\n\nWe aim to provide all customers with a smart meter in our markets covered by the EU directive. However, our DSOs in Germany were unable to begin installing smart meters in 2017 as planned because the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) had to certify the gateways (the communication units in a smart metering system) before installation could begin. The first certification took place at the end of 2018, and the mandatory smart meter rollout began in late February 2020. Competitive smart meter service providers were able to begin installing smart meters at the end of 2018 for B2B customers and voluntary B2C customers.\n\nWe continue to install UFC stations to help establish a Europe-wide network. We opened the first such station, located in Geiselwind, Germany, in 2018 and have since then opened over 60 more in Denmark, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Britain, and Germany. In 2019 we installed a UFC station at Corporate Functions in Essen.\n\nIn addition, since 2018 E.ON has been a member of the Climate Group\u2019s global EV100 initiative, which aims to make EVs the new normal by 2030. In an effort to lead the way, we\u2019re gradually electrifying our own vehicle fleet and car parks \u2013 for employees, guests, and customers. For more information about EV100, visit the Environmental management chapter.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2/3]\nProgress and measures in 2020\n\nIn 2020 we launched new projects and moved forward with existing ones. For example, we added new features to E.ON Home, an energy-management app that we introduced in 2019 and is now available in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, and Poland. Easy-to-comprehend graphics now provide customers with transparency about their home\u2019s solar power production, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. Customers can also visualise their virtual forest: their annual personal carbon savings are displayed graphically as the number of trees that would absorb the same amount of carbon in a year. The app also monitors the performance of solar panels and makes individually tailored suggestions for additional smart solutions that would enhance energy efficiency and comfort. In 2020 E.ON Home won a prestigious Red Dot Award in the category \u201cProduct Design\u201d for its intuitive, easy-to-use interface.\n\nGreen energy sales\n\n|                      | 2020\u00b9 | 2019\u00b2 |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|\n| Certified green electricity sold to end-customers | 29,681 | 8,770 |\n| Biogas sold to end-customers | 6,090 | 13 |\n\n\u00b9Includes innogy from 2020 onward.\n\u00b2Prior-year figures have been adjusted.\n\nIn 2020 we again significantly increased green energy (green electricity and biogas) sales to our residential customers making us one of the largest green energy retailers in Europe and possibly the largest.\n\n9,280,007\nThe number of our customers receiving certified green electricity products in 2020. In the United Kingdom we provide 100 per cent green electricity to all of our residential customers.\n\nThe EON Future Energy Home Business installed more than 90,000 solar and heating devices in 2020. At year-end it had service contracts with a total of more than 1.1 million customers in Western and Central Europe. The E.ON Future Energy Home and E-Mobility installations in 2020 led to customer annual CO\u2082 savings of more than 340,000 metric tonnes. This is equivalent to a forest of around 26 million trees.\n\nNew ultra-fast charging solution\n\nAn ultra-fast charging (UFC) station, which can extend an EV\u2019s range by about 200 kilometres in just 15 minutes, makes on-the-go charging quick and convenient. In February 2020 E.ON and Volkswagen Group Components unveiled a new, battery-equipped UFC station that can be swiftly installed almost anywhere, at significantly lower cost, and without a mains connection. All the system needs is a standard 220-volt outlet. Its many applications include filling stations, motorway rest areas, and public parking facilities. In the second half of the year E.ON tested the system, which was developed by Volkswagen Group Components, at six motorway filling stations in Germany. It will be marketed under the name E.ON Drive Boost in 2021, initially in Germany.\n\nSmart meters\n\nAfter a delay in the certification of smart meter gateways, the installation of smart meters in Germany started in late February 2020. The installation of second-generation smart meters in Sweden started in 2020 as well and is planned to be completed by the end of 2024.\n\nInstalled smart meters by country\n\n| Thousand units | 2020\u00b9 | 2019\u00b2 | 2018\u00b3 |\n|----------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Rollout countries | | | |\n| United Kingdom | 4,208 | 2,320 | 1,862 |\n| Germany\u2074 | 2,540 | 619 | 147 |\n| Sweden | 1,044 | 1,040 | 1,036 |\n| Pilot countries | | | |\n| Romania | 288 | 284 | 279 |\n| Slovakia\u2075 | 231 | 72 | 39 |\n| Hungary | 142 | 49 | 35 |\n| Czech Republic | 1.5 | 0\u2076 | 0.1 |\n| Total | 8,454 | 4,384 | 2,398 |\n\n\u00b9Includes innogy from 2020 onward.\n\u00b2Includes digital meters.\n\u00b3DSO in which we have a 49 per cent stake.\n\u2074Number declined because a government-sponsored pilot project was completed.\nEV charging for BMW and its employees\nIn late 2019 BMW hired us to install and subsequently operate 4,100 charging points \u2013 half of them public \u2013 at BMW locations in Germany. It will be the country\u2019s largest EV charging network and powered exclusively by green electricity. The first charging points entered service in December 2020. The arrangement has a B2C aspect as well: drivers of BMW company EVs can opt for a high-quality, at-home charging station from E.ON. By supplementing it with an E.ON green electricity tariff they can achieve truly zero-carbon mobility.\n\nOMNe: choosing the right EV charging solution\nMunicipalities, retailers, and companies are responding to EV growth by adding charging points. OMNe, a new proprietary software tool we unveiled in Germany in September 2020, can help. It factors in all the variables at a B2B customer\u2019s facility: the number and type of EVs (cars, vans), when they\u2019re charged (during the day, overnight), the facility\u2019s electricity consumption, and its grid connection. OMNe designs an individually tailored solution consisting of the optimal number of charging stations and the maximum number of charging processes for the facility\u2019s grid connection. We plan to begin marketing OMNe in the United Kingdom and other countries in 2021.\nSolutions that make companies and communities more sustainable\n\nBusinesses, cities, and municipalities across Europe are taking action to become smarter and more sustainable. Innovative approaches can enable them to dramatically reduce their energy consumption, carbon emissions, pollution, and costs. E.ON provides companies and communities with individually tailored solutions that enable them to achieve their climate targets. These solutions draw on our deep expertise in energy efficiency, energy recycling, smart and sustainable heating and cooling, and low-carbon energy. [\u2192 GRI 103-1]\nOur approach\n\nE.ON Energy Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) consists of two units: City Energy Solutions (CES) and Business-to-Business (B2B). CES and B2B develop, own, and operate high-quality assets located at or near customers\u2019 premises. They design and deliver engineering infrastructure solutions that help three groups of customers \u2013 industrial and commercial (I&C) enterprises, cities and municipalities, and the real estate sector \u2013 to reach their sustainability targets, which are becoming a major priority. EIS delivers four types of solutions: large-scale onsite generation of electricity, heat, and steam; district heating and cooling; decentral solutions for city neighbourhoods and I&C customers; and energy-efficiency products and services. The solutions draw on a wide range of advanced technologies, such as high-efficiency cogeneration units, recycled energy plants, waste-heat recovery, heat pumps, low-temperature heating and cooling networks, and energy storage solutions. Many of these technologies are supplemented by software-based solutions and advanced analytics and can help tangibly reduce energy use, energy costs, and carbon emissions.\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nOur Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Commercial, who is a member of the E.ON Management Board, has overall responsibility for the customer-oriented businesses that comprise our Customer Solutions segment and thus EIS.\n\nEIS operates through a number of E.ON entities. For example, the regional units in CES are responsible for target setting and monitoring, product development, asset operations, and sustainability management in their respective market (mainly Germany, Sweden, Poland, and the United Kingdom). A central team supports the regional units in developing their strategic sustainability road maps to transform products and assets.\n\nB2B conducts its operations through a variety of E.ON entities as well. Each entity is its own profit centre and is responsible for its business operations (including product development, asset operations, and sustainability management). It also sets its own targets and monitors progress toward them. These entities offer integrated, individually tailored energy-management and decentral-generation solutions, mainly in Western, Central, Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom, and the Nordic countries. All solutions are tailored to national regulations and customer demands. Group B2B consolidates their results, monitors their sustainability performance, and provides strategic guidance.\n\nE.ON Innovation works closely with the business units to explore emerging opportunity spaces and adjacent markets to grow our energy solutions business. Our areas of interest include energy-smart buildings, local renewable-energy systems, advanced E-Mobility solutions, and next-generation solutions for residential and commercial customers.\n\nSpecific actions\n\nEIS adopts a partnership-based business approach in both CES and B2B. When designing embedded-generation and energy-efficiency solutions for B2B customers, E.ON forges long-term partnerships to support these customers on their sustainability journey by offering individually tailored solutions that reduce their energy and operating costs as well as carbon emissions over several years. In 2020 E.ON increased its stake in Orcan Energy, a Munich-based manufacturer of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power plants. ORC plants enable B2B customers to use surplus waste heat from their production processes to generate clean electricity.\n\nCES is founded on long-term relationships with customers ranging from real estate developers to city administrations. These customers increasingly link their sustainability targets to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 13 (Climate Action). In 2020, CES formed partnerships with municipal real estate customers across Europe to support them in achieving their sustainability targets. CES works with them to implement sustainable projects and thereby help safeguard their asset\u2019s long-term value. For example, in 2020 CES deepened its partnership with Lendlease, an international real estate developer with landmark projects in the United Kingdom and Italy (see \u201cProgress and measures in 2020\u201d).\n\nWe also take part in research projects at universities and research institutions. The purpose is to develop the technologies, systems, and approaches that will enable us to meet the needs of tomorrow\u2019s energy world. Our flagship partnership is with the E.ON Energy Research Center at RWTH Aachen University. Its research has an interdisciplinary approach and focuses mainly on distributed generation, smart grids, and efficient building technologies.\nGoals and performance review\nThe impact of our B2B projects on our customers\u2019 sustainability can be measured by a variety of key performance indicators (KPIs). Customers decide which KPIs are relevant for them. They may be influenced by country-specific standards and reporting obligations. The KPIs range from carbon-emission savings to reductions in energy costs and consumption including reductions in final energy consumption (such as electricity) as well as primary energy usage (for example, fuel consumption to generate electricity or heat).\n\nCES solutions aim to have a positive impact on our customers\u2019 sustainability KPIs, which differ by project based on customer demands. KPIs include primary energy consumption (such as the use of gas to generate heat), avoided emissions (typically, CO\u2082), and the deployment of renewable generation technologies (such as geothermal energy, waste water, and heat) in new property developments. Targets differ based on customer demands and market standards. Our regional teams monitor these projects on a regular basis.\n\nProgress and measures in 2020\nIn 2020 EIS again implemented landmark sustainability projects in close partnership with its customers and was also chosen for new projects.\n\nClimate-neutral steam for a paper mill\nIn July 2020 E.ON began installing a biomass-fired cogeneration plant at UPM Paper\u2019s technologically advanced paper mill in H\u00fcrth, a suburb of Cologne. The plant, which is scheduled to become operational in the second quarter of 2022 (if Covid-19 allows), will produce climate-neutral steam for the mill and export about 20 MW of green electricity to the grid. E.ON will own and operate the plant for 30 years. It replaces a lignite-fired plant and will reduce UPM Paper\u2019s annual carbon emissions by about 140,000 metric tonnes.\n\nZero-carbon geothermal electricity\nKirchweidach, a town located about 90 kilometres east of Munich near the Austrian border, has the good fortune to have geothermal energy, which it has long used for district heating. E.ON designed a solution to harness this energy to generate zero-carbon electricity as well. The solution consists of two organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power plants. A 1 MW ORC plant entered service at the end of 2020; the second, a 4 MW ORC plant, is scheduled to come online by the end of 2021. Together, the plants will avoid about 22,110 metric tonnes of carbon emissions annually.\n\nUp on the roof\nIn early October 2020 Europe\u2019s largest rooftop solar array entered service at two Audi logistics centres in Gy\u0151r, Hungary. Designed, installed, and operated by E.ON, the system consists of 35,000 solar modules extending over roughly 16 hectares. It will produce about 9.5 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy annually, enough to supply around 4,000 households and reduce carbon emissions by about 6,000 metric tonnes each year.\n\nDecarbonising industries\nIn September 2020 B2B entered into a ten-year agreement with Cerdomus, a leading ceramics manufacturer, to install and operate a 2.5 MW high-efficiency cogeneration plant that will provide electricity and heat to the company\u2019s facility in Castel Bolognese, Italy. The plant is scheduled to become operational in 2022 and avoid about 1,400 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. In addition, a process steam generator we installed at a Dow Benelux facility in Terneuzen, the Netherlands, began operations in June. E.ON will own and operate the plant under a 15-year agreement.\nShrinking a manufacturer\u2019s carbon footprint\nIn mid-2020 E.ON entered into a partnership with a consumer goods manufacturer to refurbish its formerly steam-operated boiler house. We\u2019ll replace inefficient steam boilers with two high-efficiency condensing boilers, enabling the plant to emit 683 metric tonnes less carbon per year.\n\n55 \u2013 60 per cent\nAverage carbon savings delivered by our decentralised energy generation projects (CHP, solar) relative to customers\u2019 previous energy systems.\n\nEurope-wide roll out of ectogrid\u2122: a key driver of decarbonization\nBy connecting customers with different thermal needs and utilising waste heating and cooling, ectogrid\u2122 dramatically reduces overall energy consumption. The two ectogrid\u2122 projects we reported on last year \u2013 the European Spallation Source for Neutron Research (Lund, Sweden) and the Shamrockpark system (Herne, Germany) \u2013 continued to make progress in 2020. In addition, E.ON was awarded federal funding for TransUrban.NRW, a project to develop additional ectogrid\u2122-based heating and cooling systems for several newly built and retrofit neighbourhoods in western Germany. TransUrban.NRW, which is scheduled to run from May 2020 to April 2025, will use more than 70 per cent renewable energy. Also, we were named a preferred bidder to develop an ectogrid\u2122 solution for Lendlease\u2019s MIND (Milano Innovation District) project in northern Italy and began planning an ectogrid\u2122 heating and cooling system for \u0141asztownia Island, a sustainable neighbourhood in Szczecin in northwest Poland. The planning is supported by EU funding.\n\nH\u00f6gbytorp inaugurated\nAt the beginning of 2020 our advanced material and energy recycling unit in H\u00f6gbytorp, northwest of Stockholm, was successfully put into operation. The unit, built in close collaboration with waste management specialist RagnSells, will provide enough carbon-neutral heat for about 21,000 households as well as electricity and biogas. A roughly 25-kilometre long pipe will connect H\u00f6gbytorp to our district-heating systems in Upplands-Bro and J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla.\n\nLow-carbon energy autonomy\nIn mid-2020 residents began moving into a 360-unit development in Hattersheim, a small community near Frankfurt International Airport. Thanks to a solution designed by our subsidiary S\u00fcwag, the development has its own supply of low-carbon energy. Two cogeneration units and six rooftop solar arrays provide all of its heat and over three-quarters of its electricity.\n\nSmarter district heating\nIn mid-2020 E.ON launched OptiHeat, an end-to-end digital tool for optimising E.ON\u2019s district heating networks in Germany and Sweden. It uses demand-side forecasting and management to flatten production peaks and minimise energy losses. The goal is to cut primary energy use by 2 to 5 per cent and to reduce carbon emissions. Also, we dramatically improved water-leak detection in our district heating network in Szczecin, Poland. The project cut annual water use by more than 100,000 m\u00b3, yielding annual carbon savings of over 15,000 metric tonnes.\nEnhancing customers\u2019 experience with us deepens their loyalty\n\nThe energy world is steadily becoming cleaner, greener, more local, and more digital. It\u2019s also giving customers greater autonomy over their energy supply. Customers of all types \u2013 households and businesses, cities and government entities \u2013 are eagerly joining this new world and reaping its benefits. Today\u2019s customers are even more knowledgeable and discerning. They expect us to not only listen to and anticipate their needs, but also to design innovative and sustainable energy solutions, deliver best-in-class services, and provide a consistently superior customer experience. Earning their trust and loyalty and having a strong brand awareness are essential for us to sustainably grow our business. Loyal customers tend to stay with us longer, to purchase additional products and services, and to recommend us to their family and friends. [\u2192 GRI 103-1]\nOur approach\n\nWe put our customers at the centre of everything we do. This enables us to continually improve the experience we offer them and maintain \u2013 and, ideally \u2013 deepen their loyalty. Our focus is on people rather than products. Consequently, in 2020 we updated our brand mantra to \u201cWE has no limits.\u201d This change underscores that our brand encompasses our customers as well as the broader communities we\u2019re part of and helping to create.\n\nThe E.ON brand promises to give our customers and communities what they want in the new energy world: seamless experiences and smart, sustainable solutions. We transport energy from where it\u2019s produced to wherever it\u2019s needed. And enable people, companies, and cities across Europe to create the sustainable world they want to live in. We aim to build an energy community in which everyone can do their part \u2013 from a household opting for green electricity to an entire city committing to be sustainable. Delivering on this promise will make us distinctive in the marketplace and thus enable us to grow our business. Our ambition is to become the number one energy-solutions company in each of our markets.\n\nIn 2020 we also established a Global Customer Leadership team consisting of senior Customer Experience leaders from across our business as well as representatives of the Customer and Market Insights team (see below). Its purpose is to strengthen the customer\u2019s voice and propel customer centricity in all of our markets. The team, which had its first meeting in September 2020, meets every two months to review performance, identify areas for cross-regional collaboration, and define a shared customer narrative for the whole business.\n\nAs in prior years, in 2020 customer advocacy councils met regularly at all of our regional units. Chaired by the regional units\u2019 CEOs, they bring together senior leaders for the purpose of guiding the unit toward its goal of being the number one energy-solutions company in its market and seeing the business through its customers\u2019 eyes. The councils track their unit\u2019s performance on key customer objectives such as Net Promoter Score (NPS; see \u201cSpecific actions\u201d below), monitor the effectiveness of improvement plans (and, if necessary, adjust or reprioritise them), and review the progress of change initiatives aimed at customer advocacy. Beginning in September 2020, the E.ON Management Board receives a monthly report on NPS performance.\n\nThe Customer and Market Insights team at Corporate Functions monitors the trends that are shaping our customers\u2019 attitudes and behaviours. It conducts consumer studies and broad market research as well as advanced data analytics and modelling in order to create actionable insights and knowledge that translate into business operations.\n\nGuidelines and policies\n\nOur Customer Experience principles state our pledge for how we interact with our customers. Our efforts to design new customer journeys are guided by our brand framework with the aim of creating seamless experiences. This is our pledge:\n\n- We\u2019ll get to know you and treat you like a person\n- We\u2019ll speak your language and make it simple\n- We\u2019re the experts so you don\u2019t have to be\n- We\u2019ll always be honest and straightforward\n- We\u2019ll respond to your needs as they change over time\n- We\u2019ll empower you and help you become a better energy user.\nThese group-wide principles provide overall guidance and are embedded in Grow@E.ON, our group-wide competency framework. Each of our regional units uses a standardised process for adapting these principles to reflect their customers\u2019 needs, their own priorities, and the situation in their respective market. Our regional units in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Italy, Hungary, and Romania have had their own Customer Experience principles in place since 2015. In 2020 these principles were adopted in our new markets (the Netherlands and Poland) as well. Capability training was provided to support this process.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2 \u2611, \u2192 GRI 102-11 \u2611]\n\nSpecific actions\nWe measure customer loyalty by means of Net Promoter Score (NPS), which we introduced in 2009 and rolled out as a group-wide programme in 2013. NPS indicates our customers\u2019 willingness to recommend us to their family and friends. It helps us identify which issues are currently of particular importance to our customers and to adapt our activities to current customer needs. We measure three types of customer-facing NPS:\n\n- Strategic or top-down NPS compares our performance with that of our competitors and is based on the feedback of customers regardless of whether they\u2019ve had an interaction with us.\n- Journey NPS measures the loyalty of customers who have completed an experience with us, such as transferring their energy service to their new residence when they move.\n- Touchpoint or bottom-up NPS is based on the feedback of customers who have had a specific interaction with us, such as talking to a call centre agent.\n\nNPS is used by our regional units in all our markets (Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and, since September 2020, the Netherlands and Poland). The latter two markets are not included in our 2020 NPS figures. We\u2019ll set improvements targets for them from 2021 onward.\n\nOur methodology for measuring strategic NPS is consistent across all our markets. It also serves as the basis for E.ON\u2019s NPS engagement programme, which equips senior managers with targeted actions to capitalise on opportunities and mitigate potential challenges relating to the key drivers of NPS. As part of the innogy integration, the programme was extended to our new operations in the Netherlands and Poland.\n\nEach regional unit has a set of game-changing initiatives in place to systematically improve its customer experience. They\u2019re sponsored by the unit\u2019s CEOs and board, who are personally responsible for improving their unit\u2019s NPS. The initiatives, which are defined annually, may span multiple years depending on the degree of transformation required. We introduced these initiatives in 2017 and initially called them CEO-led signature actions.\n\nThe internal NPS (iNPS) programme, which was first introduced in 2009 in selected divisions, aims to sensitise all employees, even those who have no direct contact with customers, to the importance of customer loyalty for our company\u2019s success. As part of the innogy integration, the programme was transferred to the Culture and Performance team and will be re-evaluated in the near future.\n\nOur Customer Immersion programme brings our senior managers and employees into direct contact with residential and business customers. Its purpose is to bring the customer\u2019s voice inside our organisation and enhance our employees\u2019 customer orientation. Customer Immersion programmes help deepen cross-functional collaboration and develop capabilities that make E.ON even more customer-centric. An interactive video installation consisting of 24 screens playing the recorded statements and stories of several real E.ON customers from a variety of countries was on display at several E.ON offices in 2019 and again in 2020. The installation created a compelling opportunity for our employees, particularly those in non-customer-facing roles, to listen to real customers talking about their interactions with, and views of, our company. To date, over 4,000 colleagues have engaged with the installation, which will be on tour again in 2021.\n\nThe price customers pay for their energy consists of a sometimes confusing array of components: the cost of the energy itself, grid and other fees, taxes, and levies. That\u2019s why in the past we conducted projects at several of our regional units to improve the layout and content of our energy bills so that they\u2019re more transparent and therefore easier to read and understand. We\u2019ve involved customers in this process and also used customer-centric methodologies like Design Thinking.\n\nOur assistance for vulnerable customers varies according to the market situation, customer needs, and the welfare programmes in each country and is therefore our regional units\u2019 responsibility. Examples of this assistance include helping customers to find out whether they qualify for government support schemes and partnering with other organisations to prefinance insulation.\nfor a customer\u2019s home. In Germany, for example, vulnerable customers can contact E.ON\u2019s payment assistance team. One solution is for them to pay in instalments without interest or fees. E.ON can also put them in touch with job centres, social service agencies, and debt counselling. Disconnecting a customer is always our very last option. Customers receive four overdue payment letters before being disconnected. Only customers with an unpaid balance of more than \u20ac250 are disconnected; under German law, customers may be disconnected with an unpaid balance of \u20ac100. During Covid-19 the process was suspended for some time. In 2020 about 12,700 customers were disconnected by E.ON in Germany.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic made 2020 a very challenging year for all of our customers and the communities we serve. Our regional units responded swiftly. For example, we immediately suspended debt management processes from 20 March until July 2020, ensuring that residential as well as business customers continued to receive an uninterrupted energy supply during the pandemic. We also launched new digital services to improve customer access and assistance. Video chats, for instance, enabled customers to accomplish tasks without having to go to one of our shops.\n\nGoals and performance review\n\nNPS is a key measure of our success because we can only expand our business if our customers are satisfied and recommend us to others. This KPI is therefore used at the segment and unit level for the purpose of management control.\n\nWe define company-wide targets for strategic NPS and journey NPS annually. The variable compensation of senior managers has two components: a company factor and a factor reflecting a manager\u2019s individual performance. Since 2020, strategic NPS and journey NPS account for 20 per cent of the company factor. In 2020 NPS target achievement was again not factored into the E.ON Management Board\u2019s compensation; however, we began the process of working out how to do so equitably. The Management Board holds quarterly discussions with the units to evaluate their NPS and, if necessary, to decide what action they should take to achieve their NPS target. In addition, the COO-C and the regional units\u2019 CEOs discuss NPS and customer issues at market reviews, which are conducted on a regular basis.\n\nOur average strategic NPS for residential customers increased steadily over the course of 2020 and was at its highest level in October and December. It was above the competitor average throughout the year.\n\nDue to the challenges of collecting feedback from small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) customers during the first pandemic-related lockdown, the Management Board decided to exclude SME NPS from the overall company factor for 2020. It\u2019s planned to be included in 2021.\n\nStrategic NPS: residential customers\n\n| Dec 2019 | Mar 2020 | Jun 2020 | Sep 2020 | Dec 2020 |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Average E.ON NPS | Competitor average |\n\nOur average strategic NPS for residential customers increased steadily over the course of 2020 and was at its highest level in October and December. It was above the competitor average throughout the year.\n\nDue to the challenges of collecting feedback from small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) customers during the first pandemic-related lockdown, the Management Board decided to exclude SME NPS from the overall company factor for 2020. It\u2019s planned to be included in 2021.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2, GRI 102-11]\nProgress and measures in 2020\n\nIn 2020 we again worked hard to improve our customers\u2019 experience. We launched new projects and initiatives and continued existing ones. The Heartbeat programme, which collates information about customer satisfaction with E.ON\u2019s products, services, and customer experience in real time and displays it for employees, was extended to Sweden, Italy, and the Czech Republic. A similar programme is in place at most of the former innogy\u2019s retail businesses. The two programmes will be harmonised over the next two years. Also, COO\u2013C continued partnering with the Data Science team to use data analytics software to read and analyse customer feedback. The analysis was expanded to a growing number of E.ON\u2019s sales organisations and use cases. Key findings are communicated to the regional unit CEOs and the E.ON Management Board.\n\nExperience Share Programme\nWe re-launched our Experience Share Programme in June 2020. It consists of several sessions each year whose aim is to facilitate best-practice sharing, encourage cross-regional cocreation, and promote innovation in our customer experience and insights. The focus was on topics that are priorities at our regional units, including assembling a research plan, helping customers with payments during the pandemic, and making how we gather customer feedback more effective and engaging. We shared the best practises of regional units that are excelling in a particular area. We also learn from industry best practices through our participation in the NPS Loyalty Forum and other organisations. In 2020 we ran eight sessions on industry best practices that were attended by about 30 to 60 participants.\n\ninnogy integration\nThe innogy integration was a big theme of 2020. For example, innogy businesses joined E.ON\u2019s NPS programme for both strategic and journey NPS. Their governance was harmonised with E.ON\u2019s, and actions were defined for them to improve their NPS from 2021 onward. After the innogy integration we added new capabilities to our global customer experience model. The new capabilities aim to support the regional units in designing and implementing experience improvements: the CX Factory. The CX Factory provides additional resources to accelerate experience improvements in addition to resources already available. New capabilities include user experience (UX) design to improve our digital experiences and rapid prototyping and testing, which enables us to learn from customers\u2019 feedback and swiftly make improvements based on what they value most. In 2020 we worked closely with our regional units in the Czech Republic, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom to improve experiences in our customer journeys. In addition to direct support, we offer employees at our regional units a range of training modules on topics like design thinking, design sprints, and customer research. We conducted nine modules in 2020 with over 200 participants.\n\nComplaint management\nWe conduct an annual assessment of the status of our complaint management in all countries where we operate. In 2020 our operations for the first time were assessed to be \u201cproactive\u201d in all countries. Effective practices included intelligent call routing based on a customer\u2019s history, root-cause analysis of complaint drivers, and the use of operational excellence tools in service centres. During the corona pandemic we successfully encouraged customers to contact us using unassisted channels like SMS, virtual assistants, and our digital service platforms.\nResponsibilities\nThe innogy integration in 2020 also involved transforming our Strategy & Innovation department, which now comprises the Strategy Cluster (corporate strategy, network strategy, retail strategy) and the innovation activities of E.ON Group Innovation GmbH (see below). The department is within the CEO\u2019s remit. We expect this new setup to significantly enhance our ability to adapt E.ON\u2019s strategy to emerging trends and to better support the operating units\u2019 innovation activities.\n\nThe Strategy Cluster is responsible for making strategic recommendations and guiding decisions on corporate and business-specific strategic issues. In addition, it provides the E.ON Management Board with the information and insights it needs to set and, if necessary, adjust E.ON\u2019s strategic course. The cluster also monitors trends, competitors, and, in close consultation with the Political Affairs team, policy and regulatory developments. In addition, it works with the operating units on specific projects and collaborates continuously with the Sustainability & HSE department to ensure that E.ON\u2019s corporate strategy and sustainability strategy go hand in hand.\n\nThe ability to innovate is crucial for E.ON\u2019s future success. In 2020 E.ON therefore formed a new subsidiary, E.ON Group Innovation GmbH, dedicated entirely to innovation. It identifies and evaluates the latest developments in the energy sector and explores and forges partnerships with innovative companies, start-ups, universities, research institutions, and thought leaders. Its purpose is to strengthen E.ON\u2019s position as a pioneer in the sustainable transformation of the energy landscape. Headquartered in Essen, E.ON Group Innovation has outposts in a number of global innovation hubs: Berlin, Tel Aviv, and Silicon Valley. It works closely with the business units and E.ON\u2019s regional units to make a measurable contribution to E.ON\u2019s business success.\n\nManagement\nE.ON operates in a highly competitive and dynamic marketplace. New technologies, market entrants, and potential disruptions emerge continually. Regulated businesses generate about 80 per cent of our operating earnings. Our policy and regulatory environment is therefore crucial to our success. Although this environment is less volatile than our markets, it\u2019s also a source of change. We must continually ensure that our corporate strategy will enable us to create sustainable value for our investors and for the communities we serve. We do this through four strategy workstreams. Monitoring (i): we continually monitor E.ON\u2019s competitive and regulatory environment as well as social, technological, and economic trends. Strategy process (ii): we conduct\na strategic review (at regular intervals and on an ad hoc basis) to ensure that E.ON\u2019s strategy and equity story address new developments. Strategic projects (iii): we evaluate the status of strategic projects that simultaneously contribute to E.ON\u2019s long-term sustainable growth and accelerate the energy transition. Portfolio activities (iv): we assess how E.ON\u2019s infrastructure and customer solutions businesses affect E.ON\u2019s sustainability profile.\n\nNew business models and the demand for individually tailored customer solutions create opportunities for the energy industry to influence other sectors of the economy, communities, and, indeed, people\u2019s lifestyles. In 2020 we therefore defined four focus areas for innovation: Industry Automation and Electrification, Energy Communities and Networks, Networked Mobility, and Connected Life. Within each area we\u2019re exploring ways in which E.ON can transcend its role as an energy supplier and offer innovative solutions that help customers in a variety of industries embrace green growth.\nEnable Europe\u2019s carbon neutrality\n\n30 Lower-carbon households\n\n24 Reliable and smart grids\n\n35 Cleaner companies, greener communities\n\n39 Customer experience\n\n44 Closeup on: Strategy and innovation\n\n48 Protect the planet\n\nEnvironment\n\n48 Climate protection\n\n57 Environmental management\nEnvironment\n\nOur company has a responsibility to protect the environment and the earth\u2019s climate. We live up to this responsibility by making consistent progress toward our climate targets, conserving resources, and being a good environmental steward at and near our facilities.\n\n2020 Highlights\n\nIn August 2020 E.ON held the world\u2019s first #GreenInternetDay to raise awareness of the internet\u2019s growing power consumption. We estimate that data centres will account for 13 per cent of the world\u2019s electricity demand by 2030. It\u2019s therefore important to power them with climate-friendly electricity.\n\nCDP gave E.ON an A rating in 2020 in recognition of our leadership in corporate sustainability. We were among a small number of high-performing companies out of the more than 5,800 that were rated. E.ON\u2019s demonstrable actions have made it global a leader in corporate environmental ambition, action, and transparency.\n\nAs part of its commitment to making gas greener, in mid-2020 E.ON joined the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance. The alliance, which at year-end 2020 consisted of around 200 companies and organisations, is dedicated to expanding and deploying hydrogen technologies by 2030.\n\nE.ON Rooftop is an online tool that uses satellite imagery and other data to enable customers to swiftly calculate the solar potential of any roof in Europe. It\u2019s one of many ways that E.ON is enabling the energy transition.\n\nIn 2020 the E.ON Management Board set several new climate targets. E.ON aims to become carbon-neutral by 2040 by reducing its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 75 per cent by 2030 and by 100 per cent by 2040 and its Scope 3 emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and by 100 per cent by 2050 (all relative to 2019).\nOn course for climate neutrality\n\nClimate change caused by human action is serious and affects nature and humans. As part of the decision to adopt the Paris Agreement, in October 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its Special Report on global warming. It once again emphasised the urgent need for decisive and concerted action to reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions so that global warming can be limited to 1.5 to 2 degrees Centigrade. Although many countries worldwide have taken tangible steps to protect the climate and to mitigate the impact of global warming, the GHG concentration in the atmosphere continues to rise and thus intensifies climate change. The economic slowdown resulting from corona-related restrictions didn\u2019t alter this situation. A successful transformation to a low-carbon society will require far-reaching and permanent structural changes across society. It will also require sector integration, which refers to the interlinkages between electricity and gas in the heating, cooling, and transport sectors.\nOn 11 December 2020, EU heads of state and government adopted the Council Conclusions including the EU 2030 climate target. In a significant step forward, EU leaders agreed on a \u201cnet domestic reduction of at least 55 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990,\u201d just in time for the five-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement on 12 December. The conclusions emphasise that the implementation needs to be completed in a cost-effective manner and \u201ctake into account considerations of fairness and solidarity, while leaving no one behind.\u201d Although the conclusions enable the EU to demonstrate international climate leadership, work still needs to be done to ensure the target is fit for purpose and ambitious enough given, for example, that it refers to a \u201cnet\u201d target.\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy poses challenges for our competitiveness but also creates opportunities for us to grow our business. Our core businesses reflect the key emerging energy trends and enable us to help our customers to use energy more efficiently and to generate their own low-carbon energy. Beyond this, the production or provision of all goods and services as well as customers\u2019 use of our products results in GHG emissions. We therefore need to take action to reduce our climate impact both upstream and downstream.\n\nOur approach\n\nEnergy networks like ours are where the transition to a low-carbon energy supply is happening: they integrate renewables, connect producers and consumers, and deftly manage complex energy flows. Our customer solutions help customers of all kinds use energy more efficiently, produce their own renewable energy, and thus reduce their carbon footprint. In short, climate protection isn\u2019t an afterthought at E.ON, but is increasingly becoming an integral part of business operations and governance. Our business operations themselves help tackle climate change, improve people\u2019s lives and create a future worth living.\n\nWe want to shrink our own carbon footprint as well. In 2004 we began disclosing the annual carbon emissions from our power and heat generation and from other business activities not directly related to generation. These include upstream and downstream emissions associated with our business activities. We calculate emissions using the globally recognised Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol) issued by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The transaction with RWE, which was completed in September 2019 has enabled E.ON to focus exclusively on two sustainability-oriented businesses \u2013 energy networks and customer solutions \u2013 and to significantly strengthen these businesses through the acquisition and integration of innogy\u2019s networks and customer businesses. In 2020 the E.ON Management Board therefore set new climate-protection targets. To achieve them, we\u2019ve defined specific actions to reduce our emissions in all three scopes of the GHG Protocol (see \u201cGoals and performance review\u201d below).\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nThe Sustainability department at Corporate Functions took the lead in developing our company-wide climate-protection targets and monitors progress toward them (see \u201cGoals and performance review\u201d below). Our units are responsible for taking action to reduce their own emissions as well as those that arise from their business activities. They\u2019re supported in these efforts by their HSE team and our wider HSE organisation, which helps design energy-efficiency measures and shares ideas and best practices. Together, their achievements enable us to make progress toward our company-wide reduction targets for direct and indirect emissions. In 2020 we further embedded climate-risk reporting into group-wide energy risk management.\n\nThe chapter entitled Occupational health and safety contains detailed information about our HSE organisation.\n\nE.ON views good corporate governance as a central foundation of responsible and value-oriented management, efficient collaboration between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, transparent disclosures, and appropriate risk management. The clear organisation of our sustainability and climate-related activities ensures that we work together efficiently and improve continually. Information about our carbon footprint, progress toward\nour climate targets, and the measures we\u2019re taking are first presented to our Chief Sustainability Officer and Sustainability Council. Our Chief Sustainability Officer, who chairs the council, reports the information to the E.ON Management Board and the Supervisory Board on a regular basis.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2](#)\n\n**Guidelines and policies**\n\nIn 2019 we updated the E.ON Car Policy, which took effect in January 2020. Climate protection and environmental friendliness are key aspects of the updated version. For example, it encourages the selection of an electric company car and, for the first time, includes the option of choosing an annual pass for the German Federal Railway instead of a company car.\n\nIn 2018 we adopted the E.ON Health, Safety, Environment & Climate Protection Policy Statement, which supersedes our Health, Safety and Environment Policy Statement from 2014. The statement now encompasses climate protection and treats energy management as an aspect of this. It articulates our commitment to comply with all HSE laws and regulations and defines the appropriate management systems for this. It pledges us to protect the environment and the earth\u2019s climate, reduce our energy consumption, conserve resources, operate responsibly, and strive for continual improvement in our environmental performance.\n\nTwo other HSE policies that are more specific in nature \u2013 our Sustainability & HSE Function Policy and our Health, Safety, and Environment People Guideline \u2013 took effect at the beginning of 2018. Our Function Policy defines HSE roles, responsibilities, management approaches and tools, and minimum requirements for our entire organisation. It empowers our Sustainability & HSE division to monitor units\u2019 compliance with the obligation to have an HSE management system certified to ISO 14001 or EMAS. We also defined HSE standards for incident management, which replace the standards stipulated in previous business directives. Our Code of Conduct contains general HSE rules with which all employees must comply. The HSE People Guideline goes into greater detail, underlining the importance of environmental and climate protection and defining specific tasks.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2](#)\n\n**Goals and performance review**\n\nAfter more than five years, we have finalised the strategic transformation of E.ON. We started with the decision in 2014 to spin-off Uniper and thus E.ON\u2019s commodity-exposed activities, such as fossil-fuelled power generation. Although we have taken considerable steps to reduce our direct emissions over the last years, we have set ourselves additional ambitious targets: In 2020 the E.ON Management Board set new climate targets that, in the future, are also to serve as KPIs that are relevant for management purposes. The exact details will be determined in 2021. By reducing GHG emissions we intend to become carbon-neutral by 2040. We plan to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 75 per cent by 2030 and by 100 per cent by 2040 (both relative to 2019). We aim to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and by 100 per cent by 2050 (both relative to 2019). Scope 3 emissions occur primarily during the generation of the power we purchase and resell and during the use of the gas we sell. These indirect upstream and downstream emissions account for most of our carbon emissions. The adoption of our climate strategy set in motion actions to help us to achieve our climate-protection targets for 2030 to 2050 and thus to support Europe\u2019s energy transition. In monitoring progress toward them, it\u2019s important to remember that year-on-year comparisons can be affected by temporary fluctuations caused by weather patterns and other factors. A period of several years is necessary to determine whether the action we\u2019re taking is effective and where we stand with regard to our targets. We therefore assess the trend every three years. Our first assessment was at year-end 2019. The trend (in absolute terms and with regard to our carbon intensity target) indicated that so far the reduction rate is in line with our forecasts. In addition, each unit has the authority to pursue more ambitious emission-reduction targets that go beyond the targets for E.ON as a whole.\n\nIn 2018 we underscored our commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our own operations by setting the target of making all E.ON buildings carbon-neutral by 2030. In 2020 we formed a project group whose task is to design a road map toward this target. The road map will consist of detailed measures to reduce our buildings\u2019 carbon footprint and to foster sustainable property management. The approach is holistic, encompassing employee engagement as well as technical energy-efficiency upgrades.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2/3](#)\nProgress and measures in 2020\n\nIn February 2020 the E.ON Management Board set new and more ambitious climate targets for 2030 to 2050. At mid-year the European Union presented its hydrogen strategy. The aim is to expand the use of hydrogen and establish a hydrogen economy to support the achievement of the EU\u2019s climate targets. The EU also founded the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, which E.ON joined as part of its plan to grow its business in green gases. The alliance, which consists of around 200 companies and other organisations, is committed to expanding and adopting hydrogen technologies by 2030.\n\nCDP is one of the largest international associations of investors that independently assess the transparency and detail of companies\u2019 climate reporting. We\u2019ve reported data on our carbon emissions to CDP since 2004. CDP gave E.ON an A rating in 2020 in recognition of our leadership in corporate sustainability. We were among a small number of high-performing companies out of the more than 5,800 that were rated. E.ON\u2019s demonstrable actions have made us a global leader in corporate environmental ambition, action, and transparency. The rating is higher than the average rating for Europe (B) and the renewable power generation sector (C). Furthermore, CDP recognised E.ON again as a \u201cSupplier Engagement Leader\u201d in 2020. E.ON is among the top 7 per cent assessed for supplier engagement on climate change, based on our 2020 CDP disclosures.\n\n#GreenInternet Day\n\nIn January 2020 E.ON held the world\u2019s first #GreenInternet Day to raise awareness of the internet\u2019s growing power consumption. We estimate that data centres will account for 13 per cent of the world\u2019s electricity demand by 2030. Similarly, new 5G applications will consume an additional 3.8 terawatt-hours of electricity by 2025 in Germany alone, enough to power Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf, and Dortmund for a year. Consumers\u2019 electronic devices, by contrast, use comparatively little electricity. Moreover, the chance of convincing consumers to use their devices less frequently seems remote. Consequently, we believe the most effective solution is to supply data centres with climate-friendly electricity, something E.ON already does. We also provide data centres with low-carbon embedded generation solutions incorporating cogeneration units or fuel cells, often in combination with solar or wind energy.\n\nCarbon reporting according to the GHG Protocol\n\nWe calculate our emissions using the globally recognised WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol) for the six GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol: carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), nitrous oxide (N\u2082O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF\u2086). CO\u2082 is by far our biggest GHG. Although other GHGs like SF\u2086 and CH\u2084 contribute to our climate impact, we emit much less of them than CO\u2082. Global warming potentials indicate how much GHGs affect global warming over a period of time compared with CO\u2082. All GHG emissions can be expressed as CO\u2082 equivalents (CO\u2082e).\n\nThe GHG Protocol defines three scopes for GHG accounting and reporting. This improves transparency and provides guidance for different types of climate policies and business goals. The tables below include innogy from 2019 onward in order to foster comparability and transparency in the years ahead. For this reason, the calculation methods were harmonised in 2020. innogy\u2019s GHG emissions for 2019, which were initially determined using company-specific emissions factors, were recalculated using the E.ON Group\u2019s methods and emission factors and then aggregated with E.ON\u2019s figures. This yielded a consistent baseline for our climate target. To maximize transparency, we disclose prior-year figures and the recalculation method below the respective table.\n\nE.ON\u2019s carbon footprint by GHG Protocol scope\n\n| Scope 3 upstream | Scope 2 (market-based) | Scope 1 | Scope 3 downstream |\n|------------------|------------------------|---------|-------------------|\n| Purchased power sold to end customers | Power distribution losses | Fugitive emissions | Combustion of natural gas sold to end-customers |\n| Purchased goods and services | Purchased power used in operations and administrative buildings | Power and heat generation | Fuel combustion |\n| Power and heat generation | Upstream processes of leased assets (leased vehicles) | Company-owned vehicles | |\n| Business travel and employee commuting | | | |\n\n56% 5% 3% 36%\nScope 1 are direct GHG emissions from fuels combusted in sources that we own or control, such as our power and heat plants and vehicle fleet. They also include fugitive methane emissions from our gas distribution networks.\n\nScope 2 are indirect GHG emissions from the generation of electricity that we purchase to power our buildings, operations, and electric vehicles or that are classified as line losses in our power distribution networks. These emissions don\u2019t physically occur at our facilities but rather at the facility where the electricity is generated. This is why power distribution losses are classified as Scope 2 emissions but gas distribution losses as Scope 1 emissions. Emissions attributable to line losses are lower in grid segments with lots of renewables feed-in. In line with the GHG Protocol, we calculate Scope 2 using a location-based method and a market-based method.\n\nScope 3 are indirect emissions that occur upstream and downstream from E.ON. They result primarily from the generation of the electricity we purchase and resell to customers and the use of the gas that we\u2019ve sold to them. But also included are the emissions attributable to the production and provision of the goods and services we purchase. With reference to the GHG Protocol, we divided our emissions from power and heat generation in 2020 into emissions from \u201cplants owned and operated\u201d (Scope 1) and \u201cplants owned but leased to and operated by lessee\u201d (Scope 3) to enhance transparency. To calculate emissions when primary data are unavailable or of insufficient quality, the GHG Protocol recommends the use of secondary data, such as industry-average data or government statistics. Since spinning off its large-scale fossil-fuelled power generation business in 2016, E.ON has procured its power mainly from wholesale markets where the source of generation is often not traceable or information about the source is not reliable. E.ON therefore uses the official national emission factors of the countries in which power sold to end-customers is purchased.\n\nE.ON\u2019s 2020 carbon footprint (total CO\u2082 equivalents in million metric tonnes)\n\n| Scope 1 | Scope 2 (market based) | Scope 3 |\n|---------|------------------------|---------|\n| 3.56    | 1.65                   | 0.25    |\n| 0.05    | 0.04                   | 0.03    |\n| 1.82    | 5.83                   | 0.05    |\n| 0.04    | 6.09                   | 0.03    |\n| 0.05    | 0.25                   | 0.001   |\n\n1. To heat buildings and technical equipment.\n2. This figure does not include 107 kilotonnes of CO\u2082e of biogenic emissions.\n3. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and DEFRA attribute no direct CO\u2082 emissions to energy generated at renewables facilities and nuclear power stations. This figure includes leased CHP plants operated by our customers and plants for reserve and emergency heat and power generation.\n4. From 2019 onward, emissions from power and heat generation are divided into emissions from plants owned and operated by E.ON (Scope 1) and emissions from plants leased to, and operated by, customers (Scope 3). This improves our ability to manage our emissions and makes progress toward our targets more transparent.\n5. Excludes our consumption of district heating due to the immateriality of the quantity compared with the other Scope 2 categories.\n6. Partially based on prior-year figures for the category car rental.\n7. This figure does not include an offset of approximately 501 metric tonnes of CO\u2082.\n8. We estimate that, on average, half of our employees worked from home in 2020 owing to Covid-19. However, since the calculation method was updated in 2020, comparability with prior years is limited.\n9. This figure does not include an offset of approximately 55 metric tonnes of CO\u2082.\n10. Includes capital goods.\n11. Figures include residential, commercial, and industrial customers.\n12. Scope 3 emissions from purchased power and the combustion of natural gas sold to end-customers are from energy sold to residential and B2B customers only. Energy sold to sales partners and the wholesale market is not included.\nOur direct and indirect CO\u2082e emissions totalled 117.85 million metric tonnes in 2020, of which 3 per cent were direct Scope 1 emissions, 97 per cent were indirect Scope 2 and 3 emissions. Scope 1 emissions decreased by 8 per cent year on year, indirect emissions declined by about 10 percent.\n\n**Scope 1 [GRI 305-1]**\n\n| Total CO\u2082 equivalents in million metric tonnes | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Power and heat generation*                    | 1.82 | 1.93 | 2.60 |\n| Fugitive emissions                             | 1.65 | 1.88 | 1.95 |\n| Company-owned vehicles                         | 0.04 | 0.05 | 0.02 |\n| Fuels combustion*                              | 0.05 | 0.03 | 0.01 |\n| **Total**                                      | 3.56 | 3.88 | 4.58 |\n\n*From 2019 onward, emissions from power and heat generation are divided into emissions from plants owned and operated by E.ON (Scope 1) and emissions from plants leased to, and operated by, customers (Scope 3). This improves our ability to manage our emissions and makes progress toward our targets more transparent.\n\nThe 2020 Scope 1 emissions totalled 3.6 million metric tonnes of CO\u2082e, slightly less than the adjusted prior-year figure of 3.9 million metric tonnes of CO\u2082e. The decrease is mainly attributable to fugitive emissions reduction.\n\nThe 2019 report disclosed Scope 1 emissions for 2019 of 4.91 million metric tonnes of CO\u2082e for E.ON and 3.05 million metric tonnes for innogy. In 2020 we recalculated innogy\u2019s 2019 emissions using E.ON\u2019s emission factors, which are based on the internationally recognised factors of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).\n\nEmissions from power and heat generation are mainly attributable to our combined heat and power (CHP) plants. In 2020 we improved the transparency of Scope 1 emissions from power and heat generation of leased assets by reporting them as Scope 3 emissions from downstream leased assets. These are leased assets that we installed at customers\u2019 facilities and that customers operate for their own use. This distinction showed that, overall, emissions from owned and leased assets are almost equal. For heat generation, by contrast, 73 per cent of emissions are from owned assets and 63 per cent from leased assets.\n\nFugitive emissions consist predominantly of methane from gas leaks as well as leaks of sulphur hexafluoride (SF\u2086) and coolants used in energy distribution equipment. Their global-warming potential is very high, which is reflected in their high CO\u2082e. However, our fugitive emissions are quite small in proportion to the quantity distributed and used: in 2020 just 0.4 per cent of methane and 0.2 per cent of SF\u2086 were lost. Going forward, we intend to reduce fugitive emissions by continually improving and modernising our gas networks as well as our monitoring of leaks.\n\n**Scope 2 [GRI 305-2]**\n\n| Total CO\u2082 equivalents in million metric tonnes | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Power distribution losses (location-based)*    | 4.19 | 4.51 | 2.69 |\n| Power distribution losses (market-based)**     | 5.83 | 7.19 | 3.96 |\n| Purchased power (location-based)               | 0.30 | 0.31 | 0.20 |\n| Purchased power (market-based)                 | 0.25 | -    | -    |\n| **Total (location-based)**                     | 4.49 | 4.82 | 2.89 |\n| **Total (market-based)**                       | 6.09 | -    | -    |\n\n*Based on the emission factors of the national electricity mixes for specific geographic regions.\n\n**Climate protection**\n\nWe recorded location-based Scope 2 emissions of 4.49 million metric tonnes of CO\u2082e in 2020, slightly less than in 2019. A decline in emissions from power distribution losses was the main factor. For 2020 we disclose, for the first time, market-based Scope 2 emissions from our own electricity consumption.\n\nThe 2019 report disclosed location-based Scope 2 emissions in 2019 of 2.73 million metric tonnes of CO\u2082e for E.ON and 3.05 million metric tonnes for innogy. In 2020 we recalculated innogy\u2019s 2019 power distribution losses and purchased power used in buildings and operations using E.ON\u2019s emission factors, which are based on the IEA\u2019s factors. innogy\u2019s market-based power\ndistribution losses in 2019 were not available for our 2019 report. They were calculated for this report using E.ON\u2019s calculation method and added to the E.ON figure for 2019.\n\nLine losses in our networks account for the majority of our Scope 2 emissions. Pursuant to GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, since 2016 we\u2019ve calculated them two ways: using the location-based method and the market-based method. For our own decision-making, we use the figure determined by the location-based method, which is based on the respective national generation mix. The market-based method yields a different figure because it is based on the contractually attributable generation mix of each of our electricity suppliers. The effort required to identify every single provider that feeds electricity into each of our networks would be considerable. We therefore use the emission factor of the residual generation mix. In most cases, this is well above the factor of the national generation mix. Line losses accounted for approximately 4 per cent of the power we distributed in 2020.\n\nEach euro we invest to maintain our grids helps to reduce line losses. Our approach depends on the type of loss. Technical losses can be reduced through network optimisation. We\u2019re also upgrading our grids using smart-grid technology, which enables our lines and transformers to adapt \u2013 in many cases automatically \u2013 to the actual production and consumption in a given grid segment. However, technical losses can only be reduced to a certain extent owing to the physical attributes of power grids. Commercial losses result primarily from theft. We seek to reduce these losses by using the data provided by smart meters and other devices to identify suspicious consumption patterns.\n\n### Scope 3 [GRI 305-3](#)\n\n| Total CO\u2082 equivalents in million metric tonnes | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Purchased power sold to end-customers<sup>4</sup> | 61.27 | 70.78<sup>3</sup> | 35.57 |\n| Combustion of natural gas sold to end-customers<sup>5</sup> | 41.78 | 44.30<sup>2</sup> | 22.63 |\n| Purchased goods and services<sup>4</sup> | 3.33<sup>3</sup> | 3.29<sup>4</sup> | 2.93 |\n| Power and heat generation (leased assets)<sup>7</sup> | 1.75<sup>6</sup> | 1.70<sup>6</sup> | - |\n| Employee commuting | 0.05<sup>9</sup> | 0.05 | 0.03 |\n| Upstream processes of leased assets (leased vehicles) | 0.03 | 0.06<sup>8</sup> | 0.05<sup>8</sup> |\n| Business travel<sup>11</sup> | 0.001<sup>12</sup> | 0.01 | 0.01 |\n| Electricity distribution losses (other grid operators) | -<sup>13</sup> | 0.08 | 0.09 |\n| **Total** | **108.21** | **120.27<sup>3</sup>** | **61.31** |\n\n<sup>1</sup>Figures include residential, commercial, and industrial customers.\n<sup>2</sup>Scope 3 emissions from purchased power and the combustion of natural gas sold to end-customers are from energy sold to residential and B2B customers only.

Effective 1 January 2020, this figure is no longer recorded or disclosed owing to a lack of materiality.\nOur 2020 Scope 3 emissions of 108.21 million metric tonnes made up the lion\u2019s share of our total carbon footprint. We recorded a slight reduction compared with 2019 and expect the carbon intensity of purchased power to continue to decline further as the European countries in which we purchase power decarbonise their energy mixes.\n\nThe 2019 report disclosed Scope 3 emissions for 2019 of 59.67 million metric tonnes of CO\u2082e for E.ON and 88.13 million metric tonnes for innogy. In 2020 we recalculated innogy\u2019s 2019 emissions using E.ON\u2019s emission factors, which are based on the IEA and DEFRA\u2019s factors as well as an E.ON-specific emission factor for the recalculation of purchased goods and services. Also, innogy\u2019s figures for purchased power and combustion of natural gas sold to end-customers were checked against E.ON\u2019s materiality threshold for reporting boundaries.\n\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\nE.ON is committed to acting sustainably in all respects. This includes making steady progress toward our climate targets, effectively managing our climate-related risks, seizing climate-related opportunities that fit with our corporate strategy, and reporting transparently on all these matters. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provide important guidance for our reporting. Established in 2015, the TCFD aims to develop consistent, comparable, and accurate climate-related financial risk disclosures that companies can use to provide information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders. E.ON became an official TCFD supporter in 2019, which marks the start of our TCFD reporting below. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to expand our TCFD reporting. In addition, our TCFD reporting is supported by additional information in On course for net-zero \u2013 Supporting paper for E.ON\u2019s decarbonization strategy and climate-related disclosures.\n\n- **Governance**\n  The importance of climate change for E.ON is reflected in our governance. The Management Board has overall responsibility for our sustainability strategy, including our climate targets, and is informed on a quarterly basis by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) about important initiatives and developments as well as key performance indicators. The CSO manages and monitors all of the company\u2019s sustainability activities and chairs the Sustainability Council, our main forum for discussing sustainability issues, establishing a sustainable mindset, and embedding it in our business processes. The Supervisory Board is regularly informed about E.ON\u2019s sustainability performance by its Audit and Risk Committee, by its Innovation and Sustainability Committee, and by the Management Board.\n\n- **Strategy**\n  E.ON\u2019s business operations directly contribute to the avoidance of CO\u2082e. Our two core businesses \u2013 Energy Networks and Customer Solutions \u2013 make the energy system more efficient, increase the proportion of renewables in the energy mix, and therefore help prevent GHG emissions. Moreover, our current climate strategy includes emission-reduction targets for 2030 through 2050. The acquisition of innogy\u2019s networks and customer business substantially strengthened our core businesses and therefore enhances our ability to promote sustainability. But it also changes our carbon footprint. In 2020 we set new climate targets and intend to be carbon-neutral by 2040 (see \u201cGoals and performance review\u201d).\n\nBoth climate change and the energy transition aimed at slowing it could create risks as well as opportunities for our business. We therefore review, on an ad hoc basis, a range of climate scenarios, including those that are consistent with the goal of limiting the global rise in temperatures to less than 2 degrees Centigrade. Among them are the IEA\u2019s Sustainability Development Scenario and a scenario we developed ourselves. We use these scenarios to analyse the factors that could influence E.ON\u2019s enterprise value and its ability to achieve long-term profitability by capturing business opportunities created by the transition to a low-carbon future. Scenario analysis was also part of the process of setting our new climate targets in 2020. Also, climate protection is one of three focus dimensions in the new sustainability strategy E.ON adopted in 2020.\n\n- **Risk management**\n  E.ON plans to continually monitor and assess its sustainability, climate, and other non-financial risks and opportunities and their potential impact in the short, medium, and long term. In 2018 we began to integrate the assessment and management of these risks more systematically into our overall risk management. In 2020 we completed the task of organisationally integrating climate risk assessment into E.ON\u2019s enterprise risk management (ERM) process, which will now be the standard ERM process from 2021 onward. Risk managers at our units were actively involved in this process. They identified climate risks and chances in the country or countries where their unit operates for the three-year medium-term planning period and beyond. The status of this process is presented to the E.ON Group Risk Committee on a regular basis. Our analyses of climate\nrisks encompass physical risks (such as extreme weather and rising temperatures) as well as transitional risks (such as changes in consumer preferences, our regulatory environment, and carbon prices).\n\n- **Metrics and targets**\n  E.ON\u2019s current climate metrics consist mainly of the emission figures for its carbon footprint categories (Scope 1, 2, and 3) and the measurement of progress toward its climate targets. You\u2019ll find our carbon footprint under \u201cProgress and measures\u201d above. Also, we defined new climate targets in 2020, which can be found under \u201cGoals and performance review.\u201d For all relevant GHG categories, E.ON monitors progress toward these targets on an annual basis and analyses progress in greater depth every three years as part of a trend analysis; the next in-depth analysis will be at year-end 2022 and use our 2019 figures as the baseline.\n\nE.ON\u2019s business operations directly contribute to the avoidance of CO\u2082e. Our two core businesses \u2013 Energy Networks and Customer Solutions \u2013 make the energy system more efficient, increase the proportion of renewables in the energy mix, and therefore help prevent GHG emissions. Consequently, we also disclose avoided emissions. This also applies to the annual reporting for our Green Bonds, which includes disclosures on the metric tonnes of CO\u2082e avoided by the projects funded.\n\nIn 2020 E.ON issued another three Green Bonds totalling \u20ac2.25 billion. A Green Bond is a fixed-interest security whose issuance proceeds are used to fund low-carbon infrastructure and energy-efficiency projects. In October 2019 E.ON concluded a \u20ac3.5 billion syndicated credit facility whose credit margin is linked in part to the performance of certain ESG ratings. This gives us additional financial incentives to pursue a sustainable corporate strategy.\nE.ON is committed to preventing environmental damage and minimising the impact of its business operations on the environment, the landscape, and biodiversity. In the past five years, the focus of our environmental management has changed a lot. The transformation into the new E.ON \u2013 a specialist for infrastructure and customer solutions for a low-carbon energy world \u2013 involved our exit from large-scale conventional power (in 2016) and industrial-scale renewables (in 2019). The transformation therefore dramatically changed our asset base and geographic footprint. Nevertheless, we still operate distribution networks in six European countries. As such, our environmental management now is less about preventing major industrial accidents and more about being an exemplary environmental steward of the biospheres and landscapes near our network assets, conserving energy and other resources at our facilities and offices, and complying at all times with all international and national environmental laws and regulations. Our environmental management is guided by the precautionary principle endorsed by the United Nations. [\u2192 GRI 103-1, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\n\nOur approach\n\nEnergy management \u2013 continually looking for ways to reduce our own energy consumption \u2013 plays an important role in our environmental management and helps us reduce our greenhouse-gas emissions. Its implementation is assured by our operational health, safety, and environment (HSE) management, as we\u2019re committed to protecting people as well as the environment. Because the approaches and systems for doing both well are similar, we\u2019ve combined environmental management and occupational health and safety in a single HSE organisation. Our environmental management is guided by the precautionary principle endorsed by the United Nations, and we\u2019ve explicitly supported the UN Global Compact\u2019s ten principles since 2005. Our objective is for our business activities to cause no environmental damage and to have as little environmental impact as possible. We comply with all environmental laws and regulations. Beyond this, we\u2019ve also defined our own environmental standards, which are mandatory across E.ON. Because we want to do business only with companies that share our commitment to environmental protection, our suppliers and contractors must pledge to observe our standards. A company policy (see \u201cGuidelines and policies\u201d below) requires all E.ON units (except for very small ones and those with insignificant risks and potential impact) to have in place an environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 or EMAS, internationally recognised standards for such systems. [\u2192 GRI 103-2, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nThe Sustainability department at Corporate Functions took the lead in developing our company-wide climate-protection targets and monitors progress toward them (see \u201cGoals and performance review\u201d below). Our units are responsible for taking action to reduce their own emissions as well as those that arise from their business activities. They\u2019re supported in these efforts by their HSE team and our wider HSE organisation, which helps design energy-efficiency measures and shares ideas and best practices. Together, their achievements enable us to progress toward our company-wide reduction targets for direct and indirect emissions. [\u2192 GRI 103-2]\nGuidelines and policies\nOur HSE Policy Statement requires documented HSE management systems according to international standards. For example, it requires all E.ON units (except, as stated above, for very small ones and those with insignificant risks and potential impact) to have an environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 or EMAS. In 2020 the coverage rate was 86 per cent. In compliance with the Energy Services Act in Germany, we also introduced ISO 50001 at those units that already had an HSE management system. In 2020, 80 per cent of our business units had an energy management system (EMS) certified to ISO 50001 or conducted audits according to EN16247. We measure and analyse the energy consumed by the facilities and office buildings at all of these units. The findings help us identify opportunities to conserve energy and recommend cost-effective energy-efficiency measures. The Climate protection chapter contains more information. Similarly, the Health and safety chapter contains information about guidelines and policies relating to occupational health and safety as well as environmental protection, such as the new standard for HSE risk management we adopted in 2020. [\u2192 GRI 103-2]\n\nSpecific actions\nPRISMA (Platform for Reporting on Incident and Sustainability Management and Audits), as its name indicates, is the online channel our managers and employees use to report incidents. The Occupational health and safety chapter contains more information about PRISMA and our incident management generally.\n\nThe steps we\u2019ve taken in Germany to improve our facilities\u2019 energy efficiency included installing smart LED lighting in buildings and car parks, reducing the energy consumed by ventilation and air-conditioning, and using smart building controls that automatically adjust interior temperatures depending on exterior temperatures and the day of the week (workday or weekend). At our operations in Germany, we have in place an EMS certified to ISO50001, an international standard aimed at enabling organisations to achieve continual improvements in energy efficiency. We monitor the EMS\u2019s effectiveness by means of systematic audits, an annual management review, and confirmation by an accredited certification organisation. In 2020 these mechanisms confirmed the EMS\u2019s effectiveness. E.ON UK and some other units intend to put in place an EMS in order to fulfil obligations in their particular country, such as the UK Energy Savings and Opportunities Scheme.\n\nIn 2017 we began offering our employees in Germany incentives to embrace E-Mobility. They include an attractively priced leasing contract for an electric vehicle (EV), an at-home charging point, and a certified renewable power tariff enabling employees to charge their EV with clean energy.\n\nFor projects with a considerable public or ecological impact, we conduct an environmental impact assessment during the development stage of new power lines, gas pipelines, and other large industrial equipment we intend to build. Such assessments are often required to obtain planning or regulatory consent. There may be additional requirements for us to monitor an asset\u2019s environmental impact once it\u2019s in operation to ensure that our assessment was correct. In addition, we engage in ongoing dialogue with local stakeholders and interested parties on a range of environmental issues.\n\nE.ON also takes steps to protect wildlife and landscapes and to promote biodiversity. Bird safety, for example, is an important issue for many of our distribution system operators (DSOs). Their activities in this area include installing nest platforms for storks, eagles, falcons, and other bird species. Westnetz, an E.ON DSO in west-central and southwest Germany, has replaced the gravel surfaces around transformer stations with grass to provide a better habitat for plants and animals and is also a leader in ecological corridor management. An interview with Westnetz\u2019s Michael Wahl provides more information. In addition, many E.ON DSOs have tree-planting initiatives. [\u2192 GRI 103-2]\nGoals and performance review\nThe E.ON Management Board is informed about serious environmental incidents (category 3 in our Standard on Incident Management) by means of monthly reports from HSE and periodic consultations with the Senior Vice President for Sustainability & HSE. In the case of a major incident (category 4), the unit at which it occurred reports it directly to the E.ON SE Management Board member responsible for the respective unit and to the board member responsible for HSE within 24 hours.\n\nE.ON has been a member of EV100 since 2018, a global initiative that brings together companies committed to accelerating the transition to EVs and to making electric transport the new normal by 2030. In 2020 the initiative made more progress toward this objective: its members put a total of more than 80,000 EVs on the street and installed nearly 10,000 charging stations. In support of EV100, E.ON\u2019s offices and facilities have about 2,280 charging points for employees, guests, and customers; 1,350 of the charging points were added in 2020. Furthermore, we aim for all of our vehicles under 3.5 metric tonnes and at least half of those between 3.5 and 7.5 metric tonnes to be EVs by 2030, where technically feasible and cost-effective. In 2020 we added 273 EVs to our company fleets, giving us a total of more than 1,300 EVs company-wide, with over 1,000 of them in Germany. In addition, we\u2019ll continue installing charging infrastructure at our own facilities and communicate the change to our customers. We\u2019re working on a detailed plan to reach our goals. The E.ON Car Policy, which was revised in 2019 and 2020, places much greater emphasis on climate protection and environmental friendliness. [GRI 103-2/3]\n\nProgress and measures in 2020\nAmid the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 and the challenges it posed to our employees, customers, and communities \u2013 we continued to make progress in managing and minimising our environmental impact.\n\nActivities for staycationers\nThe Covid-19 pandemic impelled many families to spend their 2020 summer vacation at home. Lechwerke (LEW), an E.ON energy provider and grid operator in south-central Germany, responded by organising a series of nature walks on topics such as bats, wild herbs, and river ecosystems. The activities, which were suitable for children and adults of all ages, were designed to reinforce awareness of nature conservancy and climate protection. Social distancing rules were observed at all times.\n\nLess paper, more trees\nE.ON\u2019s mission is to partner with customers to make tomorrow better. One small way we do this is by encouraging customers across our markets to switch to electronic billing, which conserves paper. In 2020 E.ON Romania gave its customers extra encouragement: for each customer that opted for paperless billing in September and October, we planted a tree in a forest in Mure\u0219 and Suceava counties in north-central Romania. Trees provide oxygen, sequester carbon, and create habitats for animals and other plants. As a result of the campaign, we planted 18,000 trees covering a total area of about 3.5 hectares.\n\nAir bee and bee\nPollination can be essential for food production. Without pollinating insects, there would be no apples, oranges, tomatoes, strawberries, or vegetable oil. The declining population of wild bees and other pollinators is therefore a global concern. E.ON Energidistribution, an E.ON DSO in Sweden, decided to do its part to protect wild bee populations. In consultation with county administrative boards, it identified substations near areas where pollinators need support. Next, bee hotels (small wall-mounted wooden boxes) and bee beds (patches of sand and sandy ground) were installed at several substations to provide nesting places for solitary wild bees, bumblebees, and other pollinating insects. Also, nectar- and pollen-rich flowers were planted on the grounds of substations in areas with less abundant food sources for the insects. In 2021 E.ON Energidistribution will continue to partner with public authorities and other stakeholders to help protect pollinators and, ideally, increase their numbers. Similarly, Hansewerk, an E.ON DSO in northern Germany, has an\nongoing programme to transform grassy landscapes around its facilities into wildflower meadows to support wild bees. In 2020, it created 2.1 hectares of such meadows.\n\n**Environmental Network**\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020 around 35 employees from 11 E.ON companies in Germany formed the E.ON Environmental Network (EEN), a forum for sharing information on operational environmental issues, environmental management, sustainability as well as related legislation, standards, and benchmarks. In addition, employees at E.ON companies in six other countries took steps to form a European Environmental Network with the same objectives. In the years ahead, we intend to increase the number of such networks. The EEN brings together experts from our network and customer solutions businesses. The innogy integration has enriched our knowledge base on environmental management and broadened our perspectives. The EEN works closely with the HSE and Sustainability teams and meets on a quarterly basis, if necessary using virtual presence technology, as was the case in 2020.\n\n**Green power for U.K. businesses too**\n\nAs part of our commitment to a sustainable and renewable future, in 2019 E.ON UK began supplying all 3.3 million of its residential customers with 100 per cent certified renewable electricity at no extra cost. In 2020 we extended this offer to eligible small businesses. They can now also get renewables-backed electricity when they renew their contract with us. Sustainable energy for everyone, at no extra cost: this was likely one of the reasons why the 2020 Uswitch Energy Awards said E.ON UK provided the \u201cBest green services\u201d and \u201cBest value for money\u201d among larger suppliers.\n\n**Energy consumption within the organisation**\n\nE.ON consumed 240 million GJ of energy in 2020, 12 million GJ more than in 2019 (which didn\u2019t include innogy). The increase reflects the innogy integration. To reduce the electricity consumed by our buildings, in 2018 we set the target of making them all carbon-neutral by 2030 (see \u201cGoals and performance review\u201d).\n\n**Environmental incidents**\n\nE.ON had two serious incidents in 2020. One took place at H\u00e4ndel\u00f6verket, a combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plant in Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden. In September a pile of wood chips used as biomass fuel for the plant caught fire. The plant\u2019s crew and the fire department quickly extinguished the fire. No one was hurt, and the plant was able to continue operating safely because the fire was at no time close to the building in which it is housed. We conducted a root-cause analysis to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The other incident happened at our asset management station in \u00d6rebr\u00f6, Sweden. In February fuel from a storage tank leaked inside the work area. Samples were taken from water located in the immediate vicinity to check its pH level. The pH level was found to have surpassed the allowable threshold. In line with the best practice to resolve such situations, citric acid was added to the water to decrease its pH level.\n\n**Savings delivered by emission-reduction projects**\n\nWe regularly carry out projects to reduce our own carbon emissions. In 2020 these projects delivered over 24,625 metric tonnes of CO\u2082e savings. This primarily reflects the innogy integration, which led to an additional number of projects. Also, our regional units purchased more green power.\n\n**Avoiding and recycling waste**\n\nWe always try to avoid creating waste and, when this isn\u2019t feasible, to recover as much of it as we can. If neither avoidance nor recovery is possible, we ensure that waste is disposed of correctly and responsibly. Our operating business generates hazardous and non-hazardous waste, as does the retirement of some assets, such as the dismantling of our nuclear power stations in Germany.\nE.ON\u2019s total non-hazardous waste decreased from 454.3 kilotonnes in 2019 to 373.8 kilotonnes in 2020. This can be attributed to our UK business, which had a decrease in activities. E.ON recovered 83.3 per cent of its non-hazardous waste.\n\nWe produced 138.2 metric tonnes of hazardous waste in 2020, around 16 metric tonnes more than in 2019. We recovered 68.7 per cent of it. The increase can be partly attributed to ashes and slag from our new facility in H\u00f6gbytorp outside Stockholm, which was only partly operational in 2019.\n\nFossil-fuelled power plants emit nitric oxide (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and dust. This type of power generation is no longer a core E.ON business. We therefore no longer consider it a key indicator. We now focus on small-scale, embedded generation units. Our NOx, SO2, and dust emissions are mostly attributable to small-scale gas-fired CHP plants and larger plants for district heat networks. NOx emissions rose due to the integration of innogy, but this had no impact on the SO2 and dust emissions.\n\nResponsible water management\n\nWater is a vital resource and one that\u2019s becoming scarcer in some parts of the world. Many companies are therefore placing greater emphasis on identifying and managing water risks in their operations and supply chains. The same applies to investors and their portfolios. E.ON considers its water risks to be low for three main reasons. First, after spinning off its large-scale fossil-fuelled power generation business in 2016, E.ON no longer uses large quantities of cooling water in its operations (our PreussenElektra unit, which operates three nuclear power stations in Germany that will be shut down by year-end 2022, is a temporary exception). Second, our research indicates that the overall water risks in the European countries in which E.ON is active are low to intermediate and, according to trend scenarios, are predicted to remain so. Third, due to the profile and locations of our suppliers, our supply chain does not, from today\u2019s perspective, pose any discernible water risks.\n\nThe integration of innogy and its affiliates has brought new operations into the E.ON Group. In 2020 we began to assess these operations\u2019 environmental impact, including their water use. The findings of this assessment, along with the data collected for our 2020 reporting, may affect the materiality of water use for E.ON\u2019s future environmental management and reporting.\nNon-Core Business: Water management at PreussenElektra:\nThe nuclear power plants (NPPs) in Germany operated by our subsidiary PreussenElektra (PEL) represent our material consumption and use of water.\n\nPEL\u2019s plants use water for cooling and processes. PEL is committed to using water efficiently and sustainably and to maintaining high quality in the rivers from which its plants withdraw water. It also strives continually to use less. PEL complies with all laws and regulations regarding water withdrawal and discharge. It protects aquatic flora and fauna by using mechanical purification processes instead of biocides and by constantly monitoring the temperature of discharge water. PEL also expects its contractors to use water sparingly and has binding water-management provisions in its agreements with them. Below is a three-year overview of how much water PEL has withdrawn, discharged, and consumed.\n\nPEL\u2019s water balance\n\n| Million cubic meters | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fresh water withdrawal| 2,186.4| 2,106.8| 2,316.0|\n| Fresh water discharge | 2,140.0| 2,059.6| 2,278.3|\n| Fresh water consumption | 46.4   | 47.3   | 37.7   |\n\nPEL withdrew 2,186.4 million cubic meters of fresh water in 2020, 79.6 million cubic meters more than in 2019. PEL uses fresh water, almost all of which comes from rivers, mainly as cooling water. The need for cooling water depends on power output. Because output was higher in 2020 than in 2019, so was water consumption. PEL returned 97.8 per cent of withdrawn water to its source.\n\nNon-Core Business: Safe handling of radioactive waste\nPEL is responsible for the safe and reliable operation and dismantling of its NPPs. Both activities result in radioactive waste. We\u2019re well aware of the high responsibility that is associated with both.\n\nThe Law on the Reorganisation of Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal (Entsorgungs\u00fcbergangsgesetz, or Ents\u00dcG) and the contract to finance the costs of the nuclear-energy phase-out between the German federal government and German NPP operators stipulate the division of responsibility for nuclear-waste interim storage and final disposal and its financing.\n\nOur aim is to minimise the amount as well as the volume of radioactive waste. We do this in part by separating it from uncontaminated waste and by subjecting it to certain treatments that reduce its volume. The nuclear industry distinguishes between radioactive waste that generates negligible heat \u2013 low-level waste (LLW) and intermediate-level waste (ILW) \u2013 and waste that generates high heat \u2013 high-level waste (HLW):\n\n- LLW and ILW account for the largest amount of radioactive waste in terms of both weight and volume. Examples of LLW include protective clothing, cleaning equipment, tools, and building rubble from plant control areas. ILW includes, in particular, the reactor pressure vessel\u2019s near-core mounting parts. Together, both waste categories contain less than one percent of an NPP\u2019s total radioactivity\n- HLW contains more than 99 per cent of an NPP\u2019s total radioactivity and consists primarily of the fission products of uranium in the irradiated fuel assemblies.\n\nNPP operators package LLW and ILW safely and according to approved standards. After regulatory certification, packaged LLW and ILW becomes the responsibility of the German federal government. Konrad repository for LLW and ILW is currently being built by BGE, the German Federal Company for Radioactive Waste Disposal. BGE expects Konrad to be commissioned in 2027.\n\nAs for HLW, irradiated fuel assemblies are placed in approved transport and storage containers and stored safely in interim storage facilities at the NPPs. Under the Law on the Reorganisation of Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal, the interim storage facilities and containers of irradiated fuel assemblies became the property and responsibility of the federal government effective 1 January 2019. Fuel assemblies will remain in the interim storage facilities until Germany has a state-owned receiving facility or repository for HLW. When\nthis will happen is unclear. The responsibility for final disposal lies with the federal government.\n\nThe Law on the Reorganisation of Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal stipulated a change in the operational responsibility for defined LLW and ILW storage facilities. Consequently, federal authorities are responsible for PEL\u2019s LLW and ILW storage facilities \u2013 Lager f\u00fcr radioaktive Abf\u00e4lle Stade, Transportbereitstellungshalle W\u00fcrgassen, Bereitstellungshalle Grafenrheinfeld, Lager f\u00fcr radioaktive Abf\u00e4lle Unterweser and Lager Unterweser \u2013 effective 1 January 2020.\n\nRadioactive waste (metric tonnes)\n\n| Year | Low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste | High-level radioactive waste |\n|------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2020 | 129.0                                       | 684.0                       |\n| 2019 | 136.0                                       | 536.0                       |\n| 2018 | 116.0                                       | 313.9                       |\n\nFor 2020 PEL submitted notification for 148.0 metric tonnes more LLW and ILW than for 2019. As expected, the amount of waste increased due to dismantling projects in which dismantled plant components were declared as radioactive waste. HLW declined by 7 metric tonnes year on year because fewer fuel assemblies were finally discharged.\nCare for people and communities\n\n66\nOccupational health and safety\n\n74\nDiversity and inclusion\n\n78\nWorking conditions and employee development\n\n84\nData protection and product safety\n\n88\nBusiness resilience management\n\n90\nCloseup on: Covid-19\n2020 Highlights\n\nDuring critical phases of the Covid-19 pandemic, a daily status report for all employees was posted on the company intranet. It provided an overview of infection rates at the national, state, and local level, the latest government-imposed restrictions, and the situation within E.ON regarding infection and quarantine rates.\n\nIn 2020 E.ON conducted Be The Human Firewall, a campaign that highlighted our employees\u2019 crucial role in cyber defence. Employees could download an app that conveyed information on cybersecurity in an entertaining way.\n\nWe developed and adopted a new Group People Strategy in 2020. It sets four People Priorities for the entire group: Future of Work, Diversity & Inclusion, Sustainability, and Leadership.\n\nSocial\n\nWe engage with our customers, our employees, and a range of other stakeholders. To achieve lasting success, we need to foster a work environment in which our employees are safe, feel good, and can deliver their best performance.\n\nWe held digital events throughout 2020 to increase employees\u2019 health knowledge and promote their well-being. The events included workshops on a healthy diet, workout videos, and resilience training to help employees deal with stress.\n\nWe conducted a company-wide communications campaign in 2020 to coincide with International Day of Tolerance (16 November). It consisted of video testimonials and interviews with employees highlighting LGBT+, gender, age, disability, and other facets of diversity at E.ON.\nOur vision for health and safety (H&S) is for E.ON to have a caring culture. This encompasses ensuring our employees\u2019 safety in the workplace, promoting their health, and also supporting their mental well-being. The first imperative for a caring organisation is to keep its people safe. Every accident, even a minor one, can endanger our employees\u2019 health, while those that could occur in our operating business have the potential to dramatically alter employees\u2019 lives and those of their family. We therefore require everyone at E.ON to comply with our stringent safety standards at all times. This is particularly true for our employees and contractors who work on our power grids, gas pipelines, and other industrial facilities or install rooftop solar panels. Caring also encompasses empowering our employees to live healthy, well-balanced lives and actively promoting their overall sense of well-being. In 2020, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, all three aspects\u2014safety, health, and well-being\u2014took on even greater significance. The pandemic posed challenges but also created opportunities for us to bring our caring culture to life. For example, to safeguard our employees\u2019 health we made masks compulsory in our offices and facilities well before such policies applied to public places. We also swiftly established rules to provide extra protection to employees in at-risk groups.\nWe also strive to foster our employees\u2019 health, including their mental health. For example, we offer them help in coping with the increased demands and anxiety that can be caused by digitalisation, corporate restructuring, and other types of change, including those resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. Finally, we address the needs of an ageing workforce and take targeted action to maintain our people\u2019s ability to work. [\u2192 GRI 103-1, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\n\nOur approach\n\nOur approach to H&S is proactive and preventive and has long been firmly embedded in our corporate culture as well as our organisational setup, policies, and procedures. By signing the D\u00fcsseldorf Statement on the Seoul Declaration on Safety and Health at Work and the Luxembourg Declaration on Workplace Health Promotion in 2009, we pledged to promote a culture of prevention.\n\nOur vision for occupational H&S is zero harm. For us, this means taking all preventive measures to reduce the risk of major harm to people to zero. This applies to our employees as well as contractor employees who work on our behalf. In order to ensure systematic and effective compliance as well continual improvement, we require, with few exceptions, all units to have in place a certified occupational H&S management system that meets international standards. To ensure ongoing compliance, these systems are audited on an annual basis by our own auditing departments and by independent auditors. Our procurement policies classify work activities by their riskiness and stipulate the requirements contractors must meet for each activity. To be hired to do field work for our network business, for example, a contractor must have a certified H&S management system. We also take a range of steps to minimise the risk of safety issues, including among our contractors. For example, our project managers and H&S experts conduct inspections on a regular basis to identify hazards and risks and to define controls. E.ON and contractor employees attend joint H&S induction meetings, talks, and briefings. In some cases, we provide contractor employees with H&S instruction and advanced training. The lessons learned from an accident investigation or information from outside sources may trigger other actions, such as reviewing the risk assessments of specific units, facilities, and contractors and adjusting established processes.\n\nWe strive to actively promote our employees\u2019 well-being and enable them to maintain their performance and employability well into the future. In particular, we try to prevent the main health conditions that most frequently result in unfitness for work. Our health management includes designing and providing health services (such as flu vaccinations) as well as target-group-specific measures to maintain health. They typically address health issues that are relevant to all our employees or individual target groups. Issues include general health maintenance, nutrition, exercise, mental health, stress management, addiction prevention, and healthy leadership. We promote them by means of information leaflets, presentations, training sessions, and a variety of digital formats. Our use of the latter increased significantly in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNon-E.ON employees, such as consultants or independent auditors working at one of our offices, may participate in general prevention measures, such as Health Days. E.ON employees can participate in specific prevention measures (such as free flu vaccination or colorectal and skin cancer screening), consult company doctors, utilise the services of the employee assistance programme, and use company fitness facilities. For certain prevention measures, former innogy units and E.ON collaborated for the first time this year: In 2020, for example, E.ON and innogy employees in Germany could arrange for a colorectal cancer test for them and their partner at a reduced price. To continually improve the effectiveness of our measures, to learn from positive experiences, and not to repeat mistakes, our Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) organisation shares information, ideas, and best practices across the new E.ON. For example, we have a number of E.ON-innogy and group-wide discussion forums devoted to specific H&S issues. There are also predefined processes for using Connect, our corporate intranet, to share the lessons learned from incidents. [\u2192 GRI 103-2, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nWe\u2019re committed to protecting people and the environment. Because the approaches and systems for doing both well are similar, we\u2019ve combined environmental management and occupational H&S management in a single HSE organisation. The E.ON Management Board and the management of our units are responsible for our HSE performance, which includes compliance as well as improvement. They set our strategic objectives and adopt policies to promote continual improvement. They\u2019re supported and advised by the HSE division at Corporate Functions, the E.ON HSE Council, and employee representatives. The council is composed of senior executives and employee representatives from different business areas and countries. It meets at least three times a year and is chaired by the member of the E.ON Management\nBoard responsible for HSE. Our units have their own HSE councils and expert teams as well. They define specifications and design plans to ensure that their unit meets our standards.\n\nFurthermore, we intend to place even more emphasis on health by reactivating the International Health Experts Team. Sharing knowledge and experiences between countries will, we believe, improve the new E.ON\u2019s health policies. Also, this team is intended to serve as a catalyst for improvement and innovation with regard to health issues.\n\nGuidelines and policies\nIn 2018 we adopted the E.ON Health, Safety, Environment & Climate Protection Policy Statement, which supersedes our Health, Safety and Environment Policy Statement from 2013. The statement now encompasses climate protection and treats energy management (efficiency) as an aspect of this. It also articulates our zero-tolerance approach to accidents and work-related diseases: we\u2019re committed to ensuring the safety of our employees, customers, and contractors in all work processes at all times and to continually improving these processes as well as our work environment and workplace design. We aspire to be an employer of choice for health management and to foster a work environment that protects and promotes our employees\u2019 physical and mental well-being.\n\nOur Sustainability & HSE Function Policy defines HSE roles, responsibilities, management approaches, and reporting channels. It sets minimum requirements and management tools needed to prevent physical and mental harm in the workplace. It also requires all our operating units to have in place an occupational H&S management system certified to ISO 45001, an internationally recognised standard for such systems (ISO 45001 replaced OHSAS 18001). Under this standard, contractors who work for us are indirectly covered by our management systems. In 2020 the coverage rate was 87 per cent. In addition, the People Guideline on HSE clearly and succinctly conveys our HSE aspirations and states our expectation that all employees embrace HSE on the job. It also describes our three Safety FIRST principles, which together encompass the mindset and behaviours necessary to prevent accidents. The guideline contains extra tasks for managers, because they take the lead in delivering on our commitment to continual improvement in our HSE performance.\n\nAn updated group standard for incident management took effect in mid-2018 and applies to our contractors as well. Its purpose is to establish consistent rules for classifying, investigating, analysing, and reporting HSE incidents and for sharing what we learn from them. It complements PRISMA, our IT solution for incident management, which is described below under \u201cSpecific actions.\u201d The standard was revised in 2019 to enhance consistency across the group.\n\nA revised group standard on HSE management expectations took effect in 2019. It defines five risk-management aspects that we believe require special attention by management and HSE experts, in particular to help to prevent major harm and to foster a caring culture: HSE leadership and engagement as well as identification, evaluation, control, and monitoring. It also contains many examples of our subsidiaries\u2019 risk-management processes. One of these is the Independent Review of Integrity and Safety (IRIS) tool, which E.ON UK uses to identify potential risks in new customer solutions.\n\nIn 2015 management and the Group Works Council concluded the Group Health Agreement for our employees in Germany. Its purpose is to foster a healthy work environment and promote the health of all employees. It defines four action areas: occupational health management, addiction prevention and intervention, occupational integration management, and employee counselling. We revised it in 2018 to reflect organisational changes following the Uniper spinoff.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019ve adopted procurement policies and standards that require our suppliers to pledge to meet minimum standards for HSE.\n\nIn 2020 we developed and adopted a standard for HSE risk management. It defines the minimum requirements for identifying, analysing, evaluating, addressing, and monitoring HSE risks and opportunities. Its purpose is to ensure shared understanding and to establish an overarching framework for managing HSE risks, including sustainability risks. It was published group-wide in December 2020 and will take effect on 1 January 2021.\nSpecific actions\n\nCorporate Functions oversees strategic H&S training sessions, such as the training provided to the E.ON Group\u2019s top 100 leaders, programmes for senior managers in our operating business, and training for staff who conduct incident investigations (such as root-cause analysis). Our units conduct their own operational H&S training and other training required by law.\n\nPRISMA (Platform for Reporting on Incident and Sustainability Management and Audits) is the main component of our online incident management system. It\u2019s an integrated solution that supports the reporting and management of HSE incidents. It enables us to reach more users, report and manage data better, and increase transparency, which we believe helps prevent incidents. All E.ON units use PRISMA. In 2020 we took steps for all former innogy units to use PRISMA from 2021 onward. PRISMA has five categories of incidents. They range from 0 (low) to 4 (major). Our HSE Standard on Incident Management requires units to use PRISMA to report category 4 incidents to the HSE division at Corporate Functions within 24 hours. Employees must report all incidents, regardless of their severity, via PRISMA. No employee needs to fear retribution for reporting an incident. In addition, their personal data are always protected and can only be accessed by specific, limited user groups. We systematically investigate and analyse all incidents and use the findings to take preventive action. In particular, sharing lessons learned from incidents has become a key focus of our management efforts. If employees or contractors who find themselves in a work situation that they believe is potentially dangerous, they have clear instructions to suspend work immediately and, if necessary, leave the area. They are also instructed to alert their colleagues to potentially dangerous situations. Employees and contractors have the unwavering support of all levels of management including the E.ON Management Board to look after themselves and their colleagues. They therefore need fear no retribution for suspending potentially unsafe work or reporting an incident via PRISMA.\n\nSafety walks give senior managers the opportunity to see our workplaces up close and to talk directly with employees, deepening their understanding of H&S risks and issues. PRISMA includes a downloadable app (Go, See & Talk) that makes safety walks easier for managers to conduct. It contains the right questions to ask for each type of workplace, including questions on a workplace\u2019s safety culture and health issues. It also has blank fields for managers\u2019 own questions. Managers also use the app to submit the answers they received, their own observations, as well as photos and documents. The information is automatically entered into PRISMA and becomes part of our storehouse of data for further analysis. Safety walks and dialogue with employees are essential aspects of our senior managers\u2019 responsibility to play a leadership role in H&S. We added new features to the app in 2020 and made it available to innogy managers.\n\nAlongside familiarising our employees with H&S rules and regulations, some of which are highly technical, we actively motivate them to embrace safe work practices and involve them directly in the process. One example is Connect, our corporate social media platform, on which the HSE team has its own channel to communicate with employees across the company. Furthermore, employees are encouraged to post their feedback and suggestions, creating an ongoing dialogue. The purpose is to spur them to rethink their actions, preferences, and expectations regarding H&S and to stimulate independent thinking and action in our organisation. In addition, their feedback provides our HSE departments with new insights into employees\u2019 mindset.\n\nIn addition, we thoroughly train our lead investigators to examine fatal and other severe incidents. Training includes methodologies for comprehensive investigations of root causes (barrier-based systematic analysis) as well as intercultural competence, communication skills, and other ancillary topics. This is an ongoing activity across the E.ON Group. As part of the innogy integration, we refined our processes and the toolbox for conducting sound root-cause analyses. The processes and the tool box will also be adopted in a corporate standard in 2021.\n\nWe offer free safe-driving training to employees at almost all units in all countries. The purpose is to reduce accidents and ensure that our employees drive safely on the job and off. Traffic accidents that occur while an employee is working for the company are subject to the same procedures for reporting, analysis, and information sharing as any workplace incident. The number of at-work traffic accidents in 2020 was 70 percent lower than in 2019. The improvement may reflect, among other factors, such as a decrease in at-work traffic due to Covid-19, a positive effect from the employee-awareness training agreed on by the top 100 in 2019.\n\nEmployees who have questions or concerns about their physical or mental health can contact our employee assistance programme (EAP). EAP is a free, independent, and strictly confidential health-advisory and life-coaching service available in multiple languages to our employees in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Hungary. We have similar programmes in other countries where we operate. Alongside the EAP, we offer employees one-on-one psycho-social counselling.\nAlso, there are voluntary functions at E.ON. These include social counsellors and addiction support as well as Ergo Health Scouts, who provide advice on ergonomics.\n\nManagers in Germany are offered training on healthy management techniques to help our employees cope with stress. Training was conducted digitally in 2020 to ensure social distancing during the pandemic. The subject matter includes stress reduction, mental health issues, and ergonomic tips aimed at improving our workplaces\u2019 ergonomic design. Our employees in Germany had free access to online advisors who supported them in making their workspace \u2013 including their home office \u2013 as ergonomic as possible.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic was a source of uncertainty for employees. The HSE division supported them by communicating its availability and openness to discuss issues of concern. Furthermore, all line managers were provided with information materials, which included comprehensive recommendations, guidelines, and FAQs on, for example, the safety plans for individual facilities. Information was distributed by email, the corporate intranet, and online Board Chats. The aim of all measures was to ensure a safe and caring workplace and to avoid infections.\n\nGoals and performance review\n\nOur units develop their own H&S improvement plans, which set H&S targets for one or more years. Many units set annual targets for combined TRIF. But our main focus is on targets that help us to reach our goal of zero accidents. In addition, in 2018 the E.ON Management Board defined a set of four personal H&S targets for the top 100 leaders who report directly to them. The programme was continued in 2019 and again in 2020, when innogy\u2019s top executives joined it. Its purpose is to further embed our caring culture ambition and bring it to life. In 2020 top executives again participated in H&S upskilling workshops and a company-wide zero level measurement to assess E.ON\u2019s H&S cultural maturity. Those actions reinforced our top 100 executives\u2019 awareness of their personal targets and led to an increase in their activities related to them. We believe that having our top 100 executives initiate the transformation of our H&S culture has been effective. For example, the rate of severe incidents declined by almost 50 per cent compared with 2019.\n\nThe E.ON Management Board is informed about severe incidents, developments relating to accidents, and related measures and programmes by means of monthly reports from HSE and periodic consultations with the Senior Vice President for Sustainability & HSE. Our units report major incidents directly to the Management Board within 24 hours. We carefully review performance indicators for lost time, accidents, and dangerous situations. The purpose is to understand the causes of accidents, take action to prevent them, and conduct risk analyses. If safety data indicate that a unit may not be meeting our standards, Group HSE provides advice and support in order to improve the unit\u2019s performance. In addition, Group Audit may conduct an HSE audit of the unit.\n\nThe findings of the incident investigations and HSE audits completed in 2020 show that our HSE management systems are largely effective. Most of the deficiencies identified were rectified without delay. However, there remains work to do to ensure that all new or revised policies and processes are fully documented and disseminated. This relates in particular to H&S rules at our distribution system operators (DSOs) in Germany. At some E.ON units outside Germany we found isolated safety deficiencies that could put employees, contractors, and members of the public at risk. The deficiencies were prioritised and gradually rectified. The audits found that there was a general need to continually reinforce employees\u2019 and contractors\u2019 awareness of their responsibility to look after themselves and each other and to speak up immediately if they perceive a potential safety risk. On balance, we\u2019ve seen a steady improvement in recent years. We view audits \u2013 and the findings and recommendations they yield \u2013 as opportunities to foster continuous improvement.\n\nWe believe that a strong HSE culture will make E.ON more successful. In 2020 we began developing a new HSE strategy that shows our aim to position E.ON as one of the leading HSE companies. Also, HSE has always been a top priority for the E.ON Management Board. In 2020 the Management Board and the HSE Council therefore decided to set personal H&S targets for the top 100 managers and to endorse E.ON\u2019s HSE strategy (\u201cRoadmap 2021-23\u201d), which contains underlying targets for its operating units, including H&S. The targets for top managers and units are individual. Their purpose is to further reduce the frequency of serious incidents and fatalities (SIF), with the ultimate aim of reaching zero harm in the near future. The changes will take effect on 1 January 2021. They make it even more explicit that E.ON\u2019s HSE performance is integral to its long-term success.\nWe assess the success of our approach to health management by asking ourselves a simple question: \u201cDid we reach out to our staff with information on health and prevention and motivate them to participate in our programmes?\u201d Our health programmes are often tailored to the needs of specific target groups, which increases employees\u2019 willingness to participate. Our DSOs in Germany, for example, focus in particular on reaching out to their employees aged 50 and older and to the employees at their field offices. For many of our health programmes, we calculate the return on investment by comparing their cost with the absences they prevent. More generally, we strive to foster a work environment in which all employees feel comfortable, valued, and supported. This includes placing a special emphasis on mental health. We provide communications on the importance of managing stress and recognising the signs of mental health issues, tips and training for reducing stress, self-assessments, and direct support, including through the EAP. [\u2192 GRI 103-2/3, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\n\nProgress and measures in 2020\n\nIn 2020 E.ON UK took part in the Mind Workplace Well-being Index, which assesses whether there are gaps between an organisation\u2019s approach to creating a mentally healthy workplace and staff\u2019s perception of it. About 2,000 employees completed the survey. Mind\u2019s assessment report awarded E.ON UK the Gold standard for the second time (the first was in 2019). This is Mind\u2019s highest rating of workplace well-being.\n\nDigital health campaign\n\nWe held digital events throughout 2020 to support employees\u2019 well-being and to increase their health knowledge even while many were working remotely owing to the pandemic. The events included workshops on a healthy diet, workout videos to promote health and fitness at home, and resilience training to deal with stress. Many events were available in both German and English.\n\nWell-being Warrior Programme\n\nAs part of E.ON UK\u2019s participation in the Mind Workplace Well-being Index, in January more than 70 of its employees volunteered to serve as Well-being Warriors in its offices and in the field. They spread the messages of well-being across the organisation in person as well as virtually in light of the pandemic. They also served as signposts to colleagues in need of support. Over 700 hours of Well-being Warrior activities were carried out in the first six months of the year. The programme will continue in 2021.\n\nPulse Check\n\nOur most important goal is to create a work environment that ensures the health and safety of everyone who works with and for us. In 2020 the Pulse Check, our annual employee survey, therefore included a series of questions on our caring culture. We asked the employees for their thoughts on where we could still improve our safety culture as well as our support for employees\u2019 health and well-being in general. We will draw on the answers to these questions to design additional H&S initiatives to be conducted in 2021.\nZERO Major Harm Programme\nThe purpose of this programme, which was initiated in 2019, is to make E.ON an industry leader in HSE and to address the topic more prominently across the organisation. It has four focus areas: learning from incidents so that they don\u2019t happen again, improving key HSE processes, enhancing E.ON\u2019s knowledge, and improving data management. The programme\u2019s achievements in 2020 included the development and adoption of a group-wide standard on HSE risk management, which comes into force on 1 January 2021. Also, we\u2019re working on a group-wide standard for contractor management. Supported by outside experts, the Group HSE team developed a methodology for spot checks, an HSE format to analyse a unit\u2019s HSE performance. It focuses on coaching and collaboration rather than finicky inspection. The first step is for a unit to fill out a questionnaire, which it then discusses with Group HSE in a virtual presence meeting before Group HSE representatives visit the unit\u2019s facilities. Development will continue in 2021 and incorporate peer reviews and a self-assessment tool.\n\n96.3 per cent\nOur employees\u2019 health rate in 2020. It reflects the number of days actually worked in relation to agreed-on work time. The 2020 figure was again high (2019: 96.0 per cent).\n\nAccident statistics\nTotal recordable injury frequency (TRIF) is our KPI for safety. It measures the number of recorded work-related injuries and illnesses (excluding first aid accidents) per million hours of work. We\u2019ve calculated it since 2010 (employee TRIF) and included contractor employees\u2019 in our safety performance since 2011 (combined TRIF).\n\nEmployee TRIF by segment\n\n| Segment                  | 2020 |\n|--------------------------|------|\n| Energy Networks          | 3.1  |\n| Customer Solutions       | 1.7  |\n| Corporate Functions/Other| 1.7  |\n| Core business            | 2.4  |\n| Non-Core-Business        | 1.0  |\n| E.ON Group               | 2.4  |\n\n1 TRIF measures the number of reported fatalities and occupational injuries and illnesses per million hours of work. It includes injuries that occur during work-related travel that result in lost time or no lost time and/or that lead to medical treatment, restricted work, or work at a substitute work station.\n\nEmployee TRIF of 2.4 in 2020 was similar to the 2019 figure (2.5). Contractor TRIF decreased from 2.5 in 2019 to 2.3 in 2020. Combined TRIF declined from 2.5 to 2.3, which we view as reaffirmation of the measures we are taking to prevent serious accidents. Comparability with the prior year is limited, since innogy was included for only part of 2019.\n\nFatal accidents at work\nRegrettably, three contractors and two E.ON employees died in workplace accidents in 2020. Two of the contractor employees and one of the E.ON employees received a fatal electric shock. The third contractor employee sustained fatal injuries while unloading a truck, the other E.ON employee from a fall. Each fatal accident is thoroughly investigated so that we understand the exact course of events that led to it. Identifying root causes enables us to take the measures necessary to prevent similar accidents in future. E.ON has seen the organisation\u2019s awareness of occupational safety steadily increase for several years while its accident rates have declined. Nevertheless, serious and even fatal accidents still occur. E.ON cannot and will not accept this. It has therefore further intensified its efforts to prevent accidents. For example, in mid-2020 E.ON subsidiary Westnetz launched a large-scale occupational safety programme. The program is supported by one of the world\u2019s most recognized consulting firms for safety and operational risk management. The programme\u2019s task force established several work streams and initiated in-house and outside analyses to shed light both cultural as well as technical/process-related issues.\nLost-time injury frequency (LTIF) measures work-related accidents resulting in lost working hours. Employee LTIF of 1.5 improved (2019: 1.9), whereas contractor LTIF of 1.7 was at the prior-year level (2019: 1.7).\n\nSerious incidents and fatalities (SIF) measures accidents and incidents that have caused serious or fatal injuries and that surpass a predefined severity threshold. Combined SIF was 0.12 in 2020 (0.20 in 2019), a year-on-year decline of about 18 per cent.\n\nThe near-miss frequency rate (NMFR) records unplanned events that had the potential to cause damage but did not. We analyse how and why near misses happened and then put in place controls to minimise or eliminate similar risks in the future. We actively encourage employees to report near misses so that we can continually improve our safety performance. Our NMFR was 19.0 in 2020.\n\nNon-core business: Occupational health and safety at PreussenElektra:\nOur subsidiary PreussenElektra (PEL) is responsible for the operation, decommissioning, and dismantling of our nuclear power plants (NPPs). Its top priorities in all these activities are the health and safety of employees \u2013 its own as well as contractors\u2019 \u2013 and environmental protection. PEL is fully integrated into our safety organisation and embraces our high standards. Its extensive experience in plant operations and decommissioning helps it to further optimise its H&S processes and procedures.\n\nIn early 2020 PEL instituted a variety of measures to safeguard its employees and its contractors from infection with Covid-19. It continually adjusted the protective measures in response to the infection rate among the general population in the vicinity of its NPPs and headquarters. These systematic measures made a significant contribution to safe operations and safe dismantling and were likely in part responsible for the very low infection rate among PEL employees and contractors.\nFostering an organisation that embraces \u2013 and benefits from \u2013 difference\n\nSociety is diverse. So is our workforce. It\u2019s made up of people of different nationalities, genders, generations, ethnicities, cultures, religions, sexual orientations and identities, and physical and mental abilities. We want to encourage this diversity and benefit from it. When people with different backgrounds, abilities, and personalities interact, good ideas are often the result. We therefore encourage diversity and equal opportunity across our company. Changing an organisational culture takes time. But we\u2019re working hard to identify and take all the steps necessary to become a leader in diversity. [GRI 103-1]\nOur approach\n\nIn 2020 we made diversity one of the focus dimensions of our new sustainability strategy. Diversity and inclusion are essential elements of our vision and values. We want to ensure equal opportunity for all our employees and to make the most of their individual differences. Diversity fosters creativity and innovation, and we therefore take a targeted approach to promoting it. E.ON signed the German Diversity Charter in 2008, publicly affirming our long-standing commitment to a tolerant and inclusive corporate culture. The new E.ON now also continues the former innogy\u2019s membership in the German Diversity Charter. In 2020 we participated in initiatives organised by the Diversity Charter, such as those in conjunction with International Women\u2019s Day and German Diversity Day, and observed these days across our organisation.\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nWe believe that diversity is crucial for a successful work environment. The challenges of achieving this in practice vary by country. In line with our mostly decentralised approach to HR, each of our units therefore addresses diversity in its particular cultural context. This gives them the opportunity to address local challenges and develop country-specific programmes. Diversity is managed by Group HR/Executive HR together with a network of HR professionals that meets, both in person and using virtual presence technology, on a regular basis. Supported by Group HR/Executive HR, the E.ON Management Board is responsible for setting diversity targets for E.ON as a whole and its units. Some targets may reflect the laws of a particular country. It is our units\u2019 responsibility to design action plans to meet their targets.\n\nGuidelines and policies\n\nThe Diversity and Inclusion Declaration, signed by the E.ON Management Board and E.ON SE Works Council in 2016, aims to create a diverse and inclusive work environment that empowers all employees to realise their potential. In April 2018 the E.ON Management Board, the E.ON SE Works Council, and the Group representation for severely disabled persons signed the Shared Understanding of Implementing Inclusion at E.ON, creating a strong foundation for integrating people with disabilities into our organisation.\n\nSpecific actions\n\nWe promote diversity and equal opportunity through a variety of programmes. In Germany we conduct a mentoring programme to prepare female employees for management positions. Participants are mentored by a senior manager who \u2013 together with their immediate supervisor \u2013 offers advice and support regarding career-related questions. Also, E.ON is continuing innogy\u2019s membership in Initiate Women into Leadership (IWIL), a non-profit initiative based in Germany in which business leaders from a variety of industries serve as mentors for a group of highly qualified young women. IWIL works with mentors and mentees in Germany and other countries. innogy was one of IWIL\u2019s first members.\n\nE.ON and innogy\u2019s women\u2019s networks merged in 2019 to form a company-wide network called women@E.ON. With about 300 active members in 11 countries, the network aims to empower women to help to shape the new E.ON and be an important part of its success, to increase the visibility of women, and to promote networking.\n\nIn addition, E.ON is a member of numerous national and international networks and initiatives dedicated to different aspects of diversity. Examples include Catalyst, a global non-profit focusing on empowering and accelerating women in business, and the European Round Table (ERT), which brings together CEOs and other top executives from around 55 of Europe\u2019s largest industrial and technology companies. ERT is committed to creating a strong, open, and competitive Europe through the promotion of sustainable growth, jobs, and prosperity for all. E.ON also participated, for the second time, in the Diversity Challenge of the German Diversity Charter, an initiative for young employees to promote diversity in their workplace. innogy participated for the first time in 2018.\n\nIn 2020 the CEO Awards for Diversity and Inclusion were conferred for the second time. The awards pay tribute to individuals and activities across E.ON that are making a real difference in the areas of diversity and inclusion. Employees were nominated in the following three categories: diversity champion, diversity initiatives, and best network group. They were judged by a panel including CEO Johannes Teyssen, the Senior Vice President HR/Executive HR, and members of the SE Works Council. The winners included the chair and co-founder of the E.ON UK\u2019s parents network (who was recognised for her exemplary support for parents among E.ON employees in the United Kingdom) the employees of innogy metering and Westnetz metering for their initiative DIVERSITY@INNOGY METERING, and the aforementioned\nWomen@E.ON network for its long-standing commitment to empowering female colleagues. [GRI 103-2]\n\nGoals and performance review\nE.ON SE and E.ON companies in Germany must comply with the German Law for the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private Sector and the Public Sector, which took effect on 1 May 2015. We meet all of the law\u2019s requirements. Pursuant to the law, in 2017 we set new targets for the next five-year period, which ends on 30 June 2022. Our targets are for women to occupy 30 per cent of the positions in the first level of management below the E.ON Management Board and 35 per cent of the positions in the second level. At year-end 2020, the proportion of women in first and second levels of management below the Management Board was 35 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively. In addition, in December 2016 the E.ON Supervisory Board resolved that by year-end 2021 women will make up 20 per cent of the E.ON Management Board. Beyond compliance with statutory requirements, in 2017 E.ON voluntarily set a company-wide target for increasing the proportion of women across management positions in all countries and business units. The aim is for this proportion to reflect the overall proportion of women in the workforce (32 per cent). Group HR monitors progress toward these targets twice a year and reports it to the E.ON Management Board. We disclose the figures at year-end for E.ON companies in Germany and for the E.ON Group as a whole here and in our Annual Report.\n\nProportion of women managers\n\n| Year | E.ON in Germany | E.ON Group |\n|------|----------------|------------|\n| 2020 | 17             | 21         |\n| 2019 | 17             | 21         |\n| 2018 | 16             | 21         |\n\nE.ON aims to provide equal pay to women and men for comparable jobs at all group companies. Due to our decentralised management approach, we do not collect data or assess the pay gap for the group as a whole. However, we do monitor pay by gender among our top 100 leaders. This showed that in 2020 women in the top 100 earned no less than men. In 2020 we again reported our gender pay gap in the United Kingdom, as required by law.\n\nIn 2020 we designed a process to help foster a diversity culture at E.ON. We started by identifying the diversity dimensions that we would like to address. E.ON has so far focussed on gender, age, ethnicity, and disability. We now want to broaden our focus to include sexual orientation and parental status, for which we\u2019ll select and set meaningful KPIs aligned with our People Strategy. Each business unit will have specific targets and will develop and implement initiatives to meet them. We intend to monitor our progress on a regular basis and to analyse and report the results. [GRI 103-2/3]\nProgress and measures in 2020\n\nIn 2020 we started initiatives to learn how we can make E.ON an even more open and inclusive employer and to embrace E.ON\u2019s existing diversity.\n\nExecutive survey on gender diversity\n\nIn 2020 E.ON conducted a group-wide quantitative survey of female executives. The purpose was to gain deeper insights into the status quo of, and possible levers for, gender diversity at E.ON. A workshop on gender diversity involving the E.ON Management Board, other executives, and employees from different hierarchical levels and business units was held at the end of November 2020. The next step will be to use the feedback from the survey and workshop to identify action areas and to design and implement measures to address them. We expect implementation to begin in the first half of 2021.\n\nProportion of female employees by segment\n\n| Segment                  | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Energy Networks          | 22   | 22\u00b2  | 21   |\n| Customer Solutions       | 44   | 44   | 43   |\n| Corporate Functions/Other| 49   | 49\u00b2  | 49   |\n| Core businesses          | 33   | 33\u00b2  | 34\u00b2  |\n| Non-Core Business        | 14   | 13   | 13   |\n| E.ON Group               | 32   | 33   | 32   |\n\n1Includes board members, managing directors, and apprentices.\n2Prior-year figures have been adjusted.\n3Figure includes 19.7 per cent female workforce of Renewables segment in 2018.\n\nAt year-end 2020, women accounted for 32 per cent of our workforce, one percentage point less than in the prior year.\n\nWeek for Tolerance\n\nWe conducted Week for Tolerance, an international communications campaign on Connect, E.ON\u2019s corporate intranet, and on E.ON\u2019s social media channels. It coincided with International Day of Tolerance, commemorated on 16 November. Input was provided from Group Diversity and Group Communications and consisted of video testimonials and interviews of employees highlighting LGBT+, gender, age, disability, and other facets of diversity at E.ON.\n\nProportion of severely disabled employees in Germany\n\n| Segment                  | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Energy Networks          | 5.4  | 5.5\u00b2 | 5.9  |\n| Customer Solutions       | 4.0  | 3.8\u00b2 | 3.7  |\n| Corporate Functions/Other| 5.6  | 4.9\u00b2 | 3.2  |\n| Core businesses          | 5.2  | 5.1  | 5.0\u00b3 |\n| Non-Core Business        | 8.6  | 8.2  | 7.6  |\n| E.ON Group               | 5.4  | 5.3  | 5.3  |\n\n1Excludes board members and managing directors.\n2Prior-year figures have been adjusted.\n3Figure includes 1.2 per cent disabled employees from Renewables segment in 2018.\n\nAt the end of 2020, 2,016 people with severe disabilities or the equivalent were employed at E.ON companies in Germany (2019: 2,027).\n\n115\n\nThe number of nationalities our workforce in 2020 (2019: 115).\nThe mission of human resources (HR) is to enable E.ON to maximise its competitive advantages in the energy market and to support E.ON\u2019s vision: \u201cImproving people\u2019s lives.\u201d We do this by attracting the right people and putting them in the right roles at the right time. By identifying, developing, and retaining talented employees whom we consider to be our future experts and leaders. And by helping all our people to realise their potential and be fit for a future that will be increasingly digital. Doing this amid a continually evolving business environment, rapid technological change, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the innogy integration poses challenges for our HR management. [\u2192 GRI 103-1]\nOur approach\n\nPeople make the difference for EON\u2019s success. The Group People Strategy (GPS) guides our transformation and long-term success amid a rapidly changing world. It ensures that we are capable of achieving our goals and work in an environment that enables us to perform at our best. In 2020 we developed and adopted a new GPS called GPS@E.ON. It sets four People Priorities for the entire group: Future of Work, Diversity & Inclusion, Sustainability, and Leadership. GPS@E.ON sets the direction and provides the compass for group-wide people activities, all of which need to contribute to the People Priorities and their key ambitions. It will be brought to life by group-wide and unit-level people activities, especially by means of existing strategic initiatives. This process will be flexible and modular to reflect differences between business units.\n\nOur group-wide competency model, Grow@E.ON, for example, continues to be a core part of the GPS and is a key enabler of professional development. Grow@E.ON is integrated into all our HR and people processes. It helps to ensure that we recruit, retain, place in the right roles, and develop the people who will continue to propel E.ON\u2019s success. We offer a range of career paths. This ensures that we\u2019re an attractive employer to people who wish to pursue a specialist or a generalist career. Grow@E.ON was updated in 2020 to reflect E.ON and innogy\u2019s integration process, the updated E.ON Story, HSE topics, and our digital transformation. As part of the integration process, all new leaders and employees will be informed about, and trained in line with, Grow@E.ON.\n\nA shared corporate culture is crucial for the success of the new E.ON and the integration process. The new E.ON will inevitably develop its own culture. We intend to actively shape this process instead of simply letting it happen. The foundation has already been laid. The shared corporate culture is based on five new corporate values that guide employees\u2019 actions as well as their key ambitions. It will be brought to life by group-wide and unit-level people activities, especially by means of existing strategic initiatives. This process will be flexible and modular to reflect differences between business units.\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nWith the exception of HR management for our company\u2019s top 100 executives, which is performed centrally by Group HR/Executive HR (see \u201cGuidelines and policies\u201d below), HR management at E.ON is largely decentralised. Each unit has its own mechanisms to identify and develop talent and to conduct succession planning. It is a management responsibility to ensure that all new employees receive a company orientation as well as training on important topics like health and safety. For this purpose, the units may use standardised E.ON eLearning modules. Each unit decides which of these and other virtual learning tools as well as courses and training programmes to offer in its training catalogue.\n\nGuidelines and policies\n\nThe Group Policy FP-09 (Functional Policy Group HR/Executive HR) specifies the responsibilities of Group HR/Executive HR and the tasks exclusive to each. Executive HR for example, is responsible for the complete life-cycle management of the top 100 leaders. The policy details the company-wide instruments for which Group HR is responsible. These include executive compensation tools including the grading framework, Grow@E.ON, the employee value proposition (EVP), group diversity targets, global learning content, the expat policy, the pension framework, and global HR IT governance.\n\nThe E.ON People Commitments, developed by HR in consultation with the European Works Council and approved by the E.ON Management Board in late 2017, establish twelve principles that articulate our values and our standards for treating our employees in the context of decentralisation processes. The principles are binding for the entire E.ON Group. We provide support to E.ON units so that they can adopt the principles in a way that reflects their particular legal, cultural, and business environment.\n\nE.ON has a number of additional HR policies and guidelines. Examples include agreements on remote working and flexible work arrangements, such as sabbaticals, part-time work, special holidays, and so forth. Our International Transfer Policy governs the temporary foreign deployment of our employees. The average length of a foreign deployment is between two and three years.\n\nSpecific actions\n\nWe take action in a variety of areas to make working at E.ON attractive. Flexible work arrangements have been part of our corporate culture for many years. In 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic underscored the value of these arrangements, which were part of why we were able to respond swiftly and maintain business continuity. We also have programmes to support our\nemployees when they face challenges outside work, such as when a family member suffers an illness. For example, our employees in Germany have cost-free access to a wide variety of services from reputable providers. The services range from counselling for stress and addiction issues to home care for older or invalid family members. Employees who are sick for more than six weeks during a twelve-month period have access to reintegration assistance. Our benefits include company pension plans and employer-funded accident insurance. Both full- and part-time employees generally receive any benefits that are offered. Another area important to our employer attractiveness is training. In general, all employees receive onboarding, HSE training, functional training relevant for their role, talent development, and leadership training. The business units pay for their employees\u2019 training. In addition, employees have access to a wide variety of self-directed eLearning modules. At E.ON, we believe that the most effective way for our people to learn is through experience. Our approach to training is 70-20-10: 70 per cent of learning happens on the job, 20 per cent through people and social interaction, and 10 per cent through programmes like eLearning, seminars, and formal training.\n\nWe\u2019ve conducted an annual employee survey since 2014 to find out how our people feel about their job, their supervisor, the work atmosphere in their unit, and other topics. The former innogy employees have participated in the surveys since 2018. These surveys, which we call Pulse Checks, include questions about wider corporate matters \u2013 such as the E.ON Story, our values, our brand, and the degree to which our employees understand them \u2013 as well as current issues, such as, in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic. Employees\u2019 feedback on our handling of the pandemic was very positive. Our most important goal is to create a work environment that ensures the health and safety of everyone who works with and for us. The 2020 survey therefore included a series of questions on our caring culture. We asked the employees for their thoughts on where we could still improve our safety culture as well as our support for employees\u2019 health and well-being in general. We will draw on the answers to these questions to design additional H&S initiatives to be conducted in 2021.\n\nEmployee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) has been an important aspect of these surveys since 2017. It measures employees\u2019 willingness to recommend E.ON as an employer. Since then, eNPS has improved from -4 to +25. We analyse survey feedback carefully to identify areas where we may need to improve. More than 28,000 colleagues took part in the 2020 survey and submitted more than 22,000 comments on E.ON and the current situation. The participation rate improved by 2 percentage points year on year to 44 per cent. The findings for the E.ON Group as a whole are published on Connect, our corporate intranet. Employees are also informed about the findings for their particular business unit as well as any measures that may be implemented in response. Alongside the survey, employees have other opportunities to offer feedback, including during live online chats with a member of the E.ON Management Board that are held multiple times each year.\n\nOur mechanism for recruiting executives applies across E.ON and aims to optimise the filling of executive positions, make the recruitment process more transparent, and ensure equal opportunity. Recruitment of top executives is conducted by the Group/Executive HR team. A biweekly placement conference is held for this purpose at which HR representatives from around the company gather, in person or, more often, virtually, to discuss potential candidates for open positions directly below the top executive level. In addition, we conduct an annual management review and regularly exchange views on talented employees and their development needs at job-family-specific talent board meetings, which we introduced in 2020. These forums help us to ensure the ongoing professional development of talented employees and executives and create transparency about our current talent situation and our needs for the future.\n\nWe help people to launch their careers. We do so by offering apprenticeships in a wide variety of vocations as well as internships, work-study arrangements, and other programmes. Examples include local training initiatives in Germany, which use school projects, internships, and training courses to assist young people in making the transition from secondary school to employment. E.ON Graduate Programmes (EGP) recruit highly qualified university graduates for an 18-24-month programme during which they receive a broad overview of our business through three to six deployments in different E.ON units and departments. We offer EGPs in Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania. Due to the restructuring of the U.K. business, the EGP is on hold in the United Kingdom until 2021. In Germany we offer a job starter and a work-study programme.\n\nFeedback is essential for empowering our people to perform at their best and for identifying opportunities to develop their skills. That\u2019s why we provide employees with periodic performance and career-development reviews. Each unit is responsible for ensuring compliance with our company-wide rules regarding feedback.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2]\nGoals and performance review\nOur approach to HR is decentralised: 80 per cent of our HR activities are defined and implemented by our units, just 20 per cent by Corporate Functions. The units and Corporate Functions collaborate in a number of areas aligned to the four People Priorities in our GPS@E.ON.\n\nWe want to retain our people (and their expertise) and enable them to grow professionally. One of our objectives is therefore to develop our employees so that we can fill management positions internally. Our placement conferences have a shared platform to systematically track how many women participated in the application process and who ultimately got the job. The platform also allows us to monitor whether selected candidates are from our development pool and reflect our diversity target. In addition, the aforementioned talent boards focus not only on talent identification and succession but also, in recent years, on diversity issues, such as increasing the proportion of women and employees from minority groups in our leadership pipeline. E.ON enhanced its commitment to these issues in 2020 by making diversity a priority in its new GPS. The talent boards will enable us to evaluate the effectiveness of our talent management once enough data have been collected.\n\nProgress and measures in 2020\nIn 2020 we continued taking steps to remain, and to be perceived as, an attractive employer for current employees and for talented people whom we would like to attract. These steps included working to become more tech-savvy and to make our processes more digital.\n\nTalentry: employee recommendation programme\nIn 2020 E.ON expanded its digital recruitment processes by introducing Talentry, an employee recommendation programme. The aim is to strengthen our employer brand, increase the efficiency of our recruitment, and reward colleagues who recommend E.ON as an employer of choice. If we hire someone recommended by an employee, the employee receives monetary compensation as our thanks. After a successful pilot phase in 2020, Talentry will be available at seven of our units in Germany from the beginning of 2021 onward and will be expanded to other countries during the year.\n\nDeveloping employer brand campaign for digital and tech\nTo attract increasingly hard-to-find digital and tech talent, we decided to develop a campaign to improve E.ON\u2019s positioning as a digital and innovative employer. The process began in March 2020 with an analysis of what the target audience values in an employer. In the second half of the year we contacted digital stakeholders to find flagship projects and role models for the campaign\u2019s creative phase. We expect to launch the campaign in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nDigital capability upskilling\nIn consultation with employee representatives, in 2020 we launched a project designed to ensure that all employees are on board for E.ON\u2019s digital journey. The project, which we trialled in 2019, has four main areas: transparency about future skill requirements, update of people strategy and processes, a digital culture and future leadership framework, and leader employee development activities. As of year-end 2020, it had 18 sub-projects (global and local) covering issues such as digital skills, digital mindset, new ways of working, and specialist knowledge.\n\nManaging our employees\u2019 pension assets responsibly\nSustainability guides the management of our pension assets as well. This happens explicitly (for example, by drawing on the Norwegian State Pension Fund\u2019s research and certain embargo lists to avoid some investments) and implicitly (by selecting asset managers that properly take ESG factors into\naccount in their investment decision process). In addition, we\u2019re currently adjusting and harmonising our investment approach in line with the latest corporate and market ESG developments.\n\n**Employees by segment**\n\n| Segment                  | 2020  | 2019  | 2018  |\n|--------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Energy Networks          | 40,764| 38,814| 17,896|\n| Customer Solutions       | 31,463| 33,038| 19,692|\n| Corporate Functions/Other| 4,029 | 5,218 | 2,447 |\n| Core businesses          | 76,256| 77,070| 41,409|\n| Non-Core Business        | 1,870 | 1,878 | 1,893 |\n| E.ON Group               | 78,126| 78,948| 43,302|\n\n1Headcount, excluding board members, managing directors, and apprentices.\n2Prior-year figures have been adjusted.\n3Figure includes 1,374 employees of the former Renewables segment.\n\n**Apprentices in Germany**\n\n| Segment                  | 2020  | 2019  | 2018  | 2020  | 2019  | 2018  |\n|--------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Energy Networks          | 2,098 | 2,149 | 818   | 7.6   | 8.0   | 8.4   |\n| Customer Solutions       | 59    | 61    | 24    | 0.8   | 0.8   | 0.9   |\n| Corporate Functions/Other| 199   | 206   | 14    | 5.4   | 4.4   | 0.7   |\n| Core businesses          | 2,356 | 2,416 | 856   | 6.2   | 6.2   | 5.8   |\n| Non-Core Business        | 39    | 40    | 43    | 2.0   | 2.1   | 2.2   |\n| E.ON Group               | 2,395 | 2,456 | 899   | 6.0   | 6.0   | 5.4   |\n\n1Prior-year figures have been adjusted.\n\nAt the end of the year, we had a total of 2,395 apprentices and work-study students in Germany. This corresponds to an apprenticeship ratio of 6 per cent. Of apprentices who completed their training in 2020, 575 of 661 were given a permanent or temporary employment contract, which is a very high hiring rate of 87 per cent (2019: 240 of 262, or 92 per cent). This is one of the ways we\u2019re addressing the shortage of skilled workers.\n\n**New employee hires and turnover rate**\n\nWe hired 6,962 new employees in the reporting period. Our voluntary turnover rate in 2020 was 3.5 per cent, including board members, managing directors, and apprentices (2019: 4.6).\nAt year-end 2020, the average age of E.ON employees in Germany was 42, as in the previous year. This is comparable with the average age at other DAX 30 companies. The age distribution of our workforce reflects the demographic trend of working-age people in Germany. In 2020 around 20 per cent of our employees were under the age of 31, 50 per cent between 31 and 50, and around 30 per cent older than 50.\nOur approach\n\nWe take the lawful and confidential handling of our customers\u2019, enterprise partners\u2019, and employees\u2019 data very seriously. \u201cPersonal data\u201d means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect in 2018, and the data protection laws in different countries provide individuals with rights to control and protect the use of their personal data. In 2020 the former innogy\u2019s data protection organisation was integrated into E.ON\u2019s organisation. In the course of the innogy integration, we revised our Data Protection Management System (DPMS), related group directives, policies, guidelines, and templates. We disseminated these documents in newsletters and Connect, our corporate intranet. The DPMS is based on IDW PS980, an audit standard for compliance management systems. The DPMS provides guidance on data protection issues and is intended to ensure that we take a structured, coordinated, and consistent approach to data protection across the E.ON Group. The DPMS has been audited by a law firm. In 2020 internal audits were conducted of several E.ON units regarding the status of their data protection management. These audits also confirmed that our approach to data protection is largely compliant with GDPR requirements. In addition, we studied major data breach cases that became public and, where necessary, used these insights to further improve our own data protection and IT security measures and to harden our IT infrastructure.\n\nIn 2020 we continued to take all steps necessary to comply with the GDPR with regard to our business partners, stakeholders, customers, and other relevant parties, including those affected by the innogy transaction. These steps included revising data protection contracts and other documents, informing all relevant parties (thereby enabling them to exercise their rights to delete, rectify, and transfer data), and reviewing the data breach process. Data protection is an ongoing task amid rapidly evolving technologies and practices. Using the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) method enables us to continually improve these processes (for more information, see \u201cGoals and performance review\u201d below). These activities will continue in 2021.\n\nWe process the personal data of customers, employees, business partners, suppliers as well as other individuals. In addition to protecting personal data, we conduct robust cybersecurity at our energy networks and customer solutions businesses in order to efficiently protect our systems and data regardless of where they\u2019re accessed from, which devices are used, and where the data are processed. Safeguarding all company information \u2013 in oral, written, and digital form \u2013 is crucial in order to prevent damage to our competitive position, brand, and reputation.\n\nWe offer our customers digital solutions (like the E.ON Home app) as well as a steadily expanding range of products installed at their premises, such as solar and battery storage systems, heating systems (including heat pumps and boilers), and electric-vehicle charging points. Ensuring that these products are safe is essential for us to protect our customers\u2019 health, retain their trust, and continue our successful partnership with them. [\u2192 GRI 103-1]\nTo protect all company information, we have in place an Information Security Management System (ISMS) based on ISO 2700x, a widely recognised international standard for information security. The ISMS is certified for those parts of the organisation where this is mandatory. We work hard to ensure and maintain the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our information resources. This includes monitoring our infrastructure, vulnerabilities, and threats as well as detecting and responding to security events like cyberattacks. We have a cybersecurity strategy and designed a roadmap for implementing it. Items on the roadmap include awareness, identity and access management, cloud security, and new detection and prevention capabilities.\n\nWe extend our high standards for occupational health and safety to the products we offer our customers. We set uniform standards to ensure that our products are safe throughout their life cycle, from development to recycling. We comply fully with all applicable safety laws and regulations. If, in the case of innovative products, current laws and regulations lag behind the state of the art, we meet more stringent safety standards. Due to confidentiality constraints and the sensitivity of such data, we cannot provide information about complaints concerning data breaches, whether these complaints were substantiated or not.\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nEach of our units is responsible for complying with the GDPR. The minimum standard they must meet is to implement our DPMS (if necessary, in an adapted form). We have in place an appropriate set of processes, including those to fulfil the data subject\u2019s rights (for information, deletion, and so forth), to consider data protection requirements in relation to our suppliers and other business partners, and to report and handle personal data breaches. We assess a breach\u2019s severity using a method developed by the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA). This set of processes also provides guidance to our units, which have put in place the required processes in their organisations as well. In addition, we analysed major data breach cases that became public and, where necessary, used the lessons learned from them to further improve our own data protection and IT security and to harden our IT infrastructure.\n\nThe units are responsible for dealing with all data protection issues related to their business and with the claims that individuals address to them pursuant to the individuals\u2019 rights under the GDPR, such as information, rectification, deletion, and data portability. In addition, our units\u2019 systems and policies must comply with the data protection laws and regulations of the country or countries where they operate. Where required by law, the units have appointed Data Protection Officers (DPOs). The requirements for appointing DPOs vary by country. The DPOs share information with each other on a regular basis and report regularly to our Chief DPO in particular on the following dimensions of data protection: the rights of the data subject, relations to third parties, company documentation, and correspondence with supervisory authorities.\n\nOur Chief DPO is responsible for data protection issues at the corporate level. His responsibilities include coordinating data protection activities across E.ON. He also reports periodically to the Cybersecurity and Data Protection Council, which includes two Management Board members and, if the need arises, the entire Management Board and the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit and Risk Committee. In addition, internal stakeholders are regularly informed about relevant developments in data protection, such as legislation, technology, decisions issued by regulatory agencies, and so forth. This information is disseminated by email or, where appropriate, through internal communications channels, including Connect, our corporate intranet.\n\nIn 2020 the Information Security division was renamed Cybersecurity and was reassigned to the CEO\u2019s area of responsibility. Cybersecurity protects technology and information and prevents them from having an adverse impact on E.ON\u2019s business and customers. Its tasks include designing a group-wide cybersecurity strategy, monitoring its implementation, and coordinating the cybersecurity organisation across E.ON. Our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reports directly to the CEO and works closely with the IT function\u2019s Chief Digital Technology Officer. This organisational setup ensures that if a serious issue arises, the CEO of E.ON SE is informed immediately and that all second-line-of-defence functions (Data Protection, Compliance, Cybersecurity) belong to the same reporting line. Our units have designated Information Security Officers who report to our CISO, as well as their unit\u2019s board, any relevant issues arising in their organisations.\n\nOur regional units know their customers, their products, and the local market conditions and requirements. Consequently, their Product Development teams take the lead in product safety, supported by their unit\u2019s HSE department. In these activities they work closely with, and receive support and guidance from, several divisions and departments at Corporate Functions, primarily B2C/B2SME Solution Management, Innovation, HSE, and Sustainability. B2C has its own product safety and compliance team.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2, GRI 102-11]\nGuidelines and policies\nOur Data Protection Policy defines roles and responsibilities in a uniform manner across the whole E.ON Group.\n\nIn 2020 the E.ON Information Security Standards, which were introduced in 2018, became the cybersecurity rules for the entire new E.ON. To facilitate certification, the standards reflect ISO 2700x requirements. Our People Guideline summarises the main cybersecurity rules that are relevant for all employees. This guideline was made available to employees of the former innogy from October 2020 onward. Using the ISO 2700x framework will make it easier for employees to design or operate new IT or operational technology solutions with the level of cybersecurity we want.\n\nSpecific actions\nOur employees receive training in data protection every two to three years. New employees typically receive such training in their first year. The training is part of the onboarding process in almost all countries where E.ON operates. In addition, individual departments and teams \u2013 such as call centres and sales organisations \u2013 provide training to meet their special data protection requirements. We have an eLearning module to familiarise our employees with the GDPR\u2019s rules. As of year-end 2020, more than 88 per cent of our employees had completed it.\n\nWe use eLearning, phishing simulations, and in-house workshops such as live hacking demonstrations to familiarise our employees with cybersecurity risks, their obligation to keep confidential company information secure, and the proper way to handle such information. In 2020 the phishing awareness campaign involved simulated phishing emails being sent to employees on several days during the year. Furthermore, we enhanced our penetration-testing capacity in order to make our applications and services more robust against cyberattacks.\n\nWe take a variety of steps to address health and safety issues across the life cycle of our products. During product development we closely monitor emerging issues and comply with current standards and guidelines. Our regional units test all market-ready products, including E-Mobility solutions, for CE conformity in their own test labs or have them tested in our main test lab in Essen or by outside testing firms. This provides us with a comprehensive assessment of the risks, their likelihood, and other potential impacts. Prior to hiring, contractors who install and maintain products on our behalf must undergo prequalification to ensure that they meet our standards and values. As part of this process, we evaluate not only the contractors themselves but also their products to ensure they meet specific standards. In addition, we engage in ongoing dialogue with our contractors and train them to ensure that they adhere to all requirements and the latest technical standards. Safety training, for example, is mandatory for all installers of our solar and battery solutions in Germany. If a product has a safety related problem we need to be able to recall it immediately. We therefore check and track all hardware product changes so that we can contact our customers immediately in the event of safety-related problems. We work to improve these processes on an ongoing basis.\n\nWhenever we are the product manufacturer or deemed to be such, we are legally obliged to comply with a number of requirements. These include the installation of a system ensuring the traceability of these products and a concept for corrective measures. In case of safety-related issues, we immediately inform the appropriate market surveillance agency about the issue and our intended corrective measures, such as withdrawal, warning, and recall. Also, we are obligated to perform necessary corrective actions.\n\nGoals and performance review\nOur DPMS uses the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) method, which helps us to plan, implement, manage, and improve our processes continuously, which is mandatory under the GDPR. The PDCA cycle includes permanently monitoring the DPMS\u2019s effectiveness, proactively and repeatedly looking for any potential blind spots, and taking action if the need for improvement arises. Our successful performance of these tasks in 2020 was confirmed by a law firm; we intend to repeat such outside reviews in the years ahead. Similarly, the reviews conducted by our internal audit team in 2020 again found no significant shortcomings with the DPMS. In addition, all open procedures with data protection authorities were closed without any sanctions being imposed on E.ON Group companies. These are among the reasons why we consider the existing DPMS to be appropriate and effective. Where required, changes to the DPMS are approved by the Cybersecurity and Data Protection Council.\n\nWe assess the maturity of our ISMS domains regularly and report the assessment to E.ON\u2019s Cybersecurity and Data Protection Council on a quarterly basis. If we identify deficiencies or areas for improvement, we adjust our cybersecurity roadmaps accordingly.\nWe document product safety incidents at the unit whose product was involved and at the corporate level. The investigation and analysis of such incidents help us to identify their causes and determine how to prevent them in future. We share the insights gained in this process across the relevant departments of our organisation.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\n\nProgress and measures in 2020\n\nHuman Firewall campaign\nIn 2020 E.ON conducted Be The Human Firewall, a campaign highlighting our employees\u2019 crucial role in our cyber defence system. Employees could download the Human Firewall app that conveyed information on cybersecurity in a playful way in order to increase employees\u2019 awareness and knowledge. Human Firewall media contained QR codes that employees could scan to take part in quizzes and potentially win a prize.\n\nCybersecurity Month\nAs innogy did in 2019, in 2020 E.ON for the first time participated in European Cybersecurity Month conducted each October by the European Network and Information Security Agency. Throughout the month, E.ON organised a variety of digital events including live hacking demonstrations, penetration tests, and presentations on the psychology of manipulation, hunting adversaries in big networks, and other topics. The aim was to raise employees\u2019 awareness of how to protect themselves against cyberattacks.\n\nE.ON Bug Bounty\nWe ran the E.ON Bug Bounty campaign in the second half of 2020. Employees were encouraged to report security gaps in applications, servers, and websites and thus to help the Cybersecurity team to combat data misuse and report potential vulnerabilities. Employees received vouchers for an online retailer worth \u20ac50 to \u20ac100 as a reward. The vouchers\u2019 value was doubled during Cybersecurity Month.\nSystematic crisis prevention and management\n\nE.ON works continuously and systematically to prevent a crisis from ever happening. We want to ensure the safety, security, and reliability of our infrastructure and customer solutions. If, despite comprehensive precautions, a crisis occurs, we respond immediately and manage the situation professionally. Much is at stake: the health and safety of our employees and nearby residents, the integrity of the environment, the reliability of the energy supply, and our reputation. In 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic posed serious, unforeseen challenges. In response, we instituted systematic procedures to safeguard our employees and customers. [\u2192 GRI 103-1, \u2192 GRI 103-1]\n\nOur approach\n\nWe thoroughly train our employees, carefully maintain our assets, and operate in accordance with stringent safety and security standards. Nevertheless, we can\u2019t rule out the possibility of a crisis caused by a natural disaster, human error, technical failure, a cyberattack, or other events. Our business resilience management system therefore encompasses a variety of organisational measures to protect E.ON against significant risks. If a crisis occurs, we have in place response plans consisting of rapid, efficient, and precisely defined countermeasures. In addition, we have highly specialised crisis management teams that respond swiftly to resolve crises. We believe that the best way to prevent crises from escalating is to prepare thoroughly for potential crises and to intervene quickly at the first sign of one. The main objective of our crisis prevention and response measures is to safeguard human life, the environment, our business, and our property.\n\nIn the case of a widespread power outage following a natural disaster, some of our network operators have mobile generators to provide temporary emergency power to relief crews, medical facilities, and victim shelters until power is restored. [\u2192 GRI 103-2, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nOur standard procedures for running our business are designed to prevent crises. The Response Centre at Corporate Functions is staffed 24 hours a day by at least two people. In addition, we have a dedicated crisis management organisation consisting of crisis management teams at the operational, business/regional unit, and Group level. The crisis management teams consist of a variety of functions divided into a core team, a support team, and a specialised expert team. The core team guides the crisis management team and is supported by the other two teams. Subject experts are added to a team if their expertise is required. The teams work together closely and have broad powers in the event of a crisis. In addition, they have uninterrupted access to the systems necessary to manage a crisis effectively (such as notification and alarm systems, satellite communications). Corporate Functions and our business/regional units have designated Business Resilience Managers who are responsible for managing our efforts to prevent, identify, assess, respond to, and learn from crisis situations. This includes designing and conducting training and realistic crisis simulations for the crisis management teams around E.ON. Our Business Resilience Managers share information and experience on an ongoing basis. Ultimate responsibility for preventing and managing crises lies with the E.ON Management Board. [\u2192 GRI 103-2, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\nGuidelines and policies\nOur group function policy Business Resilience stipulates that all parts of the company must report severe security issues and crises to the Response Centre without delay. It also requires each unit, in accordance with its business operations and risk profile, to establish, implement, and continuously refine a crisis management organisation that enables the unit to manage unforeseeable, complex, and emerging situations that, potentially, could have a significant impact on its business, assets, stakeholders, and/or reputation. This includes defining a crisis methodology and processes, establishing a crisis management team, ensuring a functioning crisis infrastructure and organisation, and conducting training on a regular basis. As necessary, Corporate Functions provides the units with guidance and support to establish these mechanisms. [\u2192 GRI 103-2, GRI 102-11]\n\nSpecific actions\nWe take a variety of steps to ensure that we\u2019re thoroughly prepared for incidents and crises. For example, each year we conduct two or three crisis management exercises to simulate a power outage, cyberattack, or other crises as realistically as possible. Participation is mandatory for all crisis management team members, who also have to take part in availability tests at least twice a year. The tests\u2019 purpose is to assess our team\u2019s availability and reaction speed at any time of the day or night. In addition, all members of the crisis management team receive training for their specific function. For example, team leaders are trained to lead a team in complex, stressful, time-critical, and uncertain situations. Moreover, crisis simulations often involve several units and business areas in order to practice collaboration, communication, and joint resolution.\n\nDuring normal operations, the Business Resilience function at Corporate Functions consults on a regular basis with other teams (such as physical security and business continuity management) to jointly assess the risk exposure of assets, employees, businesses, and processes and to design effective preventive measures. [\u2192 GRI 102-11]\n\nGoals and performance review\nTo promote continual improvement, the crisis management organisation employs the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle. We assess and document the lessons learned from all crisis management training sessions, simulations, and actual incidents and draw on them to design and implement improvement measures.\n\nThe Business Resilience community across E.ON regularly shares knowledge, best practices, experiences, and lessons learned. The aim is to learn from each other and to achieve a consistently high level of competence in the crisis organisations at all E.ON units, which are our first line of defence in a crisis.\n\nCorporate Business Resilience, supported by the Corporate Audit function, is the second line of defence. Its role is to ensure that all units comply with the minimum requirements of the Business Resilience function policy for crisis management and to make recommendations for improvement. [\u2192 GRI 103-2, GRI 102-11]\n\nCrisis prevention at Non-Core Business\nPreussenElektra (PEL) is only allowed to operate nuclear power plants (NPPs) if it can demonstrate that it has taken all practicable steps to prevent a severe accident. For 2020 this was duly demonstrated to the relevant authorities, such as the Federal Ministry for the Environment, the Reactor Safety Commission, and state-level agencies.\n\nIn 2020 there were no safety-related incidents that significantly affected the safety level at PEL\u2019s NPPs. They remained at the normal long-term safety level. On average, 10 to 15 reportable events per year occur at PEL\u2019s NPPs. PEL headquarters conducts periodic reviews in which it discusses incidents and the findings derived from them with the NPPs that are in operation and those being dismantled. In line with Germany\u2019s nuclear ordinances and regulations, the incidents, findings, and any measures taken in response are communicated to state and federal authorities.\n\nPEL periodically conducts nuclear crisis exercises, notifies Group Crisis Management, and reports their results. The exercises are required by law and in some cases may be organized on short notice by Germany\u2019s nuclear regulatory agency.\nResilience during the pandemic\n\nE.ON\u2019s top priorities during the Covid-19 pandemic were to ensure a secure energy supply as well as the health and safety of employees and customers. Our power, gas, and heat networks, which secure the energy supply in large parts of Europe, continued to run stably throughout 2020, even under particularly challenging conditions. We were able to draw on previously prepared pandemic and crisis plans, which we implemented accordingly. This made it possible to maintain all key functions. The most important measures included strict adherence to hygiene and social-distancing rules as well as the isolation of particularly sensitive work areas, such as network control centres. In addition, technicians who do field work on the network received special equipment to minimise the risk of infection. In many parts of the company, we made arrangements for a large proportion of employees to work from home. This enabled us to ensure the provision of customer service as well.\n\nMany European countries relaxed the restrictions on public life and the economy in the summer of 2020. E.ON too took steps to enable many of its employees to return to their jobs responsibly. However, the number of Covid-19 infections rose across Europe from September to December. This resulted in many cities and regions being classified as high-risk areas, which in such cases led to additional selective restrictions on daily life. Throughout 2020, E.ON continuously analysed the risk situation resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and, where necessary, fine-tuned its response measures. In addition, we temporarily shortened work schedules in some countries, particularly in the United Kingdom.\n\nSafe workplaces\n\nBusiness Resilience, HSE, Legal Affairs, and other departments worked together effectively to manage and coordinate E.ON\u2019s response to the pandemic. We rapidly put in place comprehensive measures to keep E.ON\u2019s workplaces safe. These measures were accompanied by an awareness campaign using a variety of media (intranet posts, posters, stickers). The campaign addressed hygiene and other issues, such as the organisational plans for E.ON offices and facilities regarding social distancing, the restriction of canteen operations, and facility-specific policies. We defined a basic supply of masks, respirators, and disinfectant (including quality checks to detect fakes) to ensure our ability to procure and distribute these materials and devices. We also restricted the maximum capacity of buildings and workspaces to maintain social distancing at all times, procured additional personal protective equipment (including FFP2 and FFP3 masks), mitigated contact risks between employees and customers, and substantially reduced business travel. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness and feasibility of various measures (such as the reliability of mouth and nose protection, rapid-result antibody/antigen tests, and employee temperature checks). For a majority of E.ON employees, their most frequent workplace was their own home. On average, more than 70 per cent of staff worked from home in 2020. We took a variety of steps to make their home offices as safe, productive, and comfortable as possible. Our employees in Germany, for example, had free access to online advisors who supported them in making their home office more ergonomic. The measures we took \u2013 from home office arrangements to protective equipment \u2013 helped keep our people healthy: E.ON employees\u2019 infection rate was much lower than the respective regional rate.\n\nCommunications\n\nEmployee communications were particularly important during the pandemic. During critical phases, a daily status report for all employees was posted on the company intranet. It provided an overview of infection rates at the national, state, and local level, the latest government-imposed restrictions, and the situation within E.ON regarding infection and quarantine rates. We established communications guidelines for both reactive as well as proactive communications to employees and to outside stakeholders (contractors, enterprise partners). Line managers periodically received an updated FAQ document to help them provide the latest information to their teams. The intranet also had a corona content hub where employees could find descriptions of all corona-related measures taken by the E.ON SE crisis management team and a FAQ section. Employees also had the opportunity to address specific questions to a special pandemic email address. E.ON provided a variety of support services...\nto employees and line managers alike, such as counselling, podcasts on issues like mental health, and webinars. A variety of intranet communities addressed topics related to Covid-19 such as daily coping tips. We also offered digital programmes to help employees and their families deal with the pandemic. These included recommendations on mental health or a virtual spring vacation program for children. The aim of the latter was to give parents a break and provide our employees\u2019 kids with pedagogically oriented entertainment. At various times during the year, members of the E.ON Management Board made video statements to talk about the pandemic and its impact on E.ON.\n\nEmployee survey\nIn June 2020 about 2,100 employees, nearly all of them from Germany and the United Kingdom, participated in an anonymous survey on E.ON\u2019s pandemic response. About 96 per cent said they feel E.ON has kept them well informed about the pandemic, around 83 per cent that the company has taken effective measures to safeguard employees\u2019 health. A majority of respondents found it easy to structure their work routine, to work effectively, and to maintain virtual contact with colleagues. About half found little difference between in-person and virtual-presence meetings, whereas 11 per cent felt that the pandemic had adversely affected their work. Our annual employee survey, the Pulse Check, which was conducted in the fourth quarter, also included a number of pandemic-related questions. Employees\u2019 feedback on our handling of the pandemic was very positive.\n\nA special team worked throughout 2020 to assess our response to the pandemic, document the lessons learned, propose ways for E.ON to be better prepared for future pandemics, and identify work practices that we want to retain even after the pandemic. It became evident, for example, that the crisis management team needs additional resources in a longer-term crisis. We therefore provided it with more support staff. In addition, the crisis management and business resilience networks intensified their communications during the pandemic in order to maintain ongoing dialogue between different functions.\nMake sustainability our guiding principle\n\nGovernance\nGovernance\n\nWe view compliance as an absolute must. We can only achieve lasting success if we manage our company ethically, responsibly, and transparently.\n\n2020 Highlights\n\nIn 2020 we made available a new eLearning module to foster a speak-up culture in which employees feel encouraged to openly address their concerns. To foster a listen-up culture, Compliance Officers group-wide received training to identify potential reasons for, and consequences of, employees remaining silent.\n\nE.ON\u2019s Sustainability Council was reorganised in order to further integrate sustainability into the company. A key topic of discussion in 2020 was the company\u2019s new climate targets.\n\nenviaM, an E.ON energy supplier based in eastern Germany, organised a week-long online conference to discuss Germany\u2019s climate policy and its implications for social cohesion. The conference generated 90,000 page views and 3,200 interactions.\n\nNearly 2,200 employees group-wide volunteered for a total of more than 12,000 hours.\n\n6 safety events were held with our contractors in 2020. For example, Bayernwerk, an E.ON distribution system operator in southeast Germany, conducted an online forum in which participants could submit questions by means of a chat function.\nA pacesetter in sustainability and corporate governance\n\nWe\u2019re committed to helping people, companies, and cities across Europe embrace the energy transition and become more sustainable. And to ensuring that we always manage our company responsibly and transparently. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put in place effective organisational structures, clearly assigned roles and responsibilities, and embedded sustainability in our business processes.\nManagement and oversight\n\nCorporate governance refers to the way we manage, monitor, and control our company and its operations. E.ON adopts the two-board system common in Germany. The E.ON Management Board sets the company\u2019s strategic course and exercises management control over its businesses and support functions. The E.ON Supervisory Board advises and monitors the Management Board, appoints its members, and approves E.ON SE and the E.ON Group\u2019s financial statements. In addition, the Supervisory Board\u2019s approval is necessary for some decisions by the Management Board, such as transactions above a certain monetary threshold. At year-end 2020, the E.ON Supervisory Board consisted of fourteen men and six women from a total of eight countries. In accordance with German law, it has an equal number of shareholder and employee representatives. The Corporate Governance Report in our 2020 Annual Report contains detailed information about the roles and responsibilities of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, how they work together, and E.ON\u2019s statement of compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code. The code consists of recommendations and suggestions that constitute the recognised best practices of good corporate governance. These include achieving a reasonable balance between the interests of companies and their shareholders, fostering transparent decision-making by management boards, and ensuring that supervisory boards are independent.\n\nSustainability governance\n\nThe E.ON Management Board defines our sustainability strategy and has overall responsibility for our sustainability performance. In this, as in other matters, it is supported and advised by the Supervisory Board. We\u2019ve designated a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), who oversees the sustainability activities across our company and informs the Management Board about important sustainability initiatives, developments, and key performance indicators on a quarterly basis and, in the case of extraordinary events, on an ad hoc basis. E.ON CEO Johannes Teyssen has been our CSO since the end of 2019.\n\nE.ON\u2019s Sustainability Council, consisting of the CEO and seven Senior Vice Presidents (SVPs), was reorganised at the beginning of 2020 in order to further integrate sustainability into the company. Some SVPs whose areas of responsibility currently have the biggest impact on E.ON\u2019s sustainability performance were added. The aim is to make the council more agile. The council\u2019s composition will be reviewed annually. The council advises the Management Board on sustainability issues. The above-described targets, organisational structures, and measures systematically embed sustainability in the company as a key component of E.ON\u2019s strategy. The council also engages with outside stakeholders and helps us forge partnerships. It reports to the Management Board twice a year and in 2020 met three times. Among the key issues it discussed in 2020 were the company\u2019s climate strategy as part of its new sustainability strategy and non-financial risk assessments.\n\nThe Supervisory Board\u2019s Innovation and Sustainability Committee also provides sustainability advice to the Management Board and to the full Supervisory Board. In 2020 the committee was involved in the development of the new climate targets.\n\nThe Sustainability team at Corporate Functions is involved in all aspects of our sustainability work. Its main tasks are to coordinate the planning and implementation of sustainability initiatives and monitor their progress, collect sustainability data, and conduct our materiality analysis and sustainability reporting. Together with the Sustainability Council, it supports the business units in meeting their sustainability targets. The team also provides advice to employees on sustainability issues and strives to raise awareness across the organisation. In all these tasks it works closely with the Health, Safety and Environment team.\n\nSystematic risk management\n\nEvery business activity involves risks. To mitigate them, we conduct systematic risk management that\u2019s embedded in our workflows. Our Annual Report describes in detail our management system for assessing risks and chances and the measures we take to limit risks. Our risk management system addresses a wide variety of risks. These include legal and regulatory risks, operational and IT risks, finance and treasury risks, strategic risks, as well as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks. In 2020 ESG enterprise risk management focused on climate change and human rights risks. Our ESG risks include fines for violations of the law and damage to our reputation resulting from accidents or power outages. Thanks in large part to the management approaches described in the chapters of this report, at year-end 2020 we had no material reportable risks for non-financial issues.\n**Binding policies and guidelines**\n\nOur guidelines and policies define the framework and minimum standards for our business processes. Group policies apply throughout the E.ON Group. This encompasses all entities in which we hold a majority stake as well as projects and partnerships over which we have operational control. We also require our business partners, suppliers, and contractors to meet our minimum standards. Group policies do not automatically apply to our 50:50 joint ventures. However, they do provide guidance for policies that are adjusted to a joint venture\u2019s particular circumstances. We divide our policies into two types: people and behaviour, organisation and steering.\n\n**People and behaviour**\n\n- **Code of Conduct**\n  - Defines behaviours and values that are important to us. It refers employees to the relevant People Guidelines for more details.\n  - Explain in greater detail what employees need to do to comply with our standards.\n\n- **People Guidelines**\n\n**Organisation and steering**\n\n- **Steering Policy**\n  - Establishes a group-wide organisational setup, describes our steering philosophy, and delegates roles to group functions.\n\n- **Function Policies**\n  - Define the specific tasks and mandatory involvement of group functions; they apply to employees affected by the policy.\n\nThe \u201cManagement approach\u201d section of each chapter of this report contains information about the sustainability policies and guidelines that are relevant for a chapter\u2019s particular topic. The [Sustainability Channel on our corporate website](#) contains a list of our People Guidelines and Function Policies that are relevant for sustainability as well as a downloadable copy of our Code of Conduct.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 102-16](#)\n\nWe endorse internationally accepted ethical, social, and ecological principles like the United Nations\u2019 Global Compact and Sustainable Development Goals and align our company policies and commitments to them. Our [Sustainability Channel](#) contains a list of our commitments.\n\nThe innogy takeover in 2019 didn\u2019t result in E.ON\u2019s guidelines and policies becoming automatically binding for innogy. After revising E.ON\u2019s guidelines in 2020, effective 1 January 2021, we will have a largely uniform set of policies. With a small number of exceptions, these guidelines and policies will apply to all group companies including the former innogy companies.\nMemberships and initiatives\nSustainable development requires the concerted efforts of many different actors. That\u2019s why we work with other companies and with organisations, policymakers, and stakeholders to promote sustainability in Europe and around the world. Below are some of the sustainability initiatives in which we were involved in 2020.\n\nUN Global Compact (since 2005)\nThe UN Global Compact (UNGC) is the largest initiative worldwide for sustainable corporate governance. We support its ten principles and actively engage as a UNGC participant at the global and national level, such as in the German Global Compact.\n\neconsense \u2013 Forum for Sustainable Development of German Business (since 2000)\nFounded in 2000, this network of 39 Germany-based multinational companies is dedicated to promoting sustainability in the companies\u2019 operational practices, corporate strategy, and supply chain. It serves as a forum for sharing knowledge and agreeing on shared positions on sustainability issues. econsense then actively communicates these positions in public discussions. We\u2019ve participated in a variety of econsense working groups focusing on issues such as sustainability in the supply chain, climate and environmental protection, and sustainability performance metrics.\n\nWorld Energy Council (WEC) (since 2006)\nThe WEC is involved in efforts worldwide to promote an affordable, reliable, and environmentally friendly energy supply. Its members include governments, public agencies, corporations, academic and research institutions, and non-governmental organisations. Leonhard Birnbaum, a member of the E.ON Management Board, currently heads the WEC\u2019s European arm.\n\nThe Stakeholder engagement chapter of this report lists a number of other industry networks and trade associations of which we\u2019re a member.\n\nRatings and rankings\nWe welcome outside assessments of our sustainability performance. Independent sustainability ratings and rankings help us to identify our strengths and weaknesses and improve our performance. Our Sustainability Channel shows the latest results.\nEnsuring strict compliance, combating corruption\n\nThe goal of compliance at E.ON is to prevent, detect, and respond to corporate misconduct. It\u2019s therefore our responsibility never to deceive, lie to, or otherwise deliberately harm our customers, business partners, or other stakeholders. Strict compliance with laws and company policies \u2013 the foundation of good corporate governance \u2013 is therefore essential to retain our stakeholders\u2019 trust. Negligence or, worse, deliberate violations not only could lead to fines but also could potentially harm our reputation. Corruption is unacceptable for another reason as well: it leads to decisions being taken for the wrong reasons. It can thus impede progress and innovation, distort competition, and do lasting damage to companies. Anyone at our company guilty of corruption may be subject to fines and criminal prosecution. We closely monitor compliance with laws and our own policies. If violations occur, we deal with them transparently and, if necessary, take disciplinary action. [\u2192 GRI 103-1, GRI 102-11]\nOur approach\n\nWe\u2019re committed to combating corruption in all its manifestations and support national and international efforts directed against it. We also reject it as a member of the UN Global Compact. The E.ON Management Board has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that E.ON conducts its business legally and at all times refrains from criminal practices in achieving its business objectives. For this purpose, it has established a group-wide compliance function whose task is to prevent, detect, and respond to corporate crime.\n\nE.ON has in place a compliance management system (CMS) to mitigate the risk of compliance violations. The CMS is based on a number of widely recognised practices, including the promotion of a compliance culture. This encompasses an active commitment to compliance targets, the identification and analysis of compliance risks, the design of a risk-adequate compliance programme as well as a compliance organisation, and other practices. Due to the integration of innogy\u2019s CMS, an audit in accordance with the IDW Assurance Standard 980 was conducted in 2019 and successfully completed with regard to anti-corruption.\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nPursuant to a group-wide Compliance Function Policy, the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), the Group Compliance team, and the business units\u2019 Compliance Officers are responsible for refining and optimising the CMS on a continual basis. The CCO reports on a quarterly basis to the E.ON Management Board and to the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit and Risk Committee on the status of the CMS\u2019s effectiveness and current developments and incidents. In the event of serious incidents, the Management Board and the Audit and Risk Committee are informed immediately. The same applies to important new laws. Potential violations are investigated centrally by Group Audit and Group Compliance.\n\nGuidelines and policies\n\nBoth our Supplier Code and our Code of Conduct (both of which are available in the languages of all countries in which we operate) focus on our guiding principle, \u201cDoing the right thing.\u201d They provide easy-to-understand guidance for all areas that are of particular concern to us. These include human rights, anti-corruption, fair competition, and compliant relationships with business partners. The Code of Conduct also contains an integrity test that employees can use to check whether their assessment of a situation is in compliance with E.ON principles and values. Every employee in the E.ON Group is obliged to act in accordance with the Code of Conduct\u2019s rules and regulations. The Code is therefore part of our employees\u2019 duties under their employment contract. It\u2019s supplemented by ten group-wide People Guidelines which explain in greater detail how employees can be sure that they\u2019re doing things right.\n\nOne of them is our Anti-Corruption People Guideline, which contains a decision-making scheme that uses the familiar green, amber, and red of traffic lights to indicate when accepting or granting offers or gifts is permissible, potentially problematic, or forbidden. Gratuities (including donations and sponsorships) above a certain threshold, which varies by country, must receive Compliance Officer approval. Particularly strict requirements apply to invitations and gifts from public, elected, or government officials and their representatives. The Code of Conduct clearly states E.ON\u2019s prohibition against company donations to political parties, political candidates, managers of political offices, or representatives of public agencies.\n\nOur Compliance Function Policy establishes basic compliance structures, roles, and responsibilities.\n\nSpecific actions\n\nIn 2020 we continued to make new eLearning courses available to employees group-wide. Courses are tailored to the needs of each unit (see \u201cProgress and measures in 2020\u201d below). Since 2010 all employees have had to complete a Code of Conduct eLearning module on a regular basis. New material was added to the module in 2020. Employees in units without internet access receive this training in an offline format. New managers undergo integrity training, which familiarises them with their obligations regarding compliance.\n\nNew employees must complete a new joiner eLearning module along with the module on the E.ON Code of Conduct. It familiarises them with company rules and whom to contact if they have questions or feel uncertain about a decision. Employees of the former innogy must also complete this training to ensure that they\u2019re aware of the new E.ON\u2019s guidelines. Training is available in a variety of formats: face-to-face classroom training as well as digital and hybrid training.\n\nWe also use a variety of tools to continually assess which of our business areas is or could be exposed to the risk of compliance violations. These tools include compliance risk assessments (CRAs), which are conducted on a regular\nbasis. CRAs employ various methods, ranging from spreadsheet-style questionnaires to personal interviews with executives. Based on the results, we determine whether and which specific measures need to be taken to amend and refine E.ON\u2019s CMS in order to appropriately address any (new) risks identified. In addition, Group Compliance continually engages in dialogue with, and monitors the work of, the units\u2019 Compliance Officers and managers.\n\nIf employees suspect misconduct or a violation of laws or company policies, they\u2019re instructed to report it immediately. If they wish, they may do so anonymously through internal reporting channels or a group-wide whistle-blower hotline, operated by a law firm in all E.ON languages. In 2019 the hotline was published on E.ON\u2019s website, and in 2020 a weblink was included in the updated Supplier Code of Conduct to enable third parties to report misconduct.\n\nE.ON subjects potential suppliers to prequalification, which involves checking their identity and integrity to ensure that they meet our compliance standards. It includes searching media reports for references to a supplier in connection with compliance issues such as corruption and checking official sanction and terrorism lists. In some cases, potential suppliers must also complete a questionnaire, which we evaluate carefully. Prequalification is mandatory for all new suppliers. The Human rights and supplier management chapter provides more information on the supplier onboarding process.\n\nOur Know Your Counterparty (KYC) principle also defines minimum requirements for certain business partners and scenarios, other than suppliers. The KYC check is a state-of-the-art, IT-supported workflow that helps us verify counterparties\u2019 identity and integrity and avoid legal, regulatory, and reputational risks related to compliance issues such as corruption, money-laundering, tax evasion, violation of economic sanctions, and terrorism financing. It is covered in our Know Your Counterparty People Guideline.\n\nGoals and performance review\nThe effectiveness of our CMS is the main indicator of our compliance performance for purposes of management control. All compliance measures, policies, processes, controls, and so forth are assessed and guided by this criterion. The CMS\u2019s effectiveness is also monitored by the E.ON Management Board, the Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit and Risk Committee, and Group Audit. The latter, an independent entity, is our third line of defence for monitoring the CMS. The criteria we use for monitoring effectiveness include assessing whether and how prescribed measures are implemented across E.ON. Special consideration is given to violations that lead to an internal audit. The audit determines whether a violation resulted from negligence or misconduct by an individual or individuals or from shortcomings in the CMS. We use the findings to implement measures to avoid similar incidents in future.\n\nBecause our CMS is consistent throughout E.ON, we follow a uniform roadmap. The purpose of the roadmap and all preventive measure is to ensure that E.ON is a compliant company. All Compliance Officers must present the status of their unit\u2019s compliance roadmap regularly to their board. Presentations must be approved in advance by Group Compliance. Progress along the compliance roadmap was on schedule in 2020.\n\nIn 2020 our annual employee survey included questions about employees\u2019 experience when contacting Group Compliance and their willingness to openly report and discuss unethical behaviour. The feedback indicates that employees generally consider our compliance efforts to be serious and credible.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2/3, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\nProgress and measures in 2020\n\nIn 2020 we continued to improve our compliance and anti-corruption practices and to dialogue on good corporate governance inside E.ON and beyond our organisational borders. Members of our Group Compliance team serve on the boards of a variety of organisations. For instance, at year-end 2020 we were a board member and deputy chairman of the criminal law working group at the German Institute for Compliance (DICO). The mission of this non-profit association is to set standards for compliance, to play a key role in shaping good corporate governance in Germany, and to serve as a network for compliance experts in and outside Germany. For example, E.ON employees played a key role in DICO\u2019s submission of a statement to the Federal Ministry of Justice regarding draft cooperation criminal legislation in Germany and the Federal Ministry of Finance regarding draft legislation on financial integrity in Germany.\n\nPromoting a speak-up and listen-up culture\n\nIn 2020 we made available a new eLearning module to foster a speak-up culture in which employees feel encouraged to openly address their concerns. The content, which was provided by a number of departments at Corporate Functions (Sustainability, Cybersecurity and Data Protection, Compliance), addresses employees\u2019 familiarity with our compass for business decisions, poses compliance questions on hypothetical situations, and clarifies when employees should contact a Compliance Officer. To foster a listen-up culture, Compliance Officers group-wide received training to identify potential reasons for, and consequences of, employees remaining silent.\n\nNumber of compliance notices\n\n| Category                        | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 |\n|---------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Fraud                           | 58   | 57   | 65   |\n| Conflicts of interest           | 6    | 3    | 4    |\n| Other breaches of internal guidelines | 71   | 47   | 16   |\n| Total                           | 135  | 107  | 85   |\n\n1Categories were adjusted in 2020, which limits comparability.\n2Former innogy units are included from 1 July 2020 onward.\n\nIn 2020 the number of compliance notices rose from 107 to 135. We adjusted the categories in 2020, which limits comparability: breaches of internal guidelines are now included in the former category \u201cOther\u201d instead of in the category \u201cFraud.\u201d The resulting investigations found that none of the incidents reported was serious.\n\nFines for non-compliance\n\nE.ON paid a total of \u20ac279,385 in fines for non-compliance with laws in Romania and in Germany in 2020. The fines in Germany were incurred solely by Westnetz, an E.ON subsidiary. No fines were imposed on us for incorrect tariff information or non-compliance with environmental regulations.\n\nOnline training\n\nIn response to social-distancing guidelines, in 2020 we offered compliance employees across E.ON online training on company compliance processes, German corruption law, and other topics. Employees of the former innogy were required to take online training, which was available in English and German. A total of 20 online training sessions were conducted.\n\nScientific research to assess the success of anti-corruption measures\n\nIn 2020 we established an interdisciplinary partnership with the Max Weber Institute of Sociology at Heidelberg University, the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, and the latter\u2019s spin-off, Simply Rational GmbH. The purpose is to foster a behavioural- and evidence-based approach to our compliance programme as well as compliance in general. The project, which begins in 2021 and is expected to last two years, is funded by the KBA-Nota Sys Integrity Fund.\nRespecting human rights in our supply chain\n\nThe new E.ON\u2019s strategy is encapsulated in four statements. One of them is that \u201cWE take sustainability as the guiding principle in business.\u201d This commitment brings with it the obligation to ensure respect for human rights in all aspects of our business, including our supply chain. Consequently, we expect our suppliers worldwide to meet minimum standards for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, including respect for human rights. E.ON procures goods and services predominantly from countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). OECD members have shared guiding principles for human rights, fair work practices, environmental protection, and anti-corruption. The small amount of business we do with companies outside the OECD, where a lack of such shared principles may increase the risk of practices or incidents that harm people and the environment, accounts for less than 6 per cent of our purchase volume (a slight increase from 2019 resulting from a greater focus on offshoring digital activities to India). We assess our suppliers\u2019 ESG performance prior to doing business with them. Moreover, we subject suppliers in higher-risk countries or categories to particular scrutiny. In addition, we comply with the regulatory requirements for transparency along our supply chain, which in many countries are becoming more demanding. [\u2192 GRI 103-1, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\nOur approach\n\nE.ON takes its responsibilities seriously and is therefore committed to doing business ethically, respecting human rights, protecting the environment, and ensuring proper work conditions. We expect our suppliers to share our commitment to high ESG standards and have processes in place to ensure that they do. Engaging in dialogue with our stakeholders and participating in industry initiatives help us to identify potential human rights issues. For example, we belong to econsense, a network of Germany-based multinational companies dedicated to promoting sustainable business development and respect for human rights.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\n\nOur CEO Johannes Teyssen is also our Chief Sustainability Officer and Chief Human Rights Officer. Staff in the Sustainability and Legal Affairs departments deal with human rights issues, such as changes in legislation. They inform the Chief Human Rights Officer about current developments and incidents and advise him about upcoming activities and decisions. Depending on the issue, the Chief Human Rights Officer may also consult our Sustainability Council or the E.ON Management Board. Furthermore, the Group Supply Chain function, in collaboration with the Sustainability department, is responsible for addressing ESG aspects along the supply chain.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\n\nGuidelines and policies\n\nWe\u2019ve defined standards for ethical behaviours and business practices in a Code of Conduct, which is binding for all our employees. The Code was last revised at the start of 2018. It obliges our employees to contribute to a non-discriminatory and safe work environment and to respect human rights. In 2019 we updated our Human Rights Policy Statement from 2008. It was signed by all Management Board members and published on our website. The statement acknowledges the International Bill of Human Rights and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and its fundamental conventions and makes reference to our own policies, such as our Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition, a People Guideline provides guidance to employees so that they procure goods and services in line with our ESG standards. Our standards are based on the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the world\u2019s largest initiative for responsible corporate governance, which includes respecting human rights. We\u2019ve been a UNGC signatory since 2005. In addition to the UNGC, we endorse the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the UN and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights.\n\nIn mid-2020 we introduced a new mandatory training model on compliance, human rights, and cyber and data security. For details, see \u201cProgress and measures in 2020\u201d below.\n\nThe E.ON Function Policy on Supply Chain describes the mandate and organisational setup of the Supply Chain function. The mandate encompasses the management of procurement processes, activities, policies, tools, and supplier relationships. The function performs these tasks in compliance with legal requirements, company policies, as well as health, safety, and environmental (HSE) and sustainability standards. The function is not responsible for a variety of transactions, including commodity, financial, real estate, insurance, and taxes.\n\nThe standards for human rights, working conditions, environmental protection, and ethical business practices that we require our suppliers to meet are defined in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which was updated in 2020 and adopted by former innogy units. It therefore applies to all of the new E.ON\u2019s suppliers. The updated version contains a more detailed description of our CSR requirements, including information about how to contact our whistle-blower hotline. Our supplier prequalification process (see \u201cSpecific actions\u201d below) consists of self-registration, formal agreement to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, and a compliance check. Non-fuel suppliers that are not subject to supplier onboarding must agree to our General Terms and Conditions for Purchase Contracts, which are legally binding. These oblige non-fuel suppliers, among other things, to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct and to endorse the UNGC\u2019s principles. In addition, our Supply Chain Handbook defines group-wide principles, processes, and responsibilities for non-fuel procurement. It also ensures that we adopt a structured approach to managing our relationships with suppliers (see \u201cSpecific actions\u201d below).\n\nWe\u2019ve issued a Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement annually since 2017. It describes the steps we take to prevent and combat human rights violations along our supply chain. The statement fulfils our obligations under the UK Modern Slavery Act. We review the statement annually and publish it in the Sustainability Channel on E.ON\u2019s corporate website as well as on our UK website.\n\nThe total installed capacity of our biomass-fired assets is 300 MW electric, just over 1,400 MW thermal. We\u2019re committed to procuring the fuel for\nthese assets responsibly and sustainably. Suppliers of solid biomass must, like non-fuel suppliers, contractually agree to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition, the E.ON Biomass Purchasing Amendment from 2010 defines our policies and procedures, which include risk assessments, supplier audits, and provisions for joint ventures. The amendment is part of all contracts with biomass suppliers. They must pledge to respect human rights, safeguard the general living conditions of persons affected by biomass production, and protect biodiversity and the environment.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2 \u2611, \u2192 GRI 102-11 \u2611]\n\nSpecific actions\nOur supplier relationship management (SRM) for non-fuel suppliers has four main facets: supplier onboarding, risk assessment, evaluation, and development. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, we took additional steps to ensure a reliable supply chain.\n\nAt the end of 2018 we put in place a revised and fully digital supplier onboarding solution that\u2019s integrated into our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. It is used to monitor existing and new suppliers to ensure that they comply with our minimum requirements. This helps us to mitigate potential risks to HSE and corporate social responsibility (CSR), including respect for human rights. Every non-fuel supplier whose individual transaction volume exceeds \u20ac25,000 or whose HSE risk is medium or high must complete an online onboarding process. As of year-end 2020, the suppliers involved in 99.3 per cent of the non-fuel purchase orders and call-off contracts at the units of the former E.ON had completed the onboarding process. In October 2020 the supplier onboarding process was rolled out at former innogy units. New suppliers use the supplier onboarding tool to self-register after being invited to do so by the manager responsible for their respective categories of product or services. They must confirm their adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct. This includes complying with the conventions of the ILO and endorsing the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nFollowing the comprehensive assessment conducted 2018, in 2019, and 2020 we continued to evaluate our suppliers\u2019 performance and, based on the findings, make decisions about our relationship with them. Once a year we determine which of our non-fuel suppliers are key based on the amount we purchase from them, their criticality to our business, and other criteria. We periodically assess them using five key performance indicators (KPIs): quality, commercial, delivery, processes and innovation, and CSR; the latter includes the protection of human rights. The respective results are discussed with each supplier during a performance review meeting. The outcome of the meeting may require a supplier to take specific actions to improve its performance in one or more of the KPIs if it wants to continue doing business with us. At the end of 2019 E.ON and innogy drew on their respective best practices to harmonise the supplier performance review (SPR) process. The harmonised process has been in place since 1 January 2020. Since then, innogy\u2019s key suppliers have been assessed for their ESG performance as well, an aspect that had not been part of the former innogy\u2019s SPR. The total number of reviews in 2020 increased by 88% relative to 2019. Furthermore, we again carefully scrutinised our non-fuel supply chain\u2019s greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions (see \u201cProgress and measures in 2020\u201d below).\n\nIn January 2020 we established a Supply Chain Corona Task Force to continuously monitor our direct suppliers and their critical suppliers to safeguard procurement from different markets and regions. The task force held extensive discussions with a number of suppliers to find joint solutions for keeping the supply chain intact.\n\nSweden is home to over 90 per cent of our biomass-fired capacity. Since 2014 we\u2019ve evaluated the CSR performance of our suppliers there using a method developed by E.ON V\u00e4rme Sverige, which operates a district heating business in Stockholm, Malm\u00f6, and other cities. In 2020 we evaluated 18 suppliers, which together provide more than 99 per cent of the biomass we consume in Sweden.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2 \u2611, \u2192 GRI 102-11 \u2611]\nGoals and performance review\n\nOur goal is to prevent human rights abuses, environmental damage, and corporate malfeasance by identifying the associated risks along our value chain from a holistic viewpoint. Our onboarding assessments help us to do business exclusively with suppliers committed to our standards. A new KPI was added to supply chain reporting at the start of 2020. It shows the suppliers we\u2019re monitoring more closely. Periodic risk assessments enable us to identify violations or suspected violations. In such cases, the Supply Chain Compliance Officer and the respective Supply Chain Director are notified, and a process is set in motion to ensure that the situation is rectified without delay. If it\u2019s not, we terminate our business dealings with the supplier. In 2020 no business dealings were terminated because no compliance violations were detected.\n\nIf our employees are aware of or suspect misconduct or violations of laws or regulations, including those protecting human rights, they\u2019re instructed to report this information without delay. They may talk to their supervisor or their unit\u2019s compliance officer. If they wish to remain anonymous, they may call a group-wide whistle-blower hotline which is connected to the offices of a law firm. Our business partners, their employees, and other third parties can contact this hotline confidentially as well. The hotline number is published online and in our Supplier Code of Conduct. The hotline can process calls in the languages of all countries in which E.ON operates. The law firm forwards the information to Group Compliance, which provides it to the appropriate department or unit. Depending on the nature and severity of the potential violation, Group Compliance may report it immediately to the E.ON Management Board, notify law enforcement, initiate its own investigation, or take other appropriate action. In 2020 no violation of human rights was reported through these channels.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2/3, \u2192 GRI 102-11]\nProgress and measures in 2020\n\nIn 2020 we continued to refine our approach to human rights and supplier management. After updating our Human Rights Policy Statement and Code of Conduct, we incorporated a section on human rights in a new eLearning module on compliance, human rights, and cyber and data security. This module, which we made available to all E.ON companies in May 2020, is mandatory for all employees and conducted annually. From October 2020 onward it was made available to employees of the former innogy. At year-end, 87.3 per cent of employees had completed this training.\n\nGerman National Action Plan\n\nAs in 2019, in April 2020 E.ON again participated in the German government\u2019s voluntary National Action Plan (NAP) monitoring. The NAP, which defines guiding principles for embedding human rights due diligence (HRDD) in corporate strategy and business processes, encourages companies to conduct voluntary HRDD. As part of its participation in the 2019 NAP monitoring, E.ON conducted a rigorous benchmarking and a human rights risk assessment encompassing 80 per cent of its current and anticipated expenditures in all purchasing categories. In 2020 Group Supply Chain designed a systematic process for rolling out the risk matrix developed in 2019. The purpose of the matrix, which breaks down risks by country and purchasing category, is to mitigate any potential risk of human rights violations. In 2021 we plan to review the matrix with regard to the new E.ON\u2019s suppliers (including the former innogy\u2019s suppliers, which were not included in 2020) and to update it on a regular basis. If this process identifies such risks, suppliers will have to take additional steps, such as presenting a corrective action plan or agreeing to on-site audits, in order to successfully pass the onboarding process. All of the above-mentioned activities are embedded into Group Supply Chain\u2019s overall supplier relationship management (SRM) system.\n\nHealth, safety, and environment events\n\nIn 2020 we tripled the number of safety events with contractors, from two in 2019 to six in 2020. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, most events were conducted online. For example, Bayernwerk, an E.ON distribution system operator in southeast Germany, held an online forum in which representatives of Bayernwerk, Group Supply Chain, and a number of contractors discussed networks of the future, work safety culture, the professional of tomorrow, and other topics. Workshops on a variety of topics (mental health, positive error culture, electric mobility) were offered as well. In addition, the events addressed the pandemic\u2019s impact on contractors and explored ways to ensure they continue to work in a safe environment.\n\nAssessing non-fuel suppliers\n\nIn 2020 we again scrutinised our non-fuel suppliers to identify those with a large carbon footprint and explored ways to encourage their decarbonisation. The next step, which will take place in the first half of 2021, will be to conduct a more in-depth analysis of non-fuel suppliers\u2019 climate performance and to recommend amelioration measures. This project will continue in 2021.\n\nSupply chain forums\n\nFour one-hour online forums were held in 2020 for Supply Chain staff group-wide. They consisted of a chat between two senior Supply Chain managers on issues like compliance, HSE, and sustainability. Their purpose was to refresh staff\u2019s knowledge and foster a common understanding of how we manage our supply chain. The forums were recorded and can later be shown to new hires.\n\nNon-Core Business: uranium procurement:\n\nThe nuclear power plants operated by our subsidiary PreussenElektra consume uranium fuel. We maintain high procurement standards by incorporating our Supplier Code of Conduct into our contracts for procuring uranium and nuclear fuel assemblies. The code is supplemented by the Nuclear Fuel Purchasing Amendment, which defines the standards for the procurement of nuclear fuel. The E.ON Nuclear Fuel Policy from 2014 stipulates the procedure for selecting and verifying new uranium suppliers. We purchase uranium exclusively from established suppliers with proven experience. In addition, we conduct reviews and on-site audits of new long-term suppliers and of current suppliers if there\u2019s a reasonable suspicion of misconduct. In 2020 we concluded one spot sales contract for natural uranium and one purchase contract for spot delivery of enriched uranium, each for delivery in 2020. The latter completes PreussenElektra\u2019s uranium purchases for its nuclear power plants still in operation; these plants will close by year-end 2022 at the latest.\nDialoguing with stakeholders, learning from their feedback\n\nOur long-term business success depends to a large degree on our ability to understand and address our stakeholders\u2019 expectations. Equally important is helping our customers, our employees, policymakers, and other stakeholders to understand our business activities and their role in propelling the energy transition. This enhances our ability to earn stakeholders\u2019 trust and maintain our good reputation. Moreover, dialogue helps us identify stakeholders\u2019 concerns early and address them whenever we can as we expand our distribution grids, invest in digital infrastructure, and launch new businesses, such as green hydrogen.\n\nOur discussions with policymakers are important for us as well: to make large, long-term investments in infrastructure and new energy solutions for customers, we need a stable policy and regulatory framework. This framework should support the energy transition, in particular the integration and use of renewables and other efficient, climate-friendly technologies. In some cases, this will require amendments to the existing framework, amendments that we believe are essential for the energy transition\u2019s success, to which our business is entirely committed. Although the energy transition enjoys broad public support in many European countries, transparent and constructive discussion is still necessary to achieve a reasonable balance between ambitious climate protection and the interests of stakeholders adversely affected by it. [\u2192 GRI 103-1]\n\nOur approach\n\nWe continually seek opportunities to dialogue with our stakeholders, understand their viewpoints, and talk to them transparently about our business. It\u2019s part of our daily work at the local, national, and European level. Stakeholder management is a core process of our corporate governance. We factor in the short- and long-term impacts our business has on stakeholders. The types of dialogue we choose vary by stakeholder and issue. They range from information campaigns and discussion forums with trade associations and NGOs to face-to-face discussions and public advocacy. For example, we actively engage with \u2192 CDP, participate in other climate-protection initiatives like the \u2192 CEO letter on the EU\u2019s GHG targets for 2030, and share information with initiatives like \u2192 Right based on science, a Frankfurt-based climate protection start-up. We\u2019re also active in cross-sectoral initiatives, such as \u2192 Wirtschaft macht Klimaschutz, a dialogue forum created in 2017 by the German Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety. Its purpose is to facilitate collaboration among German companies in tackling climate change.\n\nWe actively participate in the policy debates on the issues that affect us \u2013 through lobbying, media interviews with our executives, and their appearances as public speakers. In addition, policymakers and regulators frequently invite us to provide our technical and energy expertise as part of their decision-making processes. We also offer our expertise voluntarily. These types of advocacy are important because the energy sector is significantly influenced by policy and regulatory decisions. We take part in discussions on energy, environmental, and climate policy in a variety of other forums as well. For example, we\u2019re a member of the steering committee of Agora, a German\nthink tank. Agora brings together policymakers, energy industry leaders, and renowned researchers to discuss issues relating to the energy transition. In addition, we support a variety of initiatives, such as the Corporate Leaders Groups, Green Recovery Alliance, and the Stiftung 2\u00b0, a foundation dedicated to climate protection.\n\nAll of our lobbying activities and dialogue formats comply with national and European laws and guidelines for the representation of corporate interests and responsible lobbying.\n\nA stakeholder is anyone who has an interest in our company. On the right is an overview of our main stakeholders, their significance for us, and their expectations of us. [\u2192 GRI 102-42/43, \u2192 GRI 103-2]\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\nCorporate Functions defines our position and talking points on issues that affect the E.ON Group as a whole and establishes the framework for our activities to engage stakeholders. The Corporate Communications & Political Affairs division at Corporate Functions is responsible for our communications with policymakers in Brussels and Berlin. Our regional units, which are best able to assess the needs and conditions in their sales or service territory, conduct our stakeholder dialogue on the local and regional level. Corporate Functions provides advice on the design and implementation of stakeholder engagement projects. Depending on the topic, these projects may involve a variety of divisions and departments. In addition, our distribution system operators and some of our customer-solutions businesses have employees whose role is to engage in dialogue with the municipalities in their service or sales territory. [\u2192 GRI 103-2]\n\nGuidelines and policies\nOur Communications & Political Affairs Policy includes guidance for group stakeholder management. It defines the principles, roles, and tasks of our stakeholder management, which includes sustainability management. It applies to our relations with all stakeholder groups inside and outside E.ON with the exception of the capital market, which is served by our Investor Relations department. In addition, our Code of Conduct contains a chapter entitled, \u201cCreating sustainable relationships,\u201d which defines our ethical standards for donations and sponsorships and for anti-corruption. The code categorically rules out donations to political parties, political officeholders, and candidates for such offices.\n\nStakeholder groups [\u2192 GRI 102-40/44]\n\n| Significance | Stakeholder | Expectations |\n|--------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions determine our success. | Customers | \u2022 A secure energy supply at reasonable prices |\n| Our employees\u2019 performance is crucial to our success. | Employees | \u2022 An active role in propelling the energy transformation in Europe |\n| Our investors\u2019 capital is essential for the successful development of our company. | Shareholders and investors | \u2022 Support for self-generation and energy efficiency |\n| We procure the services of numerous suppliers and subcontractors. | Suppliers and business partners | \u2022 A safe, interesting, and inclusive work environment |\n| The transformation of Europe\u2019s energy system can succeed only if it is actively shaped and supported by people as consumers and citizens. | Regions and communities | \u2022 Fair pay and equal opportunity |\n| Our business activities are strongly influenced by social needs and developments and the political decisions based on them. | Policymakers, society, and the general public | \u2022 Transparent information about how we manage chances and risks |\n| We see universities and social institutions as important partners. Non-governmental organisations provide us with valuable information on public expectations. | Non-governmental organisations and sustainability experts | \u2022 Information about our potential value growth |\n| \u2022 Transparent decision-making, fair treatment of customers, and innovative, forward-looking customer solutions | | \u2022 Fair terms and conditions |\n| \u2022 A reliable, economical, and environmentally friendly energy supply | | \u2022 Mutually beneficial collaboration |\n| \u2022 Compliance with laws and regulations | | \u2022 Transparency about planned measures |\n| \u2022 Accountability | | \u2022 Active participation at the municipal level |\nWe've been registered in the EU Transparency Register since 2011. The register contains a list of the organisations and individuals who engage in lobbying at EU institutions as well as the annual financial budget of each organisation. It also includes a code of conduct defining principles for ethical and transparent lobbying. By registering we pledge to abide by this code.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2]\n\n**Specific actions**\n\nWe conduct numerous dialogue forums and information events at the regional level as well. For example, the board members of our regional companies in Germany meet annually with municipal shareholders and/or representatives to discuss grid expansion, landscape preservation, the latest advances in smart grids, and other issues. We take the viewpoints, interests, and concerns of the people who live near our assets very seriously. Their feedback helps us to ensure a reliable energy supply and promote the energy transition while having the least-possible impact on people, communities, and the environment. In addition, we periodically invite outside stakeholders to attend meetings of our Sustainability Council in order to hear what they think about our sustainability activities.\n\nWe engage individual stakeholder groups in different ways. For example, our Customer Immersion programme brings our senior managers and employees into direct contact with residential and business customers in a variety of formats, including small-group discussions and online chats. We use periodic corporate governance road shows held in Europe\u2019s major financial centres to meet face-to-face with investors and analysts to discuss corporate governance, climate protection, and other sustainability issues. We engage our employees in a wide variety of formats and programmes. We also use social media. Our tweets and Facebook posts reach policymakers, the media, trade associations, academic institutions, and members of the general public across Europe and around the world. We have a total of over 790,000 followers on the two group channels, a number that has grown steadily over time. We also have Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn accounts. Altogether, E.ON has more than 1 million followers on its social media channels.\n\nE.ON is a member of a variety of industry networks and trade associations in individual countries and at the European level. They provide a useful forum for sharing information about climate protection, customer needs, and industry trends and for representing shared interests to policymakers and regulators. Examples of our memberships include:\n\n- **German Federal Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW):** through the BDEW we\u2019re also represented in two European trade associations, Eurelectric and Eurogas.\n- **German Industry Initiative for Energy Efficiency (Deutsche Unternehmensinitiative Energieeffizienz, or DENEFF):** a multi-industry network of companies and organisations dedicated to enhancing energy efficiency.\n- **Bitkom:** an industry initiative for the digital economy that we joined in October 2018; through it we\u2019re also represented in the **Federal Association of German Industry** (Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie) and its European umbrella organisation, **BusinessEurope**.\n- **E.ON executives have sat on the Economic Councils of both the CDU and SPD,** two of Germany\u2019s major political parties.\n- **Smart Energy Demand Coalition (SEDC) and European Distribution System Operators for Smart Grids (EDSO for Smart Grids):** European associations promoting smart grids and the digitalisation of the energy sector.\n- **Energy UK:** a British trade association for energy.\n- **Swedenergy:** a private association of companies involved in electricity production, sale, and trading in Sweden.\n- **Romanian Federation of Associations of Energy Utilities:** a federation of energy suppliers in Romania.\n\n[\u2192 GRI 103-2]\nProgress and measures in 2020\n\nIn 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic rendered face-to-face events largely impossible. This of course affected our interactions with stakeholders. To continue the dialogue and not lose touch, we turned to digital formats.\n\nenviaM Climate Week\nIn October 2020 enviaM, an E.ON subsidiary in eastern Germany, used its social media channels to conduct a discussion of Germany\u2019s climate policy and its implications for social cohesion (#enviaMKlimawoche). The purpose was to address climate policy from a variety of different perspectives and to present climate protection as an opportunity for businesses and the general public alike. The 19 virtual speakers, who included Bodo Ramelow (Prime Minister of Thuringia) and Dr. Dr. h.c. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber (founder of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research), discussed ways to achieve a balance between climate, economic, and social objectives. In a single week, the event generated around 90,000 impressions and 3,200 interactions on enviaM\u2019s social media channels.\n\n#GreenInternet Day\nIn January 2020 E.ON inaugurated #GreentInternet Day to raise awareness of the internet\u2019s growing power consumption. The campaign resulted in 21.7 million impressions on E.ON\u2019s social media channels, which include Google, Facebook, and Instagram. For more information, visit the Climate protection chapter.\n\nE.ON Innovation Days\nWe held our annual E.ON Energy Innovation days in October 2020. The three-day conference again explored how innovation is propelling the transition toward a connected and sustainable world. The 2020 event itself was connected: owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was held entirely online. The three main topics \u2013 electrification, connectivity, and digitalisation \u2013 were selected for their appeal to entrepreneurs, experts, academics, and government representatives. The more than 50 speakers included E.ON CEO Johannes Teyssen and Monika Sturm, Head of Blockchain Incubator at Siemens Energy. Over 5,000 people registered for the event.\n\nEuropean Sustainable Development Week\nE.ON observed the EU-wide European Sustainable Development Week (ESDW), which was held from 18 September to 8 October 2020, by conducting a two-week series of events to reinforce employees\u2019 awareness of, and engagement in, sustainability. The first week focused on sustainability at E.ON, the second on a more sustainable lifestyle. Presentations by E.ON CEO Johannes Teyssen and other experts, which were webcast to employees in 17 E.ON units via the company intranet, covered topics like E.ON\u2019s contribution to climate protection, sustainable finance, and biodiversity. E.ON\u2019s social media posts during ESDW reached as many as 1.6 million outside stakeholders.\n\nNon-Core Business: stakeholder dialogue on reliable operation and plant dismantling\nOur subsidiary PreussenElektra is responsible for the safe and reliable operation and dismantling of our nuclear power plants (NPPs). Ongoing dialogue with stakeholders is essential. We communicate with a broad range of stakeholders through press releases and briefings as well as events and forums that provide the opportunity to dialogue directly with stakeholders and to benefit from their feedback. The aim of all these measures is to provide transparent information and build trust.\n\nDialogue remains important as we decommission and dismantle our assets. In 2020, however, the corona pandemic prevented PEL from conducting some of its originally planned information events for stakeholders, such as the public talks at Grohnde and Unterweser NPPs. Press conferences, by contrast, were held online. The dialogue group for residents near Brokdorf NPP, created in 2019, continued in 2020. The group meets periodically and serves as a forum in which we can respond to residents\u2019 questions and concerns regarding Brokdorf\u2019s decommissioning. In addition, PEL is a member of the commission regarding the dismantling of Grohnde NPP that was established by the Hameln-Pyrmont district government in October 2020. In the periodic discussions with commission members, PEL is true to its strategy of transparent communications and ensures that the public is well informed and involved at all times.\nE.ON is part of the countries and communities where it does business. We therefore have a responsibility to make a tangible contribution to their prosperity, economic development, sustainability, and quality of life. We do this in the first instance by creating jobs and by offering energy solutions that enhance our customers\u2019 sustainability and comfort. In addition, we engage in community involvement and support employee volunteering in all the countries where we operate. These activities help address social needs and support our corporate vision of \u201cimproving people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nOur unit representatives know their country\u2019s needs and challenges best. So we let them decide which projects and organisations to support. We believe that this approach gives our community involvement activities a greater societal impact. A map with a selection of our community involvement projects can be found in the Sustainability Channel on E.ON\u2019s corporate website.\nOur community investments in 2020\n\nWe report our corporate giving by the categories listed below.\n\nCorporate giving by categories\n\n- **Education**: 12%\n- **Environment and sustainability**: 14%\n- **Arts and culture**: 18%\n- **Sport**: 19%\n- **Society**: 37%\n\nAlongside corporate giving, we make strategic investments in community involvement, which are typically more long-term in nature. In 2020, our strategic investments went toward three focus areas: climate protection, access to energy, and educational support for the next generation.\n\nStrategic community involvement\n\n- **Climate protection**: 40%\n- **Access to energy**: 21%\n- **Next generation**: 39%\n\nTogether, our corporate giving and strategic community involvement amounted to around \u20ac11 million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac6 million). The increase was attributable to innogy, which was included in 2020 but not in 2019.\n\n**E.ON Foundation**\n\nThe integration of innogy into the E.ON Group included the former innogy foundation, which was renamed the E.ON Foundation. It aims to promote a sustainable transformation of the energy system that reflects people\u2019s preferences. Guided by the conviction that a purely government-mandated, over-regulated energy transition won\u2019t succeed, it supports projects, events, and practical formats (labs) relating to energy and society. In 2020 the foundation made about \u20ac75,000 in donations and provided slightly more than \u20ac1.25 million in funding to the projects it supports. Because the foundation is independent, this funding isn\u2019t included in E.ON\u2019s community investments.\n\n**Corporate volunteering**\n\nAgain in 2020, our employees were actively involved in non-profit projects in all of the countries in which we operate. In total, 1,332 E.ON employees performed 11,405 hours of volunteer work in 2020. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, many volunteering activities had to be suspended to protect the health of our employees and the people they serve.\nEnsuring responsible tax management\n\nE.ON views good corporate governance as essential for responsible and value-oriented management. This also includes having a transparent tax strategy. E.ON\u2019s tax strategy and corporate strategy are closely aligned. We aim to manage our taxes sustainably in order to help ensure that our business can continue to invest, to operate flexible and efficiently, and to provide attractive dividends to our shareholders. Our tax strategy is therefore designed to be fully compliant with tax law and to ensure efficient, responsible, transparent, and accurate management of E.ON\u2019s taxation for the Group as a whole as well as in individual tax jurisdictions.\n\nOur approach\nE.ON is aware that taxes, which fund public services, are a crucial issue for governments and authorities at all levels. E.ON thus optimises its overall tax position prudently. It aims for full tax compliance and supports all national and international tax legislation and standards. E.ON also has in place policies and procedures to prevent tax evasion. This includes employees\u2019 obligation to report any suspicions or concerns to their supervisor, Group Tax or their unit\u2019s Tax function, Group Compliance or the whistle-blower hotline; if they wish, they may do so anonymously (for more information about the hotline, see the Compliance and anti-corruption chapter).\n\nOrganisation and responsibilities\nThe E.ON Management Board has overall responsibility for the group\u2019s corporate strategy, of which the tax strategy is an integral part. It has delegated the responsibility for the Group Tax function to the Senior Vice President (SVP) Group Tax, who reports directly to the CFO. The heads of the Tax functions in Germany and other countries report directly to Group Tax as well as to their unit\u2019s management board. Furthermore, E.ON SE has appointed a Tax Compliance Officer (TCO), whose role is to ensure that the existing tax compliance management system is effective and efficient. The TCO reports directly to the SVP Group Tax. Additionally, local tax compliance management systems were installed on sub-group level.\n\nThe SVP Group Tax defines E.ON\u2019s tax principles and is responsible for ensuring that these principles and concomitant procedures are in place, maintained, and complied with group-wide. The E.ON Supervisory Board\u2019s Audit and Risk Committee closely monitors E.ON\u2019s tax-related issues and risks. Furthermore, financial tax risks are reported to the Risk and Valuation division, which reviews and scrutinises these risks from a group perspective and compiles reports on the E.ON Group\u2019s consolidated risk assessment. The Tax function disseminates guidelines and policies to ensure tax compliance including related tasks, processes, and responsibilities. E.ON put in place tax compliance management systems according to IDW audit standard PS 980 at its major operations in Germany. The system\u2019s purpose is to identify and classify all material tax risks and to map the findings in a detailed risk control matrix (RCM). The RCMs are continually updated and maintained.\n\nGuidelines and policies\nE.ON\u2019s Tax function actively and continuously identifies, assesses, monitors, and manages tax risks to make sure that they remain in line with our overall business and strategic objectives. To achieve this and to ensure appropriate\nGovernance\n\nCloseup on: Tax\n\nresponses, E.ON has in place a governance framework, which includes a Tax Function Policy. The framework and policy were approved by the E.ON Management Board and are mandatory for all group companies. They are embedded into E.ON\u2019s overall compliance management system and supplemented by substantial risk control management procedures, continuous self-assessment as well as regular internal and external audits.\n\nTo avoid tax evasion and profit shifting, E.ON has issued mandatory transfer price directives to ensure that intra-group transactions are conducted in accordance with the arm\u2019s-length principle. Group Tax is responsible for monitoring adherence to this principle and is involved in all major intra-group transactions. It does this through various means, including regular meetings with relevant stakeholders and fixed transfer pricing schemes. In addition, participants from relevant business units and functions from a variety of tax jurisdictions meet at least once a year to align these transactions. Transfer price schemes are monitored continually.\n\nSpecific actions\nE.ON\u2019s Tax function takes a variety of steps to stay on top of new developments. Teams and managers hold meetings at various intervals (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) to discuss emerging tax issues. Our tax experts also meet at slightly longer intervals (monthly, quarterly, or annually) to discuss country-specific and international tax issues. These meetings, which are held in person and by means of virtual presence technology, foster ongoing collaboration and coordination between Group Tax and the units\u2019 Tax functions. In addition, tax teams and managers also receive in-house training. Technology plays a role, too. For example, we aim to continuously improve our processes, particularly by implementing and using digital solutions that ensure tax compliance while enhancing efficiency. Our digital solutions include an integrated toolset that calculates income taxes for quarterly and year-end closings and for tax filings. These standard tax tools are updated on regular basis to reflect changes in tax laws in order to remain compliant at all times and to be simple, more efficient, and more reliable. Where reasonable, we implement software interfaces to ensure data integrity and to minimise the risk of manual errors.\n\nIf employees suspect misconduct or a violation of laws or company policies, they are obliged to report it immediately. They can do so anonymously through internal reporting channels or a group-wide external whistle-blower hotline.\n\nE.ON employees participate in a variety of working groups and committees of trade associations, such as the BDI, BDEW, and Chambers of Commerce and thus actively contribute to the debate on emerging tax legislation.\n\nGoals and performance review\nE.ON and its Tax function place great emphasis on maintaining transparent and mutual communications with the tax authorities in the countries where it does business. We prepare and file all required tax returns and pay the correct amount of tax on time. When necessary, we seek advice from experts to clarify uncertainties. E.ON discusses binding tax rulings or advance pricing agreements (APA) with tax authorities where possible, convenient, and of general or economic importance to E.ON.\n\nE.ON partners with external tax experts that help it to supervise company audits and to prepare tax returns and declarations as well as tax payments. The co-operation with external partners is based on open, mutually trustful communications and feedback. Each partner performs its own independent quality assurance, which, in the aggregate, leads to adequate quality checks. We constantly aim for certainty in our tax positions and, where appropriate, obtain internal or external advice to verify and validate our positions. In case our assessment does not match that of the tax authorities, we communicate the divergent opinion openly in order to prevent misunderstandings.\nThis report focuses primarily on sustainability topics that are material to us and our stakeholders. Each year we conduct a materiality analysis to identify these topics. The report covers our two core businesses: energy networks and customer solutions. It also provides information about our nuclear power business in Germany, which is operated by our subsidiary PreussenElektra and is not a strategic business; these disclosures are therefore marked Non-Core Business.\n\nStandards and compliance\nOur reporting has been guided by the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) since 2005. This report was prepared in accordance with the current version of the guidelines, the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI SRS) 2016. It also includes the sector-specific disclosures of the GRI Electric Utilities Sector Disclosures 2013. This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. Sections of this report that fulfil a GRI standard are followed by square brackets containing the corresponding standard, like at the end of the first paragraph above: [GRI 102-50/51/52]. This report meets the reporting requirements of the German Sustainability Code and serves as our progress report for the United Nations Global Compact.\n\nIn addition to this report, we published a Combined Non-financial Report in late March 2021, which complies with the reporting requirements of the German CSR Directive Implementation Act (Section 315 in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e of the German Commercial Code) and is included in our 2020 Annual Report.\n\nStructure\nThe introductory chapter of this report provides general information about E.ON, our sustainability strategy and organisation, and our materiality analysis. The four main chapters describe the different areas in which we have an impact on sustainable development: \u201cBusiness areas,\u201d \u201cEnvironment,\u201d \u201cSocial,\u201d and \u201cGovernance.\u201d The appendix contains this report profile as well as condensed information about our key performance indicators, GRI and SASB standards, and our Green Bond reporting.\n\nThe four main chapters describe our material topics and, in compliance with GRI 103: Management Approach, how we manage them (\u201cOur approach\u201d). These chapters also contain information about our current and planned projects as well as our progress in the reporting period (\u201cProgress and measures in 2020\u201d).\nScope\nThis report encompasses all subsidiaries in which E.ON holds a majority stake and that are fully consolidated in its Consolidated Financial Statements. The statements in this report always refer to E.ON and its majority-held subsidiaries (the E.ON Group). Any deviations from this are indicated. For example, our reporting about occupational safety also encompasses entities in which we do not hold a majority stake but over which we have operational control. Our key performance indicators (\"KPIs\") include PreussenElektra\u2019s business operations. The business operations at the Renewables segment that we transferred to RWE are included in our KPIs until late September 2019. A separate innogy segment, consisting mainly of network and sales businesses, became part of the E.ON Group on 18 September 2019. Consequently, last year\u2019s reporting included a number of innogy KPIs after this date. This year, the 2019 KPIs of E.ON and innogy were aggregated in order to foster comparability and transparency. As a rule, KPIs include both entities from 2019 on. Any exceptions due to time frames, availability of data, internal collating and reporting processes are clearly indicated. 2020 figures, however, refer to the scope of the new E.ON without exception. The abbreviation n/a indicates when a figure isn\u2019t applicable, an en-dash (\u2013), when a figure is unavailable.\n\nAdjustments to prior-year figures of a KPI are explained in footnotes. This practice is in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. We use KPIs that we consider to be important in view of a business unit\u2019s operations and material in terms of its contribution to our business.\n\nAudit\nAs with previous reports, key sections of this report were audited with limited assurance by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH. The assurance engagement was conducted in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) issued by the International Federation of Accountants. Audited content is indicated by the symbol . The symbol can be found at the end of a section and applies to the entire section beginning with its headline. The \u2192 Assurance Report describes the exact scope of the audit.\n\nStatements on the future development of E.ON and its subsidiaries are estimates based on information available at the time of reporting. Actual results may deviate from these statements. To improve readability, we generally use the shorter name for companies and organisations (\"E.ON\" rather than \"E.ON SE\").\nThe transition to a sustainable economy is in full swing. Sustainable energy is not only the basis for economic and social development but also a key factor in environmental and climate protection. By delivering solutions for the decarbonisation of the energy world, E.ON\u2019s core businesses Energy Networks and Customer Solutions contribute to climate change mitigation. Our networks serve as the central platform for the energy transition, and the Customer Solutions business offers customers of all sizes \u2014 households, companies, and cities \u2014 technologies and service that enable their transition to climate neutrality. Consequently, sustainability is central to E.ON\u2019s strategy, which aims to foster value creation and provide benefits for people and the environment. The ongoing decentralisation, digitalisation and decarbonisation of the energy world requires large investments. To finance or refinance activities that enable climate change mitigation, E.ON issues Green Bonds, making the link between its sustainability, business, and financing strategies explicit. It manifests our ambition to include sustainability in our company\u2019s core processes.\n\nIn August 2019 E.ON issued its first two Green Bond tranches of \u20ac750 million each and since then has been a frequent Green Bond issuer. At year-end 2020, a total of \u20ac4.6 billion in Green Bonds were outstanding, issued by E.ON SE and E.ON International Finance B.V. By investing in E.ON\u2019s Green Bonds, investors have the opportunity to participate in the (re-)financing of E.ON\u2019s sustainable activities that are in line with our renewed Green Bond Framework.\n\n### Overview of E.ON\u2019s Green Bonds\n\n| Issuer                        | Volume (millions) | Terms in years | Maturity       | Coupon (%) | ISIN               |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|--------------------|\n| E.ON SE                       | 750 EUR           | 5              | 28/08/2024     | 0.000      | XS2047500769       |\n| E.ON SE                       | 750 EUR           | 5.5            | 07/10/2025     | 1.000      | XS2152899584       |\n| E.ON SE                       | 1,000 EUR         | 7.5            | 29/09/2027     | 0.375      | XS2103014291       |\n| E.ON SE                       | 850 EUR           | 10             | 19/10/2027     | 1.250      | XS1702729275       |\n| E.ON SE                       | 750 EUR           | 10.5           | 28/02/2030     | 0.350      | XS2047500926       |\n| E.ON SE                       | 500 EUR           | 11             | 20/08/2031     | 0.875      | XS2177580508       |\n\nRecognising the importance of a common definition of sustainable activities, E.ON has updated its Green Bond Framework and use of proceeds categories to be aligned as much as possible with the current version of the proposed EU Green Bond Standard and EU taxonomy for sustainable economic activities, in addition to the ICMA Green Bond Principles.\n## Use of proceeds in E.ON\u2019s Green Bond Framework: enabling tomorrow\u2019s sustainable energy world\n\n| Green activities | Eligible green assets and capital expenditures and related eligibility criteria | UN SDG | EU economic activities |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------|\n| **Electricity networks** | Electricity distribution infrastructure and equipment that meets the following criteria:  \n- over 67% of newly connected generation assets comply with the 100gCO\u2082/kWh threshold (over a rolling five-year period), or  \n- the grid\u2019s average emissions factor is less than 100gCO\u2082/kWh but excluding any grid connections of power plants that are more CO\u2082 intensive than 100gCO\u2082/kWh (as a proxy for this threshold any direct grid connections of power plants other than wind or solar energy will be excluded) | | \u2022 Transmission and distribution of electricity (NACE: D.35.12, D.35.13) |\n| **Renewable energy** | Renewable energy production and storage units including:  \n- wind power  \n- solar PV  \n- bioenergy (biomass, biogas, and biofuels)  \n- hydrogen production, storage, and distribution infrastructure | | \u2022 Electricity generation using solar PV, wind power, and bioenergy, storage of electricity, manufacture and storage of hydrogen  \n\u2022 Transmission and distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases (NACE: D.35.1.1, NACE: C20.11) |\n| **Energy efficiency** | Integrated on-site business and city energy solutions, composed of EU taxonomy-aligned technologies, including but not limited to the following:  \n- district heating  \n- production of heating/cooling from waste heat  \n- cogeneration of heating/cooling and electricity from bioenergy and geothermal energy. | | \u2022 District heating/cooling distribution  \n\u2022 Production of heat/cool using waste heat  \n\u2022 Cogeneration of heat/cooling and power from bioenergy and geothermal among others (NACE: D.35.11, D.35.30) |\n| **Clean transportation** | Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and supporting electric infrastructure for the electrification of transport | | \u2022 Transmission and distribution of electricity  \n\u2022 Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport (NACE: D.35.12, D.35.13, F42.21) |\n\n1The eligibility criteria consist of the definition, metrics and thresholds included in this table as well as the applicable Do No Significant Harm criteria and minimum safeguards.\n2The asset value of all eligible electricity distribution infrastructure and equipment will be included in the Eligible Green Portfolio.\n3For Bioenergy: 1. Agricultural biomass used in the activity complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Forest biomass used in the activity complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7 of that Directive. 2. The GHG savings from the use of biomass in cogeneration installations are at least 80% in relation to the GHG emission saving methodology and fossil fuel comparator set out in Annex VI to Directive (EU) 2018/2001. [\u2026]\n4Production, storage and distribution of hydrogen that meets the criteria for manufacture of hydrogen: 1) direct CO\u2082 emissions from manufacturing of hydrogen with threshold of 2,256 metric tonnes CO\u2082 per metric tonne of H\u2082, 2) electricity use for hydrogen produced by electrolysis is at or lower than 58 MWh per metric tonne of hydrogen, 3) average carbon intensity of the electricity used for hydrogen manufacturing is at or below 100 g CO\u2082e per kWh, 4) construction or operation of new transmission and distribution networks dedicated to hydrogen or other low-carbon gases or the conversion/repurposing of existing natural gas networks to 100% hydrogen and retrofit of gas transmission and distribution networks to integrate hydrogen and other low-carbon gases.\n5Construction, operation and refurbishment of pipelines and associated infrastructure for distributing heating and cooling where the system meets the definition of efficient district heating and cooling systems laid down in Article 2, point 41, of Directive 2012/27/EU (refurbishment to start < 3yrs) OR The activity is the following: (a) modification to lower temperature regimes; (b) advanced pilot systems (control and energy management systems, Internet of Things).\n6For bioenergy, please see footnote 5 \u2013 For geothermal: The lifecycle GHG emissions from the combined generation of heat/cool and power from geothermal energy are lower than 100 g CO\u2082e per 1 kWh of energy input to the combined generation. Lifecycle GHG emissions are calculated based on project-specific data, where available, using Commission Recommendation 2013/778/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 or ISO 14064-1:2018. Quantified lifecycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.\nAs countries step up their decarbonisation efforts, the proportion of greener and thus more sustainable energy will steadily rise. Alongside this trend, the energy world will also become increasingly decentralised. Electricity Networks had and further have to be adapted to fulfill their role in being the central platform to make the transition towards a more sustainable and decarbonised society a success. Applying smart technologies and consequently fostering the digitalisation of grid infrastructure allows us to manage our existing grids at high efficiency and at the same time expand our networks in a resource-efficient way. E.ON considers its Electricity Networks, in line with the described eligibility criteria for green financing, applying asset values. Projects at our Customer Solutions segment include investments in integrated embedded energy solutions for cities and businesses, electricity generation from renewable sources, manufacturing and storage of hydrogen, and charging stations for electric cars. One example is Medicon Village, a new life science research park in Sweden consisting of 80,000 square metres of office space and 40,000 square metres of laboratories. E.ON\u2019s innovative ectogrid technology ensures maximum waste heat recovery and efficiency by integrating heating and cooling generation in one system. This significantly reduces primary energy consumption and thus helps our customers to reduce carbon emissions. Considering the nature of the different projects and assets, these are considered in the Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency or Clean Transportation category.\n\nEvaluating and selecting projects\nE.ON\u2019s Green Bond Framework defines eligibility criteria. The process of evaluating and selecting assets and capital expenditures has several steps and draws on the expertise of several units and departments. The first step is for the Sustainability and Group Finance departments at Corporate Functions to identify potential assets and capital expenditures in the four categories (electricity networks, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean transportation). In consultation with the Sustainability department and experts from Energy Networks and Customer Solutions, the Accounting and Finance departments compile a list of eligible assets and capital expenditures. The Sustainability department is responsible for ensuring that eligible projects have no significant ESG concerns and comply with all relevant company policies and guidelines as set out in E.ON\u2019s Green Bond Framework. All assets and capital expenditures have to contribute significantly to climate change mitigation as one of the environmental objectives defined in the draft EU Taxonomy. The assets and capital expenditures must also fulfil the \u201cDo No Significant Harm\u201d criteria and \u201cMinimum Safeguards\u201d as defined in the EU Taxonomy. Finally, the E.ON Green Bond Committee \u2013 which consists of representatives of Sustainability, Energy Networks, Customer Solutions, and Group Finance as well as other subject experts and is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer \u2013 carefully reviews the nominated assets and capital expenditures and decides on their eligibility under E.ON\u2019s Green Bond Framework.\n\nThe eligibility criteria comply with the EU classification system for sustainable economic activities (the \u201cEU Taxonomy\u201d) as published in the draft Delegated Act for climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation activities of November 2020. In particular the Electricity Networks category is subject to a narrow eligibility definition:\n\n- While under the EU Taxonomy the entire European Interconnected System (to which all of EON\u2019s fully consolidated grids belong) is eligible, E.ON applies the EU Taxonomy\u2019s general thresholds, applicable for any grid outside the European Interconnected System\n- E.ON excludes any direct grid connections of energy production facilities above 100g of CO\u2082 per kWh.\n\nThe Green Bond Committee, which meets at least on an annual basis, monitors the eligible green project portfolio. It is also responsible for excluding assets and capital expenditures that no longer meet the eligibility criteria or have been disposed of and replacing them to the best degree possible. Assets are included in the portfolio at their current IFRS balance sheet value, which will be updated annually to reflect investment and depreciation under IFRS. Capital expenditures are included in the portfolio for the amount of the initial expenditure, subject to annual depreciation on a straight-line basis in accordance with the expected useful life of the investment.\n\nReporting\nE.ON\u2019s Green Bond Framework, the second-party opinion by Sustainalytics including an assessment on the alignment with the EU Taxonomy, and details are available on our website.\n\nThe annual reporting for the bonds, including disclosures on the metric tonnes of CO\u2082e avoided by the projects funded, will be published annually in the Sustainability Report.\nPortfolio of assets and capital expenditures allocated to Green Bonds along with impact KPI as of year-end 2020\n\nUse of bond proceeds for eligible Green Projects\n\n| Green activities          | Valuation                                      | Eligible assets & investments \u20ac millions | EU economic objective                  |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Electricity Networks      | Balance Sheet value                            | 16,674.8                                 | Climate change mitigation              |\n| Renewable Energy          | Balance Sheet value                            | 193.1                                    | Climate change mitigation              |\n| Energy Efficiency         | Capital expenditures, considering annual depreciation | 162.3                                   | Climate change mitigation              |\n| Clean Transportation      | Balance Sheet value                            | 89.2                                     | Climate change mitigation              |\n|                           |                                                | **17,119.3**                             |                                        |\n\nE.ON\u2019s Green Bond portfolio consists of \u20ac17,119.3 million in eligible projects and assets. As of year-end 2020, E.ON had issued \u20ac4,600 million in Green Bonds (details on outstanding Green Bonds see page 118), leaving \u20ac12,519.3 million unallocated. E.ON considers projects in the Energy Efficiency category referring to capital expenditures and applies IFRS book values for the remaining categories. Accordingly, reporting the amount or share of new projects provides for no meaningful information as the year-on-year development of book values always is a net figure considering both, investments into new assets and depreciation of existing assets. Considering only the capital expenditures in the Energy Efficiency category for the reporting year results in a share of new projects of ~1%.\n### Impact reporting for allocated portfolio\n\n| Category                        | Avoided emissions (million metric tonnes CO\u2082e) | Total renewable capacity (GW) | Renewable capacity added (GW) | Relative share of renewable capacity in total capacity (%) | Heat delivered to new connections (GWh) | Efficiency improvement (%) | Smart meters installed (thousand units) | Number of EV charging points |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Electricity Networks**       |                                               |                               |                               |                                                          |                                        |                           |                                        |                                  |\n| Grid connections of renewable energy | 59.06                                         | 70.42                         | 2.58                          | 84                                                       |                                        |                           |                                        |                                  |\n| Smart grid components installed | 0.16                                          |                               |                               |                                                          |                                        |                           |                                        |                                  |\n| **Renewable Energy**           |                                               |                               |                               |                                                          |                                        |                           |                                        |                                  |\n| Renewable energy production and storage units | 0.31                                          | 0.35                          | 0.06                          |                                                          |                                        |                           |                                        |                                  |\n| **Energy Efficiency**          |                                               |                               |                               |                                                          |                                        |                           |                                        |                                  |\n| Integrated on-site business and city energy solutions | 0.25                                          |                               |                               |                                                          |                                        |                           |                                        |                                  |\n| **Clean Transportation**       |                                               |                               |                               |                                                          |                                        |                           |                                        |                                  |\n| Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and supporting infrastructure | 0.03                                          |                               |                               |                                                          |                                        |                           |                                        | 9,484                            |\n\n1.

It is therefore appropriate for E.ON, a company whose corporate headquarters and main activities are in Europe but that also operates elsewhere. E.ON SE\u2019s shareholder base is broadly diversified by type (retail, institutional) and region. No shareholder holds a controlling interest in E.ON SE. E.ON was notified in December 2020 that RWE Aktiengesellschaft holds an (indirect) stake of 15 per cent and in July 2020 that The Capital Group Companies, Inc. holds an (indirect) stake of 9.99 per cent of E.ON\u2019s share capital. Furthermore, E.ON was notified in April 2020 that Capital Income Builder holds a (partially indirect) stake of 4.90 per cent of E.ON\u2019s share capital. In January 2021 Blackrock, Inc. notified E.ON that it holds an (indirect) stake of 4.92 per cent of E.ON\u2019s share capital, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board notified E.ON in June 2020 that it holds a (partially indirect) stake of 5.02 per cent of E.ON\u2019s share capital. In January 2021 E.ON was notified that DWS Investment GmbH holds an (indirect) stake of 3.02 per cent of E.ON\u2019s share capital.\n\n102-6: Markets served\n\n102-7: Scale of the organisation\n\nIn general, E.ON manages all of its units and action areas from a long-term perspective.

Second, our research indicates that the overall water risks in the European countries in which E.ON is active are low to intermediate and, according to trend scenarios, are predicted to remain so. Third, due to the profile and locations of the suppliers, our supply chain does not, from today\u2019s perspective, pose any discernible water risks. The integration of innogy and its affiliates has brought new operations into the E.ON Group. In 2020 we began to assess these operations\u2019 environmental impact, including their water use.

In Germany, for example, vulnerable customers can contact E.ON\u2019s payment assistance team. One solution is for them to pay in instalments without interest or fees. E.ON can also put them in touch with job centres, social service agencies, and debt counselling. Disconnecting a customer is always our very last option. Customers receive four overdue payment letters before being disconnected. Only customers with an unpaid balance of more than \u20ac250 are disconnected; under German law, customers may be disconnected with an unpaid balance of \u20ac100.

KPIs that reflect these standards are indicated by the DVFA/EFFAS ID.\n\nOur KPIs include PreussenElektra\u2019s business operations. The business operations at the Renewables segment that we transferred to RWE are included in our KPIs until late September 2019. A separate innogy segment, consisting mainly of network and sales businesses, became part of the E.ON Group on 18 September 2019. Consequently, last year\u2019s reporting included a number of innogy KPIs after this date. This year, the 2019 KPIs of E.ON and innogy were aggregated in order to foster comparability and transparency. As a rule, KPIs include both entities from 2019 on. Any exceptions due to time frames, availability of data, and internal collating and reporting processes are clearly indicated. 2020 figures, however, refer to the scope of the new E.ON without exception. The abbreviation n/a indicates when a figure isn\u2019t applicable, an en-dash (\u2013), when a figure is unavailable.\n\nReviewed disclosures display the icon.

We draw on the Global Compact\u2019s ten principles when establishing our own standards and guidelines. Our participation in Global Compact networks at the national and international level fosters collaboration across industries.\n\nReporting on the principles of the Global Compact\nOur commitment to the Global Compact includes reporting annually on our progress in implementing the ten principles (Communication on Progress, or COP), which is part of our Sustainability Report. The table below specifies which sections of the report address which principles. The company policies and guidelines listed there are available for download in our sustainability channel.\n### Human rights\n\n**Principle 1:** Support and respect internationally proclaimed human rights\n\n**Principle 2:** Eliminate any participation in human rights abuses\n\n### Labour\n\n**Principle 3:** Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining\n\n**Principle 4:** Eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labour\n\n**Principle 5:** Eliminate child labour\n\n**Principle 6:** Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation\n\n### Environment\n\n**Principle 7:** Support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges\n\n**Principle 8:** Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility\n\n**Principle 9:** Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies\n\n### Anti-corruption\n\n**Principle 10:** Work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery\n\n---\n\n**Cross-references in the report**\n\n- Human rights and supplier management\n- Compliance and anti-corruption\n- Good corporate governance\n- Climate protection\n- Environmental management\n- Lower-carbon households\n- Cleaner companies, greener communities\n- Good corporate governance\n- Sustainability strategy and material topics\n- Compliance and anti-corruption\n- Good corporate governance\n- Stakeholder engagement\n\n**Guidelines and policies**\n\n- Human rights policy statement\n- E.ON Code of Conduct\n- Supplier Code of Conduct\n- Slavery and human trafficking statement\n- E.ON Health, Safety, Environment and Climate Protection Policy Statement\n- SDG Self-Commitment by the E.ON Board of Management\n- Climate Commitment\n- E.ON Sustainability Strategy\n- Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)\n- E.ON Code of Conduct\n- People Guideline on Anti-corruption\n- Supplier Code of Conduct\n- E.ON Sustainability Strategy\nIndependent Practitioner\u2019s Report on a Limited Assurance Engagement on Sustainability Information\n\nTo E.ON SE, Essen\n\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the disclosures denoted with \u201c\u2610\u201d in the sustainability report of E.ON SE, Essen (hereinafter: \u201cthe Company\u201d), for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020 (hereinafter: \u201cthe Report\u201d). Our engagement in this context relates solely to the disclosures denoted with the symbol \u201c\u2610\u201d.\n\nResponsibilities of the Executive Directors\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Report in accordance with the principles stated in the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter: \u201cGRI-Criteria\u201d) and for the selection of the disclosures to be evaluated.\n\nThis responsibility of Company\u2019s executive directors includes the selection and application of appropriate methods of sustainability reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual sustainability disclosures, which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a Report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIndependence and Quality Control of the Audit Firm\n\nWe have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other ethical requirements.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards \u2013 in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (\u201cBerufssatzung f\u00fcr Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer und vereidigte Buchpr\u00fcfer\u201d; \u201cBS WP/vBP\u201d) as well as the Standard on Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality control for audit firms (IDW Qualit\u00e4tssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an die Qualit\u00e4tssicherung in der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcferpraxis - IDW QS 1) \u2013 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nPractitioner\u2019s Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the disclosures denoted with \u201c\u2610\u201d in the Report based on the assurance engagement we have performed. Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to in the Report.\n\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to allow us to conclude with limited assurance that nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the disclosures denoted with \u201c\u2610\u201d in the Company\u2019s Report for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020 have not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the relevant GRI-Criteria. This does not mean that a separate conclusion is expressed on each disclosure so denoted.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained.
