During the 2021 General Meeting, 13 members were elected by multiple votes, including eight independent members, compared to three in 2020. Of the total, eight were appointed by the Vale Nomination Committee and four by shareholders. The employee representative director is elected in a specific vote.\n\nVale's structural change in corporate governance elected a **Board of Directors** with eight independent members\nAs a reflection of this change, we now have a Board of Directors that is committed to consolidating solid governance following the best international practices for a Corporation. The Board has given full attention to the cultural evolution of the company, prioritizing Vale\u2019s strategic reorientation and our commitment to the ESG agenda. A new Innovation Committee has given more visibility to innovation and the application of new technologies in processes, products and our climate agenda. This formation has led to rich and plural discussions, guided by a necessary critical view of Vale, in order to mitigate risks and maximize the company\u2019s delivery of value to its stakeholders.\n\nWe also monitor on a regular basis Vale\u2019s Global Integrated Risk Map, and we follow closely the progress of the Dams Decharacterization Plan. There has been an advance of about 23% in the decharacterization of structures and, by 2022, the forecast is to decharacterize five more upstream structures, reaching 40% of the plan. The plan also foresees the decharacterization of all upstream structures in Brazil by 2035.\n\nAnother topic of attention has been Vale\u2019s climate strategy, which includes commitments aligned with the Paris Agreement, such as being carbon neutral by 2050 in Scopes 1 and 2, considering projects and technologies focused on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonization. We increased our competitiveness in the iron ore business by developing the high-quality product portfolio with innovative and disruptive products such as the \u201cgreen briquette\u201d. We set a Scope 3 climate target and are actively engaging in partnerships with customers to decarbonize the global steel industry.\n\nAlso, in the year, as a result of the structural and cultural changes that Vale has been going through, the company designed its new Social Ambition - focused on the creation of a positive legacy for society. This is a vision that aims to prevent repetition of the damage, such as that caused by Vale at Brumadinho, to encourage resilient communities, and to work in the direction of sustainable mining.\n\nWe also focused on continuing our strategy of divesting non-core assets, highlighting the binding agreement signed for the sale of the Moatize coal mine and the Nacala Logistics Corridor. We are close to completing the full reshaping of our business portfolio, focusing on opportunities in Iron Ore, Copper and Nickel.\n\nSpeaking of the future, in 2022 Vale\u2019s Board of Directors will be elected at a General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. Continuing the evolution observed in 2021, we have set a Nomination Committee, composed mainly of independent directors, to structure the process for nominating candidates. The continuity and complementation of the mandate of the collegiate elected at the 2021 AGM was recommended as fundamental for the consolidation of Vale\u2019s new governance.\n\nWe know that we have many challenges to address, and we are attentive to the issues of greatest impact for Vale and its stakeholders, to seek safe productivity and to promote confidence in the operation of our assets, as well as to the challenges related to the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, in particular the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nFinally, despite the challenges, 2021 was a year of important advances, especially in terms of strengthening the governance structure necessary to ensure a better Vale, where I would like to highlight the creation of the Executive Vice-presidency of Sustainability. For the coming years, we will continue to be attentive to the demands of our stakeholders and committed to make the necessary transformations for Vale to represent to everyone, and especially to society, a safe and reliable company, operating under the concept of sustainable mining.\n\nJos\u00e9 Luciano Duarte Penido\nChairman of the Board of Directors of Vale\n\nWe are attentive to the pursuit of safe productivity and to promote confidence in the operation of assets\nLetter from the CEO  GRI 102-14\n\nWe are living a moment of deep transformation of the world, of mining and of Vale. On this journey, we seek to walk together with society, with responsibility, transparency and coherence. We arrive at places uninvited, so, in addition to mitigating the negative impacts, we want, as our social ambition states \u201cTo be a partner company in the development of resilient communities, engaged in relevant issues to humanity and committed to sustainable mining\u201d.\n\nJanuary 25 marked three years since the collapse of dam B1, the saddest day in our history. The tragedy, which will never be forgotten, caused the death of 270 people and several socio-environmental impacts, and made evident the need for us to learn together from everything that happened, to transform ourselves and assume the commitment that tragedies like this do not happen again and that no life are lost in our company.\n\nThus, in 2021, we settled an agreement with the Justice Institutions and the State of Minas Gerais, aiming at the continuity of the reparation initiatives that have been carried out since the occurrence of the tragedy, in 2019, with an estimated amount of BRL 37.7 billion. In addition to this, more than 11.4 thousand people have already been indemnified, with individual and labor agreements signed.\n\nRegarding dam safety, a critical point in our operations, we had important advances during the year. We updated our plan to decharacterize and eliminate upstream structures, which now includes 30 geotechnical structures, 100% of the portfolio of dams and Tailings Storage Facilities (EARs in Portuguese), of which seven have already been decharacterized since 2019. With this our commitment was also updated: decharacterize 60% of upstream dams in Brazil by 2025, 90% by 2029 and 100% by 2035. We completed the construction of downstream containment structures for all dams at emergency level 3.\n\nRegarding the critical point of dam safety, we concluded the decharacterization of the seventh upstream dam since 2019.\nWe advanced in the implementation of solutions and technologies for monitoring, using radar, satellite images and drones to follow conservation status and soil displacement, among other control technologies. We seek to advance in the use of tailings to produce new materials, fostering the circular economy, and in natural humidity processing as a substitute for wet processing.\n\nAmong the themes of greatest impact and influence at Vale are contributions to the fight against climate change. Our goal is to zero our net emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1 and 2), and to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 15% by 2035. The efforts of our low carbon agenda contributed to our recognition as one of the leading companies in the Climate Change Program at the CDP Latin America Awards 2021. In the same year, we published our first report on climate change, in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nIn addition to investing in sustainable products, such as the \u2018green briquette\u2019, we continued our strategy of divesting non-core assets in 2021. As for productivity, we recorded a 5% increase in iron ore production, still below expectations for the period, due to the lower-than-expected performance at S11D (our largest mining complex, located in the municipality of Cana\u00e3 dos Caraj\u00e1s, Brazil) and we had impacts on base metals production due to the employee strike in Sudbury, Canada, for about two months. At the time, Vale continued negotiations for ratification of a new agreement, signed in August 2021.\n\nWe recorded pro-forma adjusted from continuing operations EBITDA of USD 31.3 billion, USD 13.8 billion higher than the previous year, due to higher iron ore and pellet sales volumes and the prices charged, which also contributed to a USD 15.0 billion increase in net operating revenues from continuing operations, which totaled USD 54.5 billion in 2021. Payments for taxes and royalties totaled USD 7.7 billion and our investments totaled USD 5.2 billion in the year, of which USD 4.2 billion were dedicated to the maintenance of operations.\n\nWith three priority pillars \u2013 sustainable mining, resilient communities, and global causes \u2013 we define our social ambition with commitments related to creating social value, promoting education, health and income generation, and protecting human rights. More than projects, we want to articulate alliances and promote structuring programs capable of contributing to social justice and to the autonomy of communities.\n\nRegarding these aspects, from the management point of view, we reached 100% of Vale\u2019s operations with risk assessment for human rights violations. We also undertook external due diligence in all operations and critical projects in three-year cycles. Also, to ensure Human Rights, with the understanding that mining can only be carried out with Free, Prior and Informed Consent, and with legislation that allows and adequately regulates the activity, we have renounced all our mining processes on indigenous lands in Brazil, which includes requirements for research and mining.\n\nStrengthening a culture oriented to diversity, equity and inclusion is a priority. We anticipate to 2025 our commitment to double the representativeness of women in our workforce (from 13% to 26%), we have established the goal of reaching 40% of leadership in Brazil made up of black people by 2026, and we have strengthened our anti-racist positioning. Also as part of the cultural transformation process experienced by the company, our Whistleblowing Channel was restructured, with a 33.8% increase in the number of reports received. All confirmed violations triggered correction plans.\n\nIn socioeconomic expenditures in the territories, we spent USD 473.5 million on social actions. Through the Vale Foundation, our initiatives impacted more than 860 thousand people in 50 municipalities in six Brazilian states. In addition, since 2020, we have donated over USD 153 million to governments and institutions in Brazil and abroad for Covid-19 related humanitarian aid actions.\n\nIn 2022, we will complete 80 years of operation. Over these decades, we have learned that our role goes beyond mining and, for this reason, in all of Vale\u2019s decisions, people are at the center. We seek, as our purpose says, to improve lives and transform the future. Together.\n\nEduardo Bartolomeo\nVale CEO\nIn this second year of the Integrated Report, referring to the period between January 1 and December 31, 2021, we share our learnings, challenges and advances of reflecting on and listening to our different stakeholders. This document provides indicators, management approaches, and accountability on relevant environmental, social and governance topics, according to our materiality matrix (see Materiality). The information comprises the companies over which Vale has operational control and their activities identified on Form 20-F, GRI 102-45, 102-46, 102-49, 102-50.\n\nThe document preparation is aligned with the guidelines of the International Integrated Reporting Framework (Value Reporting Foundation). This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Comprehensive option, and includes the Mining and Metals Sector Supplement. We report our efforts to adhere to the Mining Principles of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), of which we are an active member. This report and its appendices also include indicators from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the World Economic Forum (WEF) key metrics, and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nPwC performed limited assurance on the report according to the Assurance Report on page 122. The Integrated Report 2021 has been checked and approved by the Executive Committee, the Sustainability Committee, and the Board of Directors, GRI 102-32, 102-54, 102-56.\n\nMore information about Vale\u2019s results is available at:\n- 20-F, Report from Administration, Tax Transparency Report and Reference Form\n- Report of Governance\n- ESG Portal\n- Reparation Report\n- Other editions of Vale\u2019s sustainability reports, GRI 102-51, 102-52\n\nConversion adopted for the dollar amounts published in this report: throughout the report, the amounts in Brazilian reais were converted to USD at the rate of BRL 5.39, with the exception of the financial disclosure figures, already published in other Vale documents.\n\nOn April 28, 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") filed suit against Vale in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging that certain Vale disclosures violated U.S. securities laws. The lawsuit focuses on disclosures related to Vale\u2019s dam safety management prior to the tragic dam failure in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil in January 2019. Vale denies the SEC\u2019s allegations, including the allegation that its disclosures violated U.S. law, and will vigorously defend this case. The Company reiterates the commitment it made right after the rupture of the dam, and which has guided it since then, to the remediation and compensation of the damages caused by the event.\n\nNote 1: This document may include statements that present Vale\u2019s current expectations regarding future events or results. All forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties. Vale cannot guarantee that such statements will prove to be accurate. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, factors related to: (a) countries where Vale operates, especially Brazil and Canada; (b) the global economy; (c) capital markets; (d) mining and metals prices and their dependence on global industrial production, which is cyclical in nature; (e) the high degree of global competition in the markets where Vale operates; (f) mining and tailings storage operations; and (g) the estimation of mineral resources and reserves, their exploration and the development of mining facilities, our ability to obtain or renew new licenses, and the depletion and exhaustion of mines and mineral reserves and resources.

The VPS is results-focused and provides for the deep and comprehensive implementation of policies and practices to enable safe and environmentally responsible operations and ensure the integrity of our assets. The VPS contains practices that must be adopted daily by all employees. These practices are based on three dimensions: leadership, technical and management, which in turn break down into 17 elements. Each element has minimum compliance requirements that are verified in annual cycles of formal assessments conducted by the 2nd Line of Defense. Learn more about here.\n\nThe VPS is a management model in constant evolution that consolidates and continuously improves its approach, methods, techniques, and tools used according to what has been learned. Its application is mandatory: being adopted globally in operational and administrative areas.\nFocus on Reparation\n\nBrumadinho and evacuated territories\n\nWe will never forget Brumadinho and we remain determined to provide comprehensive reparation and to compensate the damage caused to people and territories by the collapse of the B1 Dam at the C\u00f3rrego do Feij\u00e3o Mine in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil. In addition to the 270 fatalities, five of whom were still unaccounted for as of the publication of this report, the dam\u2019s rupture caused profound environmental and social impacts.\n\nWe understand the profound significance that locating the remains of the missing victims has for the affected families. For this reason, we continue to give priority and unrestricted support to the continuity of the search conducted by the Fire Department of Minas Gerais, which has entered a new phase. Four automated search stations have been implemented to operate simultaneously, while a fifth (reserve) station is available, increasing the efficiency of the activity and the safety of those involved. Our connection with the association representing the victims\u2019 relatives and the support of the Forensic Medical Institute have been invaluable throughout this process and we are very thankful for both.\n\nIn line with the Judicial Comprehensive Reparation Agreement signed with the Justice Institutions and the State of Minas Gerais in February 2021 and homologated by court decision in April, we reaffirmed our commitments to continue the initiatives underway since 2019. The total amount of the agreement, estimated at BRL 37.7 billion (BRL 23 billion have already been disbursed since the document was signed), will fund Vale\u2019s obligations to do and to pay, encompassing socioeconomic and socio-environmental reparation actions for the damage resulting from the dam failure. This amount does not include compensations referring to individual rights, which follow their normal flow of execution by Vale.\n\nThe actions of the Agreement have been detailed and implemented together with society. The socio-economic projects in...\nBrumadinho and 25 municipalities of the Paraopeba River Basin were submitted for popular consultation conducted by the State of Minas Gerais Government in November 2021. More than 10,000 people participated in the consultation and were able to indicate priority areas for investments in socio-economic repair projects in their cities.\n\nThe implementation of the actions foreseen in the agreement poses challenges to all the parties. Through several weekly meetings, involving different technical and coordination groups, the difficulties of governance and interpretation of details of the Agreement have been overcome. At Vale we have the challenge of detailing hundreds of projects defined by the communities and municipalities of the affected municipalities, aligning schedules and budgets with current restrictions, and delivering projects that add the expected value to the territories.\n\nAlthough we know we have a long way to go, we share the advances in the commitments made in the Comprehensive Reparations Agreement, on the socioeconomic and environmental fronts.\n\nThe disbursed amount of the Agreement also includes BRL 4.4 billion to deploy the Income Transfer Program (PTR), which replaced the Emergency Payment.\n\nMore than 11,400 people have already been compensated, with individual and labour agreements signed. Out of a total of BRL 3 billion committed, BRL 2.6 billion have already been paid out under the formalized agreements.\n\nThe reparation actions are validated by public and justice institutions: the Government of Minas Gerais, Public Prosecution Office of the State of Minas Gerais, Federal Public Prosecution Office, Public Defender\u2019s Office of the State of Minas Gerais. Reparation actions have been inspected by independent audits: Getulio Vargas Foundation for socio-economic reparations and EY for financial issues.

We never imagined that the dam in Brumadinho could break. Neither could our family members. They imagined they were in the safest place in the world. They loved working for the company, they were proud to wear the uniform. And today, all that is left is a lot of pain, suffering and longing. We expect the company to have a transparent dialogue with the employees, inform them if there is any risk of loss of life, and to do everything to prevent it. For us family members, everything that has happened is very difficult.\u201d\n\nAlexandra Andrade, president of Avabrum (Association of Families of Victims and People Affected by the C\u00f3rrego do Feij\u00e3o Mine Dam Collapse in Brumadinho)\nSOCIO-ECONOMIC REPARATION\n\nOn the socio-economic front, we continue to work together with communities to rebuild infrastructure and promote livelihoods. Initiatives include:\n\n- The Family Referral Program, created in 2019 to provide psycho-social assistance. About 94% of eligible families have joined the program so far (approximately 3,500 people).\n\n- Conclusion of the construction of a new daycare centre for the Palhano community in Brumadinho (MG), with a capacity to care for 108 children, from infants to 5 years old;\n\n- Renovation of the Cachoeira do Choro Community Association in Curvelo (MG), benefiting at least 70 people;\n\n- Delivery of 5,500 new pieces of equipment to 143 Basic Health Units in 15 municipalities served (Brumadinho, Mario Campos, Sarzedo, Inha\u00fama, Par\u00e1 de Minas, Paraopeba, Pomp\u00e9u, S\u00e3o Joaquim de Bicas, Fortuna de Minas, Papagaio, Pequi, Morada Nova de Minas, Itabirito, Nova Lima and Bar\u00e3o de Cocais), in addition to the training of 2,168 health professionals, benefiting the population of these cities, which amounts to about 400,000 people;\n\n- Construction of a social center for the victims\u2019 families, serving about 100 people a day since February 2021;\n\n- Ongoing works for Territ\u00f3rio Park, a joint action with residents for the urban development of C\u00f3rrego do Feij\u00e3o, with the purpose of rescuing the bond of the population with the territory, besides enabling a new dynamic for the local economy, less dependent on mining. The project foresees social spaces such as a grove, trails, an overlook, a school, and a soccer field, in addition to a community market and a culture and crafts centre, where local businesses will operate, which have been receiving consulting services and resources for professionalization. The area will be managed by the community itself, which has been participating in training workshops to sustainably manage these spaces since July 2021. The objective is to turn Territ\u00f3rio Park into a tourist destination and combine quality of life with jobs and income generation of. Twenty percent of the work has already been completed;\n\n- Deployment of sewage collection and treatment systems is underway in the Pires community, in Brumadinho, serving 500 people;\n\n- 75 organizations and 61 projects enrolled in the Valorizar Program public notice, and 28 have been awarded in several categories, such as Work and Income Generation, Tourism, and Education and Culture, totaling an investment of BRL 1.4 million in local projects;\n\n- Supporting small entrepreneurs with income generation, professional qualification in construction or gardening, and expansion of production capacity for 300 farmers;\n\n- Encouraging tourism \u2013 one of the levers to diversify the local economy, generate employment and income, and reduce dependence on mining. Through the Strengthening the Competitiveness of the Private Tourism Sector project, in partnership with Circuito Veredas, we have supported the qualification of entrepreneurs, to help them structure their businesses and improve and expand their services and offers. The project takes place in Brumadinho, Igarap\u00e9, Juatuba, M\u00e1rio Campos and S\u00e3o Joaquim de Bicas and has been extended until June 2023. In addition to providing training for 50 entrepreneurs since 2020, we will support new entrepreneurs, totalling 90 beneficiaries in total.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want reparation. Reparation is for the damage they have done. We want compensation. I want to tell my children in the future, I want to be able to say: Ant\u00f4nio Pereira was like this, but the company provided support and today we are developed. We want a better district and we are able to make it happen.\u201d\n\nResident of the Ant\u00f4nio Pereira district, Ouro Preto/Minas Gerais (Source: 2021 RepTrak Survey)\nENVIRONMENTAL REPARATION\n\nRemoving tailings is our first step to achieving environmental reparation. Environmental reparation planning begins as tailings removal progresses and affected areas are cleared by the Fire Department, with all projects submitted for approval by the environmental agencies before any activity begins. So far, of the approximately nine million cubic meters of material to be removed from the channel of the Ferro-Carv\u00e3o stream due to the collapse of Dam B1, more than 50% have been moved and are in the process of final disposal.\n\nConsidering the areas impacted by the rupture and its surroundings, we have reforested 26 hectares (of a total of 140) by planting approximately 30,000 seedlings of species native to the region. This process began with the collection of fruits and seeds in the region\u2019s forests. We have collected about 600 kg of fruits and seeds from 80 different species so far. Thousands of seedlings have been produced from this, including those at the Vale Natural Reserve in Linhares, Esp\u00edrito Santo state, for planting in Brumadinho. Preliminary monitoring results from the areas in recovery indicate the presence of dispersing and pollinating species that will contribute to the recovery process.\n\nThe monitoring of the water quality of the Paraopeba River is a central factor for the repair operations throughout the entire basin, because as long as the raw water is not adequate for abstraction, the riverside populations and rural producers along the river banks continue to be served with a constant supply of mineral water, water tank trucks and water from new wells drilled, for animal watering and irrigation. The distribution of water involves a large logistical operation, drastically increasing the circulation of large trucks through the communities, which brings inconveniences of dust, noise, and increased circulation of outsiders in the impacted municipalities.\n\nSince January 2019, the water quality of the Paraopeba River has been monitored by the Water Management Institute of Minas Gerais (IGAM) and Vale. Significant results of iron and aluminum were identified in stretches most impacted by the contribution of tailings, with attenuation as we move away from the confluence region of the Ferro-Carv\u00e3o stream with the Paraopeba River. The iron and manganese contents, in total form, show an increase during the rainy season and a reduction during the dry season, and the current condition indicates that the water quality is in a transition phase, with a progressive reduction in the metal concentrations.\n\nDetailed results of the monitoring of the water quality of the Paraopeba River in the stretch impacted by the rupture are available at Vale website.\n\nA factor preventing the stabilization of a faster pace for environmental remediation in the areas impacted in Brumadinho is the fact that the work will only move forward after the final release by the Fire Department of the areas for total tailings removal, once the search operations for each stretch of land under analysis have been completed. We are confident that the new search stations in operation will allow a major advance in the pace of the search operations, which will speed up the entire flow of management and final disposal of the tailings and revegetation of the impacted areas.\n\nIn C\u00f3rrego do Feij\u00e3o, the foundations have been completed and now the structures are being built for the memorial to honour the victims, scheduled to be unveiled in January 2023. The project, designed by architect Gustavo Penna, involved the participation of the entire local community and Avabrum. Our intention is to build a space of belonging, identification and collective interest and a memorial to the victims of the tragedy.\n\nEVACUATED TERRITORIES\n\nSince the collapse of Dam B1 in Brumadinho, we have adopted more conservative dam assessment standards. In this sense, we have adopted preventive procedures for removing people from risk areas when recommended through timely monitoring of the dams. (read more in Dams)\n\nAlthough our structuring actions have evolved in the territories, we are aware of the impacts and our failure to meet expectations at times. We try to learn from these cases and remain vigilant of residents\u2019 needs, advancing our execution of projects and delivery of new or revitalized public equipment to the communities.\n\nIn the territories where emergency evacuations occurred \u2013 Bar\u00e3o de Cocais, Nova Lima, Itabirito, and preventive actions in Ouro Preto \u2013 based on dialogue with the residents and public authorities of each municipality, we advanced the construction and execution of the Compensation and Development Plans. We have invested a total of BRL190 million to minimize the impacts caused by elevated dam safety requirements.\n\nOne of the goals of our operations in 2021 was to encourage the creation of new business fronts and to strengthen existing production chains, thus contributing to increase the family income of the population and diversify the economy. Since March 2021, we have trained more than 1,200 entrepreneurs directly and indirectly in the evacuated municipalities through the Horizonte Project, which encourages innovative solutions to the problems residents face. Of these, 39 projects are being accelerated and, as a whole, entrepreneurs will receive more than BRL2.3 million in seed capital to start their activities.\n## ONGOING ACTIONS IN THE EVACUATED TERRITORIES\n\n| Municipality | Dam/site and Emergency Level | Projects in progress or completed in 2021 | Key Challenges |\n|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Nova Lima    | B3/B4 Dam, Mar Azul Mine (emergency level 3) | \u2022 Launching the Horizonte Project, which seeks to boost local entrepreneurship and stimulate initiatives with innovative solutions to the problems faced by local residents; \u2022 Renovating the Capela Velha Football Field, the Jardim Amanda court and the Marcinho and Grota Fria bridges; | \u2022 Accelerate the region's reparation and development program; \u2022 Close the existing ACP (Public Civil Actions) in the territory via conciliation (CEJUSC); |\n| Bar\u00e3o de Cocais | Sul Superior Dam, Gongo Soco Mine (emergency level 3) | \u2022 Building the Territorial Development and Social Transformation Program; \u2022 Supporting entrepreneurship projects and local projects; \u2022 Acting to protect cultural and religious heritage; \u2022 Revitalizing Pra\u00e7a da Lagoa; \u2022 Supporting and strengthening public health; \u2022 Supporting and structuring the Bar\u00e3o de Cocais Emergency Care Unit (UPA); | \u2022 Conclude the indemnity process with the relocated families who opted for the extrajudicial solution; \u2022 Address frequent requests from the population to complete the decharacterization plan of the Sul Superior Dam ahead of schedule, which is not recommended due to the complexity of the works; |\n| Norte Laranjeiras Dam, Brucutu Mine (emergency level downgraded from 2 to 1 in November 2021) | \u2022 Reinforcing the public health network with the inauguration of the new Basic Health Unit (UBS) Nossa Senhora de Bonsucesso, in addition to training more than two hundred professionals through the Health Cycle program and renovating half of the city's ambulance fleet, as well as donating more than 450 items to the city's UBSs, including stretchers, thermometers, oximeters, chairs for blood collection, computers, tablets, routers, chairs and tables through the Health Cycle program; \u2022 Holding public consultations with 300 people from the S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Ba\u00e7\u00e3o community about paving the remaining 5.2 km of the MG-030 access stretch to the district, held in 2021; \u2022 Conducting a study of conceptual solutions to minimize flooding in the Itabirito River, with the objective of helping municipal management find solutions for flood prevention; \u2022 Illuminating tourist spots; \u2022 Building Itabirito's Territorial Development and Social Transformation Program, to foster the city's protagonism and local entrepreneurship culture, with the participation of 35 individual entrepreneurs and 14 associations from Itabirito; \u2022 Completing the renovation and construction of courts in five municipal schools in Itabirito; | \u2022 Complete indemnities; \u2022 Return Secondary Safety Zone (ZSS) families to their original homes; |\n| Itabirito | Forquilha I, II and III Dams, and Grupo, at the F\u00e1brica Mine: Forquilha I, II and Group: emergency level 2 Forquilha III: emergency level 3 | \u2022 Completing the renovation and construction of courts in five municipal schools in Itabirito; |\nIn Conselheiro Lafaiete, 648 students were preventively relocated due to the technical reassessment of the stability of a waste rock pile in the operations near Meridional School.

Learn more about our initiatives.\nThe Renova Foundation and reparation in Mariana\n\nNineteen people died and thousands of livelihoods were impacted due to the breach of the Fund\u00e3o Dam in Mariana (MG) on November 5, 2015. The dam was operated by Samarco through a joint venture with an equal stake owned by Vale and BHP (50%/50%).\n\nReparation in Mariana has been a complex and challenging mission, both because of the breadth of territories impacted by the rupture of the Fund\u00e3o Dam, and because of the multiple social, cultural and economic characteristics of the region, which covers 39 municipalities in two states (Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo).\n\nThroughout this period, the Renova Foundation, created in 2016 through the Transaction and Conduct Adjustment Agreement (TTAC), has followed through with the commitment to fully repair the damage caused to all those affected and the environment. In December 2021, BRL 20.2 billion had already been disbursed by the Renova Foundation for the reparation, of which BRL 19.6 billion of financial resources and spent BRL 0.6 billion on administrative/governance expenses. Since its creation, the three sponsors have contributed BRL 19.6 billion of financial resources and spent BRL 20.2 billion: BRL 18.0 billion in reparatory programs, BRL 1.6 billion in compensatory programs, and BRL 0.6 billion in administrative/governance expenses. Expected disbursements in 2022 are BRL 10.4 billion, and a further BRL 6.5 billion approximately by the end of the Foundation\u2019s mission.\n\nEXPENDITURES FROM 2015 TO 2021 (in BRL million):\n\n| Year | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | Total |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|\n|      | 1,349| 1,770| 2,132| 2,720| 3,644| 8,413| 20,152|       |\n\nIn August 2018, the Governance Conduct Adjustment Term (TAC) was signed, which changed the governance established in the TTAC to a more independent and participatory model. This model involves more than 70 entities working in partnership with the support of more than 25 universities and 40 NGOs and partners; about 6,000 people who contribute to obtaining solutions to the challenges together; and the direct participation of the local committees of those affected to negotiate indemnities and advance solutions in the resettlement process.\n\nThese two agreements continue to guide the actions of the Renova Foundation. Vale will continue to seek an expedited reparation through Renova\u2019s governance bodies and is open to discussions to seek an expedited reparation through Renova\u2019s governance bodies and is open to discussions that may speed up the reparation efforts. Vale is aware that the speed of the Mariana reparation does not meet society\u2019s expectations and has been supporting to speed up this process.\n\nADVANCES AND CHALLENGES IN INDIVIDUAL INDEMNITIES\n\nWith regard to the indemnity process, the Mediated Indemnity Program (PIM in Portuguese) was initially installed to pay emergency financial aid and individual indemnities. However, a challenge was identified from the beginning: how to compensate informal workers, such as fishermen, cart drivers, washerwomen and artisans, who had no way to prove the damage caused to them by the rupture.\n\nA new solution came through a court decision, which instituted the Simplified Indemnity System (Novel), in August 2020, which allowed for advances in the compensation process. By December 2021, more than 363,000 people along the Rio Doce River Basin had received BRL 8.7 billion in total indemnities and emergency financial aid (AEFs) paid out. Of this total, more than 51,800 people along the Rio Doce River Basin received BRL 5.1 billion in indemnities paid through the Simplified Indemnity System.\n\nDELAYS IN THE RESETTLEMENT PROCESS\n\nThe Renova Foundation faces challenges related to the resettlement process that have contributed to delays, mainly related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Of about 600 consultations planned for the restitution of the right to housing in the resettlement process, 107 were concluded by 2021.\n\nThe process relies on the participation of the community and other stakeholders, such as justice institutions and government agencies. In parallel to housing construction, initiatives are underway to provide integrated support to micro and small businesses, which serve, in addition to the rest of the territory, about 160 families from the resettlements; support school and cultural integration activities; provide integrated support to micro and small businesses, which serve, in addition to the rest of the territory, about 160 families from the resettlements; support school and cultural integration activities; and provide guardianship and protection for rescued animals, among others. All these initiatives make up an integrated solution to restore the affected population\u2019s rights to shelter and livelihoods.\nATTENDANCES IN 2021\n\n| Bento Rodrigues Collective | Family Resettlement | Pecuniary Assistance | Gesteira Services |\n|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| 46                         | 25*                 | 9                    | 27               |\n| (42 Houses and 4 Public Assets) |                     |                      |                  |\n\n*24 new houses and 1 rebuilt\n\nTo conclude these services, the restitution of the right to housing is granted through the following modalities:\n\n**Collective Resettlement of Bento Rodrigues**\n\nIn 2021, infrastructure was completed for Bento Rodrigues, which includes four public assets: a school, health care unit and service station, multi-sports court, and sewage treatment plant, in addition to other infrastructure such as public lighting and pavement. Additionally, a total of 47 houses were built, 42 in 2021 and 5 in 2020.\n\n**Collective Resettlement of Paracatu de Baixo**\n\nIn Paracatu de Baixo, about 93% of the infrastructure has been completed, such as access and drainage, and construction on the school and 11 houses began in 2021.\n\n**Family Resettlement**\n\nThrough this modality, a family can choose a nearby property to live in, or even a plot of land where their new home will be built. By 2021, 36 houses had been delivered, and 29 had been built (five by 2020 and 24 in 2021) and seven rebuilt (six by 2020 and one in 2021).\n\n**Gesteira Services**\n\nBy 2021, Gesteira had 29 completed letter of credit processes (similar to family resettlement). Two had been completed by 2020 and 27 by 2021.\n\n**Pecuniary Assistance**\n\nIn the Pecuniary modality, affected parties, within their liberality and safeguarding all of their rights, request a cash payment in an amount equivalent to their right to housing. In total, 10 families had their right to housing restored through cash payments: one by 2020 and nine by 2021.\n\nUntil the properties are delivered, the resettling public can reside in temporary housing, where all the costs of maintenance and guarantee of habitability are borne by the Renova Foundation, which also provides transportation to the temporary schools and leisure and integration activities. The original cultural manifestations of the affected villages are encouraged and their continuity is guaranteed by the Renova Foundation as well, which promotes several actions to maintain and strengthen these activities.\n\nVale recorded an additional provision of BRL2.8 billion, which went to disbursements expected to support Samarco and the Renova Foundation due to budget overruns in the resettlement works \u2013 mainly related to delays due to the pandemic. Some of these funds also went to include new communities and categories in the indemnity program.\n\n**REPARATION AGREEMENTS WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND TRADITIONAL COMMUNITIES**\n\nIn 2015, the collapse of the Fund\u00e3o dam impacted the Krenak indigenous peoples in the municipality of Aimor\u00e9s, state of Minas Gerais and the Tupiniquim and Guarani people located in the Comboios, Caieiras Velhas II and Tupiniquim Indigenous Lands in the municipality of Aracruz, state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. The Degredo quilombola community, located in the municipality of Linhares, state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, was also impacted by the event.\n\nIn 2021, full reparation agreements, including the payment of family compensation, were signed with the Tupiniquins and Guarani indigenous peoples on all affected indigenous lands, benefiting 1,322 families.\n\nThese agreements with the Indigenous populations were built together with the communities, respecting their self-determination and the due consultation process. Besides family compensation, the negotiation prompted the creation of a program to support economic activity resumption and a fund to indemnify immaterial and collective damages, and the detailing of the actions of the Indigenous Basic Environmental Plan to be executed in the communities.\n\nAn agreement was also signed with the Quilombola Community of Degredo, which has also been receiving individual compensation and its Basic Environmental Plan will be, at the request of the community itself, executed by the Local Community Association that also acts as Technical Advisor, strengthening the community\u2019s autonomy.\n\nLearn more\n\nAll the information can be checked at Renova\u2019s website.\nRenegotiation of the Programs of the Mariana Reparation Agreement\n\nThe Governance TAC also provides for a single process for renegotiating the socioeconomic and socioenvironmental programs to remediate the damage resulting from the collapse of the Fund\u00e3o dam. Considering the judicialization of several themes, by several players; the advent of the creation of the Priority Thematic Axes in the 12th Court; and in view of the need to confer greater celerity, efficiency, and definitiveness, the renegotiation was initiated. This procedure, which is currently underway, aims to improve the programs without, however, confusing, inhibiting or harming the reparatory and compensatory actions, already carried out and/or in progress. Thus, in April 2021, the National Council of Justice (CNJ in Portuguese), started to promote the mediation of this renegotiation process, together with the parties: Samarco, its shareholders Vale and BHP, as well as several justice institutions and representatives of the public power. There was also the participation of those affected, through the holding of public hearings on the Mariana case, as well as other face-to-face meetings in Brasilia, Belo Horizonte and Vit\u00f3ria, with representatives of the parties involved in order to seek conciliation regarding the full reparation process for the damage in Mariana. In June 2021, a letter of principles was signed between the parties with the guidelines that aim to guide the renegotiation of these programs, as well as discussion on the simplification of governance and measures to confer definitiveness in the reparation process. The meetings are still ongoing.\n\nThe mediation of the renegotiation process with the parties started to be promoted by the National Council of Justice in April 2021\n\nJudicial Reorganization of Samarco\n\nIn 2021, Samarco filed for judicial reorganization before one of the Business Courts of the District of Belo Horizonte in the state of Minas Gerais to preserve its ability to produce, ship, receive exports and finance the normal course of its activities, and to comply with the obligations of the Transaction and Conduct Adjustment Agreement (TTAC).\n\nThe judicial reorganization request does not and will not impact compliance with the reparation commitments assumed as a result of the breach of the Fund\u00e3o Dam.\nCommitment of non-repetition\n\nOne of the pillars of our work in the committing to non-repetition of ruptures such as Brumadinho and Mariana, is the decharacterization of all our upstream dams* in Brazil, always placing the safety of people and the environment as our top priority.\n\nBy decharacterizing seven such structures since 2019 \u2013 four in Minas Gerais and three in Par\u00e1, out of the 30 mapped \u2013 we have achieved 23% of our Decharacterization Plan. By 2022, our forecast is to decharacterize more five upstream structures. With this, the company expects to end 2022 with 40% \u2013 12 of the 30 mapped dams and structures \u2013 decharacterized.\n\nAt the same time and in line with the best practices for dam management, we have intensified actions to prevent, correct and monitor unsafe structures, advancing toward the goal of having no dam in a critical condition (emergency level 3) by 2025.\n\nThese actions also increase the safety of the upstream structures that will be decharacterized, until the preparatory and engineering steps for decharacterization are completed. See more in Dams (chapter link).\n\nThe Brumadinho and Mariana events have changed the global perspective on the use and management of dams in mining. Since then, we have been working on decharacterizing or eliminating upstream structures in Brazil and have been progressing in developing technologies to reduce and dispose of tailings. We know that we have a long way to go.\n\nIn the following topics, we present the key measures we have taken to ensure the robust risk management and to reduce the dependence on dams in our operations.\n\nDams\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3\n\nThe Brumadinho and Mariana events have changed the global perspective on the use and management of dams in mining. Since then, we have been working on decharacterizing or eliminating upstream structures in Brazil and have been progressing in developing technologies to reduce and dispose of tailings. We know that we have a long way to go.\n\nThe issue of dams is currently one of the biggest challenges in the mining sector and especially at Vale, because, while they are important for continued production, they cause the perception of insecurity in the communities near the operations, especially in the state of Minas Gerais.\n\nIn the following topics, we present the key measures we have taken to ensure the robust risk management and to reduce the dependence on dams in our operations.\n\nSOME QUOTES FROM VALE\u2019S REPUTATION SURVEY THAT ASSOCIATE THE TERM \u201cDAM\u201d WITH THE COMPANY:\n\n**Dam, environmental destruction**\n\n\u201cYou have to do something impressive about what happened in Brumadinho and show that it is doing something differently in other locations.\u201d (representative from Par\u00e1 state)\n\n**Dams**\n\n\u201cTrying to repair its mistakes, seeking improvement and safety in the way of mining.\u201d (representative from Maranh\u00e3o state)\n\n**Dam Breach**\n\n\u201cThe company needs to show more about its safety procedures of safety, what they changed after the accident, how they are preventing themselves.\u201d (representative from S\u00e3o Paulo state)\n\n**Dam, destruction**\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let things like this ever happen again, you have to assume responsibilities.\u201d (representative from Rio de Janeiro state)\n\n**Dam, destruction**\n\n\u201cYou need to take your responsibilities and make sure that you won\u2019t make the same mistakes.\u201d (representative from Minas Gerais state)\n\n**DAM RISK MANAGEMENT MODEL**\n\nThe management of dam assets, which include dams to contain water, tailings and sediment, is guided by a Policy for Dam Safety and Geotechnical Mining Structures. The policy establishes guidelines and commitments for managing these structures in line with ABNT NBR ISO 9001:2015 \u2013 Quality Management System (QMS), the documents of the Canadian Dams Association (CDA), the Australian Committee on Large Dams (ANCOLD), the International Committee on Large Dams (ICOLD), the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), among others.\n\n*The term dam includes dams and dam systems, called Tailings Storage facilities (EAR in Portuguese), dry stacking, and saddle and internal dikes.\nIn 2021, the Independent Committee for Extraordinary Advisory on Dam Safety published its final report (CIAE-SB, in Portuguese acronym \u2013 Final Report, 2021), and has now been discontinued. To support governance of dam safety, the committee\u2019s members became independent members of the Independent Tailings Review Board (ITRB), acting as external reviewers of Vale\u2019s risk management system in line with the recommendations of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM). Our Geotechnical Executive Risk Committee continues to monitor our Upstream Dam Decharacterization Plan and our progress in implementing the Dam and Tailings Management System (TDMS) in alignment with the GISTM. It also analyzes our governance model, composition, duties and accomplishments of the ITRBs.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\nVale has been implementing its Tailings & Dams Management System (TDMS) since 2020, which covers the Routine, Performance and Risk pillars, all strategic aspects of dam and tailings storage facilities (EARS). In 2021, the TDMS also included all business units with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. For 2022, the consolidation of the system is planned, and training for all geotechnical teams.\n\nBased on the TDMS, the work of the Engineer of Record (EoR) for continuous monitoring of the structures is required for dams and Tailings Storage Facilities with a consequence classification of High, Very High and Extreme. The EoR performs regular safety inspections and issues monthly technical reports in order to continuously interpret the results of the inspection and monitoring activities of the structures, among other duties. External to operations, the EoR is integrated into Vale\u2019s lines of defense.\n\nRisk Assessment GRI 102-11\n\u2022 100% of the portfolio of dams and tailings storage facilities with high, very high and extreme consequence classification will have Hazard and Risk Assessment (HIRA) for geotechnical structures by the end of 2022, covering 56 structures.\n\nStatus in 2021: In 2020 and 2021 HIRAs were conducted for the Dams and EARS with Extreme consequence classification and others considered priority, contemplating 64 structures.\n\n\u2022 100% connected to Vale\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)\n\nStatus in 2021: The risks related to the rupture of dams and EARS are inserted in the Business Risk Management (GRN in Portuguese) system with established standardized controls. These risks will be gradually migrated to the operational risk base considering the specific critical assessments and controls defined in the HIRAs. Operational risks must also be identified as business risks according to criteria established in the company\u2019s risk management standards.\n\n\u2022 100% of tailings storage facilities operated with potential very high and extreme consequences should comply with the GISTM by 2023, and the others by 2025.\n\nStatus in 2021: The methodology was developed in 2021 and the first round of GISTM self-assessment was performed, with an average result of 60% adherence to its requirements.\nWhere are Vale's dams located\n\nIn Ferrous Mineral operations, all located in Brazil, Vale has:\n\n124 dams registered*\n\nwith the National Mining Agency (ANM in portuguese), of which:\n\n85% are located in Minas Gerais\n\n43 are tailings dams\n\n93 dams and 2 dry stacking\n\nare subject to the Regular Safety Inspection Report on a semi-annual basis covered by the National Dam Safety Policy.\n\nIn the North Atlantic Base Metals operations, there are 64 tailings dams or tailings storage facilities (EARs), located in Canada (Ontario, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador), totaling 67 structures for the business (added to the 3 Base Metals operations in Brazil). Of this total, 43 are active tailings dams and 24 are inactive dams.\n\nAll dams located in Canada have their performance publicly reported in accordance with the Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) program of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC).\n\nUnderstand Vale's dams.\n\n*The 124 registrations account for dams, tailings storage facilities and dam/structure systems, such as the Pontal System.\nSOLUTIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO MONITOR AND REDUCE DAM USE\n\nIn recent years, the company has sought to significantly reduce its dependence on the use of dams. To this end, it has invested in new potential solutions and intensified the frequency of monitoring and conservation status assessments of its dam structures.\n\nVale has already invested USD 19.5 billion in facilities and projects that seek to reduce dependence on dams\n\nProcessing to natural moisture\n\nTo replace the wet processing, where tailings are disposed of in dams, or in piles after the humidity reduction process, Vale has advanced in the process of reducing dam dependence.\n\nIn the last 13 years, the company has invested about USD 19.5 billion in facilities and projects that seek to reduce dependence on dams, and in 2021 natural moisture processing reached 70% of Vale's Iron Ore production. The main advance towards the goal was the approval of the NS04 project, which uses the dry technique and concentration in Vargem Grande and will contribute 1.5 Mta. Currently, there are three more dry concentration projects for anticipated development in the coming years.\n\nAnother potential solution that is being studied is the dry magnetic concentration of Iron Ore based on technology developed by New Steel, a company acquired by Vale. The technology eliminates the use of water in the low-grade ore concentration process, allowing the generated waste minerals to be stacked, instead of being sent to dams.\n\nIn 2021, Vale began tailings removal with unmanned equipment operated from a remote center. Among the emergency level 3 dams, we initiated tailings removal in two of them, and continued this process in relevant structures, such as the Vargem Grande Dam. We also adopted remotely controlled probing equipment was also adopted, which allows probing to a depth of 100 meters at the dams, with more flexibility to maintain and monitoring of the structures.\n\nThree Geotechnical Monitoring Centres (CMGs), with 24-hour instrumented and video monitoring\n\nWater level monitoring at different points of the dam, with specific instruments\n\nMeasuring the dam's response to seismic activity with specific instruments\n\nRadars monitoring\n\nUsing of satellite and drone images to monitor soil conservation and displacement\n\nInstalling of sirens\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLANS FOR MINING DAMS (PAEBM)\n\nPart of the Dam Safety Plan (PSB in Portuguese), the PAEBM is a technical document that defines immediate actions in case of emergency. It is filed with the City Halls and Brazilian Municipal, State, and National) Civil Defense that defines immediate actions in case of emergency.\n\nUnder the scope of community safety, as a preventive measure, Vale performs a social data survey of all people inserted in the Self-Rescue Zones (ZAS*) on its floodplains. Included in the PAEBM, the data involves information about the people concerned in the risk zone, especially those with any mobility restrictions or any physical, social, or territorial vulnerability associated with the ability to self-rescue.\nWhen the Emergency Level of a dam is raised, the PAEBM should be activated, and from level II on, the communities located in Self-Rescue Zones* should be resettled to safe areas, outside the floodplain.\n\nThe resettlement process is intended to occur in a planned manner, considering previously collected information, in synergy with the Municipal Civil Defense and respecting and protecting the human rights of those involved. It is important to emphasize that Brazilian law requires people to be resettled when dams are at Emergency Level III, but Vale, aiming to reduce the risk, promotes the resettlement of families whenever dams are at Emergency Level II. See more in Evacuated Territories.\n\n**DAM DECHARACTERIZATION PLAN**\n\nOne of Vale\u2019s main initiatives is the decharacterization of all upstream geotechnical structures in Brazil, including dams, dikes and drained stacks. Once the decharacterization is completed, the area is reincorporated into the local environment.\n\nIn 2021, Vale\u2019s plan to decharacterize or eliminate upstream structures was reviewed. It includes 30 geotechnical structures, encompassing now the Area IX Dam, at the F\u00e1brica Mine in Ouro Preto (MG) which had its construction method re-evaluated and changed.\n\nDuring the period, Vale concluded the decharacterization of the Fernandinho dam and also decharacterized the seventh upstream structure and completed works on Dike 5 of the Pontal Dam in Itabira, which is awaiting regulatory agencies\u2019 evaluation and no longer has the tailings storage capability.\n\nWe also completed the construction of the downstream containment structure serving the Forquilhas I, II, III, IV and Grupo Dams. With this delivery, all the dams at emergency level III now have a downstream back up dam.\n\nVale\u2019s plan also includes the construction of three other downstream containment structures for certain dams and dikes to hold tailings in case these structures fail, protecting the downstream area during the decharacterization works. The first of these structures is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2022, and the other two are in the preliminary engineering analysis phase.\n\nBy the end of 2021, Vale completed 23% of the Dam Decharacterization Plan. Since this is a rather complex process, several steps were taken to ensure that all work is in line with the best engineering practices and carried out as safely as possible. After completing deeper technical studies on the structures, taking into account peer reviews, and audit evaluations, more appropriate solutions have been defined for the decharacterization program, therefore some previously reported deadlines had to be revised and an additional provision of USD 1.7 billion was made.\n\nDue to the technical impossibility of meeting the deadlines established in the legislation governing the decharacterization of upstream structures, in\n\n---\n\n*The Self-Rescue Zone (ZAS) is the region located below the structure of a dam, at a distance of 10 km or with an arrival time of the tailings, in the extreme case of a breach, of 30 minutes. Due to its proximity, it is considered a priority in risk or emergency situations. Under Brazilian law, there is an obligation to evacuate the areas closest to the dam if it is considered an emergency level III. As a preventive measure, however, Vale indicates that the action takes place at level II.\nFebruary 2022 Vale signed a Term of Commitment with the Minas Gerais Government, regulatory agencies, and State and Federal Public Prosecutors\u2019 Offices. Through this document the schedule and our commitment of the decharacterization of all upstream structures in Brazil were formalized, besides placing the safety of people and protection of the environment as absolute priorities. Under the term of the agreement, Vale will contribute with USD 43.7 million for investments in social and environmental projects, to be disbursed over eight years.\n\nThe most recent update of the Decharacterization Plan indicates that 90% of the upstream dams in Brazil are slated to be decharacterized by 2029 and 100% will be decharacterized by 2035. The structures with a longer deadline are those of higher risk, and greater complexity.\n\n**FORECAST FOR DECHARACTERIZATION OF GEOTECHNICAL STRUCTURES**\n\n| Number of upstream geotechnical structures (cumulative) | Year of decharacterization |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 7                                                      | 2019 to 2021                |\n| 5                                                      | 2022                        |\n| 4                                                      | 2024                        |\n| 2                                                      | 2025                        |\n| 1                                                      | 2026                        |\n| 3                                                      | 2027                        |\n| 5                                                      | 2029                        |\n| 3                                                      | 2035                        |\n\n**MEASURES FOR UPSTREAM DAMS AT EMERGENCY LEVEL 3**\n\n| Measures for upstream dams under critical safety conditions | Sul Superior | B3/B4 | Forquilha III |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------|---------------|\n| Downstream containment structure (ECJ)\u00b9                     | 2020         | 2020  | 2021\u00b9         |\n| Decharacterization                                           | 2029         | 2027  | 2035          |\n\n\u00b9The Downstream containment structure (ECJs) were designed considering the tailings containment of the structures for which they are intended, and updates and adaptations may be necessary.

This material, that was previously discarded through piles and dams, is now processed and transformed into a product, following a strict quality control process.\n\nIn 2021, 250,000 tons of sand were processed and sent for sale or donation to be used in concrete, mortar, precast, artifacts, cement, and road paving.\n\nTo reduce the use of dams, Vale have announced an estimated investment of USD 2.2 billion between 2019 and 2026 to deploy dry stacking technology for tailings in Minas Gerais. The technique would allow the water from the tailings to be filtered, reused and stacked to reduce the use of dams.\n\nOne of the main progresses in 2021 was the execution of the Experimental Landfills at Itabira and Brucutu, this enabled the implementation of the filtered tailings pile (PDR in Portuguese) projects. Besides, 16 different tailings have been characterized allowing a tremendous progress in more than 10 PDR projects. Operations of at least three more PDRs are planned for 2022.\n\nIn 2021, operations began at the Vargem Grande filtration plant, the first of four filtration plants in Minas Gerais, reducing dependence on dams and improving the average quality of the product portfolio through wet processing.\n\nProduction capacity was increased by 4Mtpa and began operations at the Maravilhas III Dam, which is planned to receive only the ultrafine tailings from the plants, equivalent to approximately 30% of the total tailings generated by this operation.\nGovernance and Compliance\n\n1.

Compliance\n\nKEY LONG-TERM EMERGING RISKS MAPPED\n\nEPIDEMICS AND PANDEMICS\nCollective manifestation of a disease that rapidly spreads, by direct or indirect contamination, reaching a large number of people in a given territory (e.g., Covid-19, ebola, avian influenza, etc).\n\nRUSSIA \u2013 UKRAINE WAR AND INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS\nEscalation of the conflict could lead to disruption of international trade flows, extreme pricing, high volatility in the markets, with particular impact on the energy sector, increased regulatory and contractual uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions around the world. It may also lead to a cooling off of the international sanctions landscape by imposing new restrictions on selling or purchasing products, or conducting business with specific countries, companies and individuals.\n\nCYBERSECURITY\nVale\u2019s business relies heavily on technological systems for its operations. Cyber events or attacks can have a significant impact on our business. Cyber risk management discipline addresses situations in which the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of information technology and operational technology systems can be compromised.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nIncreased sense of urgency to address the challenges that threaten not only the mining industry, but society as a whole. Low-carbon mining is one of our priorities for the coming years.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \u2013 HIRA\nVale relies on the Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA) program for operational risk management. The program is designed to map and analyze high-severity operational safety risks or those of a very high-risk amplitude, identify and define performance criteria and establishes assurance of the appropriate critical controls, as well as the mitigation plans.\n\nIn 2021, the 1st HIRA cycle was completed as part of our strategy to improve operational risk management. The 2nd cycle has already started and will last and will be completed in the next three to five years. As part of the HIRA program, the Integrated Risk Management tool was updated, as it now consolidates all the risk related information in a single platform, which contemplates the inclusion of the information from the Risk Management area and other lines of defense in a single platform.\n\nWe concluded the 1st cycle of HIRA in 2021\nCompliance\n\nEthics and integrity are principles that guide how we conduct all of our activities. In 2021, Vale launched its Global Ethics & Compliance Program, consolidating activities to promote ethical conduct and anti-corruption behaviour.\n\nThe program has six pillars, which guide the expected behaviour and decision making in an ethical and responsible manner: (1) Governance, (2) Guidelines, (3) Communication and Training, (4) Monitoring and Risks, (5) Whistleblower Channel, and (6) Consequence Management. GRI 102-16\n\nIn 2021, Vale hired an independent external consulting firm to conduct a diagnosis of the company's compliance culture. This diagnosis allows us to identify the maturity level of the implemented processes, the impact of the actions, and employee perception of the topic. In the last year, the consulting firm's analysis demonstrated what it found to be a step-change evolution in Vale's compliance culture. Among the topics that presented the most evident advances are training for employees, appropriation of the compliance theme, adaptation of policies and guidelines to different realities, and dissemination of the company's Whistleblower Channel. Additionally, the diagnosis also points out opportunities for improvement that are incorporated into the program's annual planning. These include training for contractors, accountability of the Reporting Channel, and wider dissemination of the structure, tools, and methodologies used by the area. We will perform this compliance culture diagnosis at least once every two years. In addition, the activities of the Ethics & Compliance Program, including the Whistleblower Channel, will also be submitted to an external audit once every two years, starting in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, we carried out a diagnosis on Vale's compliance culture to identify the processes maturity level.\n\nLEARN A LITTLE ABOUT EACH OF THE PILLARS OF VALE'S ETHICS & COMPLIANCE PROGRAM:\n\nGuidelines\nVale's Code of Conduct brings together the company's ethical principles, which are based on our values and purpose. The new edition of the document, published during the launch of the Ethics & Compliance Program in 2021, is available in nine languages and has audiobooks available for the visually impaired. Employees were invited to renew their commitment to ethics by signing the code's statement of awareness and commitment. In 2021, 85.74% of the employees signed the document. New employees sign the Code of Conduct when they are hired.\n\nIn 2021, three new editions of the Ethics & Compliance Program documents were also published. The Global Anti-Corruption Manual, revised during the year, details the rules defined in the Global Anti-Corruption Policy. The company also published its Global Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest and launched its first Consequence Management Policy, a document that establishes guidelines for applying disciplinary measures for confirmed misconduct. GRI 205-2\nCommunication and Training\nThe communication and training strategy of the Ethics & Compliance Program includes mandatory actions for all employees and specific training for areas classified as priorities due to their exposure to the risk of corruption.\n\nIn 2021, as part of the communication actions for the program's launch, we released four short films on relevant topics \u2013 Ethics, the Whistleblower Channel, Harassment, and Corruption and Fraud. We also produced educational booklets detailing the ethical principles of the company's Code of Conduct.\n\nIn addition, an online course on ethics and compliance was launched and, taken by 89% of Vale employees globally, totaling the participation of 64,330 people. A total of 1,886 employees from priority areas also received specific training on anti-corruption rules. The first global edition of the conflicts of interest campaign was also held, with 34,422 employees participating (64.17% of employees with computer access). GRI 205-2\n\nRisks and Monitoring\nIn 2021, using tests and controls, Vale strived to reinforce the continuous monitoring of processes and risk management actions to track how the company was adhering to the Ethics & Compliance Program guidelines in practice.\n\nWhistleblower Channel and Consequence Management\nGRI 102-17, 102-34 | 406-1\n\nIn 2021, Vale's Whistleblower Channel underwent a restructuring process through which we implemented of new protocols. In 2021, there was a 33.8% increase in the number of reports received by the channel, totaling 6,248 reports that included allegations, inquiries and complaints. Throughout the year, 5,526 of these reports were closed. All confirmed violations have been assigned remediation plans. During the year, 3,014 corrective actions were established, including actions to dismiss 157 employees.\n\nDuring this period, 11 cases of sexual harassment were confirmed in Vale's Brazilian operations. In all 11 cases, all the victims were women. There were also three confirmed cases of discrimination - two involving gender issues and one related to sexual orientation. Vale classified all these cases as very high severity, according to the company's Consequence Management Policy launched in 2021, and they resulted in termination actions. In the cases involving contractors, on the other hand, the companies were notified and the employees were demobilized. Eighteen cases of moral harassment were confirmed, which generated action plans involving training, coaching, feedback, warnings, dismissal and/or contractors demobilization.\n\nAdditionally, Vale adopts preventive measures to promote a culture of integrity in teams that have had confirmed misconduct. Action plans for dealing with allegations confirmed in 2021 also included promoting round-table discussions and holding health and safety dialogues on a culture of respect, moral and sexual harassment, discrimination, among other topics.\n\nMore information on Vale's Whistleblower Channel and actions to promote a culture of ethics and integrity at the company are reported in the Ethics & Compliance Program's Annual Report.\nANTI-CORRUPTION RULES\nGRI 205, 205-1\nVale has zero tolerance for corruption and bribery. The company\u2019s anti-corruption rules are mechanisms intended to ensure compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the Brazilian Anti-Corruption Law (Law No. 12,846/2013), and local laws in each country in which we operate.\n\nIn 2021, Vale\u2019s operations were submitted to corruption-related risk assessment. These risks are broken down internally among the areas according to the degree of exposure to corruption and has associated controls and clear anti-corruption rules.\n\nIn total, 16 controls are related to Vale\u2019s anti-corruption rules, six of these are classified as key controls and related to approvals of socioeconomic investments, specific conditions for donations and sponsorships, suppliers in general, high-risk suppliers, hiring of public agents and training in the Ethics & Compliance Program.\n\nIn 2021, no cases of corruption involving public agents were identified. Through the company\u2019s Whistleblower Channel, three cases of bribery involving private companies were identified, all of which resulted in actions to dismiss the employees involved. GRI 205-3\n\nSOCIOECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE\nGRI 103-2, 103-3 | 307-1 | 419-1\nIn 2021, the Vale group companies received 21 significant fines (amounts equal to or higher than USD 10,000) for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, totaling about USD 10.2 million, and 11 non-monetary sanctions related to various aspects, such as alleged non-compliance with environmental conditions, pollution, and activities performed without the necessary environmental authorizations/licenses.\n\nThe company also received five significant fines, totaling USD 868,000, and three non-monetary sanctions (warnings) for non-compliance with socioeconomic laws and regulations, applied in the scope of administrative proceedings filed by the National Land Transport Agency (ANTT in Portuguese) and related to providing passenger rail transport service. Vale emphasizes that it constantly invests to continuously evolve its control and monitoring systems, and that the fines and non-monetary sanctions applied to the company are discussed in the scope of the respective administrative and judicial processes.\n\nANTITRUST, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nGRI 102-25 | 206-1\nBesides having a specific Anti-corruption Policy, the main references in antitrust management are the guidelines and decisions of the jurisdictions in the regions where we operate. In 2021, no critical facts of antitrust or unfair competition were identified or reported.\n\nIn 2021, the company published an internal document \u201cGlobal Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest\u201d. The absence of conflicts of interest is one of the ethical principles of the new edition of Vale\u2019s Code of Conduct. The company repudiates and rejects any action, influence or decision motivated by interests contrary to the standards that are not exclusive and legitimate to Vale.\nDATA PRIVACY\n\nPrivacy is a Fundamental Individual Right, which should have the same rigorous treatment and level of protection as any other fundamental rights. With rapid digitalization, growing digital dependence, and the volume of personal data circulating in the digital world, several laws aimed at strengthening privacy and data protection practices are being implemented globally.\n\nIn 2021 Vale created an independent Executive Management of Personal Data Privacy, defining an executive responsible for the global management of the program at the company. The objective of the Privacy area is to preserve the right to privacy and protection of personal data of individuals who have a relationship with Vale, acting in an independent and multidisciplinary manner.\n\nThe creation of the Privacy Department was the result of work that began in 2018, with the hiring of specialized consultants who have conducted, over the years, assessments of the company's maturity in relation to the main privacy legislations in the areas where we operate (especially but not limited to Brazil, Europe, China and Canada), with the implementation of specific actions in each region to adapt our operations to privacy rules.\n\nCompany executives and employees have been receiving regular training in privacy practices. The company's main systems and personal data flows are permanently evaluated, to ensure their correct treatment in adherence to the requirements and guiding principles of the applicable laws.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe executive management reports to the Executive Vice President of Legal/Tax, acting in partnership with other areas of the company such as the Vice President of People, Corporate Security, Department of Technology and Information Security, Repair Management, Supplies, among other areas of the company.\n\nPrivacy Guidelines\n\nVale's Privacy guidelines were established in a Global Policy published in 2020, which sets out the minimum conditions for Vale and other group companies to handle personal data.\n\nThe program also has a direct communication channel with the privacy team and with the DPO - Data Privacy Officer, so that data subjects can make requests concerning their data, or even submit complaints or suggestions.\n\nThe communication channel, as well as Vale's external privacy notice, is available on our website.\n\nSOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES\n\nGRI 203-1\n\nIn 2021, Vale contributed USD 1.3 billion in socio-environmental expenditures, including those related to Brumadinho, which represented a 28% increase compared to 2020. As for environmental expenditures, the contribution totaled USD 804.2 million, of which water resources, environmental liabilities, and energy accounted for the largest expenses. Social expenditures totaled USD 473.5 million, 73% with our own resources and 27% through incentive laws. The main expenditures were in urban infrastructure and mobility, culture, health, and social protection.\n\nVale created an independent executive management of Personal Data Privacy. The purpose of the area is to preserve the right to privacy and data protection.\nManufactured Capital\n\nSossego Mine, in Cana\u00e3 dos Caraj\u00e1s, Par\u00e1\nMANUFACTURED CAPITAL\n\nVale completed the year with around 340 Mtpy of iron ore production capacity and expects to reach 370 Mtpy by the end of 2022.\n\nPRODUCTION AND SALES\n\nMtpy\n\nProduction\n\nSales\n\nIron ore:\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n301,972\n\n300,306\n\n277,508\n\n300,185\n\n274,865\n\n274,865\n\n315,610\n\n31,306\n\n31,708\n\nPellets:\n\n43,199\n\n41,794\n\n39,676\n\n31,311\n\n30,676\n\n30,676\n\n32,306\n\n31,708\n\nNickel:\n\n206.0\n\n205.7\n\n205.7\n\n183.7\n\n183.1\n\n183.1\n\n191.8\n\n191.8\n\nCopper:\n\n381.3\n\n380.1\n\n380.1\n\n340.3\n\n340.3\n\n340.3\n\n396.8\n\n396.8\n\nManganese:\n\n1,576\n\n1,576\n\n1,576\n\n1,576\n\n1,576\n\n1,576\n\n1,576\n\n1,576\n\nEnergy Consumption Matrix by Source\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\nElectricity\n\n29.6\n\n30.3\n\n30.3\n\nDiesel oil\n\nCoal and coke\n\nNatural gas\n\nOthers\n\nRenewable Fuels\n\nOther fuels:\n\n- Other gases: 0.1\n- Shipping oils: 0.1\n- Other liquid fuels: 0.1\n\nVALE SERVES INDUSTRIES, SUCH AS STEEL INDUSTRY, ON ALL CONTINENTS\n\nGRI 102-6\n\n- Americas\n  - South, Central and North America\n- Europe\n  - Including Turkey\n- Asia and Africa, considering\n  - Middle East North Africa and India (Menai) \u2013 Middle East, North Africa and India\n  - China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines)\n  - Oceania (Australia)\n\nACTIVITIES MAP\n\nGRI 102-3, 102-4-102-7\n\nExploration\n\nJoint Venture\n\nOffices\n\nHeadquarter\n\nOperations\n\nPort\n\nRailroad\n\nGRI Index\n\nCredits\n\nManufactured Capital\n**VALE PRODUCTS** GRI 102-2\n\nWhere we operate:\n- **Iron Ore**: Brazil, Oman, Malaysia and China.\n- **Nickel**: Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, China, UK.\n- **Coal**: Mozambique.\n- **Copper**: Brazil and Canada.\n- **Manganese and ferroalloys**: Brazil.\n\n**PRODUCTION AND SALES HIGHLIGHTS IN 2021**\n\nThe production and sales highlights in 2021 were:\n\n(a) the volume increase in Iron Ore production (5% p.a.) and sales (9% p.a.) driven by higher production at our Minas Gerais operations (17% p.a.), partially offset by weaker performance at S11D (-11% p.a.);\n(b) a favourable market price scenario (46% p.a.);\n(c) the strike in Sudbury, interrupting our operations for 70 days and contributing to a 9% reduction in Nickel production and an 18% reduction in Copper production; and\n(d) the stronger performance of Coal production in Moatize (45% p.a.), along with the signing of a binding agreement to sell the asset.\n\nIn 2021, we completed the sale of Vale New Caledonia (VNC) to the Prony Resources New Caledonia consortium, in line with our commitment to withdraw from New Caledonia in an orderly and responsible manner. A total of USD 555 million were disbursed as part of a USD 1.1 billion package to provide VNC with the means to build a trajectory with sustainable operations.\n\nIn December 2021, we signed a binding agreement with Vulcan Resources (Vulcan) regarding the sale of the Moatize Coal Mine and the Nacala Logistics Corridor (CLN), in line with the company\u2019s decarbonization strategy, adapting its investment portfolio to a low-carbon economy. The transaction involves a total of USD 270 million, comprised of USD 80 million at the completion of the transaction and USD 190 million from the existing business until completion \u2013 plus a 10-year Royalty Agreement subject to certain conditions of Mine production and coal prices. The completion of the transaction is subject to the fulfillment of customary preceding conditions, including the approval of the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy of Mozambique, and the approval of the Government of Mozambique under the Concession Agreements for the change of control and antitrust.\n\nGiven our commitment to a just transition, Vale conducted a responsible investor search process for Mozambique\u2019s assets, and the new operator, Vulcan, a private company that is part of the renowned Jindal Group, has extensive experience working in Mozambique.\n\nAlso in December, we announced the sale of our 50% interest in California Steel Industries to Nucor Corporation (Nucor), completed in February 2022. As a result of the transaction, we received a purchase price of USD 436.7 million in cash, of which USD 400 million is related to 50% of the value of the negotiations and the remainder related to adjusted net debt and working capital at the closing of the transaction.\n\nIn January 2022, we completed the sale process of Vale Mangan\u00eas assets, including the Ferroalloy production units in Barbacena and Ouro Preto, and the Morro da Mina manganese ore mine, in Conselheiro Lafaiete, Minas Gerais. The VDL Group, a business conglomerate that operates in the transportation, mining, and steelmaking segments, has definitively taken over the management of the assets of the three units, ending our activities in the production and sale of Manganese Ferroalloys. The transaction did not involve the manganese ore assets that our company owns in the states of Par\u00e1 and Mato Grosso do Sul. The strategy of divesting Vale Mangan\u00eas\u2019s Ferroalloy operations streamlines our company\u2019s operations, allowing continued focus on core assets.\n\nThe transactions reinforce the discipline in Vale\u2019s capital allocation, with a focus on its core businesses and a commitment to portfolio optimization, based on our goals to preserve our operational continuity and a responsible and sustainable exit.\n\n**Divestments in non-core assets** GRI 102-10\n\nWe completed the sale of assets in line with our strategy to focus on core businesses.\nFinancial Capital\nFINANCIAL CAPITAL\n\nIn a year still marked by the persistent effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and market volatility, we were able to reach significant milestones in creating sustainable value for our stakeholders.\n\nNET OPERATING REVENUE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n\nIn USD billion\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 36.5 | 39.5 | 54.5 |\n\nNET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n\nIn USD billion\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 0.4  | 6.3  | 24.8 |\n\nTOTAL ASSETS\n\nIn USD billion\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 91.7 | 92   | 89.4 |\n\nMARKET CAP\n\nIn USD billion\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 70.1 | 89.4 | 72.0 |\n\nGROSS DEBT\n\nIn USD billion\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Value | 13.1 | 13.4 | 12.2 |\n\nRESULTS AND IMPACTS\n\n- Taxes and royalties: In USD billion\n  - 2019: 3.5\n  - 2020: 3.5\n  - 2021: 7.7\n\n- Employee salaries and benefits: In USD billion\n  - 2019: 2.2\n  - 2020: 3.9\n  - 2021: 1.9\n\n- Research and Development: In USD billion\n  - 2019: 0.4\n  - 2020: 0.4\n  - 2021: 0.5\n\n- Payments to capital providers: In USD billion\n  - 2019: 3.8\n  - 2020: 4.1\n  - 2021: 14.2\n\n- Environmental expenditures: In USD billion\n  - 2019: 0.5\n  - 2020: 0.6\n  - 2021: 0.8\n\n- Social expenditures: In USD billion\n  - 2019: 0.2\n  - 2020: 0.4\n  - 2021: 0.5\n\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations\n\nUSD 31.3 billion\nIn 2021, Vale achieved adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations* of USD 31.3 billion, 13.8 billion higher compared to 2020, mainly due to higher realized prices and sales volumes of Iron Ore and Pellets, partially offset by certain costs and expenses that included third-party purchases and royalties, higher freight costs and higher maintenance and service costs.\n\nNet income from continuing operations was USD 24.8 billion for the period, USD 18.6 billion higher compared to 2020, mainly due to higher proforma EBITDA and higher financial results.\n\nNet operating revenues was USD 54.5 billion, an increase of USD 15.0 billion compared to 2020. The increase is due to better market conditions and higher realized Iron Ore prices. Costs and expenses from continuing operations, including the Brumadinho reparation, totaled BRL 142.9 billion (USD 26.4 billion), remaining BRL 11.5 billion (USD 969 million) more than the amount spent in 2020.\n\nOur investments in the period were USD 5.2 billion, of which USD 4.2 billion were dedicated to the maintaining operations and USD 1 billion to executing growth projects. The amount invested represents an increase of 18% compared to 2020, due primarily to: (a) the advance in Salobo III, expansion of the Voisey's Bay Mine and the Serra Sul 120 Mtpy project, as planned; and (b) the start of execution of the Capanema (Iron Ore) and Sol do Cerrado (solar energy) project.\n\n### RESULTS OF EQUITY HOLDINGS BY BUSINESS AREA (IN USD MILLIONS)\n\n| Business Area       | 2021 |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Ferrous Minerals    | 166  |\n| Base Metals         | 1    |\n| Coal                | -    |\n| Others              | 327  |\n| **TOTAL**           | 494  |\n\n### BALANCE SHEET (IN USD MILLIONS)\n\n| Category                                      | 2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|\n| Current assets                                | 22,360 |\n| Non-current assets                           | 14,389 |\n| Property, plant and equipment, net and intangible assets | 50,942 |\n| Investments in associates and joint ventures  | 1,751  |\n| **Total assets**                              | 89,442 |\n| Current liabilities                          | 15,198 |\n| Non-current liabilities                      | 38,938 |\n| **Total liabilities**                         | 54,136 |\n| Stockholders\u2019 equity                         | 35,306 |\n| **TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY** | 89,442 |\n\n*Continuing operations: does not consider the result of the coal operation.\nSTATEMENT OF VALUE GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED  GRI 201-1\n\nVale\u2019s statement of value generated and distributed includes revenues, operating costs, employee compensation, donations and other social investments, retained earnings and payments to capital providers and governments.\n\nIn 2021, the earnings with regards to the balance sheet for the fiscal year reached a total of BRL 12.62 per share, between interest on capital and dividends.\n\n| Country/Region | North America, except Canada | South America, except Brazil | Brazil | Europe | Africa | Australasia | Middle East | TOTAL |\n|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|\n| Revenues       | -                           | 1,805.5                     | 1.3    | 5,272.6| 44,317.2| -           | 3,104.9    | (0.0) | 54,501.5 |\n| COUNTRY/REGION | -                           | 1,805.5                     | 1.3    | 5,272.6| 44,317.2| -           | 3,104.9    | (0.0) | 54,501.5 |\n| Operational costs | -                           | 2,312.5                     | 13.3   | 10,565.4| 6,097.5| -           | 796.0      | 240.6 | 20,025.3 |\n| Employee salaries and benefits | -                           | 435.0                       | 6.9    | 1,252.4| 30.8   | -           | 106.2      | 41.0  | 1,872.3  |\n| Research and development | -                           | 110.2                       | 26.4   | 324.1  | 20.9   | -           | 67.1       | -     | 548.6    |\n| Payments to capital providers | 421.9                       | 252.0                       | -      | 13,475.8| 26.2   | -           | -          | -     | 14,176.0 |\n| Payments to government | 17.5                        | (194.3)                     | 2.8    | 7,740.4| (21.8) | 60.0        | 86.3       | 3.7   | 7,694.6  |\n| Environmental expenditures | -                           | 106.5                       | 0.7    | 670.8  | 1.2    | 19.7        | 1.5        | 3.7   | 804.2    |\n| Social expenditures | -                           | 6.0                         | 0.0    | 449.2  | 1.7    | 14.2        | 1.6        | 0.8   | 473.5    |\n| DISTRIBUTED ECONOMIC VALUE | 439.4                       | 3,027.9                     | 50.0   | 34,478.1| 6,156.6| 93.9        | 1,058.9    | 289.7 | 45,594.6 |\n| ACUMMULATED ECONOMIC VALUE | (439.4)                     | (1,222.4)                   | (48.8) | (29,205.5)| 38,160.7| (93.9)      | 2,046.0    | (289.7)| 8,906.9  |\n\nResults center\nAccess Vale\u2019s complete 2021 financial statements.\nSee Vale\u2019s global tax contributions in our annual Tax Transparency report.\nTubar\u00e3o Port receives the first large ore carrier in the world equipped with a rotating sail system (rotor sails).

Innovation at Vale is considered one of the levers for achieving our purpose. We have a vision where our production is increasingly automated, reducing our people\u2019s exposure to risk and increasing the agility and productivity of our operations. We will have artificial intelligence solutions supporting all major decisions. We use technology to redesign our ways of working, reducing risk scenarios, with the goal of becoming a reference in safety and risk management. We have a complete view of the value chain and collaborate with clients to create differentiated products and services. Teams collaborate remotely, creating a more accessible environment, attracting a more diverse workforce. We seek to transform people and digitize processes through new ways of working, promoting agility, collaboration and integration. Renewable energy drives our business, we will develop and use new mining and processing technologies to promote sustainable development by reducing carbon emissions, promoting reforestation and accelerating social and environmental technologies. We innovate to contribute to the sustainable development of our businesses and communities, generating a positive impact on society. Innovation is supported by four main pillars: Protecting lives, Sustainable mining, Market differentiation, Learning Journey and Open Innovation.\n\nPROTECTING LIVES\n\nFor us, life comes first and there is no productivity without safety. Innovation is a catalyst to transform the way we operate, prioritizing people\u2019s health and safety. Life first is a non-negotiable value for us. To become the safety reference, we redesigned our work to eliminate exposure to risks, adopting remote work on a large scale, as well as maintaining priority based on \u201cImpacted Lives\u201d.\n\nIn 2021, Vale established the Safety Transformation Program to have global governance to maximize the impact of health and safety actions, using technology and innovation. The Program works by scaling protection solutions and ensuring adherence to minimum safety requirements; accelerating the implementation of mitigation controls and the adoption of remote operation to remove or reduce risk to people; and ensuring that the prioritization of safety technology initiatives is based on their potential to impact lives. As a result, the program has already ensured that more than 9,500 sensors have been installed to protect against fatigue, collision and electrical hazards, and more than 17,000 people are now using location sensors, allowing the monitoring of the position and exposure of professionals to critical risks, through the Global Safe Access Program. With this, more than 40 thousand people received protection barriers against accidents and more than 10 thousand people were effectively enabled to work remotely through Jornada Vale.\n\nIn addition to the growing application of remotely operated equipment, we developed applications for robotics and increased the use of autonomous equipment in our operations. These technologies allow us to achieve better and safer production levels. The increased productivity of the mine assets also represents a reduction in GHG emissions from our operations. We have more than 100 pieces of equipment operating in our Self-Employed Portfolio, removing more than 545 people from risk. We expect a robust expansion of this portfolio in 2022, particularly in the northern system.\n\nAlso in 2021, we will expand the use of new technologies in our dam management model. In addition to 24-hour video and radar monitoring, we are using satellite images and drones to track the state of conservation and ground displacement in our structures. See here how Vale\u2019s Geotechnical Monitoring Centre works.\nSUSTAINABLE MINING\nWe are committed to fostering sustainable development. The PowerShift Program is working in the ecosystem of start-ups and partnerships to develop and accelerate the maturity of solutions to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions in our value chain. The program involves, among other things, the use of waste to produce new materials, fostering the circular economy and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This occurs through the acceleration of low-carbon technologies, bioenergy and product development that assist our customers in their emission reduction goals, in addition to carbon removals via reforestation, protection and capture technologies.\n\nWe are part of the communities where we operate and, therefore, we encourage the generation of shared value through our actions in the territories. We develop technologies to reduce GHG emissions from our operations, such as, for example, the first electric locomotive of its kind and the application of biochar in our operations to replace the anthracite used in pelletizing. In partnership with the ecosystem, we are developing options for substituting diesel fuel for trucks.\n\nIn partnership with the Vale Institute of Technology (ITV), we advanced in the maturity of our portfolio of technologies to reduce Scope 3 emissions, through successful tests of new technologies for the ship fleet, such as rotorsail (a ship that uses rotating sails), which enables the use of wind to reduce fuel consumption, and air lubrication, which reduces GHG emissions by minimizing friction on the hull.\n\nMARKET DIFFERENTIATION\nWe explore opportunities to strengthen the industry\u2019s production chain, create new products, services, and business models in a co-creative way with our audiences and customers. We are developing new products and strategies to support the energy transition through electrification, improving and expanding our product portfolio in base metals. In Ferrous to increase the value of the company in a sustainable way, we developed a portfolio of initiatives where the \u201cgreen briquette\u201d has a prominent position as a new product with low energy intensity and with the potential to reduce our emissions and those of our customers. The briquette is Vale\u2019s exclusive technology, the result of several years of technological development and already patented in more than 47 countries, with three plants already approved and another five in the analysis phase. We also offer high iron content products, generated through our new natural humidity processing technology, a sustainable process that eliminates the need for dams. In 2021, we informed the market about our new bio-carbon pilot plant, a technology capable of reducing the use of traditional carbon sources, reducing total GHG emissions and enabling the production of \u201cgreen\u201d pig iron, using our modular TecnoRed plants. Also within our portfolio of new products, we announced the creation of a new company focused on Green Cement, a type of low emission geopolymer cement that will use mining waste sand. This company will use state-of-the-art technology to produce cement with high quality, lower cost and significant carbon emission reduction potential.\n\nINDUSTRY 4.0\nIn line with the technological trends advocated by Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\u2013based algorithms are used in our operations to predict the behavior of important process variables. Today 17% of our critical assets are monitored by Internet of Things (IoT) and Advanced Analytics.\n\nAt our Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center in Vit\u00f3ria, Esp\u00edrito Santo, we develop projects involving optimization of asset maintenance and improvement in the management of processes at ore beneficiation and pelletizing plants, as well as the improvement of environmental, health and safety and corporate integrity controls.\n\nFor us, innovation is an essential asset for creating shared value with society and for mitigating the impact of our activities.\n\nSmart Safety, which currently reaches 50% of Vale\u2019s employees, is a predictive analysis solution based on Artificial Intelligence that calculates the probability of risk events in operational areas. Strategically, this solution adds an intelligent and dynamic protection barrier in operations, identifying potential risk areas and acting proactively to take preventive actions. In Base Metals, for example, there is now assertive monitoring of actions to be taken to avoid accidents. In the Southeast Corridor, in Ferrous Minerals, the tool contributed to the decrease of the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) in the year 2021.\n\nWe use AI to further promote the sustainability of our operations by reducing the fuel consumption of off-highway trucks, avoiding the emission of more than 74,000 tons of CO\u2082 per year, in line with our goal of reducing direct and indirect emissions by 33% by 2030. We also highlight the use of a platform with artificial intelligence called Previsia to identify deforestation and fire risk areas in the Amazon,\npromoting a strategic preventive action. This project is the result of a partnership between the Instituto do Homem e Meio Ambiente da Amaz\u00f4nia (Imazon), Microsoft and Fundo Vale. Finally, Artificial Intelligence is also used in our Asset Monitoring Centre (CMA), which seeks to expand integration between the Planning and Asset Management areas with two purposes, enabling decisions:\n\n- Reduce risk exposure in processes and assets, through status visibility of critical controls and asset health.\n- Optimize the reliability and performance of assets throughout their life cycle, allowing greater adherence to Operational Plans.\n\n**LEARNING JOURNEY AND OPEN INNOVATION**\n\nWe seek to drive people development and digitize processes, through new ways of working that promote agility, collaboration and integration. We believe that collaboration in an open innovation ecosystem, through partnerships with universities, startups, government and other corporations is essential to accelerate innovation initiatives. We have built an innovation network within the company that today is connecting nine innovation hubs within our operations in order to address critical issues on the ground. New partnership models in the form of collabs (collaborative projects) are essential to strengthen our open innovation strategy that can accelerate our learning journey. Vale has advanced in Innovation initiatives, and we recognize that we can learn from our own journey.\n\nAn example of collaboration with the ecosystem in Brazil is MiningHub, an initiative to co-construct solutions with innovation in the mining industry. Participants include 24 mining companies, 700 startups and 15 major suppliers, with a reach in 22 countries. Already, 90 proofs of concept have been carried out and 20 contracts have been signed between mining companies and start-ups.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, Vale has also been seeking to establish partnerships in projects and initiatives to accelerate the development of solutions and knowledge, in line with its purpose to be a leader in low-carbon mining. These partnerships involve suppliers, research institutes, operators, technology consortiums, among others, as for example in the \"Charge On\" challenge held in 2021 for the development of truck battery systems. In Canada, we are part of the innovation hub that is focused on supporting early-stage technology startups and their founders. Vale helps by providing access to key resources and connections to the networks they need to start, expand and scale their ventures.\n\nIn the Mining Innovation for a New Environment 2.0 (MINE) Program, we seek to develop people, solve strategic problems for Vale and generate positive impact for society. In this program, Vale, in collaboration with universities and innovation institutes, offers participating professionals the opportunity to build a safer, more sustainable and efficient future for mining through open innovation. During the program, participants developed solutions to solve real challenges in the areas of decarbonization, circular economy, health and safety.\n\nIn 2021 we structured our Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) strategy and made our first investment: Boston Metal, owner of a new technology for iron oxide reduction through electrolysis called Molten Oxide Electrolysis (MOE). Through this investment, we are supporting the development of low GHG emission steelmaking technologies, in line with our decarbonization commitments and the new pact with society.\n\nWe evolved from 166th position in 2019 to 12th in 2021 in the \"100 Open Startups\" awards; and from 31st place to 4th in the Valor Innovation Award in 2021.\nVale Institute of Technology (ITV)\n\nITV is a non-profit institution, maintained by Vale that operates through ITV Sustainable Development, located in Bel\u00e9m (PA), and ITV Mining, located in Ouro Preto and Santa Luzia (MG), to promote scientific research. Since 2010, ITV has been developing technological and scientific solutions to solve the challenges of the mining chain in search of a more just and sustainable society. It currently has a group of 281 researchers, 224 of whom are fellows.\n\nITV SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (ITV DS)\n\nITV DS works in the generation of socio-environmental scientific knowledge for the characterization and conservation of the biotic and abiotic environments and their relationship with communities in connection with sustainable development goals. The research groups include: Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services; Environmental Genomics; Environmental Technology; Environmental Geology and Water Resources; Socioeconomics and Sustainability; and Data Science.\n\nResearch is conducted collaboratively with research institutions and companies in Brazil and abroad and shares knowledge with society through scientific publications in open journals, deposits of raw data in open access global databases and scientific communication through documentaries, videos, podcasts and newsletters.\n\nITV DS has research laboratories with the analytical capacity for state-of-the-art techniques such as next-generation DNA sequencing, proteomics, imaging equipment, and high-capacity computers, among others.\n\nITV DS is also active in training young researchers through the Professional Master\u2019s in Sustainable Use of Natural Resources in Tropical Regions. More than 120 professionals from all over the country had been trained by 2021. On this front, we highlight the research scholarship and project subsidies program for young residents in Par\u00e1 whose dissertations in line with one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nITV MINING (ITV MI)\n\nITV Mining seeks to develop solutions widely used in the mining chain that prioritize energy efficiency, safety in the mineral chain processes, and the reduction of CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nIt operates on two fronts: the teaching front, which is related to the purpose of contributing to the disseminate knowledge in the company and in society, and the research and development front in the areas of Tribology, Automation, Control & Robotics, Mining, and Extractive Metallurgy & Mineral Treatment.\n\nAn example of a project that benefitted from the cooperation of ITV is Ecoshipping, created by Vale to meet the challenge of reducing its carbon emissions, in line with what has been discussed within the scope of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\n\nEcoshipping\n\nVale\u2019s project to create the first large ore ship equipped with a rotating sail system won the International Wind Propulsion Innovation Award in November 2021. Still in the testing phase, the innovative use of wind propulsion can offer an efficiency gain of up to 8% and a consequent reduction of up to 3,400 tons of CO\u2082 equivalent per ship per year. The initial results of the pilot test have already aroused the interest of partner shipowners, who are developing new projects with rotating sails. It is estimated that at least 40% of the fleet dedicated to the company\u2019s service is able to use the technology, which would impact to a reduction of almost 1.5% in annual emissions from Vale\u2019s maritime transport of Iron Ore.

These involve initial communication, adoption of immediate actions and investigation of causes, implementation of corrective actions to eliminate undesired effects of the event and recording of lessons learned.\n\nIn 2021, 28 environmental incidents were classified as severe, compared to 16 events registered in 2020, according to the company\u2019s risk classification criteria. We advanced in 2021, compared with 2020, with respect to critical and very critical incidents, with no occurrence in 2021, compared to three occurrences in 2020.\n\nAll incidents were investigated by a multidisciplinary group and reported to the appropriate government agencies. Managing these topics involves reassessing the drainage system, deploying inspection routines in the control systems, conducting engineering works and projects, preparatory plans for the rainy season, and training employees. Proper investigation enables the identification of contributing factors, risk reduction, inclusion of new environmental controls, and improvement of industrial processes.

This information supports Vale\u2019s analysis and concession process to help us obtain environmental licenses.\nReducing emissions and making Vale resilient to the effects of climate change are strategic priorities. We maintain a program to manage risks and opportunities related to climate change, aligned with the guidelines of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The topic is addressed by a robust governance structure that includes the Low Carbon Forum, a governance structure that monitor performance and which strives to ensure delivery of the climate agenda, which includes the periodic participation of the Executive Board and Vale\u2019s leadership.\n\nVale\u2019s decarbonization strategy is public and based on a global policy. Vale understands the importance of providing transparency on our roadmap for the delivering emissions reduction and Net-zero targets, so it has been disclosing information on the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) since 2003, in Vale\u2019s ESG Portal, and published its first climate report in 2021.\n\nIn addition, our annual performance is assessed by specialized institutions such as Sustainalytics, Climate Action 100+ and RFC Ambrian, and in 2021 we received an \u201cA-\u201d rating in CDP\u2019s assessment, which is above average in the mining sector average. The points for improvement identified in the table above, such as the adaptation of strategies and targets to new temperature scenarios, definition of intermediate targets, and inclusion of Scope 3 emission in the 2050 target, come from an evaluation and comparison of Vale\u2019s performance with market best practices.\n\nVale\u2019s capital allocation is subject to a shadow carbon price of USD 50/tCO\u2082e in the valuation of its projects. We implement carbon pricing in the trade-off analysis of projects and during the decision-making process for new investments, with the objective of enabling and accelerating the transition to a Net-zero economy. In addition, we use the marginal abatement cost curve (MACC or MAC curve) tool to prioritize investments and resources in emission reduction initiatives. Our MAC curve has already mapped initiatives with reduction potential of approximately 10 MtCO\u2082e, enough to cover Vale\u2019s Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction target.\n\nAt the institutional level, Vale participates in the main associations and institutions that promote positioning on climate change mitigation innovations and policies in line with the broader objectives of the Paris Agreement. Additionally, we are not involved with any association whose positioning and actions diverge from the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe maintain a program to manage risks and opportunities related to climate change, aligned with the guidelines of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.\n\n**Commitments to a Low Carbon Economy**\n\n**TARGET:**\n\n**REDUCE SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS BY 33% BY 2030**\n\nOur target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions, by 2030 is aligned with the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to well-below 2\u00b0C and is based on 2017 emissions, which totaled 13.5 MtCO\u2082e. We built this target based on criteria for science-based target setting of Science Based Target initiative (SBTi)\u00b2.\n\n1. Base year 2017 emissions would total 12.3 million tCO\u2082e considering manganese and coal divestments.\n2. SBTi - TWG-INF-002 | Version 4.2 April 2021, valid until June 2022.\nIn 2021, Vale\u2019s activities resulted in the emission of 505 million tons of CO\u2082e adding Scopes 1, 2 and 3 together. The direct Scope 1 emissions (fuels, industrial processes and other minor sources) and indirect Scope 2 market-based emissions (electricity purchase) totaled 10.2 million tons of CO\u2082e in the period, an increase of 2% when compared to 2020 and reduction of 24% when compared to 2017. GRI 305-1 e GRI 305-2\n\nVale\u2019s indicator in 2021, of 24.4 kg CO\u2082e/t MFe-eq, was about 5% lower than 2017 intensity, of 25.6 kg CO\u2082e/t MFe-eq. Although the intensity indicator showed a slight improvement, the reduction seen in absolute emissions, of 24% (considering Scope 1 and marked based Scope 2), is mainly due to the drop in production levels compared to 2017. GRI 305-4\n\nAn increase in production is expected in the short term, according to Vale\u2019s production and sales report, which may lead to an increase in emissions. In the medium term, a drop in emissions is expected due to the implementation of low-carbon initiatives by the PowerShift program.\n\nConsidering the divestment of manganese (already completed in early 2022) and coal (sales agreement) assets, which will entail a revision of the baselines for the commitments undertaken, Vale\u2019s 2021 Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions totaled 9.0 million tons of CO\u2082e, an increase of 2% compared to 2020 and reduction of 27% compared to 2017. The divestments are subject to Vale\u2019s commitment to a just transition for coal mining workers and communities. See more at Divestments in non-core assets here and here.\n\nEnergy consumption was 146.2 thousand TJ, a small increase over the previous year, mainly due to the resumption of Iron Ore and Pellet production volumes and, more significantly, Coal, despite the reduction in Nickel and Copper production, mainly as a result of the strike in Sudbury. Due to this slight volume recovery and maintenance of the consumption level, the global energy intensity was 0.349 TJ/thousand tons of Iron Ore equivalent, a 1% reduction from that verified in 2020. GRI 302-1 and 302-3\n\nVale\u2019s Energy Efficiency Program, which aims to drive initiatives that promote a reduction in the energy intensity in our production processes, has set a reduction target of 5% by 2030, compared to the 2017 baseline.\n\nThis work is being developed globally by means of multidisciplinary groups in each operation and relies on the direct involvement of more than 400 people, supported by SmartEnergy, a platform for managing energy consumption inputs throughout the company.\n\nScope 1 and 2 emission reduction initiatives implemented in 2021 contributed to a reduction of approximately 78 thousand tCO\u2082e and are mainly related to energy efficiency initiatives. Matrix change technologies in mine, rail and metallurgical processing operations are still in technological development phase and will have a greater impact from 2026 onwards. GRI 305-5\n\n1 Vale\u2019s Scope 1 and 2 location-based emissions totaled 11.1 million tons of CO\u2082e, an increase of 6% from 2020 and 18% from 2017.\n2 Results reported in absolute emissions and do not include any type of offset.\n3 In this indicator, production volumes of Vale\u2019s main products, such as Pellets, Coal, Nickel and Copper, are converted into tons of Iron Ore equivalent.\n4 2017 indicator recalculated considering VNC and Biopalma sales. If we consider Coal and Manganese divestments, Vale\u2019s indicator in 2021 would total 21.9 kg CO\u2082e/t MFe-eq, about 9% lower than the 2017 intensity of 24.0 kg CO\u2082e/t MFe-eq.\n5 According to GHG Protocol methodology, divestments will only be removed from total emissions in the year of sale, that is, in 2022, implying a recalculation of the emissions of the base year 2017 for Scopes 1 and 2, and base year 2018 for Scope 3.\n6 If we consider Coal and Manganese divestments, Vale\u2019s Scope 1 and 2 location-based emissions would total 9.8 million tons of CO\u2082e, an increase of 6% from 2020 and a reduction of 20% from 2017.\n7 2020 energy intensity indicator was adjusted from 0.362 to 0.352 TJ/thousand tons of Iron Ore equivalent, due to the revision of the iron ore equivalent production value used in the calculation. This change does not generate significant impact. GRI 102-48\nIn 2021, Vale announced investments of USD 4 to 6 billion by 2030 to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Reduction initiatives are prioritized by the company according to its emission abatement curve for 2030, which is public and can be accessed in the Climate Change Report. About 75% of the abatement curve initiatives, consolidated in reduction potential by type of project graph showed positive NPV\\(^1\\), at a shadow price of USD 50/tCO\\(_2\\)e.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the adoption of the best technologies for each asset is under constant reassessment, due to factors such as technological maturity, costs of clean fuels or equipment and technical feasibility due to local operational characteristics. Therefore, the total reduction potential in the MAC curve could not be completely fulfilled.\n\nIn 2021, Vale announced investments of up to USD 6 billion by 2030 to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\nPowerShift \u2013 Vale Decarbonization Program\n\nIn the context of the decarbonization program in 2021, we conducted a number of tests in our operations, particularly the use of bio-oil, vegetable charcoal (biocarbon) and additives to reduce energy consumption in pelletizing plants. In addition, we successfully operated a battery powered locomotive in the Tubar\u00e3o Port in Vit\u00f3ria, an unprecedented piece of equipment among large mining companies. 5% of the underground vehicle fleet in Canada\u2019s operations are already electric vehicles. For the year 2022, we highlight:\n\n- Providing a second zero-emission locomotive, for operations at the port of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, using new battery technology.\n- Introducing battery-powered trucks in Brazil and Indonesia.\n- Implementing the trolley-assist system in Caraj\u00e1s, significantly reducing diesel consumption in off-road trucks and enabling the possible implementation of battery-powered trucks.\n- Continuing of biocarbon tests in Pelletizing.\n- Using a battery-powered electric locomotive to transport Iron Ore on the Vit\u00f3ria\u2013Minas Railroad.\n\nTARGET:\nNET ZERO SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS BY 2050\n\nAs mining is considered a hard-to-abate sector, any residual emissions from the company may be subject to neutralization using Nature-based Solutions (NBSs) with socio-environmental benefits, and qualified carbon credits with high credibility, aligned with international best practices.\n\nTARGET:\n100% RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY IN BRAZIL (2025) AND GLOBALLY (2030)\n\nIn 2021, electricity represented 29.6% of Vale\u2019s energy consumption matrix, with 89% coming from renewable sources. In Brazil, this percentage is even higher, 99% come from renewable sources, with 96% guaranteed by concession contracts for own assets, as well as by Vale\u2019s energy acquisition contracts. This contracted renewable energy was attested through certificates or declarations from generators, having been audited by a third party.\n\nVale\u2019s electricity self-generation portfolio is 99% renewable. The installed capacity in 2021 was 2.3 GW, related to hydroelectric and wind power generation assets, directly and indirectly owned, located in Brazil, Canada, and Indonesia. These plants supply an average of 59% of Vale\u2019s global electricity consumption and 69% of Vale\u2019s consumption in Brazil, and contribute to our climate change commitment to reduce GHG emissions.\n\nInitiatives for advances in renewable energy\n\nThe Sol do Cerrado Project stands out among the initiatives on this front for generating solar energy in the municipality of Ja\u00edba (MG), in Brazil. With an installed capacity of 766 megawatts-peak, the project will produce a mean capacity of approximately 193 megawatts of energy per year for Vale\u2019s operations, corresponding to 13% of our demand for 2025. Scheduled to come online in late 2022, the solar project will be one of the largest in Latin America.\n\nIn addition to investing in generation, Vale entered into agreements in 2021 to use energy storage batteries in its operations at the Ilha da Gua\u00edba Terminal and in Sudbury, Canada, thus helping to ensure greater competitiveness and security of energy supply to these operations.\n\n1 90% from hydro and 10% from wind.\n2 Historical averages of the percentages of self-production globally and in Brazil since 2017. In the year 2021, these percentages represented about 62% and 72% respectively.\n**TARGET: REDUCE SCOPE 3 NET EMISSIONS BY 15% BY 2035**\n\nOur company\u2019s challenge is the reduction of emissions in its chain \u2013 Scope 3, since 98% of Vale\u2019s total emissions occur in the value chain. Therefore, we were pioneers among mining companies in establishing a Scope 3 quantitative emissions reduction target based on SBTi criteria. Vale has made the attainment of this target more flexible with the possibility of limited use of offsets of high-quality carbon credits, for two main reasons: (I) challenge to reduce emissions at customers; (II) to foster the voluntary carbon market.\n\nAbout 97% of Vale\u2019s Scope 3 emissions are downstream in its value chain, mainly in steelmaking, from processing, transportation and the use of products sold by the company.\n\nIn 2021 Scope 3 emissions totaled 495 million tons of CO\u2082e, representing an increase of 3% compared to 2020, and a reduction of 15% compared to the 2018 base year emissions. The variation is mainly due to changes in the sales volume of our products. Considering the divestment of manganese and coal assets, Vale\u2019s Scope 3 emissions in 2021 would total 480 million tCO\u2082e, an 2% increase from 2020 and an 16% reduction from 2018.\n\n**Scope 3 emission reduction initiatives**\n\n- **Upstream**\n  - Fomenting suppliers\u2019 emission reduction\n    - Supplier engagement via CDP Supply Chain, with provision in contractual clause\n    - 375 suppliers engaged in 2021\n\n- **Scope 1 and 2 emissions**\n  - Power Shift Program:\n    - 2021 pilots are part of technologies roadmap with estimated potential to reduce more than 3 MCO\u2082e/year by 2030\n    - 36% of the Sol do Cerrado Solar Project implemented in 2021. Operations start in 2022 and the project will reduce 145 MCO\u2082e per year from Scope 2\n\n- **Scope 3 emissions Downstream**\n  - Shipping of Vale\u2019s products to its global clients\n  - Ecoshipping Program:\n    - 2 pilots implemented in 2021\n    - Rotor Sails potential reduction of up to 3,400 tCO\u2082e per ship per year\n    - Air Lubrication potential reduction of up to 5,600 tCO\u2082e per ship per year\n\n- **Higher quality products and innovative solutions to lower client\u2019s emissions**\n  - Improvement in our high-quality portfolio\n  - New technologies, such as iron ore \u201cgreen briquettes\u201d and dry concentration technology\n  - Tecnored technology, which can produce a \u201cgreen\u201d low-cost pig iron, using biocarbon instead of coal\n  - Biomass to replace coal\n\n- **Partnerships to test innovative solutions in steelmaking**\n  - Engaged clients represent approximately 30% of global steel production and about 40% of Vale\u2019s Scope 3 emissions\n  - Electrometallurgical Company1 investment\n\n---\n\n1. Boston Metal is a pre-operating company, founded in 2012 by professors from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), whose objective is the development of an innovative technology called molten oxide electrolysis (MOE), which reduces metallic oxides such as Iron Ore with the use of electricity. This MOE process will enable the transformation of Iron Ore for steel production with zero CO\u2082 emissions.\nWe recognize that reducing emissions in our chain will only be possible through solid partnerships, which is why we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with relevant steelmaking customers to develop joint solutions to decarbonize and test new low-carbon products, such as the \"green briquette\" (see the box below). In total, engaged clients represent approximately 30% of global steel production and about 40% of Vale\u2019s Scope 3 emissions.\n\n**Low-carbon products**\n\nVale already has low-carbon products in its portfolio, such as \"green briquettes\", a new agglomerated Iron Ore product, and low-carbon Nickel products produced in Long Harbour, Canada.\n\nLong Harbour\u2019s Nickel products, Plating Rounds and Casting Nickel Wheels have a carbon footprint of 4.4 tons of CO\u2082 equivalent per ton of Nickel, about three times lower than the global average intensity reported by the Nickel Institute for Class I nickel.\n\nThe \"green briquette\" on the other hand, was a new product we developed internally by the company over almost 20 years and launched to the market in 2021. It is formed by using Iron Ore and a technological binder solution, which contains sand from treated mining tailings and can withstand high blast-furnace temperatures without disintegrating.\n\nThe \"green briquette\" has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in steel production by up to 10% for Vale\u2019s steel customers. The GHG reduction occurs because the product allows the steelmaker to reduce their dependence on sintering, a process prior to steelmaking in which fine Iron Ore is agglomerated (sinter feed).\nAmong signed MoUs, we can highlight those signed with Ternium in Brazil, with the Chinese company, Baowu and with the Korean company, POSCO, which scopes seek decarbonization solutions in steel production that include our product portfolio, high quality Iron Ore, \u201cgreen briquettes\u201d metallic, alternative steel production routes, among others.\n\nThrough our Ecoshipping program, Vale is also investing in several R&D initiatives, in partnership with external research institutions, to map and test new technologies capable of reducing emissions in maritime transport. In 2021, we developed pilots to test innovative technologies aimed at reducing the intensity of emissions, such as rotary sails, air lubrication, and hull cleaning with robots. See more about this initiative in Innovation.\n\nIn relation to our Upstream emissions chain, via the CDP Supply Chain Program, approximately 500 suppliers were selected to participate in the program in 2021, with 75% adherence (375 suppliers) and 91% adherence of the 2020 respondents invited for the second year (221 suppliers). 22% of the suppliers were classified as leaders or with good management in the theme (CDP score A and B), with 63% evaluated as having low level of maturity. We identified a total of 288 opportunities with substantial strategic or financial impact, as well as emission reduction partnership opportunities with several suppliers.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities\n\nWe have adopted the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines to manage the impacts of our transition to a low-carbon economy, and the physical impacts of climate change on our operations. Also, in 2020 Vale conducted a climate scenario analysis of its portfolio based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios and plans to structure an analysis for a 1.5 \u00b0C rise scenario in 2022.\n\nMAIN RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES MAPPED\n\n**TRANSITION RISKS**\n- Changes in public policies to restrict emissions, including carbon taxation\n- Climate-related litigation with impacts on the company\u2019s image\n- Changes in demand, favoring low-carbon products\n- Product substitution due to new technologies and processes\n\n**PHYSICAL RISKS**\n- Chronic risks, such as rising average temperatures, rising sea level, and changes in rainfall patterns\n- Acute risks, such as extreme weather and sea conditions\n\n**CLIMATE-RELATED OPPORTUNITIES**\n- Use of lower emission energy sources, with potential cost reductions\n- Diversification into higher quality, lower carbon products and services\n\nLearn more\nAccess the description of risks and opportunities, as well as Vale\u2019s management actions for each, in the Climate Change 2021 Report.\nBiodiversity\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3\n\nVale prioritizes risk analysis and adopts measures intended to prevent, mitigate, recover, and compensate these impacts. In 2021, the area impacted by our operations totaled 814.57 sq km. New suppressed areas totaled 10.13 sq km and areas of permanent recovery totaled 18.2 sq km. (GRI 304-1, 304-3 | G4 MM1). Part of our operations, due to the locational rigidity of the business, overlap and interface with areas of high value for biodiversity, such as hotspots and key biodiversity areas, and approximately 30% interfere with protected areas. We remain committed to further reducing our impacts, as well as restoring and compensating the areas and habitats we affect, in line with our long-term goal of neutralizing impacts on biodiversity in new projects.\n\nOperations that generate significant impacts in areas of high value for biodiversity require management programs, which we are implementing and improving either through legal obligations or voluntary commitments. Among the 61 operational units evaluated in 2021, 54 (88.5%) required the preparation of management programs. (GRI G4 MM2). For these units, 51 programs have already been implemented, seven are being prepared and one is a future proposal, and some of the units contemplate more than one project and, therefore, have more than one associated program.\n\nThe Caraj\u00e1s Biodiversity Management Plan (PGBio Caraj\u00e1s), published in 2021, is a dynamic document that integrates and consolidates all our initiatives related to risk management and impacts on sensitive habitats and species in Vale\u2019s operations and projects in the region.\n\nIn 2021, we recorded 5,442 species as occurring in habitats impacted by Vale\u2019s operations or located near its operations, of which 2,968 were fauna and 2,471 flora. Of these, 135 fall within the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) threats classification scheme. GRI 304-4\n\nLearn more\nAbout Caraj\u00e1s Biodiversity Management Plan.\n\nProtected areas\n\nGRI 304-3\n\nWe currently protect or help protect an area of approximately 10,000 sq km, equivalent to 12 times the area occupied by our operations. As a result of this work, developed through an integrated management of the territories and partnerships, it is also highlighted the protection of native fauna and flora species, including endemic and endangered species.\n\nOur operations work to recover degraded areas by restoring forest and recovering habitats and important ecosystem services. By 2021, more than 5,000 hectares have been recovered in rural properties mostly located south of the Caraj\u00e1s National Forest within the Connectivity Project \u2013 Northern System Forest Corridor. This project goes beyond fulfilling legal requirements, aiming to increase the forest cover in areas previously occupied by agricultural activities and to promote connection in the landscape. In addition, we are fostering partnerships with a local cooperative to buy seeds of native species, generating alternatives for the sustainable use of the forest.\n\nBiodiversity management in the value chain\n\nVale understands the challenge of integrating biodiversity management into the value chain. Therefore, it has addressed initiatives to help support the supply chain and commercial areas to adopt environmental requirements, which include biodiversity, in engaging with customers and suppliers. For example, customers that consume forest-based raw materials are required to provide documents attesting to their socio-environmental compliance in their production process supply chain. As next steps, the company intends to establish a more robust evaluation with an inspection routine, also seeking to evaluate issues involving illegal deforestation in the value chain and other concerns.\nVale's 2030 forestry commitment\n\nRECOVERY OF 100,000 HECTARES OF FORESTS\nThe Vale Fund supported the development of five agroforestry businesses that implemented productive recovery models on 5,125 hectares in a pilot phase, adding up to an area of more than 6,000 hectares between 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe startups Belterra, Caapor\u00e3, Bioenergia, Inocas, and Regenera develop businesses related to the cocoa, cassava, a\u00e7ai, baru, banana, and pupunha chains, among others, in seven Brazilian states and in four different biomes (Caatinga, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and the Amazon), generating jobs and income for family agriculture. We have earmarked investments of approximately USD 10.21 million to structure and leverage the business.\n\nBelterra: Socio-environmental impact and recovery of degraded areas\n\nIncubated as part of Vale's 2030 Forestry Commitment and supported by the Vale Fund, Belterra Agroflorestas was born with vision of being a company that would achieve a social and environmental impact in rural areas by restoring degraded areas throughout Brazil.\n\nThe business model that sustains the company's operations is based on deploying of regenerative production systems, such as the Agroforestry and Agro-silvopastoral systems, on small and medium-sized properties, through leasing and/or rural partnership agreements.\n\nIn its second year of operation, Belterra has raised investments with a European climate fund and is in advanced stages of negotiation with a Brazilian investment fund for a new round of expansion in the coming years. In addition, it is negotiating supply contracts with large companies in the cocoa and cassava chain.\n\n\"With the support of Belterra Agroflorestas, we were able to diversify our production. We started planting cocoa and increased the productive efficiency here at Recanto das \u00c1guas Farm. The project was so successful that it encouraged my daughter, who is a dentist, to take over the cocoa production, ensuring that we will have another generation at the head of our family property\".\n\nAdemir de Paulo Dan, Mr. Juca, from Parauapebas (PA)\n\nAcceleration Program\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Vale Fund joined its partners to start an Acceleration Program with the purpose of being a catalyst for businesses that operate in sustainable value chains linked to Vale's forest recovery goals.\n\nThe expectation is to help companies move toward economic sustainability while scaling their field operations to meet recovery commitments. To achieve this goal, entrepreneurs receive support and guidance to develop, plan, and execute short, medium, and long-term strategies.\n\nThe Program also helps to strengthen a Sustainable Impact Business Ecosystem supported by partner institutions with specific and transversal skills to help entrepreneurs along their journey.\nPROTECTION OF 400,000 HECTARES OF FORESTS\n\nTo protect forests, we formed partnerships in 2021 with three Conservation Units managed by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio in Portuguese). Together, these Biological Reserves (REBio) help to protect more than 62,000 hectares of Atlantic Forest in three Brazilian states.\n\nIn addition, we continue to work to protect and conserve the units covered by agreements we signed in 2020, which involve 52,848 hectares, adding up to an area of 115,093.96 hectares already protected in two years.\n\nBuilding a legacy for the Amazon\n\nMore than 80% of the protected areas Vale owns and supports are located in the Amazon, where the company has promoted biodiversity conservation initiatives for more than 30 years. In the last decade, through the Vale Fund, we have supported more than 90 initiatives by research institutions, governments, NGOs and startups to protect forests.\n\nThrough the Vale Institute of Technology, the company has been investing around USD 220.8 million in research in science and technology since 2011. Of this amount, approximately USD 114 million has been applied to research for sustainable development, mainly in the areas of biodiversity, environmental genomics, and climate change.\n\nArtificial intelligence in the fight against deforestation\n\nIn 2021, the Vale Fund and Microsoft supported the Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon) in developing PrevisIA, a platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) in an aim to anticipate information about Amazon regions at risk of deforestation and fires.\n\nPrevisIA analyzes diverse data such as topography, land cover, urban infrastructure, official and unofficial roads, and socioeconomic data, among others, to identify forest conversion trends through deforestation.\n\nThis public information is available here, and its analyses have been used strategically by public agencies to plan and execute preventive actions to combat and control deforestation.\n\nEnvironmental genomics of the Amazon\n\nIn 2021, the Vale Sustainable Development Technology Institute began genetic studies to learn about the DNA of the Amazon. The Amazon DNA project aims to help identify fauna and flora species and to support the challenges of biodiversity conservation through environmental monitoring.\n\nAnother biotechnology application is investigating species via DNA sequencing with economic purposes to generate income for families and native peoples by improving their cultivation.\n\nThe Amazon DNA project has also partnered with the Federal University of Par\u00e1, The Rockefeller University, Dresden University Of Technology, Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, University of Copenhagen, PUC RS, Federal University of Minas Gerais, and the Brazilian Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\nIn 2021, Vale made a public commitment not to operate in UNESCO Natural World Heritage Sites. The Vale Natural Reserve (RNV in Portuguese), a protected area owned by the company that is dedicated to the conservation of 23,000 ha of Atlantic Forest remnants, as well as the Sooretama Biological Reserve (REBio), a protected area that Vale protects in partnership with ICMBio, are part of the Discovery Coast Atlantic Forest Reserves World Heritage Site. They also constitute a Key Area for Biodiversity Conservation.\n\nAdditionally, since 2020 Vale has been part of the Brazilian Business Commitment to Biodiversity, proposed by the Brazilian Business Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS) and the Business for Nature Call for Action, a union of companies and institutions seeking to reduce biodiversity loss. In 2021, Vale also joined yet another transparency tool for its biodiversity results \u2013 responding to CDP Forest, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project and its call to disclose our environmental impact.\n\nLearn more about initiatives and results in Vale\u2019s 2021 Biodiversity report.\n\nEcoefficiency\nGRI 103-2, 103-3\n\nWater resources\nVale\u2019s main uses of water are ore beneficiation, machines and parts cleaning, environmental controls, sanitation and human consumption. Our effluents, on the other hand, come from industrial uses, drainage, and human consumption and are reused in the company\u2019s processes whenever feasible.\n\nAware of the risks associated with water scarcity, and in line with the guidelines of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), Vale has a Water and Water Resources Policy with guidelines for responsibly and rationally managing water resources and effluents.\n\nWATER STRESS ASSESSMENTS\nTo assess water stress in the areas where it operates, Vale uses the Aqueduct tool, developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI). Applied in 43 units, the tool provides an overview of the region\u2019s most susceptible to river and coastal floods, as well as the severity of droughts and seasonal and inter-annual water variability and scarcity that can be expected. This helps the company to correlate our water use with the indicated degrees of risk.\n\nIn 2021 our global result accumulated since the base year was a 20% reduction, which exceeded our initial goal set for 2030 (a 10% reduction). Highlights were our operations in the Amazon region and part of the operations in southeastern Brazil, which achieved an accumulated reduction of 47%. GRI 303-1\n\nAs a guideline of our Water and Water Resources Policy, when we reach our goal, we must define new goals. Thus, new targets based on responsible water resources management and effluents will be published in 2022.\n\n2030 WATER TARGET\nAiming to promote water security in the regions where we are present \u2013 that is, to ensure water is available in sufficient quantity and quality for human supply, economic activities and aquatic ecosystem conservation \u2013 in 2018 we established the Water Target. Our commitment was to reduce by 10% the withdrawal of fresh water for use in our production processes by 2030 compared to 2017 as the base year.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we invested in (a) expanding our water monitoring network, (b) initiatives to reuse effluents in the company\u2019s processes, (c) using rainwater, (d) searching for new technologies, and (e) developing studies to continuously improve our responsible water resource management.\n\nIn 2021 our global result accumulated since the base year was a 20% reduction, which exceeded our initial goal set for 2030 (a 10% reduction). Highlights were our operations in the Amazon region and part of the operations in southeastern Brazil, which achieved an accumulated reduction of 47%. GRI 303-1\n\nAs a guideline of our Water and Water Resources Policy, when we reach our goal, we must define new goals. Thus, new targets based on responsible water resources management and effluents will be published in 2022.\nAtmospheric emissions \u2013 particulate matter, NOx and SOx\n\nGiven the impacts of atmospheric emissions and with our ambition to be a leader in sustainable mining, Vale established the following targets in 2021 to reduce its particulate matter (PM), sulfur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 2030, compared to 2018* as the base year.\n\nIn this context, Vale invested about USD 80 million in 2021 in operational improvements and adopted new technologies to control and manage atmospheric emissions. Other initiatives and projects are planned to reduce NOx, SOx and PM by 2030, such as the use of alternative fuels, specific technologies and improved operational efficiency. There was an adjustment of the emissions data at the PT Vale Indonesia (PTVI) unit to make it compatible with the method reported to the local environmental agency. These changes led to higher emissions of SOx and NOx in 2019 and 2020, as shown in the following graphs.\n\nIn 2021, particulate matter emissions were 47% lower, due to reduced production at the PTVI plant and at the Tubar\u00e3o pelletizing plants, as well as the shutdown period at Sudbury.\n\nSulfur oxides emissions for 2021 were 77.1 tons. The most significant reductions occurred in Sudbury and PTVI, due to lower production. In addition, there were reductions due to the mass balance, a calculation methodology used in these units that is subject to variations in the characteristics of inputs and processes. In Pelletizing, the main reductions occurred in Tubar\u00e3o and S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, due to the use of fuels with lower sulfur content and improved energy efficiency.\n\n*After the Brumadinho accident in 2019, there was a reduction in production due to the shutdown of some operations, consequently generating a reduction in emissions in this year and subsequent years. After the gradual resumption of operations and new projects to increase production until 2030, a proportional increase in the emissions curve is expected. With the planned initiatives, we project reductions in NOx, SOx and PM emissions.\nMine Closure and Future Use\n\nThe process of planning for the closure of assets should occur in parallel to the operation, minimizing risks and maximizing opportunities to generate value for the territories. The possibilities of post-mining use must contemplate a vision of the territory that integrates constraints and opportunities. We have the great challenge of structuring the governance of these processes and building, together with society, proposals for the future use and transition of mined territories that is compatible with the environmental and socioeconomic vocations of the affected areas.\n\nFor iron ore operations, co-creation for the future use of mined territories is supported by integrated database management, which allows us to analyze and prioritize the progressive closure of our assets while also integrating a plan for operations and identifying the regional aptitudes that form the basis for advancing the future use assessments.\n\nCurrently, we work with an annual cycle to plan and execute the progressive closure of assets and study our territories\u2019 aptitudes and potentialities. Among the projects for future use in progress, we can highlight the \u00c1guas Claras Mine (MAC in Portuguese) and parts of the territory of the Itabira Complex, both in Minas Gerais, Brazil.\n\nAmong the projects for future use in progress, we can highlight the \u00c1guas Claras Mine (MAC) and parts of the territory of the Itabira Complex.\nFUTURE USE OF THE \u00c1GUAS CLARAS MINE\nLocated between Nova Lima and Belo Horizonte, in the Serra do Curral region, the \u00c1guas Claras Mine was shut down in 2002, after 30 years of operation by MBR, and is currently undergoing closure and decharacterization works.\n\nThe surrounding area contains condominiums and clusters of residential neighbourhoods with strong commercial intensity alongside rural areas and environmental preservation areas, so water is important in the region. Therefore, the closure process represents a complex and multifaceted reality that requires the involvement of various players and interests.\n\nIn 2020, we started to plan the future use of the enterprise. At that time, we consulted the local community to identify potentialities and restrictions for future occupation and society\u2019s expectations regarding the area, by means of a perception study. The result pointed to the valorization of the region\u2019s natural capital to drive the future use process, as it has potential in the social spheres of ecotourism, leisure, environmental conservation / education, real estate ventures and public services. With this guiding strategy, the next steps will involve feasibility studies and continued engagement in implementing the mapped actions.\n\nFUTURE USE OF MINES IN ITABIRA\nItabira is the city where Vale was born in 1942. Today, we are looking for ways to continue operations there while beginning the closure process in a responsible, sustainable and gradual manner. Through projects to explore future use we are transitioning to post-mining activities. Our objective is to rely on the community\u2019s active participation and meet the aspirations of Itabira society.\n\nIn the initial stage, we sought to evaluate the potential and restrictions of future use, primarily in an area in the Pontal/Doze basin, surrounded by urban and rural areas. During the knowledge gathering stage, we identified several natural interferences and socio-economic pressures in the surrounding area, among them urban expansion vectors, the presence of vulnerable communities, protected forest fragments, as well as areas of interest and socio-cultural importance, which we compiled in an integrated territorial base.\n\nIn 2020 we carried out a survey to understand the relationship between the community and the conservation areas \u2013 natural capital assets \u2013 that are currently under our responsibility. Based on this research, we mapped initiatives with the potential to reconcile environmental conservation, the creation of shared value and financial sustainability. Among the opportunities, according to compatibility and use restrictions, we identified renewable energy generation as a possible way to re-signify the territory in the feasibility stage of our future use approach.\n\nIn 2021, Vale and the Itabira City Hall established a group to plan, prioritize and integrate the company\u2019s activities in the municipality. The company provided the services of a specialized consultancy to build a short, medium and long-term strategy to direct the municipality\u2019s sustainable development. Actions are underway to link the sustainable development initiatives with the municipality\u2019s expected future perspectives in terms of mining dependency.\n\nPROVISION FOR ASSET DECOMMISSIONING AND MINE CLOSURE\nGRI G4 MM10\nWe prepare and review, on an annual basis, a cost estimate for decommissioning assets (pits, piles, dams, industrial facilities, etc.). To prepare this estimate we follows the Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) methodology, provide full disclosure in our financial statements, and comply with the requirements defined by International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In the 2021 cycle, 100% of our operations* had Closure Plans and made provisions totalling approximately USD 4.2 billion.\n\nAmong the ESG gaps we identified is \u201cDisclose information on mine closure planning, including community engagement process\u201d, with a deadline for completion in 2022.

The Office also establishes policies and technical guidelines with the aim to ensure occupational health and safety aligned with ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards.\n\nAs part of a broad governance review, in 2019, Safety and Operational Excellence Executive Board was implemented.\n\nAccidents and fatalities\n\nIn 2021, there were two fatalities at Vale. These events show that there is still a lot to be done to honour our commitment to achieve zero fatal accidents.\n\nOne of the fatalities involved a company employee (in Itagua\u00ed, Rio de Janeiro) and the other involved a contractor in Moatize, Mozambique.\n\nBelow is the evolution of fatalities at Vale since 2018, followed by a brief description of the occurrences in 2021:\n\n| Year | Contractors | Employees | Total |\n|------|-------------|-----------|-------|\n| 2018 | 1           | 1         | 2     |\n| 2019 | 118         | 124       | 242   |\n| 2020 | 3           | 1         | 4     |\n| 2021 | 1           | 1         | 2     |\n\nFATALITIES IN 2021\n\nIn April, during a maintenance outage at Ship loader 01 in Sepetiba Bay Port Company Terminal (CPBS in Portuguese) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \u2013 an electrician who was a Vale employee fell from a height of approximately 18 meters upon finishing a repair and after releasing the equipment. The employee succumbed to his injuries and died in hospital.\n\nIn June, at the Moatize Mine in Tete, Mozambique, an employee of a contracted company was performing an operation on the 220 kV power transmission line when he came into contact with high-voltage electricity. Rescue efforts were unsuccessful, and he died.\n\nBoth occurrences underwent an investigation process. It was conducted by internal investigation teams, led by an executive in a neutral and impartial position from another operation, and involved global subject matter experts and employees both directly and through the Internal Commissions for Accident Prevention (CIPA in Portuguese).\n\nThe occurrences were shared via webcasts. Based on the investigations, we defined comprehensive actions that are now mandatory to prevent similar accidents in the future and compliance with these actions is required by all of Vale's areas.\nMain initiatives\n\nVale\u2019s occupational safety management comprises a series of initiatives ranging from mapping and adopting measures for risk mitigation to protocols and requirements for certain activities. The initiatives include actions to promote the physical and emotional health and well-being of employees. They include:\n\n- Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA): a structured process that identifies hazards and analyzes risks, details the causes of the scenarios for process accidents, the existing protections and the criticality of the risks in the people and environment dimensions \u2013 during its first cycle (2019 to 2021). In the second cycle (2022 to 2025), critical and very critical operational scenarios with potential business interruption will also be considered. This process also aims to continuously improve the integrity of Vale\u2019s critical assets.\n\n- Technical Standards of Asset Integrity (PNR): standards applicable to the asset\u2019s life cycle (engineering, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning) that define technical requirements to prevent and mitigate undesired events based on risk scenarios.\n\n- Metrics for process accidents: guidelines for capturing and investigating process accidents (process safety) were standardized \u2013 events involving Vale\u2019s productive processes that result in uncontrolled release of energy and/or materials (toxic or not). In 2021 the pyramid of process events was created. When fully implemented, process accidents will become an important indicator in Vale\u2019s safety strategy.\n\n- Safe Work Permit (SWP): process that assesses risks of routine and non-routine tasks considered critical or very critical. The process starts in the maintenance planning stage, continues with a discussion at the activity site, goes through the execution of the activity and ends with the delivery of the service and closing of the maintenance order.\n\n- Critical Activity Requirements (RAC): internal compliance standards for the execution of critical and very critical tasks. They are critical requirements for the elimination of fatal accidents in these activities.\n\n- Exposure to health risks: global corporate guidelines for the management and development of monitoring and control programs for employee occupational health, which includes quantitative objectives for the reduction of health risk scenarios in the medium term.\n\n- Promoting Healthy Habits (VP GO): Global employee competition to achieve healthy habit challenges with 21,957 participants in 14 countries. As key outcomes of the program in 2021, we report that: 61% of participants are more active after the program, 76% improved at least 1 nutritional habit, 26% felt less stressed after participating, 20% felt more productive, and 24% reported feeling more energized.\n\nThe company also respects the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in relation to labour laws, which include not allowing employees to work more than 48 hours a week on regular time and 60 hours including overtime.\n\nIn addition, Vale acts to promote employee health by complying with local legal requirements, considering the World Health Organization (WHO) global agenda to focus on themes such as the common flu, sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, men\u2019s and women\u2019s health, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and mental health.\n\nDisability prevention\n\nIn 2021, Vale implemented global guidelines to strengthen our efforts to prevent cases leading to employee disability. Musculoskeletal and mental disorders ranked first among common risks, both in Brazil and worldwide. In an effort to mitigate these and other risks, we instituted multidisciplinary committees to set guidelines; involve our Health and Safety, Human Resources and Management areas; and provide management indicators, tools, technology, and processes to reduce absences.\nIncident underground at Totten Mine in Sudbury, Canada\n\nIn 2021, 39 Vale workers were trapped in the Totten underground mine in Canada after a shaft blocking \u2013 a structure used to transport people and materials underground \u2013 incident. The 39 employees returned safely to the surface with the support of the Vale rescue team and the municipality via a secondary exit. After the incident, Vale began an investigation to ascertain the causes of the incident and take measures to ensure that it does not happen again.\n\nMore than 40 recommendations have been implemented, including improvements in resource management, operational controls, hazard identification, and risk assessment.\n\nVale has health and safety goals for 2025:\n\n- **Reduce by 50%** the number of exposures to health-damaging agents in the workplace by 2025.\n- **Reduce to 0** the number of recordable high-potential injuries by 2025.\n\nThe targets associated with our strategic objectives to reduce risks to health, safety, and operations are one of the criteria we use to set Vale\u2019s variable compensation levels. In case of a fatality, the indicators of health, safety, and risk management for that operation are reset to zero and there is no bonus in health, safety, and risk management targets.\n\nVale measures and analyzes health, safety, and operational risk indicators following routine management. We also perform periodic internal audits with independent auditors, based on risk criteria defined according to the nature of the activities and the maturity level of the Health and Safety management system. Non-conformities identified are registered in a system that results in developing and monitoring action plans, as well as reporting to Vale\u2019s senior management.\nCovid-19\n\nSince 2020, we have donated more than USD 153 million to governments and institutions in Brazil and abroad for Covid-19 related humanitarian aid actions. In 2021, we supported the Butantan Institute (Brazil) in the expensing works of the Multipurpose Vaccine Production Centre, which will have a production capacity of up to 100 million doses per year, and we donated 50 million syringes and 400,000 pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect professionals on the vaccination front line. The Vale Technology Institute, in partnership with the Fiocruz Network, is collaborating to produce of genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nReinforcing the solidarity actions, we joined other companies in the donating of intubation drugs, totaling 3.7 million analgesics, sedatives and neuromuscular blockers imported from China. These were all donated to the Brazilian Federal Government for subsequent distribution to the states through the Unified Health System (SUS in Portuguese).\n\nIn a concerted aim to ensure the health and safety of its employees, Vale has remained on high alert in Covid-19 prevention in all the countries where we operate. Since March 2020, we have transitioned a significant number of employees to the home office regime as part of efforts to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. We have also implemented other social distancing measures, including shifts in operational areas, restrictions on face-to-face meetings, testing protocols, among others.\n\nScreening for access to operational areas was implemented in the units globally, and an application to track proximity between people in case of need contact tracing was implemented in several of them. In Brazil, Indonesia, and Mozambique, the screening process included periodic testing of the workforce using thousands of serological or rapid antigen tests.\n\nEmployees identified as being at higher risk of developing the severe form of the disease were removed from operations and remained at home on full benefits awaiting vaccination before returning to work sites. As of January 2022, proof of complete Covid-19 vaccination is a mandatory requirement for own employees, contractors, and visitors to our Brazil locations.\n\nLearn more\nAbout Vale\u2019s crisis response plan.\n\nHumanitarian action to fight hunger\n\nThe pandemic has also aggravated hunger, endangering the food security and nutritional status of millions of people in Brazil and around the world. Given this scenario, Vale, the Vale Foundation and the Vale Voluntary Network joined forces with organizations that work to fight hunger in Brazil, such as Full Pot Movement (Movimento Panela Cheia), which was formed by Cufa, Gerando Falc\u00f5es and the National Anti-racist Front, the Rio Union Movement and Citizenship Action (Movimento Uni\u00e3o Rio e A\u00e7\u00e3o da Cidadania), among others. Together they delivered more than one million staple food baskets/food cards to more than 220,000 families in a situation of severe food insecurity in 2021.\nTALENT ATTRACTION AND RETENTION\nUnder the recruitment strategy concept, implemented in 2020 and guided by Vale\u2019s integrated management system (VPS), the company seeks to attract and retain talent that is aligned with its purpose, its cultural transformation, and its commitment to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Its practices involve everything from focusing on the candidate\u2019s experience to using artificial intelligence to assertively search profiles. The global expansion of this model began in 2021, starting in Canada.\n\nThe relationship with employees is guided by Vale\u2019s Code of Conduct, labour legislation, the eight Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and by the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), GRI 102-8\n\nEMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS WORKFORCE GRI 102-7, 102-8\n\n| Year | Employees | Contractors | Total |\n|------|-----------|------------|-------|\n| 2017 | 73,596    | 56,979     | 130,575 |\n| 2018 | 70,270    | 54,644     | 124,914 |\n| 2019 | 71,149    | 78,143     | 149,292 |\n| 2020 | 74,316    | 111,921    | 186,237 |\n| 2021 | 72,266    | 141,147    | 213,413 |\n\nBY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION \u2013 CONTRACTORS\n\n| Number of contractors | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-----------------------|------|------|\n| Brazil                | 114,757 | 90,877 |\n| South America (ex-Brazil) | 113 | 140 |\n| North America         | 4,311 | 4,617 |\n| Europe                | 133 | 109 |\n| Asia                  | 9,613 | 7,964 |\n| Oceania               | 6 | 198 |\n| Africa                | 12,214 | 8,016 |\n| Total                 | 141,147 | 111,921 |\n\nBY BUSINESS UNIT \u2013 CONTRACTORS\n\n| Number of Contractors | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n| Ferrous              | 46,327 | 34,042 |\n| Coal                 | 7,416 | 6,076 |\n| Base Metals          | 15,207 | 10,395 |\n| Energy               | - | - |\n| Corporate            | 27,690 | 26,877 |\n| Capital and decommissioning projects | 44,507 | 34,531 |\n| Total                | 141,147 | 111,921 |\n\nBY BUSINESS UNIT \u2013 EMPLOYEES\n\n| Number of Employees | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---------------------|------|------|\n| Ferrous             | 44,235 | 44,342 |\n| Coal                | 5,492 | 3,320 |\n| Base Metals         | 12,903 | 13,762 |\n| Fertilizers         | - | - |\n| Energy              | - | 3,954 |\n| Corporate           | 8,261 | 7,914 |\n| Capital and decommissioning projects | 1,375 | 1,024 |\n| Total               | 72,266 | 74,316 |\n\nTURNOVER RATE*\n\n| Year | General | Men | Women |\n|------|---------|-----|-------|\n| 2021 | 8.2%    | 7.0% | 14.5% |\n| 2020 | 10.7%   | 9.3% | 19.7% |\n\n*The turnover rate is calculated based on data from Vale and its subsidiaries.

GRI 401-1\nCOLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS\nGRI 102-41 | 407-1\n\nIn 2021, 100% of the employees in Brazil were covered by collective agreements with trade unions. Considering all the countries where Vale operates, the percentage was 92% for its own employees. In Brazil, 46 Collective Labour Agreements were signed, with 13 trade unions, most of which were for benefits, salary readjustment, working hours and profit sharing.\n\nIn the period, the company\u2019s proposed offer to production and maintenance employees in Sudbury, Canada, for a new five-year collective agreement was rejected, despite unanimous endorsement of that agreement by the union\u2019s bargaining committee. The event resulted in a shutdown of Sudbury operations, for approximately two months, and Vale continued negotiations until a new agreement was ratified in August 2021.\n\nFour cases of risk or incidents were identified in which the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining may have been violated. These cases occurred in operations in the VNL \u2013 Newfoundland and Labrador Vale region \u2013 and corrective measures were adopted according to the procedures provided for in the collective agreement.\n\nVale respects the freedom of association and collective bargaining, and in all the countries where we operate, we strive to maintain good relations with trade unions or, in countries where this right is not assured by local legislation, with equivalent worker organizations. The company seeks to resolve conflicts through dialogue and continuous meetings with representatives of these associations. Since 2005, employees have been electing a member of the Board of Directors and the respective alternate by direct vote. Elections are conducted jointly by the company and the unions.\n\nAs expressed in Vale\u2019s Code of Conduct and Global Human Rights Policy, all employees are free to join labour unions or equivalent workers\u2019 organizations.\n\nCOMPENSATION\nGRI 102-36 | 103-2, 103-3 | 201-3 | 202 | 405-2\n\nVale\u2019s compensation adheres to the legislation of each country where it operates, and variations may occur due to employees\u2019 seniority and maturity levels. With regard to base wages, there are no differences between men and women performing the same job. In addition, Vale does not deduct or restrict compensation that could lead the worker to be in debt with the company. GRI 405-2\n\nFor more information about the indicator, access the ESG databook.\n\nAlso, according to each country\u2019s legislation, the following benefits are assured but may vary: medical and dental assistance; life insurance; private pension plan; personal accident insurance; transportation allowance; educational training; food allowance; and employee assistance program.\n\nIn 2021, the turnover rate was 8.2%\nSUCCESION PLAN\nSuccession planning is a lever to generate opportunities, retain talent, and also to develop behaviours aligned to our culture. To this end, we have been counting on our Global Talent Review program since 2019, through which we discuss and continuously monitor the career, development and readiness of successors who will be needed \u2013 mainly for critical positions \u2013 in the short, medium and long term, in order to ensure to business continuity.\n\nIn 2021, we found options for successors for 99% of our critical positions for the short, medium, and long term. Developing successors and getting them ready to assume new roles in the responsibility of our leaders and a key element of the VPS management model. The assurance of an assertive succession line for jobs and positions has become part of executive compensation targets.\n\nThe People, Compensation and Governance Committee monitors the succession planning of the top leadership through quarterly meetings on the topic, always reporting to the Board of Directors.\n\nTRAINING GRI 103-2, 103-3 | 404\nVale\u2019s Corporate University (Valer) has structured a portfolio of training and development actions for technical, management and leadership skills aligned with the company\u2019s strategies such as safety, Vale\u2019s integrated management system (VPS), risk management and sustainability. More recently, Valer has been preparing employees and leaders to work in new ways that promote greater agility, collaboration and integration, and has also supported the digital inclusion strategy by developing a digital training program for operational employees. The Vale Institute of Technology has two courses recognized by Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES in Portuguese): a Professional Masters in Sustainable Use of Natural Resources in Tropical Regions and a Professional Masters in Instrumentation, Control and Automation of Mining Processes.\n\nIn 2021, in line with the commitment to employee safety, work began to review the technical-operational training model, through which diagnosed and trained were directed to employees in critical functions. About 4,000 of the 17,000 employees in these functions in Brazil were diagnosed as needing better training for technical competencies, aiming to strengthen accident prevention and operational excellence. The Entry Gates program (Portas de Entrada in Portuguese) was also implemented, focusing on the learning journey of interns, young apprentices, professional trainees, and global trainees.\n\nAVERAGE HOURS OF TRAINING GRI 404-1\n\n| Functional Category                  | Hours |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|\n| Leadership                           | 58    |\n| Specialist                           | 42    |\n| Technical-Operational + Staff        | 77    |\n\nEmployees of the Mutuca Mine, in Nova Lima/ Minas Gerais\n\nPHOTO: GUSTAVO BAXTER\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nOur diversity, equity and inclusion strategy aims to strengthen a culture that promotes and values an inclusive environment and addresses the challenges mapped out through affirmative policies. Since 2019, we have been addressing structured initiatives to create working conditions and opportunities that promote representation related to gender, race, and people with disabilities, among other fronts.\n\nIn 2021, our priority focus involved the preparing the Vale Diversity Census, to understand our challenges, and reviewing processes and systems, as well as initiatives to strengthen a culture oriented toward the promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nVALE DIVERSITY CENSUS\nIn 2021, Vale conducted its first diversity census, covering operations in Brazil and Canada. In Brazil, about 68.5% of the company\u2019s own employees participated voluntarily and confidentially, making self-declarations about how they see themselves and how they perceive the work environment at Vale.\n\nThe result of this survey will help us map gaps and implement actions that adhere more closely to our needs, to build a more fair and inclusive company. Below are the results of the Brazil\u2019s census, considering a total of 53,391 employees.\n\nIn 2021, Vale conducted its first diversity census, covering operations in Brazil and Canada. In Brazil, about 68.5% of the company\u2019s own employees participated voluntarily and confidentially, making self-declarations about how they see themselves and how they perceive the work environment at Vale.\n\nLGBTQIA+ Pride \u2013 Jailson S\u00e1 Santana, process technician.\n\nIn 2021, Vale conducted its first diversity census.\n**GENDER IDENTITY**\n\n- Male and female: 99.6%\n- Transgender, non-binary/fluid, prefer not to inform and others: 0.4%\n\n**AGE GROUP BY GENDER**\n\n- Men: 46.2%\n- Women: 53.8%\n\n**AGE GROUP TOTAL**\n\n- Up to 21 years old: 2.2%\n- 22 to 29 years old: 24.0%\n- 30 to 39 years old: 36.3%\n- 40 to 54 years old: 24.1%\n- 55 years or older: 3.6%\n\n**SEXUAL ORIENTATION**\n\n- Heterosexuals: 92.2%\n- Gay, lesbian, bisexual and others: 3.6%\n- Not informed: 4.2%\n\n**CURRENT EDUCATION**\n\n- Middle School: 19.8%\n- High School: 21.9%\n- Technical: 11.5%\n- University/Technologist: 19.8%\n- MBA / Post Graduation Lato Sensu: 11.5%\n- Master Stricto sensu: 0.9%\n- Doctorate: 0.2%\n- Post Doctorate: 0.2%\n\n**PROFESSIONALS WITH DISABILITIES BY FUNCTIONAL POSITION**\n\n- % PwD: 0.2%\n- % Not PwD: 99.8%\n\n**EDUCATION BY GENDER**\n\n- Women: 31.3%\n- Men: 39.8%\nGENDER EQUITY\nVale\u2019s goal was to double the representativeness of women in its workforce, from 13% to 26%, by 2030. In 2021, the company announced it had brought the commitment forward by five years, to 2025. During the year, it reached 18.7% representation of women globally, the equivalent of adding 4,400 women to its workforce. At the top leadership level, we reached 20.3% female representation, a 80% increase compared to 2019, when the goal was established.\n\nETHNIC AND RACIAL EQUITY\nFrom the census results, we identified that Vale Brazil is made up of 64% black and brown professionals and that we have a great opportunity to expand this representation in middle and senior leadership positions. To this end, Vale has made the following commitments:\n\n\u2022 Achieve 40% of leadership in Brazil (managers and above) made up of black and brown people by 2026;\n\u2022 Implement educational programs to intensify the professional training for black and brown people from the communities where Vale operates;\n\u2022 Strengthen anti-racist positioning.\n\nHere, we highlight our 2021 Global Trainee Program, which prioritized women and black people. Of the 144 trainees hired, 66% (95 professionals) were black and brown and 68% were women. In addition, in partnership with companies from various sectors, Vale has joined movements and indices that aim to implement and measure the effectiveness of actions to correct social inequalities within\n\nPROFESSIONALS WITH DISABILITIES\nIn 2021, Vale made concentrated efforts to ensure that 5% of our workforce is composed of professionals with disabilities (PwDs). We implemented the career acceleration program with these professionals in mind. The pilot edition included 25 professionals whose skills were strengthened. In 2022, the program\u2019s approximately 500 vacancies will be offered to this group of employees. It also remains a challenge to include PwDs in leadership positions.\n\nWOMEN BY FUNCTIONAL CATEGORY\n\n| Category                        | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | Increase in relation to 2019 |\n|---------------------------------|------|------|------|-----------------------------|\n| Total women                     | 9,050| 11,443| 13,488| 49.0%                       |\n| Staff                           | 8,457| 10,638| 12,433| 47.0%                       |\n| Supervision                     | 239  | 374  | 412  | 72.4%                       |\n| Management and coordination     | 329  | 397  | 598  | 81.8%                       |\n| Executive managers and directors| 25   | 34   | 45   | 80.0%                       |\n\nPROPORTION OF WOMEN BY FUNCTIONAL CATEGORY\n\n| Category          | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|\n| Operational Technicians | 8.7% | 11.2%| 13.4%|\n| Specialists       | 13.4%| 13.9%| 15.3%|\n| Supervisors       | 12.7%| 13.5%| 15.3%|\n| Managers          | 10.8%| 20.3%| 24.3%|\n| Directors         | 5.6% | 3.8% | 10.2%|\n\nLearn more\nAbout our commitment and initiatives in the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Report 2020/2021.\n\nLearn more\nFor more information on diversity in governance bodies and employees see indicator 405-1 in the ESG Databook.\n\nPHOTO: GUSTAVO BAXTER\nAmanda Francisca Tenorio de Almeida works at the PPE Center of the Paraopeba Complex, Minas Gerais\n\nPHOTO: GUSTAVO BAXTER\nAmanda Francisca Tenorio de Almeida works at the PPE Center of the Paraopeba Complex, Minas Gerais\nSocial and Relationship Capital\n\n1.

For this, we consider it our social ambition to be a partner that enables the development and autonomy of the communities with which we relate, based on the education-health-income tripod.\"\n\nEduardo Bartolomeo, CEO\n\nBy launching our social ambition, together we want to:\n\n- Develop solutions with suppliers, customers and partners, in order to generate a sustainable mining cycle.\n- Promote resilient communities by supporting sustainable development in the territories where we operate;\n- Ensure and disseminate the practice of business and human rights;\n- Contribute to greater social justice by implementing education, health, and income generation projects;\n- Appreciate cultures and respect and promote the rights of Indigenous peoples and Traditional Communities;\n- Ensure that our actions generate social and environmental value and promote effective, positive post-mining legacies.\n\n\"We want to articulate alliances and partnerships involving companies, governments and the voluntary sector around structuring actions and programs for the communities where we operate.\"\n\nMaria Luiza Paiva, Vale Executive Officer of Sustainability\n\n2030 Commitments\n\n- Perform Top 3\u00b9 in major external assessments of sustainable mining, in social requirements.\n- To lift 500,000 people out of extreme poverty.\n- Indigenous communities neighboring all Vale operations with UNDRIP\u00b2 rights plans.\n\n1 MSCI, Sustainalytics and DJSI. At least 3rd position in the sector in all of them.\n2 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\nDue to the inherent characteristics of its activities and the extractive sector where it operates, Vale recognizes that there are several challenges related to respect for human rights in its activities and throughout its value chain.\n\nThe topic is contained in the Integrated Risk Map, as well as in Vale\u2019s Risk Management system. To guide its actions, the company has a Global Human Rights Policy, aligned with international initiatives and standards such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Global Compact, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the principles and guidelines of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards, among others.\n\nIn 2021, Vale trained 74,000 people via the two-hour online course that is mandatory for all its own employees, totaling 111,000 hours of training. For contractors, a video training program was provided focusing on the main human rights issues. GRI 412-2.\n\nA specific front was also developed to train human rights multipliers in the operations, with more than 200 employees trained by 2021. In addition, more than 3,200 hours were dedicated to specific training on human rights and corporate security, according to the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, covering 80% of the total workforce. GRI 410-1.\n\n**HUMAN RIGHTS RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\n100% of Vale\u2019s operations* have assessed the risk of human rights violations and monitored them periodically along with other business risks. In addition, our operations have adopted prevention and mitigation control measures for these risks and conducted tests to ensure their effectiveness. GRI 412-1\n\nHuman rights risk assessment at Vale involves analyzing critical issues such as degraded working conditions and modern slavery, child labour and sexual exploitation of children and adolescents, violations in work relations, large-scale human rights violations.\n\nIn these assessments, we gauge the probability of a risk\u2019s occurrence and the severity of its impact. From there, we develop and implement action plans and monitor their progress to reduce the exposure of people and company to risks. On a quarterly basis, our risks are monitored by the Risk Committee and reported to all levels of the company, including the Board of Directors.\n\nFor critical issues, such as forced labour, child labour, sexual exploitation of children and adolescents, and human trafficking, risk management processes are determined at all life cycle stages of Vale\u2019s ventures. We also mitigate these risks through an ongoing engagement process with our communities, and partnerships with Childhood Brasil and InPacto that help us take preventive and mitigating action.\n\nIn 2021, there were no records or allegations of occurrences of child or slave labour involving Vale\u2019s operations, however we recognize the fragility of the theme in our value chain and we are acting to minimize these impacts. GRI 408-1 | 409-1\n\n*Considers as operations the risk management areas that contemplate the Company\u2019s business.\n\n---\n\n\"What I see, both from the impact of mining and other impacts from other ventures that arrive in the neighbourhood (Jardim Canad\u00e1, Nova Lima/MG \u2013 Brazil), is that they bring many people along with them, outsiders, who don\u2019t have this idea of belonging to the community. So they come with their families, stay here for a while, and many go away and leave their families. I also see the issue of vulnerable young people and children, because there are usually many lodging facilities housing males, and the girls hang around there, thinking about getting some affection because their father abandoned them, looking for some money to buy something, and I see the enticement of these adolescents is very strong.... this saddens the neighborhood. I know that progress exists and that it is coming, but I also know that with good things come bad things for the neighbourhood.\"\n\nJaquelline Pinto, representative of the Transformar Social Space and a resident of Jardim Canad\u00e1 for over 20 years.\nDue diligence in human rights\n\nIn 2021, Vale committed to conducting external due diligence in human rights for all its operations and critical projects in three-year cycles, using a methodology aligned with international human rights standards. During the year, 12 operations out of a total of 42, and two projects were contemplated. Moral and sexual harassment were relevant human rights violation risks identified in all due diligence performed. As a result, action plans are elaborated to address the risk situations that are considered critical and are monitored periodically (at least quarterly).\n\nWith regard to Vale\u2019s suppliers, human rights management involves several stages, from certification, registration, selection and contracting to contract management and supplier development and training. In the period, we assessed 100% of our supplier base with active contracts in Brazil for risk of human rights violations. We also conducted in-person due diligence processes, which identified risks related to overtime management. The suppliers that present a higher degree of risk are engaged in several ways, including the monitoring of action plans for the treatment of deviations, meetings on Human Rights and sharing of good practices.\n\nLearn more about Vale\u2019s Human Rights management.\n\nIndigenous Peoples and Traditional Communities\n\nVale\u2019s relationship with Indigenous Peoples and Traditional Communities is based on our respect for cultural diversity and for the rights of these populations. We recognize the different connection that they have with the territory, which involves not only physical and socio-economic aspects, but also cultural and spiritual aspects. Our relations are guided by Vale\u2019s Global Human Rights Policy, which is aligned with leading national and international references and legislation related to the topic. In addition to our commitment to build a constructive, mutually beneficial relationship, we make managing risks and their impacts on these populations a priority.\n\nCurrently, the company has relationships with 29 Indigenous Peoples, 13 in Brazil and 16 in other countries, in addition to 57 Traditional Communities in Brazil. The team responsible for conducting this relationship is made up of professionals dedicated to each people/community who have multidisciplinary backgrounds and consistent experience in Indigenous relations. They are dedicated to acting in these territories and to...\nforging permanent relationships with these populations. GRI G4 MMS\n\nIn addition, Vale qualifies the employees and suppliers who interface with these populations in areas impacted by its operations, to maintain consistency in our dealings in the various territories and to hold a qualified dialogue with these stakeholders.\n\nWithdrawal of all mining processes on Indigenous lands\n\nVale does not conduct any mineral research or mining activities on Indigenous lands in Brazil, and had already declined 104 mining processes, between 2019 and 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Vale gave up all mining processes on Indigenous lands in Brazil, as a result of the understanding that mining on Indigenous lands can only be carried out with the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) of the Indigenous people themselves and legislation that regulates this activity.\n\nRecognition of FPIC is critical to address the rights of Indigenous peoples to determine their own development and their right to exercise self-determination over decisions concerning their territories.\n\nIn a aim to favour a solid relationship of partnership and trust, we also implement programs and voluntary agreements, built collaboratively with these populations, considering their cultural and territorial specificities.\n\nSTRATEGIC INITIATIVES WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES\n\nOur company\u2019s planned voluntary action fronts involve:\n\n- Preservation of Cultural Memory;\n- Indigenous Protagonism;\n- Sustainable Programs.\n\nIn 2021, we will start developing projects focused on methodologies to preserve Indigenous cultural heritage with the Xikrin do Catet\u00e9, Aw\u00e1, Guajajara and Ka\u2019apor Peoples, through the Cultural Institute.\n\nAnother prominent initiative was establishing the Indigenous Program for Permanence and Opportunities at the University (PIPOU in Portuguese), which aims to contribute to the higher education of Indigenous People in partnership with non-governmental organizations, experts in Indigenous higher education and representatives of the Indigenous movement. In 2021, 50 Indigenous people were awarded scholarships and infrastructure support.\n\nWe also support the National Plan to Fight Covid-19 in Indigenous Territories, which have been deeply affected. Equipment was acquired for all 34 Indigenous health centres in Brazil (100% coverage). The initiative aims to make telemedicine services available to the Indigenous people and will bring them consultation within the villages, avoiding the need to travel to large centres.\n\n\"It is very complicated for us indigenous people to remain in university, this project is essential to help. I am very happy to be contemplated by the project.\"\n\nJuliana Porang (Juliana Coutinho Cabidelli), indigenous of the Tupiniquim Guarani Indigenous Land, Medicine student at the University of Brasilia\n\nIn 2021, we established the Indigenous Program for Permanence and Opportunities at the University\nIndigenous Peoples and the On\u00e7a Puma Nickel Mine in Brazil\n\nVale's relationship with the Xikrin do Catet\u00e9 peoples began in the 1980s. On the one hand, the relationship benefitted from infrastructure improvements made by Vale through voluntary agreements; on the other hand, associations representing these peoples and Brazilian public authorities allege that our operation has had a negative impact on the health of the communities near the On\u00e7a Puma Nickel Mines.\n\nSince 2017, Vale has sought to dialogue with the peoples involved, with the Federal Public Prosecution Office and with all the stakeholders involved, contributing to the implementation of several actions, including the judicial investigation that issued reports not confirming the impacts indicated. In 2020, Vale, Federal Public Prosecution and the Xikrin do Catet\u00e9 and Kayap\u00f3 indigenous peoples reached a preliminary agreement which culminated in the suspension of the lawsuit filed by the Federal Public Prosecution Office and/or the Xikrin Associations.\n\nIn December 2021, the Xikrin Associations and Vale entered into an out-of-court agreement to terminate the lawsuits, which was presented to the Federal Civil Court Judge of Reden\u00e7\u00e3o (Par\u00e1 state) for acknowledgement and ratification, which occurred on March 07, after recognition of validity declared in a positive opinion presented by the Federal Public Prosecution Office.\n\nIn March 2022, the Kayap\u00f3 and Vale Associations also entered into an out-of-court agreement to terminate the lawsuits in which they are parties, which was submitted to the Federal Civil Court Judge of Reden\u00e7\u00e3o for cognizance and ratification, with a favorable opinion from the Federal Public Prosecution Office and recognition of the validity of the adjustment.\n\nThe activities of Vale and the mining sector in general involve social impacts on several fronts, including risks related to the safety of communities surrounding the company's operations, conflicts arising from involuntary resettlement and land use, and conflicts with Indigenous Peoples and Traditional Communities, among others.\n\nSince 2020, we have adopted community relationship standards globally which compel us to identify, engage and monitor our relationship with these stakeholders.\nBy 2021, in Brazil, we had 411 priority communities in Brazil to engage, out of a total of 1,304 communities, distributed among 130 municipalities. In the period, 69% of the communities were covered by Relationship and Investment Plans.\n\n**GRIEVANCE MECHANISM**\n\nGRI 102-34, 103-2, 103-3\n\nVale\u2019s Grievance Mechanism is composed of several listening channels, which are the structures responsible for managing community manifestations. These channels (phone, letter, email, among others) provide different means through which stakeholders can contact and interact with the company. In addition, our Grievance Mechanism is governed by human rights guidelines and complies with the General Data Protection Law.\n\nIn 2021, 11,069 community manifestations were registered, of which we answered 98.9% and fulfilled 82.7%. The main issues were related to support for social projects (1,316); access, highways and roads (1,200); and involuntary resettlement (862). These figures do not include the manifestations captured by the Service Centre reported in the Reparation in Focus/Brumadinho chapter.\n\nIn 2021, in Brazil, we had 411 priority communities in Brazil to engage, out of a total of 1,304 communities, distributed among 130 municipalities. In the period, 69% of the communities were covered by Relationship and Investment Plans.\n\n**Relationship with the community of Piqui\u00e1 de Baixo**\n\nThe Piqui\u00e1 de Baixo community, located in the A\u00e7ail\u00e2ndia Chemical Industrial Park in the state of Maranh\u00e3o, claims that it is impacted by pollution caused by steel mills installed at the site over 30 years ago. Vale does not own any pig iron mills in A\u00e7ail\u00e2ndia, but it acts as the main supplier of Iron Ore used to produce steel.\n\nIn line with its social performance guidelines, the company has supported initiatives such as preparing a socio-economic diagnosis of the families located in the region in question, and formalizing a partnership between the Vale Foundation and the Piqui\u00e1 Community Association with the Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal Bank, to help construct 312 houses to create a new neighbourhood for the community.\n\n**ABOUT VALE\u2019S NEW INVESTMENTS IN PIQUI\u00c1**\n\nSensitive to the cause, to the history of claims and with the goal to build a positive legacy, Vale is increasing its contribution to the sustainable development of the Piqui\u00e1 community. The new investments \u2013 which are divided into four areas described below \u2013 are the result of the company\u2019s constant dialogue with the community and are part of the steering committee\u2019s plan created by the City Hall of A\u00e7ail\u00e2ndia that aims to ensure more infrastructure and quality of life for the Piqui\u00e1 community.\n\nIn the housing area, Vale is making a financial contribution totaling more than USD 8 million, to facilitate and guarantee the conclusion of works on the new Piqui\u00e1 da Conquista neighbourhood. Construction will include 312 housing units, including basic sanitation, proper public lighting and infrastructure items. About 43% of the construction on the houses has been complete.\n\nIn the environmental area, a set of actions is underway to mitigate the emission of particulates during the road transportation of Iron Ore by paving the A\u00e7ail\u00e2ndia yard and access roads. This includes articulation with plants installed in the region to comply with legal and market environmental standards.\n\nAt the social and institutional level, Vale is investing in preparing a participative plan for socio-economic development in Piqui\u00e1, which will be used as a blueprint for collaborating with public authorities to improve local infrastructure, such as proper rainwater drainage in the region. Vale is also conducting social projects aimed at income generation, education and health in the region.\nCOMMUNITY SAFETY\n\nVale is reviewing the ways in which its activities impact society. One of the vectors of this review includes community safety, which involves mitigating the risk to people\u2019s physical integrity that Vale\u2019s presence in the territories may present.\n\nThe challenge of enhancing our safety approach is extending risk and impact management to our communities. In this context, we are implementing a structured process to improve community safety, which will include executing preventive actions, responding to occurrences, performing crisis management, and investigating events as well as implementing actions to mitigate the risk of their recurrence. The direct participation of the communities in the process is evolving to become larger and larger.\n\nVale assumed the practice of recording events regardless of guilt or responsibility, transforming the analysis of these occurrences into learning that informs our actions to continuously improve operational safety to protect our communities. This practice demonstrates the way Vale is evolving to understand its role as an agent for transformative change in the territory.\n\nIn 2021, 49 people died and 126 people were injured due to events associated with Vale\u2019s presence in the territory, representing an increase of 48% and 103%, respectively, over the previous year.\n\nFor 2022, reducing safety events that result in injury to community members represents 5% of the total variable compensation of all company leadership.\n\nThe reduction of safety events with the community will represent 5% of the variable compensation of all leadership.\n\nCoal transport derailment in Moatize\n\nDespite our efforts to ensure the communities\u2019 safety wherever we operate, in October 2021, a train transporting coal from Vale\u2019s mines in Moatize to the port of Nacala, derailed in northern Mozambique. The coal cars overturned onto the ground and into the Namutimbua River, causing the fatalities of two children, in addition to seriously injuring two victims and lightly injuries to eight, totaling twelve victims.\n\nAs immediate measures, we provided medical assistance to the victims at the Cuamba District Hospital and transferred victims in serious condition to another, more structured hospital. We also assigned social monitors to the accident site.\n\nTo support the families, we provided emergency social aid to those who lost loved ones and those whose family members were in serious condition and provided psychological support to the victims and relatives of those who lost their lives.\n\nIn this occurrence, among the lessons learned was the importance of making decisions quickly to mobilize all the necessary resources for the victims and their families to receive the best care available, according to the severity of the cases. The event also influenced the definition of criteria for immediate support (to victims and their families) in emergency situations. Besides promoting improvements in the operational procedures of permanent way maintenance and preventive monitoring controls.\nIN VOLUNTARY RESETTLEMENT\nGRI 103-2, 103-3 | G4 MM9\n\nVale is committed to ensuring that the involuntary resettlement process provides the restitution of livelihoods in conditions equivalent to or better than those prior, which requires, among other measures, the replacement of impacted land, housing and economic activities. The process adopted by Vale follows the guidelines from international organizations such as the International Finance Corporation \u2013 IFC, the World Bank, the United Nations \u2013 UN, and the International Council on Mining and Metals \u2013 ICMM.\n\nIn 2021, 805 families were involved in Involuntary Resettlements in Brazil. Of this total, 572 families are being assisted due to dams decharacterization works in Minas Gerais.\n\nOn the Vit\u00f3ria\u2013Minas Railroad, a dialogue was conducted to agree on measures to assist families living in the railroad\u2019s easement strip, in the municipalities of Antonio Dias, and Nova Era, in Minas Gerais. Even though this represents an eviction from a company-owned area, support is being provided to the 34 vulnerable families to obtain new housing and restore their livelihoods in a new location. On the same railroad, Vale has carried out studies to promote the involuntary resettlement of 161 families to duplicate and modernize the railroad stretch in Belo Horizonte.\n\nAlso in Minas Gerais, in the municipality of Itabira, 13 families were mapped for feasibility analysis for involuntary resettlement due to drainage works in the Pontal System.\n\nIn the north of Brazil, Vale carried out a social and economic diagnosis to examine the reality of 25 families who will be served by the project to duplicate the road-rail bridge over the Tocantins River in the municipality of Marab\u00e1 in the state of Par\u00e1.\n\nIn Bela Vista, where Mr. Jo\u00e3o lives, our commitment is to avoid or minimize involuntary resettlements necessary for the execution of the project. Mr. Jo\u00e3o is one of the residents who was registered and is waiting for a definition from the company. At this moment we are discussing together with the Public Defender\u2019s Office \u2013 that is accompanying the process \u2013 the Specific Term of Commitment, that sets the indemnity parameters. Once this stage is completed \u2013 scheduled for May 2022, we will return to negotiations with the 13 families living in the Bela Vista neighborhood. Vale maintains a service station in the neighborhood, available to attend to the communities and clarify doubts about the process.\n\nIn Mozambique, Vale has promoted public consultations to resettle 96 farmers due to the construction of a new pipeline to supply the Moatize Coal Mine. In the same period, we held public consultations to resettle another 805 families were involved in involuntary resettlement processes in Brazil in 2021.\n\nResettlement in Itabira\n\nIn 2021, Vale progressed in the planning for decharacterizing the structures built by the upstream method of the Pontal Dam, in the Itabira Complex in Minas Gerais. Among the projects is the decharacterization of the Minervino and Cord\u00e3o Nova Vista dikes. Vale is seeking solutions to minimize the involuntary resettlement of families due to project implementation.\n\n*In 2021 a socioeconomic survey was carried out for Mr. Jo\u00e3o\u2019s family and 12 other families living in the Bela Vista neighborhood in Itabira that will be involved in an involuntary resettlement process in 2022. The goal is to prevent families from being impacted by the works of drainage system improvement in Vale\u2019s area.\n\n\u201cWe moved here in 1998, and little by little I adapted our house to the family\u2019s style, but I can\u2019t continue with that because we are in this situation of indefiniteness \u2013 whether we will be resettled or not. So I can\u2019t make any more improvements to the house, in an area that we felt comfortable, and we don\u2019t have that anymore. My shop is my world. I ask the company to expedite this situation as much as possible.\u201d\n\nMr. Jo\u00e3o Batista Carlos*, resident of the Bela Vista community in the municipality of Itabira.\n171 families from the Mphandwe and Ntchenga communities located in the future expansion area of the venture. After the host area was chosen by the communities, Vale promoted a participative process to create the resettlement project, which will include infrastructure that will also serve the host community. Vale built the 70m\u00b2 model house, which was approved by the government and communities.\n\nVale built the Cateme Village to resettle 712 families from rural communities that were once located where the Moatize Coal Mine currently stands. At the site, Vale maintains a social project to enable agricultural and economic development for the resettled families. At Fazenda Modelo, farmers who own small plots of land are trained in sustainable food production techniques which generate revenue that provides income for the families, thus contributing to restore their livelihoods.\n\n**LAND USE DISPUTES**\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3 | MM6 | MM7\n\nVale currently owns more than 9,000 properties in Brazil, corresponding to about 360,000 hectares. Of this total, 63% are operational areas and 37% are non-operational. Part of these areas are located in regions where land use disputes are part of the territorial context and require the company to manage the relationship with communities that occupy these properties irregularly.\n\nThe main issues related to land use conflicts in Brazil are found in the northern region of the country and involve the actions of organized social movements. In the municipality of Cana\u00e3 dos Caraj\u00e1s and Curion\u00f3polis, in Par\u00e1, around 400 families occupy company's properties in the region of the Cristalino Project. Vale is seeking, through dialogue, to build a solution, together with justice institutions, representatives and families linked to social movements, to vacate this area.\n\nVale does not conduct mineral research or mining activities of any nature on indigenous lands in Brazil, however, there is a controversy involving the Xikrin do Catet\u00e9 people in relation to projects in the Caraj\u00e1s region. The issue was under discussion in recent years, and during 2021 a joint effort was made by all those involved in the legal proceedings, which culminated in an agreement that made it possible to extinguish most of the Public Civil Lawsuits.\n\nThe agreement reflects the result of a process of dialogue, engagement, and negotiation between the parties, aiming at resuming the relationship of partnership and good neighbourliness between the company and the Indigenous People as well as a conciliatory solution without recognizing\nPrivate Social Investment\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3 | 203-1\n\nVale makes socio-economic investments in the territories where it operates and in initiatives that contribute to developing society, through investment vehicles or structured initiatives. In 2021, USD 95.88 million were spent on voluntary social actions with own resources, in addition to the actions to support facing Covid-19 and complementary actions in Brumadinho. See the highlights in the ESG Databook. GRI 203-1\n\nVale Foundation\n\nThe Vale Foundation seeks to strengthen public policies and contribute to the social development in the territories where Vale operates. In 2021, its initiatives impacted more than 860,000 people across 50 municipalities in six Brazilian states. We highlight the following projects:\n\nLITERACY TRACKS (TRILHOS DA ALFABETIZA\u00c7\u00c3O)\n\nThis project promotes literacy in about 70,000 children in the public school network. During the year, 2,900 educators, managers, and technicians from 1,070 schools participated in the project\u2019s training. Developed in partnership with the Government of Maranh\u00e3o, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas and the City Halls of the 24 municipalities along the Caraj\u00e1s Railroad (EFC), the initiative is aimed at first, second and third grade public school students. The project has initiatives such as: strengthening of the municipal management; training of teachers, managers, and technicians; assessment and monitoring of learning; and production and distribution of educational materials.\n\nNETWORKED TERRITORIES (TERRIT\u00d3RIOS EM REDE)\n\nLaunched in 2020, this project aims to identify the main challenges in guaranteeing the right to education and to propose actions that seek to combat school exclusion, together with the municipalities. Year to date, the project has identified 3,340 excluded children in Serra (Esp\u00edrito Santo) and Marab\u00e1 (Par\u00e1), of which 2,480 were returned to the educational system. In partnership with Apprentice School City (Cidade Escola Aprendiz) and the City Halls of Serra and Marab\u00e1, children and teenagers between 4 and 17 years old are identified as being out of school or at risk of dropping out. After being identified, the children are monitored by the project to ensure their school enrollment or attendance regularized. This is possible thanks to the assistance provided by the Networked Territories teams in collaboration with the schools and the municipal government, through home visits or phone contact. In addition to the Vale Foundation, the project has investments from Wheaton Precious Metals, in Par\u00e1, and from GHT, in Esp\u00edrito Santo.\n\nTerPaz\n\nIn 2021, we inaugurated the first community complex of the Paz Plant in the Icu\u00ed-Guajar\u00e1 neighbourhood in Ananindeua (Par\u00e1). This is one of six units Vale is building in Par\u00e1, as part of the Territories for Peace Program (TerPaz), conceived and managed by the state government.\n\nThe Plants are inclusive community spaces with sustainable architecture, built in regions with high rates of violence and social vulnerability and designed to serve local communities. They offer a wide range of sports and leisure activities, such as legal advice and document issuing, vocational training, family health, a library, a swimming pool, digital inclusion rooms, among others.\nHEALTH CYCLE (CICLO SA\u00daDE)\nHealth Cycle (Ciclo Sa\u00fade) is a technical cooperation program to strengthen primary care in the municipalities and aims to promote health through an integrated process. In 2021, we implemented the program in 18 municipalities, supporting 175 basic health units (UBS in Portuguese) and training 2,200 professionals. The project can potentially benefit up to 695,000 users of the Brazilian Unified Health System. The project includes training workshops, management support and furniture and equipment donation to improve conditions for the population. It is a Vale Foundation initiative in partnership with the Center for Health Promotion (CEDAPS), the Post-Graduate Family Health Program at Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 University, and the municipal governments where it is implemented.\n\nAMAZ \u2013 THE AMAZON IMPACT ACCELERATOR\nAmong the highlights of the Vale Fund in 2021 is the launch of AMAZ \u2013 impact accelerator of Amazon. This program supports startups in various areas such as financial and administrative management and articulates cooperative opportunities in logistics and market access. By 2030, we will select 30 businesses through annual calls for proposals. The selected candidates will receive total contributions of USD 2.3 million. Together, the startups should help preserve one million hectares of forest and benefit 930 families.\n\nCOVID-19 RESPONSE PLAN AND EMERGENCY CREDIT LINE\nThe Vale Fund provided about USD 1 million to family farming and extractive associations and cooperatives through the Covid-19 Response Plan, between 2020 and 2021. Our partnership with Conexus and the CX Fund has already impacted 18,800 producers, invested in 85 community businesses (43% in the Amazon) and provided loans in the amount of USD 1.7 million through the Emergency Credit Line, catalyzing resources with other cofinanciers.\n\nThe Vale Fund\nThe Vale Fund works to strengthen a more sustainable, fair and inclusive economy. Since 2010, it has supported the construction of a new economic reality by investing in business development, knowledge generation, the strengthening of the impact ecosystem, and financial arrangements aiming to conserve and recover the environment, especially in the Amazon.\nAMAZON AT HOME, FOREST STANDING (AMAZ\u00d4NIA EM CASA, FLORESTA EM P\u00c9)\nDeveloped by Climate Ventures, the Amazon Logistics and Commercialization Lab sought to unlock market barriers to leverage Amazonian socio-biodiversity products. As an innovation and co-creation space focused on prototyping and testing, the Lab tested solutions to boost region\u2019s bioeconomy. As a result, the movement Amazon At Home, Forest Standing (Amazonia em Casa, Floresta em P\u00ea) was created, which relied on a partnership with Mercado Livre, increasing online sales of sustainable businesses in the biome.\n\nSTRENGTHENING THE IMPACT ECOSYSTEM\nThe Vale Fund supported several initiatives and networks in 2021 to strengthen skills, produce knowledge and support the environment by boosting social and environmental impact businesses. Partners such as the Corporate Citizenship Institute (ICE in Portuguese), Phi Institute, Latin American Venture Philanthropy Network (Latimpacto), Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE), Pipe Social, and Move.Social have been part of this trajectory.\n\nVale Cultural Institute\nIn 2021, the Vale Cultural Institute supported and sponsored more than 200 projects in 160 Brazilian municipalities. The four cultural spaces of the Institute \u2013 Can\u00e3a dos Caraj\u00e1s House of Culture (Casa da Cultura de Can\u00e3a dos Caraj\u00e1s), Vale Maranh\u00e3o Cultural Centre (Centro Cultural Vale Maranh\u00e3o), Minas Gerais Vale Memorial (Memorial Minas Gerais Vale) and Vale Museu \u2013 initiated more than 1,900 projects, reaching more than 1.6 million people, and the Vale M\u00fasica music training program held more than 622 classes.\n\nPublic calls for proposals were sent out, offering funds from the Federal Law for Cultural Incentives in an effort to foster cultural activities and drive the creative economy throughout Brazil. For example, the Vale 2021 Cultural Institute Call for Proposals allocated USD 4.6 million for projects to be carried out in 2022.\n\nThe Vale Volunteer Network\nIn 2021, the Vale Volunteer Network united more than 5,000 volunteers, who took part in 150 actions. Among them are the Brazil Without Hunger and Christmas Without Hunger campaigns, which were part of Vale\u2019s humanitarian actions to fight hunger. Partners of the Brazil Without Hunger campaign included Microsoft, Deloitte, GHT, Komatsu, Epiroc, Arcadis and Acende Brasil. Partners of the Christmas Without Hunger campaign include Mascarenhas Barbosa, \u00c1pia, Weir Esco, Barbosa Mello and Continental. Faced with the worsening pandemic and the fall in blood bank stocks, Rede and Pasa, a Vale Group company that operates in the health sector, signed partnerships with clinics and blood banks in several states and expanded spaces in their own clinics to receive blood donations.\n\nThey also worked for the organ donation cause, by creating a card for volunteer donors, in partnership with Adote. Joining forces with the Vale Foundation, Ita\u00fa Social, Gimba, and BRSupply, they also promoted a school reception campaign, which guaranteed the delivery of school kits to children and young people enrolled in the Knowledge Stations in Arari (MA), Brumadinho (MG), Marab\u00e1 (PA), Serra (ES), and Tucum\u00e3 (PA). In addition to these, there are actions to promote reading, menstrual dignity campaigns, inclusive runnings and animal protection actions, among dozens of others.\n\nAMAZON AT HOME, FOREST STANDING (AMAZ\u00d4NIA EM CASA, FLORESTA EM P\u00c9)\nDeveloped by Climate Ventures, the Amazon Logistics and Commercialization Lab sought to unlock market barriers to leverage Amazonian socio-biodiversity products.

In addition to these, there are actions to promote reading, menstrual dignity campaigns, inclusive runnings and animal protection actions, among dozens of others.\nSuppliers and customers\n\nIn 2021, around 18,000 suppliers made up Vale's supply chain, including consumer goods companies, service providers and consulting firms, among others.\n\nThe company prioritizes the hiring and development of local suppliers. Local purchases represented, in 2021, a financial volume of more than 53% of the total purchases in the period, which was USD 18.4 billion. GRI 102-9 | 103-2, 103-3 | 201 | 203 | 204-1\n\nValue chain partnerships\n\nPOSCO, a South Korean steel producer headquartered in Pohang, South Korea, and a Vale customer, launched a matching fund with its global raw material suppliers. By joining forces with the mining and steel industries, they aim to an effective social contribution to the local communities where these partner companies operate.\n\nVale was one of the partners chosen to receive a social contribution. In its first year (2021), the program began in Brazil with investments in education for vulnerable young people at the Knowledge Station in Marab\u00e1, Par\u00e1. The program has implemented a Pre-College entrance exam preparatory course. In its second year, the program will be carried out with an institution to be selected by POSCO in South Korea.\n\nSocial development actions in the communities\n\nVale has sponsored the Share (Partilhar) Program since 2020, to promote the socio-economic development in the locations where it operates by joining forces with its supply chain.\n\nThe initiative encompasses a Community Value Index (IVC in Portuguese), which makes it possible to recognize and appreciate the suppliers that contribute most to each region's social progress through five levers: employment generation, investments in wage mass, local spending on products and services, taxes, and social investments.\n\nIn 2020, we incorporated the program's methodology and technical and commercial aspects into Vale's supplier contracting process, to value our suppliers and encourage them to help strengthen the communities where the company operates.\n\nThrough the program, Vale's suppliers have already committed to carrying out 55 voluntary social investment actions in Minas Gerais and Par\u00e1. In addition, they closed 96 contracts using the program's innovative methodology, in which Vale generates a score for suppliers according to their socioeconomic contributions in the regions, making them more competitive during our procurement processes. In 2021, among our suppliers' voluntary social investments in the territories where Vale operates, we highlight the training of welder, seamstresses, truck drivers and Munk operators, among others.\n\nA total of 434 suppliers participated in the competitive processes prepared with the Share (Partilhar) methodology, which is 77% of the companies invited. The volume of contracts awarded in the program exceeded USD 740 million.\n\nIn 2021, around 18,000 suppliers made up Vale's supply chain, including consumer goods companies, service providers and consulting firms, among others.\n\nLearn more\n\nAbout the social development actions in the communities.\nSupplier evaluation and monitoring\n\nSupplier management is guided by adherence to compliance standards required by Vale, which include aspects of health and safety, social and environmental issues, ethics and integrity, and human rights.\n\nThe company\u2019s history in the market is also checked during the registration phase, including an analysis of the companies\u2019 compliance with the requirements of Vale\u2019s Ethics & Compliance Program. The public lists of forced or compulsory labor sanctions and of the Brazilian Federal Government (CEIS, CEPIM, and CNEP), among others, are also analyzed. If any irregularity is identified, the supplier is not registered and may be considered unfit to supply Vale.\n\nFor active suppliers, Vale also carries out periodic monitoring of aspects such as social, environmental, human rights, performance and government relations. Local labor obligations are monitored, as well as the black list of employers using forced or compulsory labor, and the list of public sanctions by the government on a monthly basis.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, public sanctions are monitored (in accordance with the Sanctions Compliance Policy), and every six months the Supplier Performance Index (IDF) is calculated. This is an evaluation of supplier performance on five criteria \u2013 technical quality, environmental protection, health and safety, respect for employees, and continuous improvement.\n\nProgram to manage carbon emissions in the value chain\n\nReducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the Paris Agreement is part of Vale\u2019s commitment to Agenda 2030. Since 2011, the company has monitored and encouraged suppliers to manage their emissions through a contractual clause and an annual questionnaire.\n\nIn 2020, Vale entered into a partnership with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), an international non-profit organization that helps companies and cities to disclose their environmental impact. The partnership engages suppliers classified as critical in greenhouse gas emissions in a specific program, the CDP Supply Chain, to encourage public carbon disclosure along the supply chain.\n\nIn 2021, we invited 496 suppliers, accounting for about 30% of the company\u2019s overall spending. Not included in this group were steel customers and shipping suppliers. Of this total, 375 answered the questionnaire on the CDP platform, which represents a 37% increase over last year.\n\nNinety-one percent of the suppliers who responded in 2020 also submitted their responses in this cycle, allowing us to assess their evolution and coordinate actions focused on the low-carbon economy. The platform analyzes management data, governance and indicators to define risks and opportunities aimed at reducing emissions. The material is evaluated by CDP and passed on to the suppliers.\n\nSee more at Climate Change.\nStakeholder engagement GRI 102-43\n\nAware of its potential impacts on society, Vale seeks to practice dialogue and active listening with its stakeholders to build a positive legacy for future generations.

This includes how resources are deployed and relationships are cultivated. As such, it is hoped that integrated reporting can be a tool to help providers of financial capital allocate their investments in a more efficient way\u2014and therefore act as a force for sustainability.\n\nVale\u2019s journey into integrated reporting, now in its second year, shows increased maturity in the presentation of the factors that materially affect the ability of the company to create value over time. As the company progresses, further evidence is expected around how the integrated report reflects the company\u2019s development and decision-making framework. This should be an area of attention at the next reporting cycle.\n\nBefore we comment in greater detail on key aspects of the report, we acknowledge the company\u2019s commitment to the reparation of the damage caused by the Brumadinho and Samarco accidents. As those events have been one of the main driving forces in the transformation process being implemented at the company, it is right that its progress and challenges around social and environmental matters are disclosed at the beginning of the report.\n\nWe would like to comment on some key principles of the integrated reporting framework, how Vale applied them, and to offer suggestions for improvement at the next reporting cycle.\n\nSTRATEGIC FOCUS AND STRATEGY DELIVERY\n\nThe narrative about Vale\u2019s business model, purpose and strategic pillars is presented in a clear way. The main achievements in the past year, and challenges for the year ahead, are detailed for each of the five strategic pillars of Safety and Operational Excellence, New Pact with Society, Transformation of Base Metals, Discipline in Capital Allocation, and Maximisation of Flight-to-Quality in Iron Ore. The company explicitly outlines a long-term ambition for each strategic pillar.\n\nIn the table, it would be useful to include a summary of the key short-, medium- and long-term targets, and the achievements in the previous year, plus a summary of the management\u2019s assessment of its progress and challenges. This should come at the beginning of the report as a key tool for stakeholders to hold management to account, therefore providing consistency and comparability over time and with peers.\n\nMATERIALITY\n\nThe report explains the process used to identify the material issues that affect value creation at Vale. According to best practice, it included, among other steps, a survey of internal and external stakeholders ranging from employees to investors, suppliers, clients and non-governmental organisations. In our opinion, there are no glaring omissions and we were encouraged to see priority areas for investment stewardship, such as biodiversity, human rights, occupational safety, tailings storage facilities management, and climate change mapped by the company as material to its long-term success.\n\nThe implication of the material issues to Vale\u2019s capacity to create value and the company\u2019s strategic response to each one can be found throughout the report.\nTOWARDS CLARITY AND CONNECTIVITY\n\nThe report presents a great level of detail, resulting in an extensive document. Yet at times it is difficult to navigate. This is often the case when a company chooses to begin the implementation of the integrated reporting framework by combining existing annual and sustainability reports.\n\nWe would expect an increased emphasis on the streamlining of the information in the next reporting cycles, evidencing the thinking behind the integrated reporting and how the capitals employed by the company (financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social and natural) interconnect in the process of value creation.\n\nThe report brings some examples of interconnected capitals. For instance, the natural, financial and manufactured capitals employed in the context of the development of low-carbon products, such as the \u2018green briquettes\u2019.\n\nWe encourage Vale to go further in this thematic, and to demonstrate how it impacts value creation.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nThe report describes the board\u2019s structure and its recent evolution following the company\u2019s now-dispersed shareholder base. This is a key input to the governance. However, it is important to report the outcomes of the governance structure, for example: how the board members and the committees support the strategy; which primary activities took place in the reporting cycle; and how these activities impacted the company\u2019s capitals and the strategy delivery.\n\nSTAKEHOLDER RELATIONS\n\nThe full reparation of the damage caused by the Brumadinho and Samarco accidents is an essential element in the strategy of de-risking the company and rebuilding trust with stakeholders. Understandably, the reparation process is still a source of controversy between Vale and the affected communities. The detailed disclosure provided helps the reader assess the company\u2019s progress and challenges. It is critical that the company continues to show evidence that it understands, considers and responds to the needs and interests of this key group of stakeholders.\n\nBeyond reparations, we highlight the \u201cNew Pact with Society\u201d strategic pillar, which includes targets related to climate change, water management, biodiversity, diversity across the workforce and the reduction of poverty. We were pleased to see that a challenge Vale sets out to address in this strategic pillar is the implementation of the social value lens in its projects and operations. This is evidence of integrated thinking and the interconnection between social, financial, human and manufactured capitals.\n\nIn summary, Vale has demonstrated progress in the implementation of the integrated reporting framework and the integrated thinking upon which it is founded. We encourage Vale to continue in its integrated reporting journey, gradually evolving from a combination of the standard annual and sustainability reports, towards a tool to succinctly communicate the key factors which materially affect its ability to create value over time and how they are interconnected.\n\nAreas of focus for future reports should be (i) conciseness, by striking a balance between keeping the report no longer than it needs to be and ensuring the completeness of the information; (ii) connectivity between the different forms of capital employed by the company in the process of creation, preservation and erosion of value; and (iii) further evidence of the integrated thinking applied to decision-making.\n\nJaime Gornsztejn\nEngineer, specialist in Governance, Director of Corporate Governance at Federated Hermes\n\nIt is crucial for long-term investors to understand how companies create value over time.\nThe Integrated Report is an innovative instrument for managing information about Vale\u2019s performance, which stimulates objective analysis by its managers, employees and partners, and also allows external observers and the public to view it in a comprehensive and synthetic way, even considering the magnitude of the company.\n\nHowever, there is no way for an independent observer to gauge the accuracy of the information in the Integrated Report, which underscores the importance of independent auditor analysis. It is not the case of incurring in the redundancy of commenting on it here in this space, but it is good to register the importance of each Report highlighting the steps taken by Vale, in the course of the year, in relation to the observations of the auditors contained in its previous edition.\n\nI shall start with the issue of the disasters that occurred in Brumadinho and Mariana, which is the most uncomfortable in the 2021 Report, to note that there is a great distance between the expectations of public opinion and the actual pace of social and environmental reparations. The inherent slowness of judicial processes and the technical challenges of reparations do not satisfy people, in general, who expect a gentler end to these tragedies. The anxiety of the public opinion and of those directly involved recommends that Vale do everything possible to build agreements that speed up the results, the overcoming of the trauma and the recovery of its image.\n\nIn this same sense, the weighting of climate change scenarios in the dam risk assessment routines, highlighted in the Report, always leaves doubts, since the climate threat is growing. What would be the margins of error considered in these evaluations, considering, for example, the intensity of this summer\u2019s rainfall in southern Bahia, in Minas Gerais, in the mountains of the state of Rio de Janeiro, and in Greater S\u00e3o Paulo? Since these are extremely sensitive hypotheses, all true information can be cautionary and deserves space.\n\nThe inclusion in the 2021 Report of a component relating to \u201cmine closure\u201d is very important, since it refers, after all, to how the company \u201cgives back\u201d to society the areas that have been exploited, whatever the permanence of the enterprises there may have been. There is an ethical and historical issue involved, which is crucial for legal, formal, and efficient mining to objectively demonstrate its difference in relation to the predatory activities that are advancing in Brazil.\n\nVale\u2019s decision, in 2021, to give up the requests for mineral research on indigenous lands that it was keeping with ANM \u2013 Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Minera\u00e7\u00e3o (National Mining Agency) \u2013 deserved applause. This attitude gives coherence to the company\u2019s statement that mineral exploration on these lands is not included in its business plans for the next decades in Brazil.\n\nIt is also worth noting, in this same vein, Vale\u2019s critical statement regarding the Executive Branch\u2019s Bill 191/2020, which deals with mineral exploration and mining on indigenous lands. The company\u2019s objection was based on the need for indigenous protagonism in the process of prior and informed consent (FPIC), in accordance with the internationally established standard through Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization, which is far from recognized in the government\u2019s proposal. This manifestation occurred in 2022 and should be reported in the next edition of this Report, but it is an unfolding of discussions on the subject that have been ongoing since 2021, within IBRAM (Brazilian Mining Institute) and other civil society organizations.\nHowever, Vale\u2019s decision to file, with ANM, new requests for research on the surroundings of indigenous lands requires action and clarification. Although legally feasible, these applications, assuming that they result in mining activities, raise doubts about probable irreversible impacts on contiguous areas. The occurrence of such damages in previous similar projects, as in the case of the Xikrin do Catet\u00e9 Indigenous Land (Itacai\u00fanas River), raises the expectation that they will not be repeated in eventual future mining projects in areas neighboring indigenous lands.\n\nVale\u2019s creation, in 2021, of the Executive Vice-presidency of Sustainability is encouraging, as it represents a step forward in the corporate commitments to the social and environmental agenda, a measure that signals its acceptance at the highest hierarchical level of the company. Thus, it is expected that, as early as 2022, this initiative will result in consistent and visible advances in the interlocution with the various actors with whom Vale has relationships, and in the specific territories where it operates.\n\nConsidering that Vale obtained a record profit in 2021, mainly due to the increase in the price of iron ore in the international market, a scenario that should intensify this year due to the climate of war instigated by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, I suggest that the company consider the possibility of expanding, in the same proportion, its investments in sustainable socio-environmental projects.\n\nFinally, the current war situation could not have been foreseen in 2021 and, therefore, is not considered in the respective Integrated Report. However, Vale urgently needs to evaluate the impacts of the crisis on the perspectives that were then being taken into account. Above all, regarding the ethical implications and the commercial retaliations that will influence the markets and public opinion, as the conflict itself develops.\n\nM\u00e1rcio Santilli\nPhilosopher, founding partner of the Socio-environmental Institute (Instituto Socioambiental \u2013 ISA)\n\nVale\u2019s creation of the Executive Vicepresidency of Sustainability is encouraging, as it represents a step forward in the corporate commitments to the social and environmental agenda.\nIndependent auditor's limited assurance report on the non-financial information included in the 2021 Integrated Report of Vale S.A.\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nVale S.A.\nRio de Janeiro \u2013 RJ\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWe have been engaged by Vale S.A. (\"Company\" or \"Vale\") to present our limited assurance report on the non-financial information included in the 2021 Integrated Report of Vale for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nOur limited assurance does not cover prior-period information, or any other information disclosed together with the 2021 Integrated Reporting, including any incorporated images, audio files or videos.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MANAGEMENT OF VALE\n\nThe management of Vale is responsible for:\n\n\u2022 selecting or establishing adequate criteria for the preparation and presentation of the information included in the Integrated Report;\n\n\u2022 preparing the information in accordance with the criteria and guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI \u2013 Standards), with the basis of preparation developed by the Company, and with Guidance CPC 09 \u2013 Integrated Report issued by the Brazilian Federal Accounting Council (CFC), related to the Basic Conceptual Framework for Integrated Reporting, prepared by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC);\n\n\u2022 designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls over the significant information for the preparation of the information included in the Integrated Reporting, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S RESPONSIBILITY\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the non-financial information included in the 2021 Integrated Reporting, based on our limited assurance engagement carried out in accordance with the Technical Communication CTO 01 \u2013 Issuance of Assurance Reports related to Sustainability and Social Responsibility, issued by the Federal Accounting Council (CFC), based on the Brazilian standard NBC TO 3000, \"Assurance Engagements Other than Audit and Review\", also issued by the CFC, which is equivalent to the international standard ISAE 3000, \"Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information\", issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Those standards require that the auditor complies with ethical requirements, independence requirements, and other responsibilities of these standards, including those regarding the application of the Brazilian Quality Control Standard (NBC PA 01) and, therefore, the maintenance of a comprehensive quality control system, including documented policies and procedures on the compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nMoreover, the aforementioned standards require that the work be planned and performed to obtain limited assurance that the non-financial information included in the 2021 Integrated Report, taken as a whole, is free from material misstatement.\n\nA limited assurance engagement conducted in accordance with the Brazilian standard NBC TO 3000 and ISAE 3000 mainly consists of making inquiries of management and other professionals of Vale involved in the preparation of the information, as well as applying analytical procedures to obtain evidence that allows us to issue a limited assurance conclusion on the information, taken as a whole. A limited assurance engagement also requires the performance of additional procedures when the independent auditor becomes aware of matters that lead him to believe that the information disclosed in the Integrated Report taken as a whole might present significant misstatements.\n\nThe procedures selected are based on our understanding of the aspects related to the compilation, materiality, and presentation of the\ninformation included in the 2021 Integrated Report, other circumstances of the engagement and our analysis of the activities and processes associated with the significant information disclosed in the 2021 Integrated Report in which significant misstatements might exist. The procedures comprised, among others:\n\n(a) planning the work, taking into consideration the materiality and the volume of quantitative and qualitative information and the operating and internal control systems that were used to prepare the information included in the 2021 Integrated Report;\n\n(b) understanding the calculation methodology and the procedures adopted for the compilation of indicators through inquiries of the managers responsible for the preparation of the information;\n\n(c) applying analytical procedures to quantitative information and making inquiries regarding the qualitative information and its correlation with the indicators disclosed in the 2021 Integrated Report; and\n\n(d) when non-financial data relate to financial indicators, comparing these indicators with the financial statements and/or accounting records.\n\nThe limited assurance engagement also included the analysis of the compliance with the guidelines and criteria 1) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-Standards); 2) the provisions established in the basis of preparation developed by the Company; 3) the principles for the Integrated Report, pursuant to Guidance CPC 09 \u2013 Integrated Report, related to the Basic Conceptual Framework for Integrated Report, prepared by the International Integrated Report Council (IIRC) applicable in the preparation of the information included in the 2021 Integrated Report.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion.\n\nSCOPE AND LIMITATIONS\n\nThe procedures applied in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are less detailed than those applied in a reasonable assurance. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the level that would be obtained in a reasonable assurance engagement. If we had performed a reasonable assurance engagement, we might have identified other matters and possible misstatements in the information included in the 2021 Integrated Report. Therefore, we do not express an opinion on this information.\n\nNon-financial data are subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, due to the nature and diversity of the methods used to determine, calculate and estimate these data. Qualitative interpretations of the relevance, materiality, and accuracy of the data are subject to individual assumptions and judgments. Furthermore, we did not consider in our engagement the data reported for prior periods nor future projections and goals.\n\nThe preparation and presentation of non-financial information and indicators followed the definitions of the basis of preparation developed by the Company and the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-Standards) and, therefore, the information included in the 2021 Integrated Report does not have the objective of providing assurance with regard to the compliance with social, economic, environmental or engineering laws and regulations. However, the aforementioned standards establish the presentation and disclosure of possible cases of non-compliance with such regulations when sanctions or significant fines are applied. Our assurance report should be read and understood in this context, inherent to the criteria selected and previously mentioned in this paragraph.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBased on these procedures performed, described herein, and on the evidence obtained, no matter has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the non-financial information included in the Integrated Report for the year ended December 31, 2021 of Vale S.A. has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria and guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-Standards), with the basis of preparation developed by the Company, and with the Guidance CPC 09 \u2013 Integrated Report.\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, May 6, 2022\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores Independentes Ltda.\nCRC 2SP000160/O-5\n\nMauricio Colombari\nContador CRC 1SP195838/O-3\n## GRI Content Index  GRI 102-55\n\nFor the Materiality Disclosure Services, GRI Services reviewed that the GRI content index is clearly presented and the references for Disclosures 102-40 to 102-49 are aligned with appropriate sections in the body of the report.\n\n### ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE\n\n| GRI Standards | Disclosure | Page number(s) and/or URL and/or direct answers | Material / Non-Material | Omission | SDG | ICMM Principles | SASB |\n|---------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------|-----|-----------------|------|\n| 102-1         | Name of the organization | Page 20 | Mandatory |          |     |                 |      |\n| 102-2         | Activities, brands, products, and services | Pages 20 and 56 | Mandatory |          |     |                 |      |\n| 102-3         | Location of headquarters | Page 55 | Mandatory |          |     |                 |      |\n| 102-4         | Location of operations | Pages 20 and 55 | Mandatory |          |     |                 |      |\n| 102-5         | Ownership and legal form | Page 20 | Mandatory |          |     |                 |      |\n| 102-6         | Markets served | Page 55; further information can be found in the 2021 Reference Form - Section: Information on products and services related to operating segments - 2.1.3 Customers and sales (Pages: 259, 260, 262 and 266) | Mandatory |          |     |                 |      |\n| 102-7         | Scale of the organization | Pages 20 and 55; further information can be found in the 2021 Reference Form \u2013 Section: 7.2 \u2013 Information on operating segments | Mandatory |          |     |                 |      |\n| GRI Standards | Disclosure | Page number(s) and/or URL and/or direct answers | Material / Non-Material | Omission | SDG | ICMM Principles | SASB |\n|---------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------|-----|----------------|------|\n| 102-8         | Information on employees and other workers | Page 90; More information can be found in the \"Social\" tab of the ESG Databook | Mandatory |          |     |                |      |\n| 102-9         | Supply chain | Pages 110; further information can be found in the 2021 Reference Form \u2013 Section: 7.3 \u2013 Information on products and services related to operating segments. e.
