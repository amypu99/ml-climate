It covers the operations and activities of T-Mobile US, Inc. for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31) unless otherwise noted. Find out more about The Numbers and Small Print.\n2020 was a year that won\u2019t soon be forgotten. At T-Mobile, we persevered through extraordinary challenges, including a global pandemic, an economic crisis, and significant social and political unrest\u2014all while beginning a massive integration process following the long-awaited completion of our merger with Sprint.\n\nDespite all of these challenges, we successfully stayed focused on serving and supporting our customers during a time when staying connected was more important to them than ever. We also stayed true to our commitment to not just be a bigger company after joining forces with Sprint\u2026 but to be a BETTER company that would use our combined network, scale, and resources FOR GOOD.\n\nI could not be prouder of how T-Mobile stepped up\u2014doing the right thing the Un-carrier way, and making an impact that matters for our employees and for the customers and communities we serve.\n\nAt the heart of this endeavor to use our scale for good is our pursuit to truly deliver 5G for All by building the world\u2019s best 5G network, which will enable a more connected, digitally-equitable future as we lead the transition to this transformative technology while working hard to ensure that no one is left behind. Our marquee cause to leverage this asset is Project 10Million that focuses on helping connect every single student to the internet and eradicate the homework gap in the United States. Education is a great leveller in our society and we have committed to ensuring America\u2019s children can get the access they need and the education and equal opportunity that they deserve.\n\nWe first announced this unprecedented $10.7 billion project in late 2019, but as the education landscape rapidly shifted towards remote learning due to the pandemic, we accelerated our efforts and partnered with schools and school districts across the country to connect millions of students who lacked home internet. Post-pandemic, this work will continue until we achieve our goal to connect 10 million students with the internet access they need to learn and succeed.\n\nOver the last year, we focused heavily on our people and our culture. We guided teams through the significant shifts in our business and a pandemic-world, while navigating protests for greater racial justice that took place across our country. We implemented measures to help employees manage the social, emotional, and economic stress of the pandemic while undertaking the important journey of uniting our company behind a new company vision, mission, and set of values. We also launched our five-year Equity In Action plan, which reflects our commitment to embed diversity, equity, and inclusion even more strongly in our company culture with ambitious programs to continue building diverse talent across our company to reflect the communities we serve.\n\nFinally, our commitment to the planet is stronger than ever. The impact of climate change on our customers, our communities, and our operations is growing every year. We will continue to follow through on our longstanding enterprise sustainability commitments, even as the size of our company footprint significantly grew with the Sprint merger. T-Mobile was the first major U.S. telecom to sign the RE100 commitment and we are on track to power our business and network with 100% renewable energy by the end of 2021. In recognition of our industry-leading efforts, we were named to the CDP\u2019s A List for climate change\u2014a leading standard of corporate environmental transparency. We are incredibly proud to currently be the only U.S. telecom company given this top listing.\n\nMoving forward, it\u2019s important to us that T-Mobile continues to break down barriers and use our leadership position in the wireless industry as a force for good. As you\u2019ll see in the pages that follow, what we\u2019ve accomplished this past year has moved us one step closer to a more equitable and sustainable future for all. And we\u2019re just getting started!\n\nMIKE SIEVERT\nCEO\nT-Mobile US, Inc.\nOur unstoppable mindset sparked a revolution. Putting people first, treating them right, and changing the rules in their favor. As the Un-carrier, we changed the wireless industry by abolishing barriers and unnecessary complexities. We led by example. And that was just the start.\n\nIn 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint came together in a historic merger to represent a bigger and better company with even bigger and bolder aspirations. Today, our success makes possible what was impossible before: A transformative network experience connecting Americans nationwide.\n\nOur combined people and assets, along with our newfound scale and capabilities, position us to lead this industry through the 5G era and beyond. Because we don\u2019t wait for change. We make it.\n\nAs the leader in 5G, our network already covers more of America than anyone else.\n\nAND WE\u2019RE NOT DONE. WE ARE INVESTING BILLIONS IN OUR NETWORK TO PROVIDE 5G FOR ALL.\nWE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY\n\nWe have the winning formula to lead the new 5G era. By living our values every single day, we strive to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world. That\u2019s our mission as we stride towards a vision to be #1 in customer choice and #1 in customers\u2019 hearts.\n\nOur original obsession with breaking down barriers to do right by our customers is the driving force behind everything we do. That hasn\u2019t changed now that we\u2019re a bigger company. In fact, we\u2019ve set our sights even higher, bringing our Un-carrier spirit and focus to address the societal barriers that keep many people disconnected and excluded from fully participating and succeeding in our digital world. Because connectivity is no longer just an option, it\u2019s a fundamental part of how we operate as a society and stay connected to core aspects of everyday life.\n\nOur relentless focus on customers, our belief that equity is the starting point, not the end result, our commitment to one another, and our passion for thinking big and doing good is reflected in our new company values. Together, these values light the way for our combined company, uniting us behind the things that matter and differentiating us as the Un-carrier.\n\nWE'RE BUILDING A MORE EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE FUTURE WHERE EVERYONE CAN FULLY PARTICIPATE, DREAM BIG, AND THRIVE.\nAs one united company, we represent over a century of connections and an incredible legacy of giving. Our rich history of breaking down barriers to provide people with technology solutions that improve and enrich their lives has prepared us to tackle even bigger challenges.\n\nTogether, we see and are pursuing an unmatched opportunity to leverage our larger size, scale, and transformational network to be a force for good\u2014for our customers, our employees, and our communities.\n\nIT\u2019S NOT C.S.R.\nIT\u2019S WHO.WE.ARE.\n\nOUR LARGER ROLE FOR PEOPLE AND THE PLANET\n\nEmbedded in our mission to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world are three simple elements: the world we live in, the people that live in it, and the technology that connects us to this world. T-Mobile\u2019s success, scale, and wide-reaching impact compel us to protect, uplift, and connect them together.\n\nAs a company that\u2019s inspired to change the world for the better, we\u2019re working to ensure everyone can equally and fully participate in the endless opportunities available in today\u2019s digital world. By connecting people to what\u2019s possible, elevating opportunity for all, and driving towards a more sustainable future, we can be a catalyst for equitable and enduring transformation in our communities.\n\nThe environmental, social, and governance issues we address in our strategy\u2014and those we talk about in this report\u2014have been identified through a materiality assessment, involving a robust internal and external stakeholder engagement process. Corporate Responsibility at T-Mobile is governed at the highest levels of our business, in partnership with the T-Mobile Board of Directors and respective committees.\n\nBRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE\n\nFast and reliable internet connectivity has become one of the most important differentiators of societal equity today, powering everything from education, to our work, civic engagement, and even healthcare. Those who lack access are often at a disadvantage. The digital divide is even wider in rural America and for communities of color. We are working to help bridge these disparities for good by making investments to provide more equitable connectivity, improve digital literacy, and open pathways for careers in the 5G economy through skills-building and training programs.\n\nSee how we do it\n\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION\n\nWe\u2019re a company that celebrates our differences\u2014knowing we\u2019re better together than apart. We champion diversity, equity, and inclusion for our employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities we serve\u2014and we are putting action behind our words through our Equity In Action Plan.\n\nSee how we do it\n\nTHRIVING PLANET\n\nEverything is connected. People can\u2019t thrive unless our planet, the world that sustains us, is thriving. The health, well-being, and livelihoods of generations to come, and our business, depend on the actions we take now to protect our planet. See how we are doing our part to combat climate change and make our business more sustainable.\n\nSee how we do it\nIn 2020, our supercharged Un-carrier spirit was unstoppable. We empowered more people than ever through equitable access to wireless connectivity\u2014all the while investing in our employees and supporting our community partners. And we\u2019ve continued to advance initiatives that embed sustainability across our operations and contribute to building a better world.\n\n+2.5M\nK-12 students connected with free or heavily subsidized service and devices through our Project 10Million education programs\n\n#5\nin Top Employers\u2019 Responses to Pandemic, Forbes, and JUST Capital\n\n$100M\ndonated to support local communities\n\n~20M\nmeals delivered to families and children in need through donations to Feeding America\n\n60%\nemployees of color\n\n$22.4M\ninvested for employees to further their education\n\n$3B\nspent with diverse vendors\n\n~20M\nmeals delivered to families and children in need through donations to Feeding America\n\n100%\nscore on the Disability:IN Disability Equality Index (five years running)\n\n3.5M MWH\nworth of signed renewable energy contracts\n\n7.9M\ndevices collected for recycling, reuse, and resale\n\nA LIST\nCDP Climate\n\n100 BEST\nCompanies to Work For, Fortune (four years running)\nRESPONDING TO COVID-19\n2020 was one of the most unpredictable and challenging years many of us have ever faced. The circumstances highlighted how people everywhere relied more than ever on their wireless service to stay connected to everything that matters most to them. As the reality and impact of COVID-19 came into focus, our response was always centered around putting people first.\n\n\"We\u2019ve had to transform the way we interact and engage with our customers, whether in store or over the phone/digitally, and it hasn\u2019t always been easy. When I say I\u2019m in awe of our frontline teams, it\u2019s because they are truly on the frontline, delivering results and bringing the T-Mobile experience to life.\"\n\nJon Freier\nEVP of Consumer Group\nWe knew that keeping our customers connected during the pandemic was mission-critical. At the same time, the welfare of our customers and that of our employees was paramount. We focused on safety while challenging ourselves to show up for one another and deliver to our customers in new and innovative ways.\n\nAs the pandemic unfolded prior to our merger, we quickly shifted both companies\u2019 business operations. We temporarily closed approximately 80% of our T-Mobile stores, while Sprint closed 70% of its company-owned stores and many third-party retailer locations. We also leveraged digital options such as virtual retail shopping to mobile and curbside fulfillment to keep providing services for our customers. Those locations that did stay open to provide essential services were strategically chosen to be an average 30-minute drive from our customers\u2019 homes, were thoroughly and frequently sanitized, and operated on reduced schedules.\n\nWe also re-invented our world class customer support model and transitioned nearly 14,000 Care Experts from 17 Customer Experience Centers to a work-from-home environment within a span of 20 days to help keep employees safe. Despite moving from a highly collaborative, in-person team support model to a remote working environment, our customer care teams didn\u2019t miss a beat and we couldn\u2019t be prouder of how they continued delivering outstanding service to our more than 100 million customers.\n\nFor customers facing hardship due to the pandemic, we quickly took measures to ensure continued service. T-Mobile joined the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s (FCC) Keep Americans Connected pledge, agreeing to not terminate service to any residential or small business customers due to an inability to pay their bills. Additionally, we waived any late fees customers incurred because of their economic circumstances. The pledge initially covered service through May 2020, but we extended our promise through the end of June 2020.\n\nRecognizing the severe financial strain many Americans were experiencing because of COVID-19, we launched T-Mobile Connect, our lowest priced smartphone plan ever, ahead of schedule. We also gave ALL customers unlimited data for two months during the pandemic, and an extra 20GB of data to customers with hotspot data plans.\n\nI am just amazed by our collective resiliency and ability to adapt. The pandemic brought additional layers of complexity to all of our lives, yet our employees continued to show up for each other and our customers. Their passion for keeping our customers connected and providing the best experience possible is inspiring beyond measure.\n\nCALLIE FIELD\nCHIEF CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OFFICER\n\nOur engineering teams were hard at work too, keeping our network operational while working to maintain and build out new towers, manage network switch locations, and expand our network\u2019s reach\u2014despite these complicated times. T-Mobile also partnered with multiple spectrum holders and the FCC to light up an additional 600 megahertz (MHz) spectrum on a temporary basis to enable us to meet increased network demand during the pandemic, effectively doubling total 600 MHz Long-Term Evolution (LTE) capacity across the nation. And, we were the first wireless provider to activate the nationwide 988-emergency mental health lifeline. As mental health issues rose throughout the pandemic, this critical service couldn\u2019t come quickly enough.\nSHOWING UP FOR OUR EMPLOYEES\n\nThe pandemic took a toll on people around the world\u2014and our employees were no exception. Many suddenly found themselves assuming the roles of remote workers, teachers, and caretakers. Others relied exclusively on virtual solutions to stay connected with family and friends. These significant changes were taking place just as T-Mobile completed its merger with Sprint, which meant that, in April 2020, virtually everything about our employees\u2019 work lives was upended.\n\nIn the midst of this rapidly changing environment we moved at a record pace to shift our approach to business, implementing changes at every level across the company to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees. We transitioned 2,200 retail employees to remote positions to assist customer care teams. We also supplemented pay for some of our employees and commissions for third-party dealers as well as provided access to incremental paid time off for employees impacted by COVID-19 or taking care of children at home due to school closures.\n\nFor the limited number of Care employees that remained in our Customer Experience Centers, we introduced safety measures including reduced hours of operations, common area closures, and frequent cleaning and sanitizing. Even as we encountered new transitions as the pandemic and recommended guidelines continued to evolve, ensuring continuity of customer service and care has remained a constant priority for our team.\n\nA MAGENTA HUG THROUGH TOUGH TIMES\n\nFrom integrating two companies and cultures to navigating a global pandemic and shifting the way we work, nothing in 2020 felt normal. Recognizing these significant challenges and the impact they had on employees\u2019 ability to interact with one another in person, and for leaders to travel the country to engage with their teams, our CEO Mike Sievert inspired our \u201cMagenta Hug\u201d program to bring people together and spread some magenta love. Magenta Hug used the online platform Kudoboard to enable employees to share messages of support and kindness. More than 30,000 employees posted, and it became the fastest Kudoboard to reach 10,000 submissions in the history of the platform. And, each employee had the opportunity to select one gift from a catalog of 60 items, with more than 65,000 employees redeeming a gift.\n\nFind out how we\u2019ve supported communities during the pandemic\n\nTAKING CARE OF EACH OTHER\n\nIn October, we asked our teams across the company\u2014from our stores to our Customer Experience Centers to our back office\u2014about how well our company responded to COVID-19. Here\u2019s some of what we heard from employees:\n\n92% of respondents agree, \u201cT-Mobile\u2019s support for employees as a result of the pandemic has been fair to employees like me.\u201d\n\n87% of respondents agree, \u201cI believe that my health and well-being is a top priority for our organization.\u201d\n\n86% of respondents agree, \u201cT-Mobile is doing everything they can to support me and my family during this crisis.\u201d\nSTAYING HEALTHY, TOGETHER\n\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, we launched Stay Healthy Together, a comprehensive internal microsite for employees featuring the latest news, updates, and guidance regarding the pandemic. Throughout the year the site has remained a one-stop-shop for the latest information and resources, including changes to operating procedures and revised local or national guidance, plus well-being resources to help each other and our loved ones navigate life in a pandemic. For working parents, the site curated a myriad of resources and offered discounts on home office furniture, financial counselors, and tutors for children. Virtual communities in places like Slack were more important than ever, including Magenta Kids, an online space connecting parents to fun, family-friendly and interactive programs and resources curated by our Community Team in Human Resources.\n\nTo help our employees prioritize their wellness and fight the fatigue of a challenging year, we were excited to welcome health and fitness expert Bob Harper to join us for a conversation on maintaining positivity through tough times.\n\nSTAYING FOCUSED ON MENTAL HEALTH\n\nThe toll that COVID-19 took on our world hasn\u2019t just been a physical one; our mental health and well-being has been similarly tested. T-Mobile\u2019s senior leaders reminded us that yes, we can\u2014and should\u2014talk about mental health. We held company-wide conversations on the importance of mental health\u2014particularly during Mental Health Awareness Month in May and National Disability Employment Awareness Month in October. LiveMagenta, T-Mobile\u2019s well-being program, includes resources for emotional, financial, physical, social, and work health for co-workers and their families. Among the benefits are:\n\n- Unlimited access to LiveMagenta life coaches, no matter the time or day.\n- Five free counseling sessions per topic.\n- Free access to Sanvello, an app that offers clinical techniques to help dial down symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression.\n- Free access to Talkspace, a digital alternative to in-person therapy that allows voice and video messaging with thousands of licensed, masters-level or higher clinicians.\n- Free access to mindfulness resources through eMindful.\n\nCOVID Connect launched as our new education series to help navigate the complex and ever-changing topic of COVID-19 with fact-based information, rooted in science. Through regular virtual conversations with Dr. Vin Gupta, a Critical Care Pulmonologist and Assistant Professor of Health Metrics Sciences at the University of Washington, teams got answers to their questions about COVID-19. Topics included vaccine efficacy and eligibility, travel safety, herd immunity, and CDC guidance updates, as well as the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impacts on people of color.\n\nIn addition to these conversations with employees, Dr. Gupta consulted and advised our Senior Leadership Team and other leaders across the company on options and critical decisions for our business to keep our employees, customers, and communities safe.\nCONNECTING CUSTOMERS TO THEIR WORLD\nWe love our customers. It\u2019s who we are. Now more than ever, customers need a wireless provider they can depend on. That\u2019s why they\u2019re at the heart of our mission, which guides everything we do.\n\nAnd we won\u2019t stop. In bringing choice, value, and simplicity to customers in new ways.\n\nWe understand how important it is for people to remain connected\u2014to family and friends, to resources and information, to their jobs via teleworking or schools via virtual classrooms. And we take our responsibility to keep our customers connected incredibly seriously.\n\nNeville Ray\nPresident of Technology\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND DISASTER RESPONSE\n\nWhen disasters impact our customers and communities, connectivity is a crucial lifeline to loved ones\u2014and for first-responders and aid agencies. That\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on building ever greater resiliency into our network operations and providing on-the-ground emergency support to communities in times of need.\n\nUnfortunately, 2020 was another year where natural disasters significantly impacted our customers, employees, and communities. When wildfires raged through millions of acres in California, Oregon, and Washington and storms wreaked havoc in the south and southeast of the country, T-Mobile was there.\n\nWe take a comprehensive approach to disaster preparation and response, always hoping for the best but making sure we anticipate and plan for the worst. We partner closely with national weather forecasters to monitor for climate-related emergencies. Once a storm hits, our investments in our network\u2019s resiliency and infrastructure prove critical. Our nationwide 5G buildout with crucial low-band spectrum gives us the coverage penetration necessary to keep customers in service during and after natural disasters.\n\nOver the past year, we invested even more to further increase our network emergency response capabilities, doubling the size of our emergency management fleet of satellite-enabled vehicles. Meanwhile, our Network Response Teams are always on standby\u201424/7/365\u2014prepared to respond quickly and nimbly to any service disruptions. In extreme situations, when commercial wireless networks are out of service, T-Mobile also provides first responders and government agencies with Wi-Fi calling via satellite.\n\n$1.3M worth of in-kind services provided to support disaster relief efforts\n\nWe also show up in other important ways to support customers and communities when disasters strike. For example, T-Mobile waived all fees for talk, text, and data for those affected by Hurricane Zeta and the California wildfires, while our Emergency Response teams showed up in full force over 50 times throughout the year, going into hard hit communities with charging stations and other much-needed supplies like water and food. Finally, we also leverage our network to engage our employees and customers to participate in text-based fundraising efforts that have raised millions of dollars for relief agencies and, through the T-Mobile Foundation, we match or double our employees\u2019 donations to disaster partners.\n\nCONNECTING OUR HEROES\n\nTo help America\u2019s frontline heroes at such a critical time, T-Mobile launched Connecting Heroes, a 10-year commitment to provide free smartphone service and 5G access to America\u2019s first responder agencies, including all public and non-profit state and local fire, police and emergency medical service departments\u2014saving them up to $7 billion. It\u2019s just one way we can say \u201cthank you\u201d to those who risk it all to protect us.\n\nT-Mobile also launched new 911 capabilities\u2014Location-Based Routing and Next Generation 911 connectivity over IP\u2014two critical advancements that can speed up emergency response times by helping pinpoint the location of callers, reducing the need for call transfers, and enabling a more efficient and effective 911 communication system.\n\nFirst responders are on the frontlines every day, keeping us safe and protecting us when we need them most. We want to give them the tools they need to do their jobs effectively, so they don\u2019t have to worry about their mobile connection being able to reach their colleagues. We are pulling out the stops to help our first responders get and stay connected.\n\nMIKE KATZ\nEVP OF T-MOBILE BUSINESS GROUP\nAfter Hurricane Mar\u00eda devastated the island of Puerto Rico four years ago, the first plane to land in the country was chartered by T-Mobile. It was carrying a giant generator loaned to the Federal Aviation Administration to power airport radars and get the island\u2019s main international airport in San Juan up and running again, just days after the storm.\n\nUnderscoring our commitment to invest in the country for the long haul, we rebuilt our network so it was ready for 5G connectivity. This has been life-changing for those in remote or underserved areas. And, through Project 10Million, we\u2019re providing 100GB of internet data per year for five years and a free mobile hotspot to eligible households to help ensure continued learning and communication between teachers and their students. Students also have the option to purchase additional data at low cost, if needed.\n\nAlongside our ongoing work to bring rapid, reliable connectivity to the country are partnerships to support Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery and resilience efforts.\n\nBelow are just a few examples:\n\n\u2014 Remote learning enabled for students at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Puerto Rico Vimenti School, and teachers of Caras Org.\n\n\u2014 Enabled people experiencing homelessness to connect with La Fondita de Jesus to monitor COVID-19 treatment.\n\n\u2014 A founding member of the inaugural 5G Narrowband Internet of Things (NBIoT) Lab, the first IoT lab in Puerto Rico which has enabled 3D printing of personal protective equipment for first responders, as well as launching a Farmbot project which could transform farming in the future.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the importance of distance learning and home broadband access came into stark focus here. We\u2019re working hard to provide even remote rural areas in Puerto Rico with the high-speed connections once available only in big cities\u2014because we believe that where you\u2019re from shouldn\u2019t limit how far you go.\n\nJORGE MARTEL\nVICE PRESIDENT & GENERAL MANAGER, T-MOBILE PUERTO RICO\n\nIn 2020, we committed to a ten-year investment in Distrito T-Mobile, a massive 476,000 square foot entertainment complex in San Juan that includes a hotel, a drive-in movie theater, and a musical hall for concerts, along with restaurants, gaming areas, and even a zipline. This new complex will help regenerate economic investment and give people who have been through so much hardship some light relief.\nAs a combined company, we said that we would work to build a network for ALL\u2014one that brings the benefits of 5G to as many Americans as possible. We\u2019re keeping our promise.\n\nFor far too long, small towns and rural areas across the country have been under-resourced and underserved by wireless and internet companies. A shocking one-quarter of all households in rural America lack access to any high-speed broadband. Of the households that do have access, 40% live in areas with only one provider. This means no competition and higher prices.\n\nEven before COVID-19, a lack of connectivity was cited among the top five educational barriers for Americans living in small towns.\n\nBy delivering choice and competition to rural areas, we\u2019re closing the gap among those who have been underserved for far too long.\n\nIn the next five years, we aim to build a transformational 5G network to reach more cities and towns in the U.S. than anyone else. In doing so, 90% of rural Americans will be able to connect to a world of opportunity.\n\nFind out how Project 10Million is connecting rural kids and schools.\n\nAt T-Mobile, our commitment to small town America is about more than our network. It\u2019s about making sustained investments to support the people, schools, and businesses that are the heart of rural America. Over the course of the year as COVID took a toll across the country, T-Mobile donated nearly $3 million to rural area Boys & Girls Clubs and school districts. We also worked directly with six local Boys & Girls Clubs to redirect our technology grants to upgrade their equipment, software, and expand Wi-Fi to reach more rural youth during the pandemic.\nMAKING CONNECTIVITY ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL\n\nBuilding a network for ALL includes anticipating our customers\u2019 unique needs and ensuring our services are accessible to ALL. We\u2019re committed to investing in digital accessibility through a wide range of award-winning services and solutions\u2014and to ensuring access to our websites, applications, tools, and services for ALL of our customers and employees, regardless of their level of ability.\n\nT-Mobile has a dedicated Accessibility Resource Center (ARC) which focuses on removing barriers for customers and employees with disabilities when accessing our digital space. Through this work we enable the use of assistive technologies, such as screen readers for those who are blind or have low vision, adaptive devices and keyboards for those with motor disabilities, and captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing.\n\nThe ARC, in coordination with our Learning and Development teams and the accessibility community, also provides Cultural Awareness training for our sales and customer service employees. This helps ensure that our frontline employees are equipped to understand and provide support for all customers.\n\nPROVIDING ACCESSIBLE SOLUTIONS SO THAT EVERYONE HAS THE ABILITY TO CONNECT\n\nWe believe wireless technology should enable everyone to connect. That\u2019s why we work hard to provide accessible solutions which includes our Directory Assistance Program for customers with visual, physical, and/or cognitive disabilities; alternate billing options for individuals with visual impairments; language and speech assistance; and easy-to-use handsets and family well-being monitors.\n\nBuilding on Sprint\u2019s strong track record of making accessible products and services for customers who are Deaf, DeafBlind (Deaf and Blind), or have speech disabilities, we\u2019re the nation\u2019s largest provider of Telecommunications Relay Services, providing accessibility services to 37 state customers, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as the U.S. Federal Government. Relay services enable those who have speech disabilities and hearing loss to communicate over the phone by using a specialized text telephone and operator service to convert voice communication into text.\n\nWe are proud of our commitment to break down connectivity barriers for ALL of our customers and look forward to a future where 5G innovation can empower people with disabilities to participate even more seamlessly in society.\n\nLearn more about our accessibility services\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) are rooted in our culture of belonging and have always been at the center of everything we do.\n\nDE&I isn\u2019t a new concept for us, and following our merger with Sprint, we recognized an opportunity to evolve and expand our deep and long-standing commitment to our people, our customers, and the communities we serve.\n\nEquity In Action (EIA) is our five-year Un-carrier plan that spans the values we live by; how we invest in and provide opportunities for our employees; the products and services we offer; the suppliers we do business with; and how we advocate for our communities. EIA offers a roadmap that inspires us to lead by example, put people first and ensure DE&I remains at the center of everything we do.\n\nIT FOCUSES ON THREE KEY AREAS:\n\n1. **TALENT**\n   - We will recruit, retain, and develop the best team in the history of our industry which includes increasing diversity across every level. Strengthening the pipeline of diverse talent up to the executive level makes us a stronger, smarter, and better company.\n\n2. **CULTURE**\n   - Where others see numbers, we see people\u2014and our culture is proof of that approach. We will focus on providing our employees with tools to build inclusive habits and behaviors as part of their day-to-day lives. By putting inclusion at the core of our culture, our employees will be inspired to build equitable products and services for our customers.\n\n3. **BRAND**\n   - We\u2019re committed to continuously evolving and improving. When issues of racial injustice rose to the forefront of national conversation in 2020, we rose to the occasion to use our platform and voice to drive action and we won\u2019t stop standing up for true equality for all. Diverse, inclusive workplaces are the basis for our unique Un-carrier culture, making us a better and more successful company.\n\nTo ensure we deliver on our DE&I promises, we formed an External Diversity & Inclusion Council made up of leading thinkers and advocates in this space to help guide and support our efforts. This Council includes leaders of National Urban League, League of United Latin American Citizens, National Action Network, UnidosUS, OCA-Asian-Pacific American Advocates, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Human Rights Campaign, National Organization On Disabilities, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, National Diversity Coalition, and Multicultural Media, Telecom and Internet Council.\n\n2020 was a huge year for the Un-carrier, and the world. It will forever be the year remembered by the challenges we faced, but defined by the ways in which we showed up for one another and took urgent action to affirm that we all belong here\u2014at T-Mobile and in our larger communities.\n\nHOLLI MARTINEZ\nVP OF DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION\nTOGETHER, WE ARE THE UN-CARRIER\nOur values guide us toward a bigger and better future. We are cultivating a culture of bridges, not silos. A team of allies, not heroes. One that works left-right, not top-down. All in pursuit of something bigger\u2014a brighter future for our customers, for one another, for our shareholders, society, and the planet. Today, we stand together as one team ready to deliver on our mission and live our values every day.\n\n\u201c...Our employee benefits, programs, and resources are grounded in our values. We appreciate one another as individuals with unique needs and goals. Working as a team, together, we are the Un-carrier and can accomplish incredible things for our customers, our communities, and each other.\n\nDeanne King\nEVP and Chief Human Resources Officer\nBringing our two teams, businesses, and cultures together began with building a strong foundation\u2014and by asking a few critically important questions. Who do we want to be as the supercharged Un-carrier? What values brought each of our companies to this point, and which values will we need to take us to a bigger and better future?\n\nSo, we listened. Through two dozen focus groups with hundreds of employees across each legacy company, as well as a comprehensive culture survey sent to all employees and completed by more than half, we focused on building the foundation for our shared culture.\n\nWe learned that our two respective cultures had a lot in common. A passion and dedication to customer-centricity, a celebration of diversity, and focus on inclusion, a fun, collaborative culture\u2014these were key ingredients to our respective historical successes and will remain key to our future successes.\n\nWe identified opportunities to define our new, shared values including an increased emphasis on personal and professional growth, on working across organizational lines to establish and build trust in each other, and a renewed focus on empowering each other as a team.\n\nWith these insights in hand, we\u2019ve articulated who we are, what we stand for, and the values that guide our work together. Our values not only tell an inspiring story of WHO WE WERE but also WHO WE ARE, and WHO WE WANT TO BE as a culture and as a company.\nWE VALUE WHAT EACH PERSON BRINGS\n\nWe're inspired by a simple mantra when it comes to our work together: #BeYou. A One Team, Together culture doesn't mean we're all the same, and it doesn't mean minimizing or ignoring our differences. In fact, it means celebrating our differences. When we're empowered to bring our full, authentic selves to work, we can all win, together.\n\nOur ability to dream big and deliver as a company is impossible without our employees. We know we are a stronger company when we work to create an environment where every employee feels valued for who they are and equipped to offer the best for our customers and constantly innovate. That means bringing together our unique talents, perspectives and backgrounds and empowering all employees with opportunities to learn, grow, and develop.\n\nWe are focused on creating career pathways for those who serve our country and are proud supporters of FourBlock, a nationwide community of veterans and employers dedicated to transforming the veteran transition process, and Hiring Our Heroes, an initiative by way of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that was designed to connect employers with a pipeline of accomplished, ready-to-hire individuals from the military community. Our mission is to hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by 2023 and we're more than halfway there!\n\nU.S. workforce demographics\n\n3,432 Veterans*\n\n3,294 Individuals with Disabilities*\n\n1,621 LGBTQA*\n\n* As self-identified as of 12/31/20.\n\nRECOGNITION\n\nIn 2020, T-Mobile was recognized with 44 national, regional, and local awards and recognitions that named us a great place to work, including Fortune\u2019s 100 Best Companies to Work For in each of the past four years.\n\nDisability:IN\nDisability Equality Index 100% Score\nFive consecutive years\n\nWorking Mother\nBest Company for Multicultural Women\n\nForbes\nAmerica\u2019s Best Employers for New Graduates\nBest Employers for Women\n\nHuman Rights Campaign\nCorporate Equality Index 100% Score\nFive consecutive years\n\nNational Association for Female Executives\nTop Companies for Executive Women\n\nMilitary Friendly\u00ae\nDesignated T-Mobile as a top Military Friendly Employer (14 years) and Military Spouse Friendly employer\nSecond time\nWe know that leading with transparency includes providing details on our workforce data. This not only keeps us accountable, but also raises the bar for others. The following data tells a story, a story of progress and room for growth. And a story that is not yet complete. We still have work to do and will keep pressing forward to create a more diversified and inclusive workplace, with broader access to opportunity for all.\n\n### TOTAL U.S. WORKFORCE\u2014RACE/ETHNICITY\n\n- **60.1%** People of color\n- **39.9%** White\n\n### TOTAL U.S. WORKFORCE\u2014GENDER\n\n- **40.6%** Female\n- **59.4%** Male\n\n### U.S. Race/Ethnicity by Position\n\n| Position          | American Indian/Alaskan Native | Asian | Black | Hispanic | Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander | Two or more races | Unknown/Undeclared | White |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------|-------|----------|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| Executive (Dir +) | 0.3%                           | 10.8% | 4.8%  | 5.4%     | 0.2%                             | 1.9%              | 0.2%              | 76.5% |\n| People Manager    | 0.5%                           | 8.2%  | 14.4% | 22.6%    | 0.6%                             | 3.6%              | 0.1%              | 49.9% |\n| Individual Contributor | 0.5%                     | 9.5%  | 18.3% | 28.7%    | 0.5%                             | 4.5%              | 0.2%              | 37.8% |\n| Intern            | 0.0%                           | 43.3% | 9.2%  | 9.2%     | 0.0%                             | 5.0%              | 0.0%              | 33.3% |\n| **Total Race/Ethnicity of U.S. Workforce** | **0.5%** | **9.4%** | **17.6%** | **27.6%** | **0.5%** | **4.3%** | **0.2%** | **39.9%** |\n\n### U.S. Gender by Position\n\n| Position          | Female | Male | Unknown |\n|-------------------|--------|------|---------|\n| Executive (Dir +) | 32.4%  | 67.4%| 0.2%    |\n| People Manager    | 35.8%  | 64.2%| 0.0%    |\n| Individual Contributor | 41.4% | 58.6%| 0.0%    |\n| Intern            | 41.7%  | 58.3%| 0.0%    |\n\nAll data is as of December 31, 2020; percentages by category may not add up to 100% due to rounding.\nEMPOWERING EMPLOYEE ACTION\n\nGrassroots employee action has inspired many of our diversity initiatives\u2014from our commitments to military veterans and their families, to our advocacy for the LGBTQIA+ community, and our partnerships with leading civil rights organizations. The passionate and dedicated volunteer leaders of our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) help lead the way in identifying the issues and areas where our company can make the biggest impact.\n\nWhen our two teams and cultures joined forces in 2020, we integrated three decades of work, advocacy, and impact to form six bigger, better, and more ambitious groups with four additional affinity groups: Accessibility Community at T-Mobile, Multicultural Alliance (including Asia Pacific & Allies Network, Black Empowerment Network, Indigenous People\u2019s Network, and Magenta Latinx Network), Multigenerational Network, Pride, Veterans & Allies Network, and Women & Allies Network.\n\nOur ERGs amplify and celebrate the rich diversity of culture, heritage, and experience of our employees, helping to foster a sense of belonging by sparking conversation, hosting community events, and encouraging all members to be exactly who or what they want to be. Currently, nearly 40% of our team count themselves as members of one or more ERG. And the impact of this experience translates to our day jobs.\n\nBy taking advantage of the networking and educational programs offered through the ERGs, our data shows that employees who are members or leaders of these groups are more likely to achieve promotions or lateral transfers to try new jobs across the company. Our ERGs and our 50+ local DE&I chapters across the country help demonstrate the power of One Team, Together in both our professional and personal lives.\n\nIn 2020, our ERGs brought employees together for 25 virtual events, ranging from multiple conversations on parenting in a pandemic to a poignant, emotionally intimate virtual vigil for George Floyd and other victims of police violence.\n\nOur guest speaker series, Talking with Trailblazers, inspires us to listen and learn from the diverse perspectives of leaders inside and outside of our company, creating an open dialogue about the timely issues impacting our communities. Throughout the past year, conversations included how to be antiracist with author and professor Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, confronting racial inequality with Equal Justice Initiative Founder Bryan Stevenson, and being civically engaged with Voto Latino Co-Founder & actress Rosario Dawson. Overall, more than 25,000 employees tuned in live over the course of 2020.\n\nFrom Black History Month to Veterans Day, Mental Health Awareness Month to Pride Month, and Women\u2019s Equality Day to Autism Acceptance Month, and so much more, we place an emphasis on amplifying important moments inside and outside our walls to inspire learning, celebration, and allyship year-round.\nHOW WE DREAM BIG AND DELIVER\n\nWe aim high. We take smart risks and own our results. We act like owners because we ARE owners. There\u2019s a reason our team is so passionate and invested in T-Mobile and the results we deliver for our customers and each other\u2014and that\u2019s because when we say \u201cTogether, We Are the Un-carrier\u201d, we mean it literally!\n\nTo underscore this point, every member of our team is given the opportunity to be an owner of the company. Since 2014, we have awarded annual restricted stock unit grants to employees at every level of the company, from frontline to executives and back office employees, so that everyone can truly share in T-Mobile\u2019s performance. We also offer an employee stock purchase program, where employees can purchase TMUS stock at a 15% discount through payroll deduction.\n\nThis is just one way we hold ourselves and each other accountable in our work together\u2014to not just dream bigger, but to follow through on our goals and our promises to deliver amazing results for our customers. Our people are the center of the Un-carrier\u2019s success.\n\nNEVER STOP GROWING\nWe\u2019re a team that prides ourselves in never becoming complacent or comfortable with the status quo. No matter how much we achieve\u2014or how much we deliver, we\u2019re inspired by the idea that there is so much more out there to accomplish.\n\nLast year we launched Magenta University, our one-stop learning and development shop to support our employees with resources to grow skillsets, gain new perspectives, explore career options, and become the kinds of leaders we\u2019d like to follow.\n\nWe also enhanced learning opportunities with an annual Day of Learning, which brings the best aspects of external conferences directly to employees through inspiring and motivating keynotes from external speakers, including Josh Linkner showing us how to \u201cInnovate Through Change\u201d, Judi Holler explaining why \u201cBrave is the New Badass\u201d, and Walter Bond inspiring us to think with a \u201cShark Mindset\u201d.\n\nLEARNING & DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS\n\nEmployees participated in approximately 2.7M hours* of training\n\nHad millions of impressions across learning sites and platforms\n\n+14K joined leadership and career development programs\n\nOur Day of Learning reached more than 18,600 employees, employees rated it 4.4 out of 5 stars and 90% would recommend a replay to their peers\n\n10 apprentices onboarded\n\n$22.4M enabled tuition assistance program for 6,745 employees\n\n* Includes only trackable training hours completed in our formal Learning Management System by full-time and part-time employees.\nDEVELOPING LEADERS FOR OUR FUTURE\n\nIn addition to our learning resources, we\u2019re proud to offer career and leadership development programs designed to empower employees to define and achieve their own career success. We\u2019re building a diverse group of strong leaders now and for the future at T-Mobile. Here are just a few examples:\n\n\u2014 We launched Lead Magenta Next in partnership with our Employee Resource Groups to increase opportunities for employees from historically underrepresented groups to expand their leadership skills.\n\n\u2014 Our Stay Magenta internal career rotational program was so successful, it is being expanded to a company-wide program called CareerTraX. This program provides selected employees opportunities to complete rotational job experiences outside of their current role. Stay Magenta was recognized as one of WayUp\u2019s Top 100 Internship programs for 2020.\n\n\u2014 We launched our Apprenticeship Program in Nevada to place participants on a year-long journey to gain skills through hands-on experience and step-by-step coaching. We plan to expand the program into more states to help build a diverse workforce that is best positioned to serve consumers and expand our leadership in the 5G era.\n\n\u2014 We revamped many of our other development programs to create equitable leadership development opportunities for all\u2014including the creation of Magenta Manager which includes development for aspiring managers, new managers, and in-role managers, as well as immersive leadership learning experiences. In addition, we continue to offer our award-winning Top Talent Development programs like Magenta9 for aspiring Director+ level leaders and Leadership Edge for aspiring Vice President+ level leaders, and more.\n\nStay Magenta was an amazing experience that gave me a \u2018real-world\u2019 look at what it will be like working in my chosen field of study. This internship jump-started my career by giving me hands-on projects that allowed me to utilize and enhance my skills, as well as provide an endless amount of networking avenues that tap into a wealth of knowledge and resources.\n\nRICHARD GRAVA\nWAYUP TOP 100 INTERN & STAY MAGENTA ASSOCIATE ENGINEER, PRODUCT & TECHNOLOGY\nWe are a company inspired to change the world for the better. From reliable connectivity for all to education and youth development, T-Mobile is committed to giving back in bold ways that align with our brand, leverage our technology, and mobilize our people to create meaningful change for the greater good. Because we don\u2019t wait for change, we make it. And we won\u2019t stop.\n\nWhile the pandemic brought difficulty into all of our lives, it also galvanized some truly inspirational, innovative, and collaborative work like never before. I have seen this inspirational work with our employees who have continued to find ways to show up and invest in their communities and with our young innovators pursuing trailblazing ideas to drive societal and environmental change, all while navigating the complexity this pandemic has brought.\n\nJanice Kapner\nEVP and Chief Communications, Brand & Community Officer\nBRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE\n\nThe way we see it, we can't achieve our mission of being the best in the world at connecting people to their world unless we start at the beginning\u2014by working to ensure that EVERYONE is connected and able to reap the benefits of a 5G economy and a digitally-connected world.\n\nApproximately 17 million school-aged children in the U.S. do not have access to high-speed internet at home. That's a statistic we simply can't accept. From the formative days of education to participation in our economy and our democracy, to the ways we see and interact with one another, digital connectivity is woven into the very fabric of our lives.\n\nConnectivity is therefore no longer just an option, it's a fundamental component of today's world that impacts almost every aspect of how people navigate their daily lives. And today, our success has made possible what was impossible before: a transformative network experience that works to connect everyone, everywhere, across America.\n\nTo ensure that connected individuals have the foundational skills to benefit from today's digital world, we're not stopping at access to connectivity. As part of our Equity In Action efforts, we're also investing in digital literacy programs through partnerships with organizations making progress in this space. We are using our resources to help scale existing efforts and those being undertaken by our External Diversity and Inclusion Council.\nWe have zeroed in on a bold goal: help every single disconnected student in the U.S. get access to the internet so they can learn. The need for equitable access to the internet is more crucial than ever.\n\nProject 10Million is our $10.7 billion landmark initiative to provide free and heavily subsidized connectivity and mobile devices to millions of underserved student households over five years.\n\nOur intent is to not just chip away at the digital divide that separates those with connectivity, from those without. It\u2019s to eliminate it. Permanently.\n\nLaunched in August of 2020, Project 10Million builds on Sprint\u2019s commitment to provide free internet access to one million underserved and disconnected high school students as well as T-Mobile\u2019s work to provide equal access to online learning to schools and their students.\n\nThrough partnerships with school districts, Project 10Million offers free wireless hotspots, free or heavily subsidized high-speed data, and access to affordable laptops and tablets to underserved student households.\n\nAnd this goal has never been more important. With the onset of COVID-19, an unprecedented 55 million students were learning remotely. Understanding the new urgency, we enhanced the program with additional low-cost data options for schools and increased monthly data plans to provide connectivity to their students for free.\n\nThroughout 2020, we connected more than 2.5 million students across the U.S.\n\nWe have also started working at the state and local levels to help further understand where the greatest need is and deliver connectivity to students. For example, in Texas, we partnered with Operation Connectivity to connect 171,000 students across the state. Operation Connectivity is a statewide initiative to deliver internet connectivity and devices to Texas school districts for online learning. Texas is home to some of the largest urban, and smallest rural, school districts in the country. This partnership allowed state agencies to help ensure all school districts in the state were evaluated and treated equally to identify the areas and students with the greatest need.\n\nAnother great example is in Los Angeles, CA where our partnership with the Angeleno Connectivity Trust (ACT) facilitated our ability to get wireless connectivity to students who needed it most. ACT is an initiative to help deliver internet access to vulnerable young people\u2014including students experiencing homelessness, those in foster care, and youth with disabilities. With ACT, Project 10Million is working to provide 100GB of free internet connectivity to 18,000 students for five years.\n\nSee the latest on Project 10Million\nBUILDING SKILLS FOR THE DIGITAL ECONOMY\n\nIn today\u2019s rapidly evolving economy, there is significant opportunity to equip and empower the current and future workforce through digital skills-building and job training programs that will unlock new employment opportunities. Through programs and partnerships, we\u2019re investing in upskilling the underemployed, directing resources to those who lack access, and accelerating career path progression through hands-on learning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important we create a sustainable career path for those who might previously have lacked access to these kinds of opportunities\u2014and show real results.\u201d\n\nCHI PAK\nDIRECTOR OF SUPPLIER DIVERSITY\n\nNEXTTECH DIVERSITY\n\nIn early 2021 we embarked on a five-year partnership with the Learning Alliance Corporation and other telecommunications partners to launch NextTech Diversity. Our aim is to provide career training and placement for thousands of underrepresented candidates to take on roles as 5G network technicians. Black technicians are particularly underrepresented, making up just 10% of the telecom network-infrastructure field. Our initial $750,000 seed funding supports 50 candidates through 2021, with 39 graduating\u201421 of whom are already employed\u2014with additional candidates set to graduate by December 2021. As graduated candidates are placed in jobs, we aim to annually double our impact through 2025 and hope to see the impact of investments like this for years to come and to encourage partnerships that further unlock skills-building and career opportunities across the telecommunications industry.\n\nWASHINGTON ALLIANCE FOR BETTER SCHOOLS\n\nFor years, T-Mobile has partnered with the Washington Alliance for Better Schools (WABS) to improve the way we prepare students for rewarding careers in tech. We have expanded our partnership to provide a two-year program that includes two paid internships and a 59-credit certificate to high school seniors. Since the cost and length of study for traditional STEM degrees often prevents students from lower income families from attending, this program works to reduce those barriers of entry by providing students with classroom learning aligned with employer standards and a postsecondary credential. Providing a pathway to tech jobs for the young people who need it most not only creates more equity and access for students interested in STEM careers, but it also supports our industry\u2019s ability to fill a growing number of tech jobs.\n\nMAGENTA EDGE\n\nIn early 2021, we launched Magenta Edge to help small businesses by providing resources and educational programming for entrepreneurs. It has a foundational focus on black-owned small businesses that have been disproportionately impacted during the COVID-19 crisis, exacerbating long-standing systemic lack of access to resources and capital. From marketing to tax, eight foundational themes are covered with free business development advice.\n\nAS PART OF MAGENTA EDGE, WE SPOTLIGHT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, LIKE JACKIE GRANCHAMPS, FOUNDER & CEO OF CECILE\u2019S BATH & BODY, TO SHOWCASE THEIR EXPERIENCES ALONG THE SMALL BUSINESS JOURNEY\n\nWatch video\n\nJackie Granchamps, Founder & CEO, Cecile\u2019s Bath & Body\nEMPOWERING TOMORROW\u2019S LEADERS\n\nNot only do we aim to conquer the digital divide by expanding access to wireless connectivity and investing in job training programs, but we are also inspiring and empowering the next generation of leaders, builders, and innovators.\n\nFrom scholarships and hands-on learning opportunities to mentoring young changemakers, we\u2019re making space for the next generation to dream big and find ways to use tech for social and environmental good.\n\nTHE CHANGEMAKER CHALLENGE\nDisruption and challenging the status quo are at the heart of the Un-carrier\u2019s ethos. With the Changemaker Challenge, T-Mobile and the T-Mobile Foundation in partnership with Ashoka, identify and empower young people with innovative ideas to build more connected, sustainable, and informed communities. Through an annual nationwide contest, we call on young people to submit their ideas for projects in three categories: Technology, the Environment, and Education. Finalists pitch their projects to our top executives, with a chance of winning seed funding and mentoring to supercharge their ideas. In 2020, we announced not one, but three winners.\n\nCHANGEMAKER CHALLENGE WINNERS\n\nAVA, a video game created by college student Vanessa Casta\u00f1eda Gill that helps neurodiverse youth apply social skills in a safe and accessible space.\n\nStories Untold U.S., a platform for those affected by gun violence founded by Carlitos Rodriguez, a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting in Parkland, FL.\n\nYouth Climate Action Coalition, a program to increase sustainability in schools co-founded by Kevin Malaekhe, Jake McCullough, and Jack Galloway.\n\nOPPORTUNITIES IN EDUCATION\nThrough our partnership with WABS, we\u2019re funding the After School STEM Academy as a hands-on experience for elementary and middle school students. In 2020, there were 71 sessions which involved more than 1,000 students, all facilitated by industry volunteers. We also sponsored an ACCESS STEM team, which has helped 44 teachers reach more than 5,000 students across King, Snohomish, and Pierce counties in Washington.\n\nIn 2021 we developed the Magenta Scholars program and committed to donating $500,000 to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund to create 18 scholarships for students attending historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Scholarship recipients will also have an opportunity to join the Un-carrier\u2019s signature summer internship program and receive mentorship and professional development. In addition to creating 18 scholarships, we committed to donating up to $500,000 to the Fund to contribute to gap scholarships that help students meet outstanding financial obligations in order to graduate. We hope to continue to drive opportunity and equity through scholarship and education and have joined Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Partnership Challenge to further our relationship and engagement with HBCUs and their students.\nINVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITIES\n\nOur relentless spirit doesn\u2019t stop when it comes to giving. And if this last year has taught us anything, it\u2019s that as a combined company, we\u2019re just getting started. We continue to look for even bigger and bolder ways to give back\u2014guided by our employees, our customers, and a big magenta heart.\n\nIn 2020, we gave nearly $100 million as a company and through the T-Mobile Foundation to communities across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. This represents more than $16 million in charitable donations and $83 million through in-kind product and service donations.\n\nEMPOWERING EMPLOYEES TO GIVE BACK\nT-Mobile employees are the heart of the Un-carrier culture, as well as our giving strategy. That\u2019s why we make sure they have the tools and resources they need to make a difference and invest in the causes they care most about. With a comprehensive matching program and volunteer grant program, our employees serve as champions for healthy, vibrant communities.\n\nThe T-Mobile Foundation Employee Matching Program supports the causes our employees care about most, matching donations to thousands of charities, dollar for dollar. And we don\u2019t stop there\u2014we donate $10 per volunteer hour that they complete, up to a combined $2,000 per calendar year. To get new employees going, the T-Mobile Foundation adds $25 to their own giving account to donate to a cause of their choice.\n\nOur Huddle Up Volunteer Grants Program also encourages T-Mobile employees to organize in small teams to support youth-focused non-profits through volunteer activities. Teams can apply to the T-Mobile Foundation for a $5,000 grant to support their youth education projects. In 2020, we awarded nearly $200,000 towards employee volunteer projects before we put the program on hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a year of significant change for our teams, we\u2019ve been humbled by the generosity of our employees who have together volunteered 48,000 hours. They also personally donated almost $4 million to charitable causes\u2014that\u2019s more than any other year!\n\nOn the heels of social unrest and racial injustice experienced in 2020, T-Mobile donated $1.25 million to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the National Action Network, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, and the National Urban League in 2020 and early 2021. Additionally, through employee giving and company support, we donated more than $550,000 to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\nCREATING MOVEMENTS THAT INSPIRE GIVING\n\nTogether with our employees and customers, we create change that really matters. Leveraging text-to-give and our wildly popular T-Mobile Tuesdays app, we\u2019ve rallied both our employees and our customers to raise millions for good causes over the years. During 2020, we supercharged our mobile giving power to support causes that needed some extra magenta love.\n\nResponding to the 60% rise in food insecurity across the U.S., we raised $1.5 million for Feeding America\u00ae through our #CaptureKindness campaign and T-Mobile Tuesdays. This is on top of another $500,000 raised through T-Mobile Tuesdays to help low-income workers and small business owners that were hit particularly hard by the pandemic. In total, we raised $2 million (the equivalent of 20 million meals)\u2014our biggest contribution to Feeding America\u00ae ever.\n\nFEEDING AMERICA\u00ae\n\nThanks to consumers texts and all the home runs hit during the MLB\u00ae Postseason, T-Mobile donated $2 million for the T-Mobile Little League Call Up Grant, a fund dedicated to helping thousands of children across America participate in their local Little League programs by helping families cover registration fees.\n\nLITTLE LEAGUE\u00ae CALL UP GRANTS\n\nAs an alternative to our traditional annual April Fool\u2019s Day tradition, T-Mobile instead asked everyone to #GiveThanksNotPranks which raised $300,000 to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America COVID-19 Relief Fund, which provided childcare support to first responders and healthcare workers, along with meals to families in need.\n\nBOYS & GIRLS CLUB COVID-19 RELIEF FUND\n\nAs part of #GivingTuesdayNow, we donated half a million medical masks to the CDC Foundation and nearly 40,000 phone chargers to hospitals nationwide. And, we offered customers and employees the opportunity to send a huge, collective THANK YOU to frontline workers through T-Mobile Tuesdays.\n\nCDC FOUNDATION\nPIVOTING SUPPORT DURING THE PANDEMIC\n\nFrom the onset of COVID-19, we quickly pivoted our community investments to meet the changing needs of our non-profit community partners as they navigated uncharted territory. Understanding that volunteering and resource needs would look different, we worked closely with our partners to repurpose available funds and resources to provide more targeted support where it mattered most given the circumstances. Through these efforts we aimed to provide critical support to youth and their families during this period of transition and uncertainty.\n\nAs schools and daycares adjusted to in-person operations during the early days of the pandemic, our local partners at the Boys & Girls Clubs of King County, WA, were working to address a new challenge: safely distributing much needed meals to their opened facilities that were providing emergency childcare for first responders. The Boys & Girls Clubs needed resources to quickly distribute the meals donated from numerous food relief organizations. Working together, T-Mobile repurposed our fleet of Magenta Express shuttle buses, normally used to transport employees across our Bellevue campus, to deliver over 23,000 meals and supplies to 24 local Clubs.\n\nAnother opportunity to quickly provide resources to support our local communities arose when we learned about a wireless connectivity need through Swedish Health Services in Seattle, WA in January 2021. The team at Swedish Health Services needed a reliable internet connection for their mobile unit to help register and track the vaccines they were administering to vulnerable communities\u2014this is where we were able to step in and provide access to connectivity.\nWHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING OUR PLANET WE WON\u2019T STOP\nA thriving society needs a thriving planet. From investing in renewable energy to reducing waste, we\u2019re working to do our part to preserve the environment and build a better world.\n\nBecoming a much bigger company in 2020 hasn\u2019t stalled our relentless pursuit of decarbonization. In fact, by joining forces with Sprint, we\u2019ve been able to scale up energy-smart technologies and make more investments in wind and solar. We are continually looking for innovative ways to boost energy efficiency and reduce energy usage across our entire business, including optimizing our transformational 5G network.\n\nMike Simpson\nSVP, Chief Procurement Officer\nACCELERATING CLIMATE ACTION\n\nTackling climate change and building a more sustainable future demands bold action from each of us. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve led the U.S. wireless industry when it comes to setting science-based targets and investing in renewable energy.\n\nIn true Un-carrier style, we\u2019re leveraging our larger size and scale to double down on our commitments to reduce our carbon footprint and to source 100% of our electricity from renewable energy by end of 2021.\n\nT-Mobile was the first in the industry to set two carbon reduction targets validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative, a global initiative and a leading standard for setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and prevent the worst effects of climate change. We also set an industry first by joining the RE100 pledge in 2018, committing to source renewable energy equivalent to 100% of our total electricity usage by the end of 2021. A few years and one historic merger later, we\u2019re still on track to meet these goals.\n\nWe\u2019re meeting our targets through a combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments. In turn, we\u2019re reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, and future-proofing network infrastructure from the threats of a warming world. We\u2019re proud to have been recognized for our leadership in environmental ambition and climate action in the CDP A List 2020, Green America\u2019s Wireless Scorecard, and the EPA Green Power Partnership.\n\nTARGET\nReduce combined absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 95% by 2025 from a 2016 base year\n\nPROGRESS\n23.4%\nCombined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions decreased by 22.2% since 2016\n\nTARGET\nReduce Scope 3 GHG emissions 15% per customer by 2025 from a 2016 base year\n\nPROGRESS\n97.0%\nScope 3 emissions intensity decreased by 14.5% per customer since 2016\n\nOUR 2020 EMISSIONS PROFILE\n\n8.95M metric tons (MT) CO\u2082e*\n\n7.3% reduction in year-over-year scope 1 and 2 emissions\n\nScope 1: 53,180 MT CO\u2082e\nScope 2: (location-based): 2,755,796 MT CO\u2082e\nScope 2: (market-based): 1,858,206 MT CO\u2082e\nScope 3: 7,033,821 MT CO\u2082e\n\nScope 1: Direct emissions generated from T-Mobile facilities including offices, retail stores, data centers, customer experience centers and network operations.\nScope 2: Indirect emissions from purchased electricity required to power all T-Mobile facilities.\nScope 3: Indirect emissions generated from upstream and downstream activities, including the products T-Mobile sells and the services it uses, including corporate travel.\n\n* CO\u2082e is a measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential (GWP). See the OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms\u2014Carbon dioxide equivalent Definition.\n\nCalculations are based on the GHG Protocol methodology and the EPA Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. Baseline year is 2016.\n\nAs a result of the T-Mobile and Sprint merger in April 2020, we have included legacy Sprint environmental data in our historical results back to 2016, aligning data with T-Mobile data standards.\nMAGENTA GOES GREEN WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nIn 2020, our post-merger network grew in size and scale\u2014and so did our total energy consumption. As a combined company, we got to work finding new energy efficiencies to complement our renewable energy efforts. In total, we\u2019ve signed contracts worth 3.5 million megawatt hours (MWh), and in 2020 alone, the renewable energy supplied by our wind and solar projects increased by 95% year-over-year.\n\nWe also saw three of our investments coming online: Otter Creek Wind Farm in LaSalle County, IL; Greensville Solar Farm in Greensville County, VA; and Myrtle Solar Farm in Suffolk, VA. This brings our total to nine Power Purchasing Agreements, one community choice aggregation, and several retail renewable agreements across the country, with commitments spanning from 12 to 20 years.\n\nGOAL\nSource 100% of our total electricity usage with renewable energy by the end of 2021\n\nPROGRESS\n25.3%\nAt the end of 2020\n\nACTIVE RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS\nAlthough there have been some delays in projects during this last unprecedented year, we\u2019re tracking to reach 100% by the end of 2021 as more projects come online throughout the year. In fact, we have sourced 75% of the electricity we\u2019ve consumed through June 30, 2021 with renewable energy.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY OUR STORY SO FAR\n\nT-Mobile\nSigns Red Dirt PPA\nSigns RE100 pledge\nSigns Solomon Forks PPA\n\n2018\n\nSprint\nSigns PPA for Maryneal Wind Farm\nSigns PPA with White Mesa Wind Farm\n\n2019\n\nRed Dirt Wind Farm is operational\nSigned Otter Creek, Greensville, Rockhound, and Myrtle PPAs\nSolomon Forks Wind Farm is operational\n\n2020\n\nOtter Creek, Greensville, and Myrtle are operational\n\n2021\n\nPhase 2 of Green Energy Direct program\nWhite Mesa and Maryneal are operational\n\nACHIEVE 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nDEC 31 2021\nENERGY-SMART INNOVATION\n\nAs the data flowing through our network continues to increase, we expect efficiencies in our 5G network to result in less energy consumption despite faster processing speeds. In 2020 we used a record low 377 MWh of energy per petabyte of data traffic on our network. This is partially thanks to heating and cooling innovations in our cell towers that are saving propane, diesel, and grid electricity, as well as optimizing use of our low-band network spectrum where possible.\n\nOur energy innovation experts are continually testing and evaluating new equipment for all of our facilities from our switch stations, to cell sites, retail stores, and customer experience centers. For example, we\u2019re upgrading mechanical and electrical systems in our data centers, optimizing air management to keep hardware cool, and systematically upgrading our buildings and offices with ENERGY STAR certified LED Lighting, which is at least 75% more efficient than incandescent lighting. The interior and exterior LED lighting retrofits and upgrades and new lighting controls implemented in 2020 will save an estimated 2,255 tons of CO\u2082e annually through an energy reduction of over 5.5 million kWh. We\u2019ve also completed lighting retrofits across a majority of our offices, 1,500 new corporate and dealer stores, and our headquarters.\n\nGOAL\n\nAchieve a 95% reduction in energy consumption (MWh) per petabyte (PB) of data traffic on T-Mobile\u2019s network by 2030 using a baseline of 2019.\n\nPROGRESS\n\nAchieved a 7.7% reduction in energy consumption (MWh) per petabyte (PB) of data traffic since 2019.\nMITIGATING CLIMATE RISK AND INVESTING IN NETWORK RESILIENCE\n\nAs the frequency and severity of extreme weather events linked to climate change increase, evaluating climate-related risks and investing in network resilience become increasingly critical to our business.\n\nOur Enterprise Continuity Program considers the full range of natural and man-made hazards that could impact our customers, our people, our operations, and our assets across the country when developing risk mitigation and business continuity strategies. We continue to invest in network and operational redundancy along with hardening and improving the resiliency of our infrastructure, critical network sites, and operations to ensure we are as prepared as possible to respond to natural disasters and keep our customers connected when it matters most.\n\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team partners with groups across the company to track progress on network resiliency, such as the effectiveness of power back-up systems in data centers and the network hardening efforts in at-risk areas. As part of the risk assessment process, our network sites are evaluated for vulnerabilities to environmental change. ERM also analyzes the negative financial implications of an unstable environment, regulatory ambiguity, reputational risk, and uncertain future energy costs and availability. We are continuing to build on these efforts by further utilizing frameworks such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework to evaluate potential climate-related risks.\n\nThe President of Technology oversees the company\u2019s network resilience strategy work, which includes evaluating climate-related impacts and developing risk mitigation plans. To ensure business-critical risks are overseen and communicated at the Board-level, the Senior Vice President of Internal Audit & Risk Management serves as the Chief Audit Executive and has a direct communication channel to the Audit Committee for purposes of reporting or discussing concerns. The Chief Audit Executive receives monthly status reports of the Enterprise Continuity Program as well as provides a quarterly enterprise-wide risk assessment to the Audit Committee and communicates to them any significant issues raised by the Enterprise Risk and Compliance Committee.\n\nFind out more about how we future-proof our network for extreme weather events\n\nFor more on how we govern and manage climate risk, download our 2021 CDP Climate Change Questionnaire\nMINIMIZING WASTE, MAXIMIZING IMPACT\n\nTo help prolong the life of our devices and facilitate recycling of e-waste, our customers can bring any make, model, or carrier phone, battery, accessory, tablet, or netbook into select T-Mobile U.S. stores to be recycled or upcycled for free. They can also trade in eligible devices and accessories for great deals on the latest technology. These trade ins are either reused or resold.\n\nIn 2020 we collected over 7.9 million devices for reuse, resale, and recycling, including phones, smartwatches, tablets, hotspots, and IoT items.\n\nNow, we\u2019re partnering with suppliers, non-profits, and employees to do more to keep as much waste out of landfills as possible. In coordination with the CTIA\u2014The Wireless Association, we\u2019ve worked alongside industry specialists to develop sustainable packaging guidelines and help minimize the impact and footprint of phone packaging. While packaging protects our products, it also produces waste.\n\nWe\u2019ve already begun to see the results of this work for our postpaid phones:\n\n\u2014 Eliminated plastic inserts or trays within product containers\n\u2014 Ensured labelling on packaging includes internationally recognized symbols to encourage recycling\n\u2014 Reduced the use of volatile organic compounds, both on and within packaging, to less than 10%\n\nAdditionally, we work to reduce waste across our operations. So far, we\u2019ve reduced paper receipts, direct mail advertising, and customer bills, while still maintaining the same level of access and communication with our customers. We\u2019ve also downsized on printers, encourage composting, recycling, and using refillable water stations in our buildings, and eliminated paper cup use from many of our customer care centers. We\u2019re always looking for ways to deliver an even bigger impact, which is why we\u2019re a part of the Department of Energy\u2019s Better Buildings Waste Pilot, which allows us to share best approaches to operational waste diversion, reporting, and employee engagement across industries.\n\nFROM TRASH TO TREASURE\n\nDid you know that for every 1 million devices recycled, more than 36,000 lbs of precious metals can be recovered (copper, silver, gold, and palladium)?\n\n7.9M devices collected for reuse, resale, and recycle\nDOING IT THE RIGHT WAY ALWAYS\nWe\u2019re proud of the trust that customers, communities, and business partners place in us. But we never take it for granted. We do the right thing, every time. No matter how quickly or how boldly we move\u2014there is only one way to deliver\u2014and that\u2019s by doing things the right way\u2014through ethical conduct and socially and environmentally responsible business practices.\n\nWinning is important, but how we get there matters! It\u2019s critical that we conduct business with uncompromised ethics. Our success relies on the trust of our customers, suppliers, business partners, and one another\u2014each and every day.\n\nMike Sievert\nCEO\nETHICAL CONDUCT\n\nOur Code of Business Conduct provides clear expectations on how we do it the right way at T-Mobile. The Code is a snapshot of the workplace conduct standards and legal guidelines we follow as part of our commitment to ethical business practices.\n\nAll officers and employees receive ongoing training on company values and important Code topics\u2014such as Data Privacy, Anti-Corruption, Health and Safety, Harassment and Discrimination, and our non-Retaliation policy\u2014to help ensure everyone understands our Code of Business Conduct standards and T-Mobile\u2019s commitment to doing business ethically. Additional ethical conduct policies are included in our company governance documents.\n\nWe\u2019re fair and honest in our business dealings. We don\u2019t try to gain an unfair advantage over competitors, suppliers or customers by deceiving anyone, taking advantage of confidential information, or fudging on the facts. Our Code of Business Conduct includes complying with U.S. and foreign laws barring corruption and bribery. It also emphasizes that we should compete fairly, and not conspire with our competitors to rig prices, fix bids, divvy up sales territory, or boycott particular suppliers or customers. We also follow all laws and regulations that apply to our business, including those that may not be specifically mentioned in our Code.\n\nDOING RIGHT BY OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nDuring the eight years of Un-carrier moves, we\u2019ve ended long service contracts, overages and domestic roaming fees, improving value for money, and revolutionizing customer care, bringing fun to the wireless industry. We treat customers honestly and fairly. That doesn\u2019t mean over-selling. It means giving customers honest, complete, and transparent information about our great products and services. It means delivering what we promise. And we never charge customers for things they haven\u2019t authorized. Additionally, T-Mobile abides by the practices outlined in CTIA\u2019s Consumer Code for Wireless Service. By marketing and selling responsibly, our customers can avoid potential bill shocks and confusing account balance information.\n\nIn the Code, and through our Speak Up Policy, we encourage anyone to report a concern. They can do so through our third-party Integrity Line (online or by phone), by emailing our Compliance & Ethics team or by contacting our Chief Compliance Officer or the Chair of the Audit Committee directly. Our Speak Up Policy outlines how people are protected from retaliation whenever they raise or report suspected misconduct or a potential violation of the law.\n\nSTANDING UP FOR DEMOCRACY IN THE 2020 ELECTION\n\nIn 2020, we partnered with Vote.org, a nonpartisan civic engagement organization, to make it easy for ALL of us at #TeamMagenta to register to vote\u2014one of the most fundamental ways we can contribute to our communities. We also provided up to four hours of paid time off for employees to vote on Election Day. We welcome our right to participate in the political process as responsible corporate citizens.\n\nThe Code and our employee Political Activities & Lobbying Policy provide guidance on lobbying, and emphasize that only authorized employees of T-Mobile are allowed to lobby government officials and employees on behalf of T-Mobile. To ensure compliance with election laws, employees are expected to conduct personal political activities in their own name, on their own time, and with their own resources. Our EVP, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary provides periodic reports to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on the company\u2019s political spending and related policies.\n\nForbes and Just Capital\u2019s 100 Most JUST Companies\n\nIn 2020, we partnered with Vote.org, a nonpartisan civic engagement organization, to make it easy for ALL of us at #TeamMagenta to register to vote\u2014one of the most fundamental ways we can contribute to our communities.

Our EVP, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary provides periodic reports to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on the company\u2019s political spending and related policies.\nRESPONSIBLE SOURCING\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct outlines expectations around ethical business practices for all T-Mobile suppliers. Even before suppliers are selected, a Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) process screens for anti-corruption, global sanctions, human rights, and environmental risks.\n\nThe screening outcomes enable us to assess the information, before confirming contracts. The supplier risk assessments are performed on an ongoing basis, depending on the risk profile of the supplier. Our TPRM process also continuously monitors current suppliers for policy violations and risks through automated, real-time workflows which look for any adverse news or changes in the supplier risk profile related to corporate social responsibility.\n\nIn 2020, we also began a partnership with EcoVadis to deepen the visibility of any social and sustainability issues in our supply chain. Approximately 30% of our suppliers, by sourceable spend, have participated in a comprehensive risk and performance assessment through the end of the year.\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing Guidelines recognize that certain materials, particularly those derived from natural resources, can pose severe risks associated with human rights and the environment based on their extraction, transportation, and trade. We therefore expect our suppliers to exercise additional due diligence on the source and custody of these materials and operate in a manner that:\n\n\u2014 Aligns with our commitment to human rights, equal opportunity, fair labor standards, and a safe and healthy workplace;\n\u2014 Includes participation in multi-stakeholder initiatives towards responsible sourcing; and\n\u2014 Protects the environment.\n\nRead our Human Rights Statement\nRead our Environmental Policy\nRead our Responsible Sourcing\n\nA DIVERSE SUPPLY CHAIN IS A RESILIENT SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nOur suppliers are an important extension of our business, as well as our values. Through our Supplier Diversity program, we\u2019re on a mission to create fair and equitable opportunities for veteran or service-disabled veteran-owned, disability-owned, woman-owned, minority-owned, LGBT-owned, and small and disadvantaged businesses as direct and indirect suppliers. In 2020, we spent $3 billion with diverse business partners like these.\n\nWe\u2019re on the path to join other responsible corporations on the Billion Dollar Roundtable for supply chain diversity excellence by 2025. By investing in this area, we not only support our Equity In Action plans, but we also strengthen our customer relationships, and support the economic viability of our local communities.\n\nRead about our NextTech Diversity Program for 5G network technician training\n\nDana, President & CEO of Picore International\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DANA\u2019S JOURNEY\nWatch video\nOur customers expect transparency, control, and simplicity when it comes to how we use and protect their information.\n\nThis means cutting through the complexity to make it easy for them to learn about what information we collect and how we use and protect it. We strive to help customers feel empowered to make choices about their data because it shouldn\u2019t take that much work to understand how companies use it.\n\nEarly in 2021, we launched an updated Privacy Center with the goal of giving customers a clear and simple explanation of how their data is being used and how they can manage it. Here, customers will find our privacy notice and additional information on our privacy and security practices. They\u2019ll also find content with best practices and how-to\u2019s on ways they can protect themselves and their data.\n\nInternally, we work to weave a culture of privacy and security throughout the business by engaging our Security and Privacy Ambassador Network (SPAN), which acts as an extension of our Privacy Office. The members of SPAN are embedded across the company and equipped with enhanced privacy knowledge to raise awareness, oversee adoption of privacy and security practices, and proactively elevate important matters to the Privacy Office.\n\nAs Chief Privacy Officer for T-Mobile, my goal is to ensure transparency, simplicity, and choice for our customers. T-Mobile\u2019s Privacy Center does just that, giving you a clear view of how we use data, and providing simple tools you can use to protect your own privacy.\n\nKELSEY JOYCE\nCHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER\n\nIt\u2019s important to us that customers know that we are committed to continued investment and efforts in this area. We\u2019re also committed to responsible data use and adhere to best practices\u2014for example, those outlined by the CTIA Consumer Code of Conduct.\n\nIn addition to the choices we offer around data usage, we also give customers the ability to manage their family\u2019s online activities. Depending on the device brand and account type, we offer a variety of features and apps to do so, such as restricting adult content from being accessed when connected to a cellular network.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking out for our customers when it comes to scammers. As the first U.S. wireless provider to implement number verification in 2019, we also led the industry in 2020 in implementing STIR/SHAKEN with all major U.S. network providers to fight number spoofing and further protect customers from scammers and unwanted robocalls.\n\nAs Chief Privacy Officer for T-Mobile, my goal is to ensure transparency, simplicity, and choice for our customers. T-Mobile\u2019s Privacy Center does just that, giving you a clear view of how we use data, and providing simple tools you can use to protect your own privacy.\n\nKELSEY JOYCE\nCHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER\n\nWe use some information, like age and apps installed on a customer\u2019s device, for advertising purposes. All of this information is attributed to Advertising IDs, which are pooled to create audience segments based on customer interests, like sports or entertainment. When we share data, we share the audience segment. We do not share underlying customer broadband or device usage data with third parties for advertising purposes.\n\nWe also do not share information for advertising purposes that directly identifies customers, like name, address, email, or precise location information. This enables the delivery of offers and ads for products and services based on customer interests. As always, our goal is to deliver the best experience to our customers. Customers can opt out at any time, but they might prefer the more relevant advertising this data use offers.\n\nT-Mobile customers can make selections on the data usage for these types of advertising purposes at any time through their My T-Mobile account. To learn more about customer choices and the number of customers who choose to opt out of this type of data use, please visit our Privacy Notice.\nOVERSIGHT AND CONTROLS\nWe\u2019re always working to protect our customers and to help keep their data secure with strong oversight and governance controls, as well as technical and physical safeguards. The reality of data security is that bad actors are constantly testing our systems. Our data security program incorporates core functions from the widely recognized National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and is constantly evolving to address new threats as they arise, including enhancing existing safeguards. While we have processes to identify and protect our systems, detect and respond to threats, and recover if attacks are successful, no system of safeguards will win every time and we\u2019re committed to addressing every aspect of data security. We will not rest on this issue, and we take this responsibility very seriously.\n\nFraud also continues to be an industry-wide problem that T-Mobile is constantly working to deter and address on behalf of our customers. We offer customers a variety of safeguards against these criminal attacks, including PINs, to help them protect their personal information. Our award-winning support teams work with customers directly to address concerns about potential fraud or to discuss security measures available to them. We maintain security incident response plans to investigate and remediate incidents involving unauthorized access to personal data, and we are constantly evolving our safeguards to respond to new risks and we recognize that we have more work to do here.\n\nOur Information Security and Privacy Council, comprised of senior leaders from across the business, oversees T-Mobile\u2019s privacy and security programs, and our Enterprise Risk and Compliance Committee is responsible for T-Mobile\u2019s risk management and compliance activities. Our Board of Directors maintains oversight in each of these areas via periodic updates to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board. Our Audit Committee also receives updates as appropriate.\n\nTALKING SCAMSHIELD\u2122\n\nDelan Beah, our Senior Vice President of Core Network and Services Engineering, and her team are always working to stay a step ahead of the scammers. Here we talk about our latest defense technology, ScamShield\u2122, which as of early 2021 has helped protect over 80 million customers from more than 33 billion suspect calls\u2014and counting.\n\nHow does our fraud/robocall protection differ from the competitors?\n\nUnlike a third-party app, or other passive monitoring solutions, ScamShield sits inside our network, leveraging the power of the entire network to keep our customers protected. That means protection around the clock and using advanced technology like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, data analytics, and T-Mobile patented technologies to identify scam calls. So even as scammers change tactics, our network defenses are updated every six minutes to provide the best scam protection in the industry.\n\nWhat makes ScamShield so important, and why now?\n\nIn 2019, Americans got more than 58 billion robocalls. That\u2019s 1,855 robocalls EVERY SECOND. And while it dropped during the pandemic, it is now on track to return to those levels or worse this year. Scammers saw COVID-19 as an opportunity to take advantage of people when they were most vulnerable.\n\nFraud also continues to be an industry-wide problem that T-Mobile is constantly working to deter and address on behalf of our customers. We offer customers a variety of safeguards against these criminal attacks, including PINs, to help them protect their personal information.

Our Audit Committee also receives updates as appropriate.\nGOOD GOVERNANCE\n\nDoing it the right way takes good leadership. Two important bodies of T-Mobile\u2019s governance and management structure are our Board of Directors and our Senior Leadership Team.\n\nOur Board of Directors is made up of dynamic and experienced leaders from across industries who provide counsel and direction to ensure our long-term success. The composition of the Board has continued to evolve since the end of 2020 with new additions. As of July 2021, our Board of Directors consisted of 14 members, seven of whom identify as a woman and/or racially or ethnically diverse.\n\nWe understand that diversity, inclusive of gender, race and experience, is a critical attribute of a well-functioning Board of Directors and a measure of sound corporate governance. Our director selection guidelines define diversity broadly to include not just factors such as gender and race, but also factors such as age, ethnicity, geographic, cultural, and professional diversity.\n\nIn addition to our Board of Directors, we have an experienced Senior Leadership Team that is comprised of 16 executives, seven of whom identify as a woman or racially or ethnically diverse.\n\nLearn more about our executives and directors\n\nETHICAL CONDUCT AND ESG OVERSIGHT\n\nOur Board of Directors adopted our Code of Business Conduct as well as our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which is applicable to our CEO, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Treasurer, and Controller. The Board of Directors is supported by the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. To ensure oversight of critical environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, risks and progress on initiatives, T-Mobile executives report updates to the Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nThe Audit Committee receives quarterly enterprise-wide risk assessment reporting, which includes risks relating to cybersecurity and privacy, business continuity, annual fraud risk assessment, and SOX and Internal Audit reporting or assessments from management and our internal audit lead. The Audit Committee is also apprised on any significant issues identified as a result of our Enterprise Risk and Compliance assessments.\n\nAdditionally, members of our senior leadership team and management report quarterly to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on key ESG issues and progress updates.\n\nRead our Corporate Governance documents\n\nRead our Annual Report\n\nMEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM\n\nBOARD DIVERSITY\n\n4 identify as women\n4 identify as racially or ethnically diverse\n\nSENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM DIVERSITY\n\n4 identify as women\n3 identify as racially or ethnically diverse\nTo ensure we have our finger on the pulse when it comes to the evolving environmental, social, and governance landscape, in early 2021 we commissioned a third-party materiality assessment to identify and prioritize the most significant ESG issues to our business and to our stakeholders. The results are shown in the matrix to the right, which shows the most material topics to be:\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL**\n- Greenhouse gas emissions and climate change\n- Waste and recycling\n- Natural resource management\n- Energy management\n- Product lifecycle management\n\n**SOCIAL**\n- Health, wellness and society\n- Digital equity\n- Employee diversity (equity and inclusion)\n- Employee attraction, development, and engagement\n- Responsible use of products and services\n- Philanthropy and community engagement\n\n**GOVERNANCE**\n- Digital security and privacy\n- Ethical business practices\n- Human rights\n- Open internet and competitive behavior\n- Business continuity and network resilience\n- Sustainable and responsible supply chain\n- Responsible marketing\n- Corporate governance\n- Economic contribution\n- Partnerships and collaboration\n\nIn total, thousands of employees and customers were asked to rate specific ESG issues on two dimensions: the importance for T-Mobile to manage, and how well the topic is currently being addressed by T-Mobile. They were also asked to rank the three most critical issues for T-Mobile to address.\n\nThis exercise was supported by in-depth interviews with internal and external stakeholders, including investors, suppliers, community partners, and advocacy organizations.\n\nSee our complete list of material ESG topics and definitions.\n\nThe topics discussed in this report should not be considered a characterization regarding the materiality or financial impact of information disclosed on such topics. Please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and other publicly filed documents available at https://investor.t-mobile.com.\nWith the world\u2019s first nationwide standalone 5G network, we will unleash opportunities for the next generation of innovators and America\u2019s economy.\n\nThis is where future transformative technologies are made possible that boost healthy living, improve education, enable work-anywhere arrangements, and promote long-term sustainability.\n\nWe\u2019re fueling 5G innovation and building the 5G ecosystem with a number of initiatives and collaborations with universities and standards bodies. We also operate the award-winning T-Mobile Accelerator, the T-Mobile Ventures investment fund, and we\u2019re co-founder of the 5G Open Innovation Lab.\n\n\u2014 T-Mobile Accelerator serves as a hub for driving ideas, innovation and action. Since its inception, it has supported 75 start-ups that have raised an aggregate of nearly $100 million since participating in the program. Today, 80% of alumni companies are still in business. We will continue to work with our External Diversity and Inclusion Council, and the California Sub-Council (among other third parties), to identify diverse candidates to apply for the program.\n\n\u2014 T-Mobile Ventures is a multi-year investment fund focused on early and emerging growth companies developing groundbreaking 5G products and services for the T-Mobile network.\n\n\u2014 The 5G Open Innovation Lab is a global applied innovation ecosystem for corporations, academia, and government institutions. The Lab was co-founded by T-Mobile and includes founding and corporate partners such as Amdocs, Dell Technologies, FS, Intel, Microsoft, NASA, and VMware.\n\nStart-ups from the T-Mobile Accelerator, as well as participants from T-Mobile Ventures and 5G Open Innovation Lab, work directly with technology and business leaders at T-Mobile as they build, test, and bring to market new products and services that unleash the potential of T-Mobile 5G.\n\nEXAMPLE: REVOLUTIONIZING THE FUTURE OF FARMING\n\n5G can help power smarter wireless solutions that protect the environment by cutting emissions and reducing reliance on natural resources.\n\nTake farming. It\u2019s one of the most important jobs on our planet, and it\u2019s an industry with massive potential for generating and using raw data. Yet few industries have been as limited by data connectivity. With 5G, that is changing. Farmers will be able to produce more food using fewer resources. Less water, less fertilizer, less pesticide. Together with Snohomish County, the 5G Open Innovation Lab, and our partners, we\u2019ve created a state-of-the-art agriculture technology field lab at two farms in rural Washington. It\u2019s called the Food Resiliency Project and funded by the CARES Act, with the goal to bring together farmers, distributors, and technology companies to transform the agriculture industry and improve food resiliency.\n\nSensors combined with artificial intelligence can create predictive models that dramatically reduce risk and increase efficiency for farms of all sizes. Systems that monitor crops and soil conditions can provide farmers with real-time data to quickly adjust their operations, better deploy resources, and even run farming tasks remotely. We can\u2019t wait to see the 5G innovation that occurs as we work with the developers and entrepreneurs building the next big thing in agritech.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis report contains certain forward-looking statements based on T-Mobile management\u2019s current assumptions and expectations, including statements regarding our ESG targets, goals, commitments and programs and other business plans, initiatives and objectives.

Our Procurement and Supply organization spends billions of dollars on products, goods, and services annually, procuring everything our company needs to run our business, from hardware and network equipment to software, spectrum assets, and transportation. Engaging with small, medium, and large suppliers across the globe, we work to provide access and opportunities for all our suppliers and grow a robust supply chain that reflects our diversity and values. We are a company committed to conducting our business in a socially, environmental, and economically responsible manner. This commitment extends to our supply chain partners and the goods and services they provide. Our Supplier Code of Conduct and Responsible Sourcing Guidelines outline the policies and guidelines that govern our supply chain partnerships and sustainability performance is a contributing factor to how we award contracts. In 2020, we began working with EcoVadis to better evaluate our supply chain across four key areas: environmental, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement. We've received assessments from suppliers representing approximately 30% of sourceable spend. |\n| 102-10     | Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain | T-Mobile 2020 Form 10-K Part I page 5; Part II pages 30\u201332 |\n| 102-11     | Precautionary Principle or approach | T-Mobile 2020 Form 10-K Part III page 127 |\n|            |                  | 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report: Doing It the Right Way.

Our reporting for water consumption includes domestic water used in our buildings (data centers, call centers, offices, retail stores, switches, warehouse), some cell sites with irrigation, as well as domestic wastewater. We do not include water use for buildings where the water utility is not included in the leasing contracts. |\n| 103-2 | The management approach and its components | We strive to conserve water across our operations as outlined in our Environmental Policy and are continuously working to improve practices to underscore our commitment to environmental stewardship. We evaluate our buildings and embed sustainable design practices into updates when possible. We also seek to educate our employees on ways to reduce water usage at our buildings. As part of the Science Based Target Network (SBTN) Corporate Engagement Program, T-Mobile collaborates with other organizations on developing methods and tools to set science-based targets for nature, which includes water use targets. |\n| 103-3 | Evaluation of the management approach | The T-Mobile Sustainability Steering Committee is a cross-functional group led by our VP of Corporate Responsibility that oversees and sets the overall T-Mobile corporate sustainability strategy. The Committee evaluates and reviews progress and impact of the company's sustainability initiatives and goals. |\n| 303-1 | Interactions with water as a shared resource (management approach disclosures) | T-Mobile employee occupied buildings across the United States, interacting with domestic water use (includes data centers, call centers, offices, stores, switches, warehouses), and some cell sites with irrigation through our direct operations. Water withdrawal and discharge occurs through the different municipal systems in the United States. As outlined by our Responsible Sourcing Guidelines, we show a preference for working with suppliers who demonstrate adherence to industry best practices in areas such as water use. |\n| 303-2 | Management of water discharge-related impacts (management approach disclosures) | We manage our domestic waste water released through the sewage system of our buildings according to each municipal water treatment system standards. We therefore follow all local municipal waste water treatment protocols for domestic water discharge from our facilities. |\n| 303-5 | Water consumption | In 2020, T-Mobile used 1,086,662 cubic meters (m\u00b3) of water. This includes the municipal water withdrawal that we are directly billed for in our buildings (data centers, call centers, offices, retail stores, switches, warehouse), and some cell sites with irrigation. |\n| Disclosure# | Disclosure Topic                                      | 2020 Response                                                                 |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 103-1      | Explanation of the material topic and its Boundaries | Environmental Policy  \n2021 CDP Climate Change Questionnaire  \n2020 Corporate Responsibility Report: When It Comes to Protecting Our Planet, We Won't Stop. > Accelerating Climate Action > page 39 |\n| 103-2      | The management approach and its components           | Environmental Policy  \n2021 CDP Climate Change Questionnaire  \n2020 Corporate Responsibility Report: When It Comes to Protecting Our Planet, We Won't Stop. > Accelerating Climate Action > page 39 |\n| 103-3      | Evaluation of the management approach                | Environmental Policy  \n2021 CDP Climate Change Questionnaire  \n2020 Corporate Responsibility Report: When It Comes to Protecting Our Planet, We Won't Stop. > Accelerating Climate Action > page 39 |\n| Disclosure# | Disclosure Topic | 2020 Response |\n|------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| 305-1      | Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions | Gross direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions in metric tons of CO\u2082 equivalent: 53,180 MT CO\u2082e  \nGases included in the calculation: CO\u2082, CH\u2084, N\u2082O, HFCs  \nBiogenic CO\u2082 emissions in metric tons of CO\u2082 equivalent: 0 MT CO\u2082e  \nBase year for the calculation: 2016  \n\u2014 The rationale for choosing it: 2016 was the first year of available data for all direct emissions sources across the T-Mobile and Sprint portfolios.  \n\u2014 Emissions in the base year: 61,266 MT CO\u2082e  \n\u2014 The context for any significant changes in emissions that triggered recalculations of base year emissions: The 2016 emissions figures for T-Mobile and Sprint were combined to ensure consistency when comparing base year emissions to current and future reporting periods.  \nSource of the emission factors and the global warming potential (GWP) rates used, or a reference to the GWP source: Publicly available emission factors and global warming potential values from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are used to convert from the native unit of measure (gallons, mmBTU, or MWh) to MT CO\u2082e.  \nEmission factors:  \n\u2014 U.S. EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership: \u201cEmission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories\u201d, (2020)  \n100-year Global Warming Potential values:  \n\u2014 IPCC: \u201cFifth Assessment Report (AR5)\u201d, (2014)  \nConsolidation approach for emissions: Operational control  \nStandards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used: Scope 1 emissions data is collected, calculated, and reported in accordance with the GHG Protocol and T-Mobile\u2019s standard procedures and guidelines for sustainability reporting.
