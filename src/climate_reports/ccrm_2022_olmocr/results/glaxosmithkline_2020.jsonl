They contribute to many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and as a science-led, global healthcare company, our biggest contribution is towards Goal 3: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\n\nAbout our reporting\nThis document provides a comprehensive summary of environmental, social and governance (ESG) data from across our business.

However, December 2020 values include estimates based on December 2019 values as actual data is not available in time for publication. Data was restated for 2019 to correct for December estimates during that reporting period.  \nOur baseline year for environmental targets is 2016.  \nEnvironmental data for the sites that joined the GSK network as part of the GSK-Pfizer consumer healthcare JV is integrated with GSK data. |\n| **Energy**                 | This includes all purchased energy such as grid electricity, natural gas, coal, diesel and other fuels and renewably generated energy such as from solar, wind or biomass.  \nPurchased renewable electricity is renewable electricity generated by a supplier that is purchased under a supply agreement that includes evidence of origin such as REC, REGOs or as part of a Power Purchase Agreement PPA. | Energy data is based on invoice data from utility companies and meter readings.  \nPurchased renewable electricity is allocated to a site once evidence of a supply contract is in place. Retirements of Certificates of Origin may occur after the reporting period. |\n| **Water**                  | This includes all water supplied or withdrawn by GSK.  \nCaptured rainwater and recycled water are measured and reported but not included in the \u2018total water used\u2019 calculation. | Water data is based on invoice data from suppliers and meter readings at our sites. |\n| **High Water Risk**        | This includes all water supplied to sites identified by GSK as a high water risk site.  \nGSK originally identified 13 high risk water sites, but due to network changes, there are currently seven high risk water sites in our network:  \nCape Town, South Africa  \nBoudouaou, Algeria  \nJamshoro, Pakistan  \nKarachi F268, Pakistan  \nKarachi West Wharf, Pakistan  \nNashik, India  \nOak Hill, USA  \nGSK mapped the geographic location of its sites against outputs from the assessment tools WRI Aqueduct and WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter to identify sites in regions of high-water stress.  \nA more detailed water stewardship risk assessment covering local water availability, water quality, the local regulatory framework and access to water and sanitation was then performed to classify whether a site is determined to be a GSK high water risk site.  \nFollowing a review in 2020, the site in Xochimilco, Mexico was removed and the site in Jamshoro, Pakistan was added to the list of high water risk sites. The data from 2016 has been restated to reflect this change.  \nGSK have not yet completed water stewardship risk assessments for the sites that joined the network as part of the Pfizer consumer healthcare JV. | |\n| **Waste water**            | This includes all wastewater sent to a municipal sewer, discharged to surface water after treatment on site, waste water used for irrigation, wastewater used to recharge aquifers in accordance with local regulations.  \nLiquid waste such as waste solvents that contain water are reported separately as wastes. | Wastewater data is based on invoice data from utility companies, meter readings, or a calculation based on water use in the absence of a meter. |\n## Environmental Data Terminology continued\n\n| KPI                        | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Method                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Scope 1 Carbon emissions** | GSK Scope 1 emissions cover emissions from the direct combustion of fuels on our sites to generate heat and electricity; emissions from our sales force vehicles; fugitive losses of propellant during the manufacturing of inhalers, losses from refrigerants used in GSK owned ancillary equipment and from on-site waste and waste water treatment. | Carbon emissions are calculated as CO2 equivalent per the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Carbon emission factors and calorific factors for the combustion of natural gas, diesel, coal and other fuels are taken from the UK Government emission conversion factors for greenhouse gas company reporting 2019 edition. Carbon emissions for sales force travel are calculated based on distance travelled, not directly on fuel use and have added an estimate (approx. 10%) for offices where distance driven data is not available. Carbon emissions from refrigerant losses are based on the quantities of refrigerant used to top up equipment. Biogenic emissions are reported separately but not included in the Scope 1 & 2 total emissions. |\n| **Scope 2 Carbon emissions** | GSK Scope 2 emissions include any purchased electricity, steam, compressed air and chilled water.                                                                                                                                                                   | Carbon emission factors for purchased electricity are taken from the International Energy Agency Statistics \u2013 CO2 from Fuel Combustion 2019 edition. GSK use market-based scope 2 emissions for reporting purposes. Carbon emission factors for purchased heat, steam and chilled water are taken from the UK Government emission conversion factors for greenhouse gas company reporting 2019 edition. GSK are restating scope 2 emissions from electricity for 2018 and 2019 based on the updated IEA emission factors published in 2019. GSK report market-based Scope 2 emissions for facilities where there is evidence from the utility provider of low carbon energy generation such as certificates of origin (REC, REGO, PPA) or hydroelectric local grid supply e.g. in the Quebec Region. |\n| **Scope 3 Carbon emissions** | GSK report all 15 Scope 3 categories as detailed in the Greenhouse Gas protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Scope 3 data across all 15 categories were prepared by GSK using a hybrid model combining primary activity-based data where available, and economic data. The model was quality assured by the Carbon Trust. Scope 3 emissions for business travel by air are based on ticketing information not directly on fuel use. Scope 3 emissions from patient use of metered dose inhalers are based on the numbers of inhalers leaving manufacturing sites for distribution, and the amount of propellant in each inhaler. |\n## Environmental Data Terminology continued\n\n| KPI                                      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Method                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Waste**                                | \u2018Waste generated\u2019 is the operational waste that leaves GSK boundaries. \u2018Beneficial use\u2019 waste is defined as waste sent for recycling, re-use, or incineration with energy recovery. \u2018Non-beneficial use\u2019 waste is defined as waste disposed by either incineration with no energy recovery or sent to landfill. | Waste data is based on invoices and waste transfer note data.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| **Waste to Landfill**                    | Waste to landfill includes both hazardous and non-hazardous waste that is disposed in landfill                                                                                                               | Waste to landfill data is based on invoices and waste transfer note data. In some cases, local laws and regulations require certain waste be sent to landfill. For some types of waste (e.g. asbestos waste) landfill is the best environmental option. We include these wastes as waste sent to landfill in our data table, but we also allow the small number of sites affected to claim \u2018zero to landfill\u2019 status. |\n| **Ozone depleting substances contained in equipment** | We report the ozone depleting potential for the total amount of ozone depleting substances contained in ancillary equipment as kg CFC-11 equivalents.                                                      | The total amount of ozone depleting substances is based on site inventory data multiplied by the ozone depleting potential factors from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We estimate the impact of fugitive losses for these refrigerants. We are excluding the inventory from a small number of sites where GSK do not own or manage the refrigeration equipment |\n| **GSK reportable incident**              | A GSK reportable injury or illness meets the following criteria: 1. The affected individual is either a GSK employee or a complementary worker under direct GSK daily supervision; and 2. The incident is work related; and 3. The outcome has involved at least one of the following: \u2013 A fatality; \u2013 Loss of consciousness; \u2013 Medical treatment beyond first aid; \u2013 A significant occupational injury or occupational illness diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional; \u2013 Restricted days/change of job duties/days away from work; and 4. Must be a new case | To be consistent in our global reporting, a GSK reportable injury or illness meets these listed criteria. These criteria are different from national regulatory reporting requirements which vary across the world. A lost time incident is one that has resulted in either days away from work or a job restriction when the employee is unable to perform one or more routine activities. Lost or restricted days are counted from the day following the incident. Hours worked is calculated based on the number of working days in a year, the length of an average workday, and the number of employees by site as provided by GSK Human Resources. Employees include full time employees and directly supervised agency staff. GSK are restating incident data for 2019 to account for a small number of incidents that occurred in 2019 but the records were not complete when the table was prepared last year. Incident rates are calculated per 100,000 hours worked. |\n## List of products on the WHO List of Prequalified Medicinal Products and Vaccines as part of its Prequalification of Medicines Programme (PQP)\n\n| Vaccines | Type, form and presentation | Date of prequalification |\n|----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Engerix** | Hepatitis B \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (1 dose) | Thursday, 1 January 1987 |\n| **Engerix** | Hepatitis B \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (10 doses) | Thursday, 1 January 1987 |\n| **Engerix** | Hepatitis B \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (20 doses) | Thursday, 1 January 1987 |\n| **Priorix** | Measles, Mumps and Rubella \u2013 Lyophilised active component to be reconstituted with excipient diluent before use vial (1 dose) | Friday, 9 March 2001 |\n| **Rotarix** | Rotavirus \u2013 Liquid: ready to use plastic tube (1 dose) | Thursday, 12 March 2009 |\n| **Rotarix** | Rotavirus \u2013 Liquid: ready to use applicator (1 dose) | Thursday, 12 March 2009 |\n| **Cervarix** | Human Papillomavirus (Bivalent) \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (1 dose) | Wednesday, 8 July 2009 |\n| **Cervarix** | Human Papillomavirus (Bivalent) \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (2 dose) | Wednesday, 8 July 2009 |\n| **Polio Sabin Mono T1** | Polio Vaccine \u2013 Oral (OPV) Monovalent Type 1 \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (10 dose) | Thursday, 29 October 2009 |\n| **Polio Sabin Mono T1** | Polio Vaccine \u2013 Oral (OPV) Monovalent Type 1 \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (20 dose) | Thursday, 29 October 2009 |\n| **Polio Sabin One and Three** | Polio Vaccine \u2013 Oral (OPV) Bivalent Types 1 and 3 \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (10 doses) | Thursday, 29 October 2009 |\n| **Polio Sabin One and Three** | Polio Vaccine \u2013 Oral (OPV) Bivalent Types 1 and 3 \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (20 doses) | Thursday, 29 October 2009 |\n| **Synflorix** | Pneumococcal (conjugate) \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (1 dose) | Friday, 30 October 2009 |\n| **Synflorix** | Pneumococcal (conjugate) \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (2 doses) | Friday, 30 October 2009 |\n| **Poliorix** | Polio Vaccine \u2013 Inactivated (IPV) \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (1 dose) | Thursday, 5 August 2010 |\n| **Poliorix** | Polio Vaccine \u2013 Inactivated (IPV) \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (2 dose) | Thursday, 5 August 2010 |\n| **Polio Sabin Mono Three (oral)** | Polio Vaccine \u2013 Oral (OPV) Monovalent Type 3 \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (10 doses) | Tuesday, 5 October 2010 |\n| **Polio Sabin Mono Three (oral)** | Polio Vaccine \u2013 Oral (OPV) Monovalent Type 3 \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (20 doses) | Tuesday, 5 October 2010 |\n| **Polio Sabin Mono Two (oral)** | Polio Vaccine \u2013 Oral (OPV) Monovalent Type 2 \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (10 doses) | Wednesday, 11 May 2011 |\n| **Polio Sabin Mono Two (oral)** | Polio Vaccine \u2013 Oral (OPV) Monovalent Type 2 \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (20 doses) | Wednesday, 11 May 2011 |\n| **Priorix** | Measles, Mumps and Rubella \u2013 Lyophilised active component to be reconstituted with excipient diluent before use vial (2 doses) | Wednesday, 21 December 2011 |\n| **Havrix 1440 Adult** | Hepatitis A (Human Diploid Cell), Inactivated (Adult) \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (1 dose) | Friday, 19 July 2013 |\n| **Havrix 720 Junior** | Hepatitis A (Human Diploid Cell), Inactivated (Paediatric) \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (1 dose) | Friday, 19 July 2013 |\n| **Boostrix** | Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (acellular) \u2013 Liquid: ready to use vial (1 dose) | Tuesday, 9 July 2013 |\n| **Menceo** | Meningococcal ACYW-135 (conjugate vaccine) \u2013 Lyophilised active component to be reconstituted with liquid active component before use.

3 GHG emissions. This was not done in the 2018 ESG performance summary.\nIndependent Limited Assurance Report\nto the Directors of GlaxoSmithKline plc\n\nGlaxoSmithKline plc (\"GSK\") commissioned DNV GL Business Assurance Services UK Limited (\"DNV\", \"us\" or \"we\") to conduct a limited assurance engagement over Selected Information presented in the ESG Performance Summary 2020 (the \"Report\"), for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nOur Observations\nOur observations and areas for improvement will be raised in a separate report to GSK\u2019s Management. Selected observations are provided below. These observations do not affect Our Conclusion made in the left hand column.\n\n- GSK significantly increased the proportion of renewable electricity purchased from 5% in 2019 to 52% in 2020. We found that the process for tracking which sites purchase renewable electricity and the evidence to support this could be improved. We recommend that responsibility for this is assigned to one individual or team who can track progress and maintain evidence of renewable energy purchases for all GSK sites.\n- GSK acquired a portfolio of sites in August 2019 and these were duly integrated into their environmental performance reporting. However, we found that none of these new sites had completed the GSK Water Stewardship Risk Assessment used to determine if a site is deemed \u201chigh risk\u201d against a number of categories including water availability and local regulatory frameworks. We recommend that GSK considers implementing a process whereby any new sites are assessed against GSK\u2019s Water Stewardship Risk Assessment within a year of joining GSK.\n- GSK can improve their market-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting against the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s Scope 2 Guidance by establishing a robust procedure for collating market-based emission factors from all sites and applying residual emission factors where market-based emission factors are unavailable.\n- Stakeholders rely on GSK\u2019s EHS performance data. To further demonstrate the robustness of their reporting, GSK may wish to consider expanding the scope of their assurance in future reporting cycles to include additional or alternative indicators, or performance against targets.\n\nSelected Information\nThe scope and boundary of our work is restricted to the following Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) performance data included within the Report (the \u201cSelected Information\u201d) for the reporting year 2020:\n\n- Total Energy (GWh)\n- Purchased Renewable Electricity (GWh)\n- Total Scope 1 GHG emissions (thousands of tonnes CO\u2082e)\n- Total Scope 2 GHG emissions \u2013 location-based (thousands of tonnes CO\u2082e)\n- Total Scope 2 GHG emissions \u2013 market-based (thousands of tonnes CO\u2082e)\n- Selected Scope 3 GHG emissions from Emissions from use of propellant based inhalers by patients (thousands of tonnes CO\u2082e)\n- Total water use (million m\u00b3)\n- Total wastewater discharged (million m\u00b3)\n- Water use at high water risk sites (million m\u00b3)\n- Total beneficial use waste (thousand tonnes)\n- Total non-beneficial use waste (thousand tonnes)\n- Total overall waste (thousand tonnes)\n- Total waste to landfill (thousand tonnes)\n- Number of fatalities (employees and complementary workers under GSK direct supervision)\n- Reportable incidents with lost time\n- Lost time reportable injury and illness rate (per 100,000 hours worked)\n- Reportable incidents with and without lost time\n- Reportable injury and illness rate (per 100,000 hours worked)\n\nTo assess the Selected Information, which includes an assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the Report, we have used GSK\u2019s EHS Technical Support Documents (the \u201cCriteria\u201d), a summary can be found on pages 11, 12 and 13 of the Report.\n\nWe have not performed any work, and do not express any conclusion, on any other information that may be published in the Report or on GSK\u2019s website for the current reporting period or for previous periods.\nStandard and level of assurance\n\nWe performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 revised \u2013 \u2018Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u2019 (revised), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance.\n\nDNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17021:2015 - Conformity Assessment Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement; and the level of assurance obtained is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered sufficient to provide a basis for Our Conclusion, so that the risk of this conclusion being in error is reduced but not reduced to very low.\n\nBasis of Our Conclusion\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Information; our work included, but was not restricted to:\n\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the Criteria for the Selected Information;\n- Conducting interviews with GSK\u2019s Management to obtain an understanding of the key processes, systems and controls in place to generate, aggregate and report the Selected Information;\n- Desktop review of evidence of site level data and following this through to consolidated group data;\n- Remote site visits to Dresden (Germany), Nyon (Switzerland) and Ware GMS (UK) to review process and systems for preparing site level data consolidated at GSK\u2019s Ware R&D (UK) site. DNV were free to choose the sites on the basis of materiality and their contribution to the group\u2019s overall data;\n- Performing limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Selected Information to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported;\n- Recalculating the Selected Information using suitable conversion factors and/or as established by GSK\u2019s Criteria;\n- Reviewing information provided by GSK\u2019s third party contractors;\n- Reviewing that the evidence, measurements and the scope provided to us by GSK for the Selected Information is prepared in line with the Criteria; and\n- Reading the Report and narrative accompanying the Selected Information within it with regard to the Criteria.\n\nDNV GL Business Assurance Services UK Limited\n\nLondon, UK\n9 March 2021\n\nDNV Business Assurance\n\nDNV GL Business Assurance Services UK Limited is part of DNV \u2013 Business Assurance, a global provider of certification, verification, assessment and training services, helping customers to build sustainable business performance. www.dnvgl.co.uk/BetterAssurance\nPublic policies available online\n\nPlease see our public policy page for our positions on a number of issues including:\n\n- Anti-microbial resistance\n- Care, welfare and treatment of animals\n- Clinical trials in the developing world\n- Cloning and Stem cell technologies\n- Code of conduct\n- Deforestation free sourcing\n- Impact of climate change on health\n- Genetically modified micro-organisms and Environment, Health and Safety (EHS)\n- Marketing practices and scientific engagement\n- Nanotechnology\n- Ozone depletion and metered-dose inhalers for asthma\n- Pharmaceuticals in the environment (PiE)\n- Pharmacovigilance\n- Tax strategy\n- Working with third parties\n\nOn gsk.com we provide more information on a number of topics including:\n\n- Materiality assessment\n- Human rights\n- Sustainable Development Goals\n- Political advocacy\n- Patient group funding\n- Trade association memberships\n- Charitable grant contributions\n- Criteria for working with Public Policy Groups\n- Modern Slavery Act Statement\n- Preparing for future disease threats\nCautionary statement\n\nThis document may contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give the Group\u2019s current expectations or forecasts of future events. An investor can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as \u2018anticipate\u2019, \u2018estimate\u2019, \u2018expect\u2019, \u2018intend\u2019, \u2018will\u2019, \u2018project\u2019, \u2018plan\u2019, \u2018believe\u2019, \u2018target\u2019 and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, dividend payments and financial results. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations (including under the Market Abuse Regulations, UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), the Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Investors should, however, consult any additional disclosures that the Group may make in any documents which it publishes and/or files with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). All investors, wherever located, should take note of these disclosures. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any particular expectation will be met and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which relate to factors that are beyond the Group\u2019s control or precise estimate. The Group cautions investors that a number of important factors, including those in this presentation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-09", "created": "2025-04-09", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/ccrm_2022/glaxosmithkline_2020.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 35, "total-input-tokens": 75612, "total-output-tokens": 23301, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 30, 1], [30, 1308, 2], [1308, 4198, 3], [4198, 7656, 4], [7656, 10841, 5], [10841, 12537, 6], [12537, 14103, 7], [14103, 15982, 8], [15982, 18258, 9], [18258, 21166, 10], [21166, 24814, 11], [24814, 27623, 12], [27623, 29376, 13], [29376, 34026, 14], [34026, 37941, 15], [37941, 42353, 16], [42353, 46140, 17], [46140, 47693, 18], [47693, 48163, 19], [48163, 50644, 20], [50644, 55531, 21], [55531, 56333, 22], [56333, 59108, 23], [59108, 61956, 24], [61956, 63276, 25], [63276, 65397, 26], [65397, 65647, 27], [65647, 70687, 28], [70687, 74527, 29], [74527, 79112, 30], [79112, 81491, 31], [81491, 85344, 32], [85344, 88663, 33], [88663, 89698, 34], [89698, 91722, 35]]}}
