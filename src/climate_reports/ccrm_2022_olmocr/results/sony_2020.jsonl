appropriate disclosure to and communication with stakeholders. Since 2019, Sony releases its Corporate Report to comprehensively communicate financial information and non-financial information, including policies for mid-to-long-term value creation and business strategies. Sony also posts financial data, non-financial information and business summaries designed primarily for investors and shareholders on the Investor Relations section of its website. In addition, Sony releases the Sustainability Report 2020 to provide a comprehensive and detailed report on non-financial information for a wide range of stakeholders. This report is organized by the material topics which form the foundation for Sony\u2019s long-term value creation, and it focuses on activities in fiscal 2019.\n\nCorporate Report 2020\n\nIntegrated report covering financial and non-financial information, such as business strategy and management policies for mid- to long-term value creation\n\n- Message from the CEO\n- Value Creation at Sony\n- Businesses and Foundation for Creating Value\n- Corporate Governance\n\n\u201cInvestor Relations\u201d Website\n\nA business overview, with financial and non-financial information, particularly relevant to investors and shareholders\n\nBriefings for Investors\n- Corporate Strategy Meeting\n- Earnings Announcement\n- ESG Briefing\n\nFinancial Reports\n- Securities Report (Japanese only)\n- SEC Filings\n\nCorporate Governance and Internal Controls\n- Corporate Governance Report\n\nSustainability Report 2020\n\nCovers non-financial information, such as activities related to sustainability and CSR, relevant to a wide range of stakeholders\n\n- Approach to Sustainability\n- Corporate Governance\n- Ethics and Compliance\n- Respect for Human Rights\n- Technology\n- Employees\n- Responsible Supply Chain\n- Quality and Services\n- Environment\n- Community Engagement\nEditorial Policy\n\nSony first issued its environmental report in 1994, then enhanced the information related to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and changed the name of the report to \u201cCSR report\u201d in 2003. In order to keep the information disclosed up to date as Sony\u2019s scope of business and circumstances change, Sony has been disclosing its CSR activities mainly on the web since 2014. In 2018, the report was renamed the \u201cSustainability Report.\u201d In 2020, Sony compiled and issued this report mainly in PDF format to improve readability. For more information on Sony\u2019s sustainability and CSR activities, please refer to this report. In addition, the Sustainability section on the Sony Group Portal Website includes sections on the Environment, Social Contribution, Accessibility, and Diversity & Inclusion.\n\nScope: Sony Corporation, consolidated subsidiaries and other companies within the scope of consolidation\n\nPeriod Covered: Fiscal 2019 (April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2020)\n\nPlease note, however, that reporting on material activities, such as major organizational changes, includes information up through July 31, 2020.

This report also refers to the Environmental Reporting Guidelines (Fiscal year 2018 version) published by Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment. For the comparative tables with the GRI Standards, please see page 165 below.\n\nComparative Table with GRI Standards\n\nReporting Principles of Materiality:\nSony has conducted a materiality assessment that incorporates stakeholder perspectives to identify material issues, which is the foundation for the creation of long-term value through its businesses. Learn more about this on page 4.\n\nSpecifying Material Topics\n\nFor a third-party report on the verification of environmental data, please see page 164.\n\nIndependent Verification Report\n\nInquiries:\nSony Corporation\n1-7-1 Konan, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-0075, Japan\nTel: +81-3-6748-2111\n\nDate of Issue: August 2020\n(Previous report issued: August 2019; issued annually)\nApproach to Sustainability\n\nSony\u2019s management approach is \u201cgetting closer to people,\u201d and its purpose is to \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.\u201d For people to be connected through emotion, it is necessary for people, society, and the planet to be healthy. The Sony Group Code of Conduct states, \u201cIt is the core corporate responsibility of Sony to society to pursue its corporate value enhancement through innovation and sound business practices and contribute to developing a sustainable society.\u201d Sony also gives due consideration to the impacts of its business activities on the interests of its stakeholders\u2014shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, business partners, local communities, other organizations\u2014and the global environment. Sony also engages in dialogue with stakeholders to build trust and get input. Based on these principles, Sony will create sustainable social and economic value from a long-term perspective by delivering emotional experiences to people and continuing to work with its stakeholders to pursue sustainability in such areas as the environment and human rights, implementing these initiatives across all of its businesses.\n\nSony Group\u2019s Materiality\n\nOverview and Purpose of Materiality Analysis\n\nThe Sony Group is a global organization with a broad range of businesses around the world\u2014electronic equipment, devices, game consoles, digital networks, motion pictures, music, and financial and insurance services. Sony recognizes that stakeholders expect Sony to maintain a well-defined stance and take action to address the issues facing society and the global environment, in addition to delivering emotional experiences through its business. Therefore, in 2019, Sony reviewed its \u201cCSR material topics,\u201d conducting an analysis incorporating the perspectives of stakeholders. The aim was to identify topics that are material to Sony\u2019s efforts to create long-term value through its businesses. The process for materiality analysis consisted of (1) identifying and classifying candidate topics, (2) assessing the topics from the perspective of Sony and its stakeholders, and (3) specifying material topics.\n\nMateriality Assessment Steps\n\nStep 1: Identify and classify candidate topics\n\nBased on internal and external information and documents, Sony selected candidate topics with high relevance. References included the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards, which are global guidelines for sustainability reporting, the ISO 26000 international standard for corporate social responsibility, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are globally agreed goals for building a sustainable world.\n\nStep 2: Assess the topics from the perspective of Sony and its stakeholders\n\nThe candidate topics identified and classified in the Step 1 were assessed from the perspectives of Sony and its stakeholders with reference to following:\n\n- Assessment by executive officers responsible for each topic from the viewpoints of mid-to-long-term social and technological changes, and the need to further enhance measures to achieve Sony\u2019s ideal state\n- Assessment of the importance of each topic from the perspective of stakeholders based on information published by NGOs, investors, ESG rating agencies, the mass media and others\n- Assessment from the perspective of stakeholders through an exchange of views with investors and external CSR experts\n\nStep 3: Specify material topics\n\nBased on the assessment conducted in Step 2, the material topics were specified with the final approval of senior management.\nAnalysis Results and Material Topics\n\nAs a result of the multi-faceted assessment process above, \u201cTechnology\u201d and \u201cEmployees,\u201d which are the common elements underlying Sony\u2019s diverse business portfolio, were specified as the most important material topics for supporting Sony\u2019s long-term value creation. The Sustainability Report 2019 reports on Sony\u2019s material topics within nine categories \u2014 Corporate Governance, Ethics and Compliance, Respect for Human Rights, Technology, Employees, Responsible Supply Chain, Quality and Services, Environment, and Community Engagement \u2014 as shown in the table below. Going forward, Sony will strengthen its efforts to address these material topics in order to create long-term value.\n\n| Material Topics of the Sony Group |\n|----------------------------------|\n|

Activities\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\nSony\u2019s organizational structure for CSR implementation is spearheaded by the CSR Section at Sony Corporation headquarters, which in turn operates under the supervision of the Corporate Executive Officer in charge of CSR appointed by the Board of Directors. The CSR Section plans and sets objectives for CSR-related initiatives, makes these initiatives known throughout the Sony Group, monitors the progress of activities, and provides relevant information to the public via various reports including the Sustainability Report. In addition to disclosure, the CSR Section promotes dialogue with stakeholders, reports on various external inputs to the executive officer in charge of CSR, and ensures that these inputs are fed back to the management team and relevant headquarters departments (including those in charge of legal affairs, compliance, Corporate Communication, environment, product quality, procurement, investor relations, employees, and marketing). Accordingly, Sony addresses CSR from a Group-wide perspective and incorporates issues into management action as necessary. The CSR Section and other relevant headquarters departments then implement CSR activities throughout the Group by ensuring Sony\u2019s policies and initiatives are conveyed to group companies around the world.\n\nOnce a year, in principle, the CSR Section reports to the Board of Directors on the status of Sony\u2019s entire set of sustainability initiatives, and the Board reviews them. For matters of great importance, the Senior Executive and department in charge of the matter provide regular reports for the Board of Directors to review.\n\nRaising Awareness\n\nSony recognizes that effective implementation of CSR requires keen employee awareness and offers a variety of educational programs. Sony and some of its group companies offer e-learning training programs for all employees focused on instilling know-how and introducing Sony\u2019s CSR program as well as enhancing general understanding of CSR. Sony also publishes a monthly newsletter to help Sony Group employees better understand social responsibility. It details Sony\u2019s principal CSR initiatives and reports on related awards received from third parties and CSR trends. In addition, Sony holds a Sustainability Forum that provides the Group\u2019s employees in Japan with the opportunity to increase their knowledge of CSR. This event features lectures by invited experts, film screenings, workshops where employees can develop new ideas, and other activities, and addresses a variety of themes, including emergency relief, the environment, human rights, poverty, international understanding, employment opportunities for persons with disabilities, work-life balance, diversity, social innovation, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and AI ethics.\n\n> Volunteer Systems for Employees\nStakeholder Engagement\n\n\u201cWe will all give due consideration to the impact of our business activities on the interests of our stakeholders including shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, business partners, local communities and other organizations.\u201d\n\n(Sony Group Code of Conduct)\n\nCommunication with Stakeholders\n\nSony understands that addressing issues of interest to its many stakeholders is intrinsically linked to its ability to ensure a strong operating foundation, which is in turn vital to ensuring the well-being and sustainability of its business activities and to achieving sustainable growth. Sony\u2019s CSR initiatives reflect this understanding. Sony works to earn the trust of its stakeholders through its business activities, as well as through a range of CSR initiatives.\n\n| Stakeholders          | Principal Goals                                                                 | Main Communication Methods                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customers             | \u2022 Provide products that deliver satisfaction, safety and peace of mind from the customer\u2019s perspective  \n                        | \u2022 Provide customer service that further enhances customer satisfaction  \n                        | \u2022 Enhance usability and accessibility                                                   | \u2022 Customer Center (handles enquiries from customers)  \n                        | \u2022 Important notices regarding products and services  \n                        | \u2022 Purchaser\u2019s questionnaire  \n                        | \u2022 Participation in trade shows and exhibitions  \n                        | \u2022 Seminars  \n                        | \u2022 \u201cAccessibility\u201d website  \n                        | \u2022 Various social media sites                                                      | \u2022 Town hall meetings  \n                        | \u2022 Career counseling  \n                        | \u2022 Employee surveys  \n                        | \u2022 Sony Ethics & Compliance Hotline  \n                        | \u2022 Labor-management negotiations  \n                        | \u2022 Occupational Health & Safety Committee  \n                        | \u2022 In-house newsletters and intranet                                               |\n| Shareholders          | \u2022 Ensure swift and appropriate disclosure  \n                        | \u2022 Achieve continued growth in corporate value                                           | \u2022 General meetings of shareholders and presentations on financial results  \n                        | \u2022 IR Day and meetings for individual investors  \n                        | \u2022 ESG briefings  \n                        | \u2022 Websites disclosing information for investors  \n                        | \u2022 Corporate Report (integrated report)                                               | \u2022 Local volunteer activities  \n                        | \u2022 Participation in events held by local organizations and governments  \n                        | \u2022 Social contribution activities                                                   |\n| Business partners     | \u2022 Ensure appropriate, transparent and fair procurement practices, in line with the Sony Group Code of Conduct and Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct  \n                        | \u2022 Ensure that procurement practices are in harmony with the environment and society (including labor issues, human rights and conflict minerals) | \u2022 Explanatory meetings for suppliers  \n                        | \u2022 Audits and surveys related to CSR procurement  \n                        | \u2022 Dedicated website for business partners and a department established for handling their enquiries  \n                        | \u2022 Periodically held conferences for business partners  \n                        | \u2022 Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals Hotline                | \u2022 Activities for contributing to the community and reducing the environmental burden at each worksite  \n                        | \u2022 Activities for contributing to the community and reducing the environmental burden at each worksite  \n                        | \u2022 Measures for considering the environment over the lifecycle of products and services  \n                        | \u2022 Environmental information provided through communication with various stakeholders  \n                        | \u2022 Information provided on the website                                               |\n| NGOs, NPOs and other organizations | \u2022 Collaborate with NGOs and NPOs to help address social challenges  \n                        | \u2022 Participate in global frameworks  \n                        | \u2022 Participate in CSR-related organizations and projects                                | \u2022 Activities held in collaboration with NGOs and NPOs |\nPartnership and Participation in Multi-stakeholder Frameworks\n\nFor Sony, engaging and working together with various stakeholders is vital for pursuing CSR activities. Sony not only promotes engagement with stakeholders in implementing its CSR activities but also participates in multi-stakeholder efforts to forge a global framework for social responsibility.\n\nPartnering with an Environmental NGO\n\nIn July 2006, Sony joined the Climate Savers Programme, which is a partnership between the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), a leading environmental protection NGO, and various companies in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Through the Climate Savers Programme, leading corporations partner with the WWF to establish targets for reducing absolute emissions of CO\u2082 and other greenhouse gases. Progress toward these targets is monitored by an independent body. As of April 2020, 12 corporations worldwide had signed on as Climate Savers Programme partners. As a member of the Programme, Sony is expanding the scope of substances subject to greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements in a step-by-step manner and has incorporated them into its environmental targets. In June 2015, Sony introduced the Green Management 2020 environmental mid-term targets for fiscal 2016-2020. In addition to the targets for absolute greenhouse gas emissions from Sony Group sites and energy consumption of products, Sony has set new reduction targets for business partners, suppliers and logistics. These targets were reviewed and approved by the WWF as revised targets for Sony under the Climate Savers Programme.\n\nParticipation in CSR-Related Organizations and Projects\n\nSony is a member of numerous global CSR organizations, including BSR and the Council for Better Corporate Citizenship (CBCC). The CBCC was originally established in 1989* under an initiative of Nippon Keidanren (Japan Business Federation), with the purpose of promoting good relations between Japan-affiliated companies and various stakeholders, including local communities and employees, by encouraging good corporate citizenship. Sony\u2019s founder, Akio Morita, served as the organization\u2019s first chairman. Sony intends to continue its active involvement in the CBCC going forward.\n\nSony is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance, which is dedicated to supply chain responsibility encompassing human rights, labor conditions, safety and health, and the environment.\n\n> Responsible Supply Chain\n\n*1 The organization was founded as the Council for Better Investment in 1989, and its name was changed to CBCC in June 2010.\nContributing to the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have a target year of 2030, were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. They were formulated based on the outcome of the Millennium Development Goals, which had been established in 2000 with the intention of realizing a better international community. The SDGs are comprised of 169 targets organized under 17 goals related to issues such as poverty, inequality, education, and the environment. The initiative is not only intended for developing nations, but applies to all countries, including developed countries.\n\nThe purpose of the entire Sony Group is to \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.\u201d The essence of Sony\u2019s responsibility to society is to strive for innovation through products, services and content that deliver emotional experiences to customers, while conducting business in a sound manner. At the same time, based on an awareness that Sony\u2019s business is only possible in a global environment and a society where people can live in peace and security, Sony conducts ongoing environmental and human rights initiatives throughout the supply chain. Accordingly, Sony believes that its diverse business portfolio, including education, healthcare and startup support, is very relevant to the 17 SDGs, and Sony will help to achieve the SDGs in the course of its business activities.\n\nSony also conducts ongoing assessments of the various impacts and risks that its business activities have on the global environment and society, and manages them while carrying out appropriate disclosure of information. In addition, Sony aims to contribute to the SDGs through its technologies, products, services and content, as well as various partnerships.\n\nRelated Information\n- Sony\u2019s Purpose & Values\n- Policy, Framework and Main Scope of Community Engagement\n\nCollaboration Agreement Signed to Pursue Innovation with UNOPS\n\nIn February 2020, Sony entered a collaboration agreement with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in the area of innovation. The first of the collaborations under the new agreement is Sony\u2019s involvement in the Global Innovation Challenge in April 2020. The Global Innovation Challenge is a program hosted by UNOPS to support startups and companies providing solutions to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UNOPS and Sony have jointly developed the theme of \u201cAdvancing resilient infrastructure with technology in the face of climate change,\u201d calling upon organizations to submit business ideas around this theme. Startups and companies selected through this process will be able to move into the UNOPS Global Innovation Centre that will open in Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture. They will also have access to the UNOPS Global Innovation Accelerator Program, which includes participation in the Sony Startup Acceleration Program (SSAP) and other programs designed to offer various forms of support to realize their ideas. In their collaboration, Sony and UNOPS will make the most of their respective assets, knowledge, and expertise to support the launch and business operation of startups that can create new value for the world, while continuing to work on solutions to the various issues targeted by the SDGs, thereby helping to build a sustainable world.\n\nGlobal Innovation Challenge (UNOPS)\nSony Startup Acceleration Program (in Japanese)\n\nContributing to the SDGs\u2014Sony Computer Science Laboratories\n\nSony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL) was established in 1988 for the purposes of pioneering new research fields and paradigms, and creating new technologies and businesses for the good of people and society. Sony CSL respects the freedom of its researchers to explore new fields of research and pursue truly creative research that goes beyond the imperative or mere improvement.\n\nIn 2008, Sony CSL proposed and began applying Open System Science. Since then, Sony CSL has been conducting science for the future of humanity, moving freely between scientific disciplines and developing entirely new ideas that go beyond borders between nations, between scientific fields, and between science and business to put our ideas into practice. Sony CSL actively pursues research that makes a positive contribution to issues on the global development agenda, in areas as diverse as sustainable agriculture, energy, health, food, prosthetics, and urban planning. Projects that are linked to the achievement of SDGs and focus on social applications for fundamental research include Synecoculture\u2122 and Open Energy Systems\u2122 (OES).

To operate Sony effectively, Sony Corporation approaches its corporate governance through two basic precepts:\n\n(a) The Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), a majority of which is comprised of independent outside Directors, focuses on effective oversight of management\u2019s operation of the business and maintaining a sound and transparent governance framework by utilizing the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committees; and\n\n(b) The Board determines Sony\u2019s fundamental management policies and other material matters and delegates to each of the Senior Executives that assume important roles for the management of Sony, including the Corporate Executive Officers, decision-making authority to conduct Sony\u2019s business operations broadly in line with their respective responsibilities, as defined with a view to promoting timely and efficient decision-making within Sony.\n\nStructure\n\nIn furtherance of these efforts, Sony Corporation has adopted a \u201cCompany with Three Committees\u201d corporate governance system under the Companies Act of Japan (Kaishah\u014d) and related regulations (collectively the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d) as the most appropriate system for the company. In addition, Sony Corporation has introduced its own requirements to help improve and maintain the soundness and transparency of its governance by strengthening the separation of the Directors\u2019 function from that of management; maintaining what the company believes is an appropriate Board size, which enables the members of the Board to actively contribute to discussion; and advancing the proper functioning of the statutory committees.\n\nMilestones\n\n1961: Issued American Depositary Receipts (ADRs); Started US-GAAP accounting\n1970: Listed on the New York Stock Exchange and disclosing quarterly earnings release\n1971: Started appointing independent directors\n1997: Introduced a new corporate executive officer system\n2003: Adopted a company with three committees system\n2005: Majority of the board became independent\n2015: Split out business units as subsidiaries\nCorporate Strategy, Business Strategy and Other Policies\n\nThe Board sets and determines the fundamental management policy, including the mid-term plan and annual business plan pursuant to the Charter of the Board by fully examining various the thinking of management led by the CEO, from multiple perspectives.

Under the Companies Act of Japan, a \u201cCompany with Three Committees\u201d is required to have three committees: The Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. The Companies Act also requires the Board to appoint Corporate Executive Officers (Shikko-yaku), who make decisions regarding the execution of Sony\u2019s business activities within the scope of the authority delegated to them by the Board. Sony Corporation has appointed its Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), who is responsible for Sony\u2019s overall management, and other officers who are responsible for important and extensive headquarters functions as Corporate Executive Officers. Sony Corporation has also appointed Corporate Executive Officers, including the CEO and other officers, that assume important roles for the management of Sony as Senior Executives.

The Nominating Committee broadly considers various relevant factors, including a candidate\u2019s capabilities (such as the candidate\u2019s experience, achievements, expertise, and international fluency), availability, and independence, as well as diversity in the boardroom such as gender and nationality, the appropriate size of the Board, and the knowledge, experiences and talent needed for the role. Under the Charter of the Board (the \u201cBoard Charter\u201d), Sony Corporation also requires that the Board consist of not fewer than 8 Directors and not more than 14 Directors. In addition, since 2005 the majority of the members of the Board have been outside Directors.\n\nBoard Experience and Expertise (Outside and Non-Executive Directors)\n\n| Name                  | Experience and Expertise |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n|                       | CEO or Equivalent Position of Business Enterprise | Global Business | Diversity (Gender/Nationality) | Engineering/IT/Technology | Relevant Industry/Operations | Finance/Accounting | Risk Management/Governance Relations |\n| Shuzo Sumi            | \u25cf                        | \u25cf              | \u25cf                              | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf                          |\n| Kazuo Matsunaga       | \u25cf                        | \u25cf              | \u25cf                              | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf                          |\n| Tim Schaaff           | \u25cf                        | \u25cf              | \u25cf                              | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf                          |\n| Toshiko Oka           | \u25cf                        | \u25cf              | \u25cf                              | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf                          |\n| Sakie Akiyama         | \u25cf                        | \u25cf              | \u25cf                              | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf                          |\n| Wendy Becker          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf              | \u25cf                              | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf                          |\n| Yoshihiko Hatanaka    | \u25cf                        | \u25cf              | \u25cf                              | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf                          |\n| Adam Crozier          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf              | \u25cf                              | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf                          |\n| Keiko Kishigami       | \u25cf                        | \u25cf              | \u25cf                              | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                          | \u25cf                        | \u25cf                          |\n| Joseph A.

As of June 26, 2020, all Directors satisfy the qualifications for Directors as set forth below, and all outside Directors satisfy the additional qualifications for outside Directors and are also qualified and designated as Independent Directors under the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\n- Director qualifications\n  - He/she shall not be a director, a statutory auditor, a corporate executive officer, a general manager or other employee of any company in competition with Sony in any of Sony\u2019s principal businesses (a \u201cCompeting Company\u201d) or own 3% or more of the shares of any Competing Company.\n  - He/she shall not be or have been a representative partner or partner of Sony\u2019s independent auditor the past three years before being nominated as a Director.\n  - He/she shall not have any connection with any matter that may cause a material conflict of interest in performing the duties of a Director.\n- Additional qualifications for outside Directors\n  - He/she shall not have received directly from Sony, during any consecutive twelve-month period within the last three years, more than an amount equivalent to 120,000 USD, other than Director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service).\n  - He/she shall not be an executive director, corporate executive officer, general manager or other employee of any company whose aggregate amount of transactions with Sony, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of an amount equivalent to 1,000,000 USD, or two percent of the annual consolidated sales of such company.\n\nAlso, each outside Director may, by resolution of the Nominating Committee, be nominated as a Director candidate for re-election five times, and thereafter by resolution of the Nominating Committee and by consent of all of the Directors. Even with consent of all of the Directors, in no event may any outside Director be re-elected more than eight times.\n\nMatters related to Outside Directors\nSony Corporation expects that each outside Director play an important role in ensuring proper business decisions by Sony and effective input and oversight by the Board through actively exchanging opinions and having discussions about Sony\u2019s business based on his or her various and broad experience, knowledge and expertise. Considering these expectations, the policy and procedures on the election of Director candidates, including independent outside Director candidates, are set forth as described above. As of June 26, 2020, the Board has 12 Directors, nine of whom are outside Directors. The Chairman of the Board is an outside Director; the Nominating Committee has four Directors, three of whom are outside Directors; the Compensation Committee has three Directors, all of whom are outside Directors; and the Audit Committee has three Directors, all of whom are outside Directors.\n\nPolicy and Procedure for Appointment and Dismissal of Senior Executives\nSony Corporation has appointed Corporate Executive Officers, including the CEO, and other officers that assume important roles for the management of Sony as Senior Executives. The Board, a majority of which is comprised of independent outside Directors, has the authority to appoint and dismiss and assign the roles and responsibilities, or to request report regarding such matters with respect to Senior Executives. In making decisions on the appointment of Corporate Executive Officers, including the CEO, the Board considers whether candidates for CEO meet certain qualifications for the CEO position which are set by the Nominating Committee and whether candidates for other Corporate Executive Officers have the necessary skills, capabilities, experiences and achievements that correspond to such Corporate Executive Officer\u2019s expected roles and responsibilities. As for Senior Executives except for Corporate Executive Officers, the Board receives report regarding the status of appointment/dismissal of such Senior Executives. The tenure of Senior Executives, including the CEO, is one year. The Board determines their re-appointment upon the expiration of each term considering the factors described above as well as their latest performance. The Board dismisses a Corporate Executive Officers, as necessary, in the event that the Board recognizes such Corporate Executive Officer is disqualified after discussions amongst the members of the Board or the Nominating Committee, even in the middle of the term for such Corporate Executive Officer.\n\nNominating Committee\nMembers: 4 Directors including 3 outside Directors (as of June 26, 2020)\n\n| Name               | Position                                      |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Shuzo Sumi        | Chairman of the Nominating Committee (Outside Director) |\n| Yoshihiko Hatanaka| Nominating Committee Member (Outside Director) |\n| Adam Crozier      | Nominating Committee Member (Outside Director) |\n| Kenichiro Yoshida | Nominating Committee Member (Director)         |\n\nPurpose/Authority\n- To determine the content of proposals to be submitted for approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders regarding the appointment and dismissal of Directors\n- To evaluate management succession plans, which the CEO develops, for the CEO and other executives designated by the Nominating Committee\n\nThe Nominating Committee determines the content of proposals regarding the appointment and dismissal of Directors, considering the policy on composition of the Board, the qualifications for Directors and the limitation of re-election of Directors.

Kraft Jr. | Compensation Committee Member (Outside Director) |\n\nPurpose/Authority\n\n- To set policy on the content of individual compensation for Directors, Senior Executives and other officers\n- To determine the amount and content of individual compensation of Directors and Corporate Executive Officers in accordance with the policy, and oversee the status of determination regarding the amount and content of individual compensation of Senior Executives except for Corporate Executive Officers\n\nPolicy of Composition of the Compensation Committee\n\nUnder the Companies Act, the Compensation Committee must consist of at least three Directors, the majority of whom must be outside Directors. In addition, the chair is to be selected from among the outside Directors. A Director who is a CEO, a Chief Operating Officer (\u201cCOO\u201d) or a Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) of Sony Corporation or who holds any equivalent position shall not be a member of the Compensation Committee. In determining whether to appoint or remove a member of the Compensation Committee, continuity of the Compensation Committee shall be duly taken into account. As of June 26, 2020, the Compensation Committee is comprised of three outside Directors.\n\nBasic policy for Director and Senior Executive remuneration\n\nThe basic policy regarding remuneration for Directors and Senior Executives, as determined by the Compensation Committee, is as follows:\n\n(a) Basic policy regarding Director remuneration\n\nThe primary duty of Directors is to supervise the performance of business operations of the Sony as a whole. In order to improve this supervisory function over the business operations of Sony, which is a global company, the following two elements have been established as the basic policy for the determination of remuneration of Directors. No Director remuneration is paid to those Directors who concurrently serve as Corporate Executive Officers.\n\n- Attracting and retaining an adequate talent pool of Directors possessing the requisite abilities to excel in the global marketplace; and\n- Ensuring the effectiveness of the supervisory function of the Directors.\n\nBased upon the above, remuneration of Directors consists of the following three components:\n\n- Fixed remuneration;\n- Remuneration linked to stock price; and\n- Phantom Restricted Stock Plan.\n\nThe amount of each component and its percentage of total remuneration shall be at an appropriate level determined in accordance with the basic policy above and based upon research conducted by a third-party regarding remuneration of directors of both Japanese and non-Japanese companies. Regarding remuneration linked to stock price, restricted stock is used to further promote shared values between the shareholders and Directors, and incentivize Directors to develop and maintain a sound and transparent management system. Appropriate restrictions and conditions shall be set in order to enhance the effectiveness of the programs. Regarding the Phantom Restricted Stock Plan, points determined every year by the Compensation Committee shall be granted to Directors every year during his/her tenure, and at the time of resignation, the remuneration amount shall be calculated by multiplying the common stock price by the individual\u2019s accumulated points. Sony shall not grant any points pursuant to the Phantom Restricted Stock Plan to a Director for a fiscal year in which Sony granted restricted stock as Director remuneration to such Director.\n\n(b) Basic policy regarding Senior Executive remuneration\n\nSenior Executives are key members of management responsible for executing the operations of the Sony as a whole or respective businesses of Sony. In order to further improve the business results of Sony, the following two elements have been established as the basic policy for the determination of remuneration of Senior Executives.\n\n- Attracting and retaining an adequate talent pool possessing the requisite abilities to excel in the global marketplace; and\n- Providing effective incentives to improve business results on a short-, medium- and long-term basis.\n\nBased upon the above, Senior Executive remuneration shall basically consist of the following four components:\n\n- Fixed remuneration;\n- Remuneration linked to business results;\n- Remuneration linked to stock price; and\n- Phantom Restricted Stock Plan.\n\nThe amount of each component and its percentage of total remuneration shall be at an appropriate level determined in accordance with the above basic policy and the individual\u2019s level of responsibility and based upon research conducted by a third-party regarding remuneration of management of both Japanese and non-Japanese companies, emphasizing linking Senior Executive remuneration to business results and shareholder value. In principle, remuneration for a Senior Executive who has a greater management responsibility and influence on Sony as a whole has a higher proportion of remuneration linked to stock price which is directly linked to the corporate value. (Please see below Reference: Executive Compensation Package Design to Focus on Long-Term Management.)\nRemuneration linked to business results shall be structured appropriately and based upon appropriate indicators to ensure that such remuneration effectively incentivizes Senior Executives to achieve the mid- to long-term and the corresponding fiscal year\u2019s corporate targets. Specifically, the amount shall be determined based upon the level of achievements of the targets of (1) certain key performance indicators linked to consolidated or individual business results of Sony of the corresponding fiscal year, such as Return on Equity (\u201cROE\u201d), Net Income attributable to Sony Corporation\u2019s Stockholders and Operating Cash Flow (\u201cFinancial Performance KPIs\u201d), which indicators are selected based on the areas for which each Senior Executive is responsible and (2) the individual performance of the area(s) for which the relevant Senior Executive is responsible. The amount to be paid to Senior Executives shall fluctuate, in principle, within the range from 0 percent to 200 percent of the standard payment amount (\u201cBusiness Results Linked Standard Payment Amount\u201d) based on the achievement of the above-mentioned targets. Efforts to accelerate collaboration among businesses of Sony from the viewpoint of value creation as \u201cOne Sony,\u201d as well as sustainability initiatives related to social value creation and ESG (environment, social and governance) shall be included in the evaluation indicators of individual performance. The Business Results Linked Standard Payment Amount shall be determined so that such amount is within a certain percentage of the cash compensation (total of the fixed remuneration and the remuneration linked to business results) and remuneration linked to the share price. Regarding the Phantom Restricted Stock Plan, points determined every year by the Compensation Committee shall be granted to Senior Executives every year during his/her tenure in office, and at the time of resignation, the remuneration amount shall be calculated by multiplying the Common Stock price by the individual\u2019s accumulated points.\n\n(Reference: Restricted Stock)\n\nSony has introduced a restricted stock plan starting from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, pursuant to which shares of restricted stock will be allotted to Sony Corporation\u2019s Corporate Executive Officers and other executives, and non-executive Directors of Sony Corporation (the \u201cNon-Executive Directors\u201d). The purpose of the plan for the Corporate Executive Officers and other executives of Sony Corporation is to further reinforce management\u2019s alignment with shareholder value, and to incentivize management to improve mid- to long-term performance and increase shareholder value. Furthermore, the purpose of the plan for the Non-Executive Directors is to incentivize these Directors to develop and maintain a sound and transparent management system by further promoting shared values between the shareholders and the Non-Executive Directors. The grantees will not be able to sell or transfer the granted shares during the restricted period, and Sony Corporation will acquire the granted shares from a grantee without any consideration to, or consent of, the grantee under certain conditions. Details of the plan, such as vesting conditions, eligibility and the number of grants, will be determined by the Compensation Committee.\n\n(Reference: Executive Compensation Package Design to Focus on Long-Term Management)\n\nThe following bar chart shows the compensation of remuneration for Senior Executives applicable to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The proportions of \u201cRemuneration linked to business results\u201d are based on the Business Results Linked Standard Payment Amount.\n\nProcedures to determine remuneration of Directors and Senior Executives\n\nBased on the policy outlined above, the Compensation Committee determines or oversees by having Corporate Executive Officers report, both with respect to the amount and content of the compensation for each Director and Senior Executive. Specifically, in principle, each year at the meeting of the Compensation Committee held after the Ordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders, the amount of basic remuneration and the content of each Director\u2019s and Corporate Executive Officer\u2019s compensation for the corresponding fiscal year is determined. Thereafter, at the meeting of the Compensation Committee held after the corresponding fiscal year end, the final amount of compensation of each Director and Corporate Executive Officer is determined, including the amount of remuneration linked to business results.\nFor determining the amount of the remuneration linked to business results for each Corporate Executive Officer, the Business Results Linked Standard Payment Amount, the targets for the Financial Performance KPIs and the targets for the individual performance of the areas (s) for which the relevant Corporate Executive Officer is responsible are determined and thereafter, at the meeting of the Compensation Committee held after the corresponding fiscal year end, the amount of such remuneration is determined based on the level of achievement of such targets for the Financial Performance KPIs and the individual performance. With respect to the remunerations for Senior Executives except for Corporate Executive Officers, matters regarding the amount and content of individual compensation, which shall be determined by CEO shall be reported to the Compensation Committee.\n\n- Corporate Executive Officer remuneration linked to business results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020\n\nThe Business Results Linked Standard Payment Amount for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was between 37.5% and 50.0% of cash compensation (total of the fixed remuneration and the remuneration linked to business results). The Financial Performance KPIs mainly used for the Corporate Executive Officers and their weighting, targets and results were as follows:\n\n| KPI          | Weight | Target to be achieved for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 (Consolidated) | Result for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 (Consolidated) |\n|--------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operating CF | 50%    | Amount determined in order to achieve the Operating CF (as defined below) target under Sony\u2019s Third Mid-Range Plan of 2.2 trillion yen or more for the three-year period from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 | 762.9 billion yen                                             |\n| Net Income   | 40%    | 500 billion yen                                                                | 582.2 billion yen                                             |\n| ROE          | 10%    | 12.5%                                                                          | 14.8%                                                         |\n\nOperating cash flow, excluding the Financial Services Segment (\"Operating CF\"), was selected as a Financial Performance KPI and was weighed the highest due to operating cash flow being determined as the most important performance metric under the Third Mid-Range Plan of Sony. ROE was also selected due to it being one of the financial targets of Sony\u2019s Third Mid-Range Plan. Net Income attributable to Sony Corporation\u2019s Stockholders was selected in order to incentivize management to achieve the current fiscal year\u2019s corporate target.\n\nFor the target to be achieved for the Operating CF for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, an amount which the Compensation Committee determined as appropriate was set in order to achieve the Operating CF target under Sony\u2019s Third Mid-Range Plan of 2.2 trillion yen or more (target as of April 1, 2019) for the three-year period from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The target for the Net Income attributable to Sony Corporation\u2019s Stockholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was set as 500 billion yen, which was the forecasted amount for the Net Income attributable to Sony Corporation\u2019s Stockholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 announced in April 2019. The target for ROE was 12.5% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The results for the Financial Performance KPIs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 were as follows: Operating CF: 762.9 billion yen, Net Income attributable to Sony Corporation\u2019s Stockholders: 582.2 billion yen, ROE: 14.8%, each exceeding the targeted amount.\n\nAs outlined above under \u201cBasic policy regarding Director and Senior Executive remuneration,\u201d remuneration linked to business results for Corporate Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was determined based upon the level of achievement of the indicators which were selected based on the areas of responsibility of the relevant Corporate Executive Officer and the individual performance of the area (s) for which the relevant Corporate Executive Officer was responsible. The amounts to be paid to the Corporate Executive Officers were determined within the range from 0% to 200% of the Business Results Linked Standard Payment Amount. As a result, the ratio of remuneration linked to business results of Corporate Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was in the range of 149.1% to 155.1% of the Business Results Linked Standard Payment Amount.\n\nSupport for Activities of Directors, the Board and the Committees\n\nSony Corporation engages in various activities to enhance the oversight function of the Board over management\u2019s operation of Sony\u2019s business as follows:\n\n- Outside Director Initiatives\n\nThe Chairman of the Board is elected from among those Directors other than the Representative Corporate Executive Officer, and the Chairman leads the Board\u2019s activities and secures the appropriate cooperation, communication and arrangement among outside Directors and Senior Executives. For example, the Board conducted outside Directors\u2019 meetings generally the same day as each Board Meeting was held. The Board also conducted Directors\u2019 corporate strategic workshops with management, site visits by outside Directors and meetings of the Chairman and the CEO. All these activities were aimed at securing better understanding by outside Directors of Sony\u2019s business and management\u2019s initiatives and encouraging corporate strategic discussions among Directors.\n\u25cf Secretariat Offices for the Board and each Committee\nThe company has established the secretariat offices of the Board and each Committee to support the activities of the members and encourage constructive and proactive discussion at the meetings of the Board and each Committee. Each secretariat office endeavors to distribute necessary materials for the meetings in advance and to provide other information such as accounting information, organizational charts, press releases, external analyst reports and credit rating reports, as appropriate. Each secretariat office explains the meeting agenda to the members and provides them with presentation materials in advance of each meeting date and facilitates deliberation in separate meetings or brief sessions depending on the nature of matters to be discussed. Each secretariat office also provides the absent members with a follow up briefing, as appropriate. In addition, each secretariat office shares the annual schedule of the meetings and anticipated agenda items in advance with the members, in order to appropriately set the frequency of meetings and the number of agenda items to be deliberated at each meeting.\n\n\u25cf Provision of Necessary Information\nWhen the company is requested to provide additional information by Directors, each secretariat office endeavors to provide the members such information promptly. Also, each secretariat office verifies appropriately whether requested information is provided smoothly. In the event that the members consult with external specialists, participate in various seminars and so on to perform their duties, the costs and expenses in connection with such activities are borne by the company in accordance with applicable internal rules.\n\n\u25cf The Audit Committee Aide\nWith the approval of the Board and with the Audit Committee\u2019s consent, the company has established the Audit Committee Aide to support the activities of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee Aide does not concurrently hold positions related to the business operations of Sony and, upon instruction by each Audit Committee member, conducts investigations into and analyses of auditing matters and engages in physical inspections or visiting audits either by him/herself or by cooperating with relevant departments in order to support the Audit Committee.\n\n\u25cf Policy for training Directors\nNewly appointed Directors receive briefings by Senior Executives and outside experts in connection regarding their expected roles and responsibilities, including legal duties, as a Director or a member of the Committees. In addition, newly appointed outside Directors receive briefings about the business, financial status, organization and governance structure of Sony. Also, throughout their tenure, each Director receives compliance-related training in accordance with internal protocols and briefings on matters relevant to each Director\u2019s fulfillment of his/her roles and responsibilities including the current status of Sony\u2019s business.\n\n\u25a0 Evaluation of the Board and the Committees\u2019 Effectiveness\n\nPolicy for Evaluation\nSony Corporation believes that it is important to endeavor to improve the effectiveness of the Board and each Committee in order to support Sony\u2019s business operations and enhance the corporate value of Sony. To achieve this goal, Sony Corporation conducts evaluations of the effectiveness of the Board and of each Committee (the \u201cEvaluation\u201d) at least annually.\n\nRecent Evaluation\nFrom February through April 2020, the Board conducted the Evaluation mainly in respect of the Board and Committee activities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 after confirming that actions proposed in response to the results of the previous Evaluation were taken. The recent Evaluation was conducted, as the company did with the previous Evaluation, with the support of a third-party evaluation by an outside counsel having expertise in Japanese and global corporate governance practices (the \u201cOutside Counsel\u201d) in order to ensure transparency and objectivity and to obtain professional advice.\n\nProcedures for Recent Evaluation\nFirst, the Board discussed and confirmed that the actions proposed to be taken in response to the results of previous Evaluation were taken, and discussed and confirmed the proposed procedures for the Evaluation for the fiscal year ended March 2020. Thereafter, the third-party evaluation was conducted by the Outside Counsel in accordance with the following steps:\n\n\u25cf Reviewed relevant material, such as the minutes of Board meetings, and attended a Board meeting;\n\u25cf Confirmed with the Board Secretariat office and each Committee\u2019s secretariat office how meetings of the Board and Committees were conducted;\n\u25cf Gathered responses to a questionnaire from each Director about the current status and practices of the Board and each Committee, such as the composition of the Board, operation of the Board, commitments of each Director, activities of each Committee and procedures of the previous Evaluation;\n\u25cf Interviewed the Chairman of the Board, newly-appointed Directors, a Director who is concurrently in the position of the CEO, and certain additional Directors about the Board and Committee status and practices; and\n\u25cf Researched other global companies\u2019 practices in Japan, the United States and Europe, and compared them with the company\u2019s practices.\n\nThe Board then received, reviewed and discussed the Outside Counsel\u2019s report on the results of its evaluation. The Board confirmed the effectiveness of the Board and the Committees.\nSummary of the Results of Recent Evaluation\n\nThe Outside Counsel reported that the Board is established and operated in a manner sufficient to be highly appreciated, based on various points, including the self-evaluation results of the Directors and comparison with benchmarked companies in Japan, the United States and Europe. Following discussion and analysis based on the Outside Counsel\u2019s report, the Board re-affirmed that the Board and each Committee were functioning effectively as of April 2020. The Outside Counsel also provided examples of potential options, based on other companies\u2019 practices, to help further improve effectiveness of the Board and Committees. The examples include studying the feasibility of having special committees, further enhancing the executive session\u2019s effectiveness, further enhancing disclosure about the compensation system, and further securing diversity of the outside Directors and enhancing disclosure about the same.\n\nActions in response to the Results of Evaluation\n\nIn order to further increase corporate value of Sony, Sony Corporation will take appropriate actions to further enhance functions of the Board and the Committees in response to the results of the Evaluation, as well as various comments and opinions given by Directors and the Outside Counsel during the Evaluation process.\n\nFor reference, after the previous Evaluation conducted from February through April 2019, Sony Corporation took the following actions, among others, to help improve the effectiveness of the Board:\n\n- Enhanced diversity in the boardroom (by newly appointing two non-Japanese and one female Directors as outside Directors);\n- Continuously made periodic reports to the Board on ESG (environment, social and governance) related matters;\n- Focused on information security continuously through the Director in charge of Information Security;\n- Held additional executive sessions;\n- Expanded disclosure regarding compensation of Directors and Senior Executives; and\n- Conducted visiting audits by Audit Committee members at Sony\u2019s business sites.\n\nSenior Executives and Other Officers\n\nSenior Executives (In Sony, Corporate Executive Officer, Senior Executive Vice President and Executive Vice President)\n\nTotal number of Senior Executives: 17 (including 6 Corporate Executive Officers) (as of June 26, 2020)\n\n- Governance Framework TOP - Senior Executives\n\n  - Purpose/Authority\n    - Determines and executes Sony\u2019s business activities in accordance with their roles and responsibilities assigned by the Board\n\n  - Delegation of Authority from the Board\n    - The Board determines the fundamental management policies and other material matters related to the operation of Sony\u2019s business.

At Board meetings held on May 13, 2009 and April 30, 2015, the Board amended and updated the internal control and governance framework, and with the written resolution of the Board dated as of May 15, 2020, the Board reaffirmed the framework in effect and determined to continue to evaluate and improve such framework going forward, as appropriate. These determinations were required by and met the requirements of the Companies Act of Japan. For the content of the reaffirmation and the status of its implementation determined by the written resolution of the Board dated as of May 15, 2020, please refer to the page below.\n\nBoard of Directors\u2019 Determination Regarding Internal Control and Governance Framework Pursuant to the Japanese Companies Act and Status for Implementing the Internal Control and Governance Framework\n\nFor the summary of major frameworks established and maintained based on the above determination, please refer to each page below.\n\nFinancial Reporting Framework\n\nSony\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Sony formed a cross-functional steering committee comprised of management in charge of the principal Sony headquarters functions to monitor the actions necessary to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, including documenting, testing and evaluating internal controls and overseeing and assessing the global evaluation. Based on the Company\u2019s evaluation, management has concluded that Sony maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020.\n\nDisclosure Framework\n\nThe securities of Sony Corporation, the ultimate parent of all Sony companies, are listed for trading on exchanges in Japan and the U.S. As a result, Sony is obligated to make various disclosures to the public in accordance with applicable securities laws, regulations and rules in those countries and listing standards of the stock exchanges on which Sony Corporation\u2019s shares are listed. Sony is committed to full compliance with all requirements applicable to its public disclosures.\n\nSony Corporation\u2019s policy on investor relations activities is to aim to disclose accurate information in a timely and fair manner, as well as to endeavor to promote constructive dialogue with shareholders and investors, with a view to maximizing Sony\u2019s corporate value by building a relationship of trust with shareholders and investors. Sony Corporation has in place disclosure controls and procedures in support of this policy. All personnel responsible for the preparation of submissions to and filings with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory entities, or for other public communications made on behalf of Sony Group, or who provide information as part of that process, have a responsibility to ensure that such disclosures and information are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable, and in compliance with the established disclosure controls and procedures.\n\nSony Corporation has established \u201cDisclosure Controls and Procedures,\u201d outlining the process through which potentially material information is reported from important business units, subsidiaries, affiliated companies and corporate divisions and is reviewed and considered for disclosure in light of its materiality to Sony. As a body to assist the CEO and CFO of Sony Corporation, in designing, implementing and evaluating the Disclosure Control and Procedures, Sony Corporation has established the \u201cDisclosure Committee,\u201d which is comprised of members of senior management of Sony Corporation who are in charge of relevant departments. In order to assure appropriate and timely disclosure, the Disclosure Committee shall evaluate events that are reported from the important business units, subsidiaries, affiliated companies and corporate divisions in accordance with Sony\u2019s internal rules in light of their materiality to Sony. Based on such evaluation, the Disclosure Committee shall review the necessity of disclosure in accordance with applicable securities laws, regulations and rules, as well as the listing standards of the relevant stock exchanges, and report to the CEO and the CFO for their determination.\n\nRisk Management System Framework\n\nEach business unit, subsidiary / affiliated company and corporate division of Sony periodically reviews and assesses risks for the area of which it is in charge and works on finding, reporting, assessing and responding to the risks. In addition, Senior Executives including Corporate Executive Officers, of Sony Corporation have established and maintain a system to identify and control risks that may cause losses to Sony Group regarding the areas of which they are in charge. The Corporate Executive Officer in charge of group risk control comprehensively promotes and manages the establishment and maintenance of the system stated above through the activities with related departments.\nCrisis Management System Framework\n\nOne aspect of risk management is the proper handling of crises if and when they arise, and the proper preparation for such crises. Sony\u2019s crisis management and business continuity activities predominately occur at the business and operational level closest to the events the Company may encounter. Since some events can have a significant impact on the entire Sony Group as a whole, Sony has established a Group crisis management procedure to enable a swift and organized Group-wide response to crises as needed.\n\nFramework for Business Continuity Planning\n\nThe Sony Group has strengthened its business continuity planning (BCP) to enhance risk management throughout the supply chain. The Group identifies, analyzes, and evaluates business risks in order to mitigate the risk of business disruptions due to emergencies such as earthquakes, natural disasters, and accidents.\n\nSony\u2019s electronics business struggled to cope with the impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake and severe flooding in Thailand in 2011, and with the impact of the earthquakes in the Kumamoto region of Japan in 2016. Sony\u2019s employees and top management rallied together, capitalizing on their experiences in implementing measures to ensure business continuity, and succeeded in minimizing the impact of production disruptions.\n\nIn 2016, Sony began reassessing the earthquake risk to its Japanese plants with the lessons learned from the Kumamoto earthquakes, aiming to establish standards for the anti-earthquake measures needed to secure employee safety. Sony has also established its own building fire prevention standards to address fire risks and ensure business continuity as part of its overall effort to reduce risks at each site. With the increase in water damage in recent years caused by climate change and other factors, Sony has conducted a new survey on flooding risk at its sites and is taking precautionary measures to mitigate damage and ensure quick recovery.\n\nFor each of its businesses, Sony formulates and manages crisis management and BCP to minimize the impact of any disruption of business. To make these initiatives more effective, Sony ensures that the companies and organizations in its corporate group collaborate on practical drills to better ensure business continuity and prepare for the rapid restoration of operations. In addition, Sony Group headquarters has established a group-wide crisis management and business continuity framework for reviewing crisis management and BCP at each of its businesses and preparing for incidents and business disruptions that would significantly impact the entire Group. The Group also conducts management training designed to enhance the effectiveness of this framework. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2019 and has had a significant global impact, Sony has put a Group crisis management system in place, placing the highest priority on ensuring the safety of employees and others and preventing the spread of the virus, as well as taking swift action to minimize the impact on Sony businesses.\n\nSony also shared the lessons it learned in the recovery effort following the Kumamoto earthquakes with related enterprises and regional companies through industry associations, helping to strengthen industrial competitiveness and supply chains in Japan.\n\nSony recognizes the importance of BCP to its business strategy. Taking into account its experience with large-scale emergencies, Sony will continue to implement effective, practical measures, such as enhancing risk management across its group-wide supply chains.\n\nInformation Security\n\nLike many companies, Sony faces increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats, so the importance of information security continues to grow. In recent years, malicious actors seeking to compromise the information of global companies continue to grow in number, and their attack methods are becoming more advanced. To address this situation and ensure that Sony continues to earn customers\u2019 trust, Sony maintains and enhances a robust information security program. Led by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Sony\u2019s information security program is grounded in a company-wide governance structure. Sony manages potential risks effectively, incorporates security controls into systems and products to safeguard information, trains employees and business partners to understand how their actions can introduce information security risk, and deploys 24/7 monitoring and response capabilities to swiftly address attacks.\n\nInformation Security Governance\n\nSony\u2019s information security program is governed by a set of global policies and standards based on internationally accepted industry best practices. These policies set forth Sony\u2019s commitment to information security and define practices and procedures to be followed by Sony executives and employees to help protect information resources and information systems from unauthorized access, leakage, falsification, loss, destruction, and other security risks. Sony routinely reviews and revises these policies and standards to address changes in the risk landscape, threats, and the regulatory environment. The CISO monitors the global implementation of and compliance with those policies. The CISO\u2019s office coordinates with the executive information security officers (EISOs) responsible for information security at Sony Group companies to create a Group-wide information security management system. These officers ensure effective implementation of policies and standards. Strong Board of Directors and executive support for, and governance of, information security is essential. The Sony Group Board of Directors and Sony senior management are regularly informed of cybersecurity risk and information security program activities. The directors in charge of information security review information security activities frequently, and the CISO briefs the full Board of Directors regularly on the activities.\n\nSenior management at Sony and its Group companies also review security activities regularly and play an active role in managing risks within their respective organizations and work to instill a culture of security awareness in all employees. Sony Group companies have set up information security management committees to fulfill this responsibility.\nEmployee Training as a Key Component of Information Security\n\nEvery employee has a critical role to play in protecting Sony\u2019s most sensitive information. To increase Sony employees\u2019 awareness of information security threats, Sony requires all personnel to receive annual information security training, where they learn how to report incidents and study the types of behaviors they must avoid in order to reduce risk. Sony employees also regularly receive phishing awareness training, which tests employees\u2019 knowledge of how to spot and avoid cyber-attacks delivered through fraudulent emails.\n\nMonitoring and Response Measures\n\nSony has a 24/7 global security operations center equipped with advanced technical capabilities to prevent and manage information security incidents. Sony\u2019s incident response team defends the company\u2019s information infrastructure by using threat intelligence and analysis, monitoring and detection of malicious activity, rapid response and containment, and sophisticated forensics capabilities.\n\nStrengthening Measures Against New Threats\n\nSony is committed to safeguarding the trust of customers, employees, and business partners. Sony continuously looks for ways to improve practices, implement stronger controls, and provide more robust security against new threats, all in order to protect the personal data information entrusted to its care. To do this, Sony employs and invests in a workforce of information security professionals and subject matter experts.\n\nStructure of Audit by the Audit Committee, Internal Audit and Accounting Audit, and Status Thereof\n\nAudit structure and status of the Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee conducts the audit of the performance of duties by Directors and Corporate Executive Officers pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, and the Charter of the Audit Committee established by the Board, through deliberation at Audit Committee meetings (held six times during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020), activities of Audit Committee Members (for example, reviewing reports relating to the execution of duties by the Corporate Executive Officers and employees of Sony Corporation, or directors, statutory auditors and employees of major subsidiaries of Sony Group and visiting audits at Sony\u2019s business sites), and activities of the Audit Committee supporting personnel (the Audit Committee Aide).\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee conducts the \u201corganizational audit\u201d in cooperation with divisions in charge of internal audit and divisions in charge of internal control of Sony Group. Through the process, the Audit Committee receives periodic reports from these divisions at the Audit Committee meetings or other meetings to be held from time to time, requests them to conduct necessary investigation, and receives reports on its process and result. The Audit Committee also assesses the eligibility and the independence of the independent auditor and the adequacy of the audit by receiving a report from the independent auditor that the organization of quality control of the auditor, the independence, professional ethics, expertise and the effectiveness and the efficiency of the audit, pre-confirming the audit plan at the beginning of each fiscal year, pre-approving auditor compensation, and reviewing the report of the procedures, and the result of the audit, for the last fiscal year and interim periods including review of quarterly financial reports and evaluating their content.\n\nInternal audit structure and status\n\nSony Corporation established a department in charge of internal audit, the Risk & Control Department, which coordinates closely with the internal audit departments of major subsidiaries around the world, and Sony Group Internal Audit Charter, and endeavors to maintain and enhance the internal audit structure of Sony Group in order to promote Sony Group\u2019s internal audit activities on a global basis. The Risk & Control Department and each internal audit department of major subsidiaries of Sony (\"Internal Audit Department\") play an important function in maintaining Sony Group\u2019s governance in order to strengthen Sony Group\u2019s management structure, promote efficiency of management, and maintain and avoid any loss of material assets, including Sony\u2019s brand image, by evaluating the effectiveness of the internal control system and risk management structure of Sony through independent and objective audit. The Risk & Control Department and each Internal Audit Department conduct the internal audit of each department or subsidiary that they supervise, in accordance with the annual audit plan that is established based on the risk assessments conducted in the beginning of each fiscal year and any matters proposed by Sony\u2019s management or the Audit Committee. Each internal audit is conducted under the planned audit procedure. Afterward, each Internal Audit Department follows up until the completion of any improvement plan developed based on the audit result. In order to ensure its independence, fairness and objectiveness, the appointment and dismissal of the head of the Risk & Control Department is subject to the prior approval of the Audit Committee. The appointment and dismissal of the person in charge of each Internal Audit Department also require the prior approval of the head of the Risk & Control Department.\n\nThe Internal Audit Departments of major subsidiaries are required to provide the Risk & Control Department with a report on the material items and a copy of the issued audit report, and the Risk & Control Department makes periodic presentations on such report to the Audit Committee, the CFO, and the Corporate Executive Officer in charge of internal audit. The Risk & Control Department also make periodic reports to the independent auditor on the status of the internal audit activities and the result of the audit. The audit report issued by the independent auditor is used for the planning of the internal audit and conducting the internal audit.\nAccounting audit status\nSony\u2019s accounting audit is conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata under an agreement. The certified public accountants who conducted the accounting audit of Sony for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, are as follows: Hitoshi Kiuchi, Takaaki Ino and Masataka Kubota. The team at PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata that conducted Sony\u2019s accounting audit is composed of 98 certified public accountants, 85 assistant certified public accountants and 205 other staff members.\n\nPolicy and Governance Framework on Tax Strategy\n\nTax Policy\nThe Sony Group conducts its business, including managing its tax obligations, honestly, ethically and with integrity. Sony Group Code of Conduct defines that it is Sony\u2019s policy to comply with all applicable tax laws and regulations of each country and region where Sony conducts business as well as the common rules and guidance regarding international taxation. Sony understands and complies with the laws and regulations that apply to their work.\n\nGovernance Structure\nBased on the above global tax policy, each Sony group company has the responsibility to understand and comply with tax laws and regulations applicable to its businesses, with support from the group\u2019s Global Tax Office (the GTO), which is in charge of Sony\u2019s overall tax position. The global head of the GTO reports directly to Sony Corporation\u2019s Chief Financial Officer based in Japan. The GTO has implemented a series of processes and controls to identify, manage and report tax risk appropriately. These include regular updates with Finance teams; documented review processes; regular training for staff involved in tax return preparation and review; and regular updates with the global head of the GTO.\n\nTransactional taxes such as VAT and sales taxes, Customs Duty, Employment Taxes and others are the ultimate responsibility of the relevant divisional Finance Director. The GTO has strong links with these divisional Finance Directors to ensure that in the event of material risks being identified or errors made, the GTO provides support including where necessary liaising with the relevant tax authority.\n\nApproach to Tax Planning\nSony operates diverse businesses within a complex global environment, in which tax is an important factor. Sony believes in taking a principled and responsible approach to managing its tax affairs, in line with business objectives. The tax function provides appropriate input as part of the approval process for business proposals to ensure the tax consequences are clearly understood. Sony is committed to fulfilling its obligation both to comply with applicable tax laws and to safeguard Sony\u2019s reputation. The jurisdictions in which Sony does business may offer various tax incentives such as enhanced deductions, credits and exemptions for certain types of income and expense to meet local policy objectives such as encouraging inward investment. Sony believes it has a duty to its shareholders to take advantage of such incentives where they are generally available to all taxpayers who meet the relevant criteria and the requirements to claim the incentive do not conflict with broader business objectives.\n\nTax Risks\nSony employs diligent professional care and judgement in assessing tax risk, and may take advice from third-party specialists and where appropriate consult with or obtain rulings from relevant tax authorities to support the decision-making process. However, tax law is not always clear and unambiguous, and differences in interpretation can arise. Sony monitors its tax positions closely and will not record an accounting benefit unless it determines based on consideration of the facts and the law that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained.\n\nDealing with Tax Authorities\nSony seeks to maintain good professional relationships with tax authorities. When providing responses to Tax Authority questions, all responses are based on an honest and accurate representation of the facts as Sony understands them.\n\nTransparency\nSony prepares and files annually a country by country report in accordance with Japanese law and prepares and files a transfer pricing master file in accordance with the laws of the countries where Sony does businesses.\nRelationship with Shareholders and Other Stakeholders\n\nSony\u2019s core corporate responsibility to society is to strive to enhance its corporate value through innovation and sound business practice. Sony recognizes that its business activities have direct and indirect impact on the societies in which Sony operates, and therefore sound business practice requires that Sony\u2019s business decisions give due consideration to the interests of Sony\u2019s stakeholders including shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, business partners, local communities and other organizations. Personnel must endeavor to conduct the business of Sony accordingly.\n\nPolicy for Constructive Dialogue with Shareholders\n\nSony Corporation\u2019s policy on investor relations is to make public disclosures which are timely and fair, accurate and easily understandable, and provide a comprehensive picture, with the goal of maximizing Sony Corporation\u2019s enterprise value by building a relationship of trust with shareholders and investors. Pursuant to this policy, the Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) appoints the CFO as the Corporate Executive Officer in charge of IR activities. Under the CFO\u2019s supervision, the department in charge of IR (\u201cIR Department\u201d) works to promote constructive dialogue with Sony Corporation\u2019s shareholders and investors. As a part of these efforts, the IR Department engages in various activities to enhance the manner and frequency of dialogue with shareholders and investors. These go beyond one-on-one meetings to include investor briefings, corporate strategy meetings and business unit briefings like \u201cIR Day.\u201d The IR Department also coordinates internally to gather information necessary to guide the dialogue with shareholders and investors. Further, the IR Department evaluates the opinions and concerns expressed from shareholders and investors and conveys appropriate feedback regarding those opinions and concerns to the Corporate Executive Officers in charge and the Board.\n\nWhen holding dialogue with shareholders and investors, any insider information shall not be disclosed. The IR Department reviews information to be disclosed in advance with other relevant departments, such as legal department, and outside experts, as appropriate.\n\nDisclosure Framework\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nAdministration of the General Shareholders Meeting\n\nSony Corporation\u2019s policy on administration of the general shareholders meeting is as follows.\n\nBasic policy for the general shareholders meeting\n\nSony Corporation endeavors to develop open environment where each shareholder could easily make a statement by the following two points, as the basic policy for the general shareholders meeting.\n\n- To take necessary measures to encourage the shareholders who find it difficult to attend the shareholders\u2019 meeting to vote\n- To encourage direct communications between the shareholders who attend the shareholders meeting and Sony Corporation\u2019s management\n\nSony Corporation sets the date of the general shareholders meeting appropriately, depending on venue availability. Further, Sony Corporation displays the voting results gathered before the shareholders meeting date on the screen of the meeting hall during the voting in order to operate the shareholders meeting in a transparent manner.\n\nActivities to secure the rights of shareholders\n\nSony Corporation endeavors to develop an environment in which shareholders could exercise their rights appropriately and effectively, to secure equal treatment of shareholders, including institutional investors who hold shares in a street name, and to consider concerns of minority shareholders and foreign shareholders adequately, through confirming shareholder composition quarterly. As a part of these activities, Sony Corporation prepares the convocation notice, giving consideration to the accuracy of the information provided therein and the readability of such notice to facilitate informed voting by shareholders, both in Japanese and English. Sony Corporation strives to send the convocation notice for the general shareholders meeting early enough to give shareholders sufficient time to consider the agenda and posts it at its website. Sony Corporation also uses an electronic voting platform to allow electronic voting through the internet (via PC, smartphone or mobile phone). For more information on the general shareholders meeting, please refer to the page below.\n\nShareholders\u2019 Meeting\n\nReview of voting results\n\nThe voting results for each agenda item of the general shareholders meeting and its analysis are reported to and reviewed by the Board as appropriate. The IR Department then takes any appropriate follow-up measures, such as engaging in dialogue with shareholders.\nRelationship with Other Stakeholders\n\nAs a part of the Sony Group Code of Conduct, CEO communicates and implements our thoughts and initiatives about Sony\u2019s social responsibility and relationship with stakeholders in Sony Group. The Board periodically receives report on the status of the communications and the implementation of the Code of Conduct and reviews such report.\n\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct\n\nSony Corporation understands that there are various challenges in society, such as Sustainable Development Goals (\u201cSDGs\u201d) and identifies material challenges highly relevant with Sony\u2019s business operations, such as environmental challenges, diversity inclusions through CSR Materiality Assessment. Sony Corporation will aim to engage in CSR activities with understanding of such material challenges.\n\nApproach to Sustainability\n\nEnvironmental Policies and Targets\n\nDiversity Principle and engagements\n\nGender, Sexual Orientation, Disabilities: Promoting Greater Opportunities for Women\n\nShareholdings in Other Listed Companies\n\nSony Corporation and its subsidiaries may acquire and/or hold shares of other listed companies for the purpose of expanding Sony\u2019s business portfolio, promoting certain businesses within Sony and enhancing Sony\u2019s relationships with the companies whose shares it holds. Sony\u2019s policy regarding shareholdings of listed companies (excluding Sony\u2019s subsidiaries), and its policy for exercising voting rights are as follows:\n\nPolicy regarding shareholdings of listed companies\n\n- Shareholding policy\n\nSony Corporation and its subsidiaries decide whether to acquire or continue to hold shares of listed companies (excluding the acquisition and holding of shares by Sony Corporation\u2019s listed subsidiaries, and Sony Corporation\u2019s shareholding in its own listed subsidiaries) based on an appropriate examination of each investment, and choose to engage in such shareholding only if it is judged to further Sony\u2019s business purposes and to have sufficient economic rationale. If it is determined that investments do not meet these criteria, Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries will avoid or reduce exposure to such holdings.\n\n- Assessment of rationale for shareholding\n\nIn all cases where Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries hold shares in listed companies (excluding shares held by Sony Corporation\u2019s listed subsidiaries, and Sony Corporation\u2019s shareholdings in its own listed subsidiaries) for reasons other than for the sole purpose of investment, Sony Corporation carries out a yearly review to assess the rationale for shareholding, the importance of Sony\u2019s business relationship with each company whose shares it holds (taking into account the progress of, and outlook for, any anticipated business collaboration between Sony and said company), and any anticipated positive impact of such shareholdings on Sony\u2019s business relationship with the company. In addition, Sony Corporation also assesses the appropriateness of these shareholdings by considering the potential of each investment to contribute to mid- to long-term value creation in Sony, via an assessment of expected return on investment and cost of capital. These evaluations are first carried out on the management side, after which the Board, which is responsible for overseeing business operation, carries out its own assessment based on the result of the evaluations by the management side.\n\n- Details of the assessment carried out by the Board of Directors\n\nBased on the above policy, at the Board meeting held on June 26, 2020, Sony carried out an assessment of the rationale for its and its subsidiaries\u2019 shareholdings in listed companies (excluding shares held by Sony Corporation\u2019s listed subsidiaries, and Sony\u2019s shareholdings in its own listed subsidiaries) as of March 31, 2020. As a result of the assessment, it was determined that Sony should consider reducing its exposure to certain holdings, which are currently being reviewed.\n\nPolicy for exercising voting rights\n\nSony Corporation believes in the importance of enhancing the corporate value of the listed companies whose shares it holds, and Sony Corporation\u2019s own corporate value in turn, through the exercise of its voting rights. Accordingly, Sony aims to exercise its voting rights with the intention of increasing each company\u2019s mid- to long-term corporate value, after a comprehensive consideration of both the significance and economic rationale of its shareholdings, and the details of proposals. Sony Corporation has established internal rules determining what factors should be taken into account when considering proposals about matters such as the appropriation of retained earnings, the appointment of directors, statutory auditors and accounting auditors, as well as shareholder proposals. Through these rules, Sony Corporation makes appropriate decisions regarding the exercise of its voting rights.\nBusiness relations with companies who invest in Sony Corporation\n\nShould a company who holds shares of Sony Corporation\u2019s stock express the intention to sell such shares, Sony Corporation will not attempt to obstruct such sale by threatening to limit business transactions with said company, and will not engage in any transactions that would harm the common interests of the company or its shareholders.\n\nAnti-Hostile-Takeover Measures\n\nSony Corporation has not adopted any anti-hostile takeover measures. Sony Corporation will fully examine the necessity and rationale with respect to the adoption or implementation of anti-hostile takeover measures with the Board and/or the Audit Committee and once complete, will provide sufficient explanation to shareholders.\n\nRelated-Party Transactions\n\nAs a part of the Sony Group Code of Conduct established by the Board, Sony Corporation\u2019s officers and personnel are prohibited to commit any conduct where their loyalties may be divided between Sony Corporation\u2019s interests and their own interests. To help ensure compliance with these requirements, Sony Corporation regularly reviews the status of related-party transactions, whether financial or otherwise, between Sony companies and officers in the Sony or their close relatives. Furthermore, Sony Corporation requires its Directors and officers to obtain approval of the Board in connection with transactions between Sony Corporation and the Director or officer in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the Board Charter and any other applicable internal rules. The Board is expected to approve any such related-party transactions only after appropriate examination of the size and nature of the transaction, the requirements of applicable laws and regulations, the Board Charter and any other applicable internal rules, and concluding that the interests of Sony Corporation and its shareholders are not adversely affected.\n\nPolicy for Shareholder Returns\n\nSony Corporation believes that continuously increasing corporate value and providing dividends are essential to rewarding shareholders. It is Sony Corporation\u2019s policy to utilize retained earnings, after ensuring the perpetuation of stable dividends, to carry out various investments that contribute to an increase in corporate value, such as those that ensure future growth and strengthen competitiveness. Going forward, Sony Corporation will determine the amount of dividends based on an overall consideration of its consolidated operating results, financial condition and future business expectations.\n\nRoles of Corporate Pension Funds as Asset Owners\n\nSony Corporation owns, as a domestic corporate pension plan, a closed-end defined-benefit corporate pension (the \u201cPension Plan\u201d). The Pension Plan manages its assets in line with its Basic Pension Plan Management Policy (the \u201cBasic Management Policy\u201d) which was set to secure beneficiaries\u2019 right of benefit and to increase the benefit. In order to realize prudent and appropriate asset management structure in the Pension Plan, Sony Corporation appoints asset management director of the Pension Plan who should have proper knowledge and skills, based on the nomination by Senior General Manager of Sony Corporation\u2019s Finance Department, and the Pension Plan appoints external advisor to supplement their specialties in asset management. Any decisions on fund management are made by the person who has the ultimate authority in accordance with the Basic Management Policy, after deliberation at the pension committee, which is composed of heads and/or personnel of HR Department, Accounting Department and Finance Department which are related to management of the Pension Plan, and then, potential conflict of interests between Sony Corporation and the Pension Plan is properly controlled.\n\nIn addition, the asset management guidelines are issued to the managing trustee, and the compliance status pursuant to the said guidelines are periodically reviewed and evaluated.\nManagement Approach\n\nMateriality Rationale\nIntegrity and Sincerity is Sony\u2019s key values to achieve its Purpose. Sony\u2019s ethics and compliance program supports Sony\u2019s value creation by ensuring that Sony personnel throughout Sony\u2019s diverse business portfolio work together to deliver emotional experiences to Sony customers in an ethically responsible manner generating trust for the Sony Brand.\n\nSony\u2019s Approach\nSony\u2019s ethics and compliance program is designed to manage key group-wide risks and create a culture of integrity to ensure ethical and responsible business conduct. Sony\u2019s program is continuously improved based on evolving best practices and global regulatory expectations. The Sony Group Code of Conduct is the cornerstone of Sony\u2019s ethics and compliance program and supports Sony\u2019s diversity as well as commitment to creating social value. The Code identifies basic standards of ethical and responsible business conduct aligned with Sony\u2019s ethical values. Sony has also adopted in-depth group-wide policies, procedures and controls for key risk areas such as antitrust, anti-corruption, privacy and personal information management. Senior management evidences its commitment to ethical business conduct by repeatedly communicating the importance of staying true to the Code and leading by example.\n\nStructure\nSony has instituted a global and regional network and structure, which covers all Sony Group companies to ensure effective implementation and oversight over our ethics and compliance program.\n\nMilestones\n2001: Established the Compliance Division in Sony Corporation (Current \u201cCompliance & Privacy Department\u201d)\n2003: Adopted the Sony Group Code of Conduct\nEstablishment of the Compliance Hotline (Current \u201cSony Ethics & Compliance Hotline\u201d)\nEstablishment of the Global Compliance Network which consists of regional offices of Global Entertainment & Americas, Europe, Japan, East-Asia and Pan-Asia\n2008: Established the Compliance Monitoring Team\n2009: Established the Compliance Leadership Team\n2018: Revision of Sony Group Code of Conduct\n2020: Honored as one of \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Ethical Companies\u201d for the 2nd consecutive year\n\nLooking to the Future\nSony continuously assess its risks and the program and improves its program to help maintain its culture of integrity and ethical conduct by all Sony personnel. Senior management will continue to allocate necessary resources to our program to achieve Sony\u2019s goal of ethical and responsible business conduct and compliance with laws and regulations.\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct\n\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct (\"the Code\") is the cornerstone of Sony\u2019s ethics and compliance program and underlines a shared obligation to foster Sony\u2019s culture of integrity and protect Sony\u2019s reputation. The Code applies to all Sony board members, officers and employees (\"Sony personnel\")\n\nSony\u2019s Core Ethical Values\n\nSony promotes innovation through its commitment to ethical and responsible business conduct. Sony\u2019s culture of integrity is built upon accountability to the core ethical values of Fairness, Integrity, Honesty, Respect and Responsibility which guide how Sony personnel work with colleagues, business partners and the communities in which Sony does business to fulfill Sony\u2019s Purpose & Values.\n\nSony Group Code of Conduct\n\nSony updates the Code from time to time, as part of its continued effort to maintain the Code\u2019s effectiveness and provide clear direction and resources on relevant topics. Sony also recognizes its responsibility as a member of a global society and the Code reflects principles set out in global ethical guidelines, which include (among others):\n\n- Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n- The United Nations Global Compact\n- The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n- The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nSony also participated in the formulation of (and updates of) and observes the standards in the Charter of Corporate Behavior of Keidanren (Japan Business Federation), an alliance of Japan\u2019s leading corporations. These standards are also embodied in the Code.\n\nThe Code confirms that Sony must be true to its core ethical values in every aspect of its business operations and includes guidance on key risk areas.\n\n- Accurate recordkeeping\n- Anti-corruption/bribery\n- Antitrust / fair competition\n- Avoiding conflicts of interest\n- Diversity / anti-discrimination / equal employment opportunity / fair labor and employment practice / proper workplace conduct\n- Fair dealing (fair business practices)\n- Privacy (e.g., data privacy of employees, customers, consumers) and cyber security\n- Protection of human rights\n- Financial integrity and anti-fraud\n- Speaking up / no retaliation\n- Tax compliance\n- Workplace health and safety\n\nCode Implementation\n\nThe Code was approved by the Sony Corporation Board of Directors and adopted by every Sony group company (the \"Sony Group\" or the \"Sony Group companies\") as its code of conduct through its decision-making body. Sony Group leaders are responsible for promoting the Code as part of ongoing commitment to creating a culture of integrity and ensuring ethical and responsible business conduct.\n\nThe Code, which is available on Sony\u2019s website and on each Sony Group company\u2019s intranet, has been translated into 23 languages to help ensure that it is clearly understood by the employees and relevant third parties. Sony will provide additional translations as may be necessitated by changing workforce demographics.\n\nAll Sony Group employees and selected third party staff are required to complete comprehensive Code of Conduct training within 90 days of hire or the commencement of provision of service and refresher Code of Conduct training periodically thereafter. In addition, Sony provides in-depth training on key risk areas at least once per year. Sony also provides frequent messaging about key risk areas and related policies, and topics of the Code to ensure that all employees are well aware of those.\n\nSony Group Code of Conduct (PDF) [PDF-622KB]\nEthics and Compliance Program\n\nThe Basics of Sony\u2019s Ethics and Compliance Program\n\nSony\u2019s ethics and compliance program starts with \u201cTone from the Top.\u201d Senior management continuously and repeatedly communicates the importance of being true to Sony\u2019s core ethical values. Their commitment is supported by a robust ethics and compliance program aligned with integral business processes including policies and procedures, training, ongoing risk assessments, program assessment and surveys, third-party risk management, monitoring and audits. Sony continuously improves its program in accordance with regulatory guidance and other leading practices that organizations with mature ethics and compliance programs have found to be effective.\n\nSony\u2019s program includes mandatory ethics and compliance communications and training to be provided to all employees and relevant third parties. All Sony employees and relevant third parties are required to complete Code of Conduct and Proper Workplace Conduct training within 90 days of hire or the commencement of provision of service. Sony Group personnel are also required to complete a risk-based compliance training curriculum based upon roles and responsibilities.\n\nKey Compliance Trainings (assigned based upon risk assessments) include:\n\n- Anti-Bribery\n- Economic Sanctions Compliance\n- Customer Due Diligence\n- Antitrust and Fair Competition\n- Import / Export Trade Compliance\n- Information Security and Privacy\n- Manager Training\n\nGlobal Ethics and Compliance Network\n\nSony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program strongly supports its ethical and responsible business conduct. Sony established a group-wide ethics & compliance network (\u201cGlobal Ethics & Compliance Network\u201d) under the leadership of the Corporate Executive Officer in charge of compliance and the Senior Vice President in charge of compliance. The Sony Corporation Compliance & Privacy Department leads Sony\u2019s group-wide ethics and compliance program with support by the Compliance Leadership Team comprised of subject matter experts, the Head of Compliance Monitoring and its Regional Compliance Officers. The Global Ethics & Compliance Network establishes (i) centralized risk management framework in line with best practices, (ii) monitors compliance with the risk management framework, (iii) provides necessary support, and (iv) collects and analyzes the information to provide effective oversight, address gaps, and drive consistency and continuous improvement across all Sony Group companies.\n\nGlobal Ethics and Compliance Network\n\n- Corporate Executive Officer in charge of Compliance\n- Senior Vice President in charge of Compliance\n- Headquarter: Compliance & Privacy Department\n- Compliance Monitoring\n- Regional Compliance Network\n\n- The Senior Vice President in charge of compliance appoints the Regional Compliance Officer for each geographic region who is responsible for establishing and maintaining the ethics and compliance program in his or her region to promote ethical and responsible business conduct and prevent and detect violations of laws, regulations and company policies. Each regional compliance officer must also ensure that each Sony Group company in his or her region has designated appropriate personnel embedded in the business and responsible for compliance at such company. Above all, Sony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program is a shared endeavor and is successful through the team effort of directors, management and employees at all levels, with each person taking ownership and responsibility for compliance with the law and in every interaction.\n\n- The Sony Corporation Compliance & Privacy Department establishes a group-wide ethics and compliance program and oversees actions taken by compliance personnel assigned to each Sony Group company through Global Ethics & Compliance Network. In addition, Compliance & Privacy Department works with the Compliance Leadership Team members and local business unit leaders and compliance members to conduct comprehensive risk assessments and implement compliance policies, procedures and internal controls to prevent and detect unethical behavior. It provides oversight of the investigation of and follow-up on any incidence of policy non-compliance or potential violation of law. Sony also has a Compliance Monitoring function, which measures the effectiveness and maturity of Sony\u2019s overall ethics and compliance program by conducting periodic assessments of program design and implementation on global basis. It also conducts risk-based compliance audits and validations of controls.\n\n- The Sony Corporation Board of Director\u2019s Audit Committee provides ultimate oversight of Sony\u2019s program and receives monthly reports and periodic in-person updates about the ethics and compliance program activities. Reports to the Board\u2019s Audit Committee provide program performance results, compliance hotline metrics, employee training data, and new program and communications initiatives, as well as updates on global regulatory developments.\nPromoting a Speak Up/Listen Up Culture\n\nSony believes that a \u201cspeak-up/listen up\u201d culture \u2014 where employees are encouraged to raise concerns and feel confident that they can do so without fear of retaliation \u2014 is a key to early detection and prevention of ethical and regulatory problems.\n\nMultiple Reporting Channels\n\nSony has an open reporting program and provides many different types of resources to employees to enable them to raise concerns, including the Sony Group Ethics & Compliance Hotline (\u201cHotline\u201d). The Hotline is available online (in 27 different languages) or by phone, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The phone lines are staffed by specially trained third-party representatives, and translators are available to assist when needed, in up to 52 different languages. All information provided to the Hotline is handled confidentially. Calls to the Hotline are not recorded or traced, and reporters may remain anonymous to the extent permitted by law.\n\nSony Ethics & Compliance Hotline Key Features\n\n- Phone calls available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n- Web site available in 27 languages\n- Phone call available in 52 languages\n\nHow Sony Operates the Hotline\n\nIn FY 2019, the Hotline received approximately 440 reports covering issues primarily relating to employment, labor, work environment and information management. Approximately 73% of the reports raised issues related to employees, diversity and workplace respect. All issues raised through the Hotline are promptly reviewed for investigation and, if supported by the findings, disciplinary or corrective action is taken. 39% of reports received in FY 2019 were substantiated and many resulted in remediation. Sony provides information about its reporting statistics to senior management and the Audit Committee of Sony Corporation to help assure effective oversight.\n\nSony Ethics & Compliance Hotline\n\nCorporate Executive Officer and Senior Vice President in Charge of Compliance\n\nSupervise\n\nReport\n\nCompliance & Privacy Department\n\nRegional Compliance Officers\n\nInvestigate and Resolve\n\nReport\n\nSony Corporation Audit Committee\n\nHow Sony Promotes Speak-Up Resources\n\nSony continuously promotes the need to raise concerns and the resources Sony has made available for employees to raise concerns to. For example, the Sony Group Code of Conduct clearly states that speaking up is the responsibility of every employee to protect their colleagues and Sony. The Code of Conduct training provides guidance on the importance of reporting concerns, and is supplemented by ongoing quarterly messages highlighting Sony\u2019s open reporting program. Sony also provides training to its managers on how to create an environment where employees feel comfortable speaking up when they observe unethical behavior, how to handle reports and how to prevent retaliation since Sony understands that the employees may prefer to raise concerns with their manager in the first instance. Sony does not tolerate retaliation against anyone who participates in an investigation or raises a concern in good faith and vigorously enforces and promotes its policy against retaliation.\nFor Ethical and Responsible Business Conduct\n\nSony is firmly committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations and conducting ethical and responsible business in an honest and fair manner. Sony establishes and maintains internal rules and policies and framework for complying with applicable laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption, antitrust, anti-money laundering, economic sanctions, trade control, tax and financial crimes laws, and takes all reasonable measures to prevent illegal/sanctionable transactions.\n\nSony\u2019s Anti-Corruption Efforts\n\nSony prohibits any form of corrupt practices. Sony believes that corruption negatively impacts the economy and must be eliminated to build a sustainable, inclusive and transparent society. Sony closely monitors global anti-corruption law enactment and enforcement trends to ensure that Sony\u2019s global ethics and compliance program and internal controls properly address these evolving risks.\n\nAnti-bribery policy and procedure\n\nAll Sony Group personnel are required to read, understand and follow the Sony Group Anti-Bribery Policy and the Sony Group Code of Conduct, which include anti-corruption expectations for all personnel. Sony\u2019s approach to compliance in this critical area is multifaceted. Key features include:\n\n- Sony\u2019s corporate policies and procedures prohibit improper payments in every transaction, whether with a government or with a private party. The Sony Group Anti-Bribery Policy was most recently revised in 2018, and establishes policies and procedures that all Sony Group personnel must adhere to when interacting with officials of various governments around the world, including strict limitation on the type of expenditures that are permitted and pre-approval requirements.\n- Third parties who will interact with governments on Sony\u2019s behalf, joint venture partners, and parties to acquisitions and certain investments are subject to due diligence and legal pre-approval by each Sony Group company from time to time and relevant third parties must agree to abide by Sony\u2019s anti-bribery policy.\n- Sony provides extensive training and support to assist local management with policy compliance. Tailored trainings are provided to management and employees depending on their respective roles as explained below. Refresher training is provided at least every two years, and more frequently based on risk assessments.\n\n<For all employees>: Provides training when hired on the Sony Group Code of Conduct, which includes anti-corruption expectations.\n<For selected employee groups (i.e. senior management, finance, legal, marketing, sales, real estate, corporate development, tax, audit, anyone involved in procurement and any other employees identified as dealing with government officials) >: Provides more focused anti-corruption training, which includes training on Sony\u2019s specific policy pre-approval and due diligence requirements.\n\n<For legal, finance, other control personnel and higher-risk personnel>: Provides live training on necessary basis.\n- Concerns are promptly investigated and remediated and testing activities are monitored until completed.\n- Sony has implemented robust internal controls and accounting processes designed to detect and prevent violations of company policy relating to improper payment risks and to ensure accurate books and records.\n- Sony conducts periodic anti-corruption assessments and audits of the business to raise overall awareness, detect potential misconduct and monitor compliance with anti-corruption laws and policy.\n\nSony continues to leverage opportunities to share learnings and successful practices across its system.\n\nAntitrust and Competition Law Compliance\n\nSony wants to outperform the competition based on the merits of Sony\u2019s products and services, not because of unfair business practices. Sony complies with antitrust and competition laws and does its part to promote a fair, competitive marketplace. Sony has implemented the Sony Group Policy on Antitrust/Competition Law Compliance, which explains the purposes of competition laws and guides employees on compliance with such laws. Sony has also developed robust, customized training courses to raise awareness regarding competition laws and to reinforce the policy requirements. In addition, Sony legal personnel monitor changes and developments in competition laws and maintain up-to-date controls, policies and procedures for compliance with these laws.\nDue Diligence on Sony\u2019s Business Partners / Economic Sanctions and Trade Control Laws / Anti-Social Forces\n\nSony adopted group wide policies related to anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, economic sanctions compliance, and trade laws and customs law compliance. Sony performs risk-based due diligence procedures on its business partners (such as customers, joint venture partners, acquisition targets and other third parties) to verify the identity of its business partners and help ensure that Sony is only doing business with reputable business partners. This screening protects Sony Group companies from being involved in transactions involving the proceeds of criminal conduct and/or with entities or individuals who are blacklisted under economic sanctions and/or trade control laws. Sony also trains its business people on relevant \u201cred flags\u201d to ensure ongoing monitoring to detect and prevent any illegal conduct by third parties with whom it does business and to ensure that Sony only does business with reputable third parties. These policies and procedures also ensure that Sony does not do business with members of organized crime and other anti-social forces. Sony strongly opposes anti-social forces that threaten to disrupt the order and safety of the community. Sony will not have relationships with members of anti-social forces and will not give economic benefits to, or accept illegal demands from them.\n\nPrivacy and Personal Information Management\n\nSony believes it is important to protect the personal information of Sony\u2019s customers, employees and other stakeholders and thus building trust. Sony has entered a new digital age, where the global privacy landscape and advancements in information and communication technology are changing at a faster pace than ever before. In the wake of the European General Data Protection Regulation, new privacy laws have emerged, continuing to raise the bar for privacy compliance across the world. Rapidly evolving cloud-based solutions and social media platforms, smartphones and other mobile devices, Big Data and transformative technologies such as AI, means Sony faces new privacy challenges and risks every day. To be able to respond to these changes and to ensure Sony continues to earn stakeholders\u2019 trust, Sony maintains a robust global privacy program. Sony\u2019s approach to privacy continues to be grounded in a group-wide governance structure that enables the effective management of potential risks and incorporates privacy controls into business processes, systems and products to safeguard the personal information of Sony customers, employees and other stakeholders.\n\nPrivacy Governance\n\nLed by Sony Corporation\u2019s Senior Vice President responsible for Privacy, Sony has a governance structure of privacy and personal information management that covers the entire Sony Group. Sony\u2019s privacy management is governed by a set of global policies and standards, which are based on applicable laws, principles and best practices. These policies set forth Sony\u2019s group-wide commitment to privacy and define practices and procedures to be followed by Sony executives and employees to ensure appropriate handling and protection of the personal information that Sony collects, stores and/or processes. Sony routinely reviews and revises these policies and standards to address changes in the risk landscape, and the regulatory environment. Sony Corporation\u2019s Senior Vice President responsible for Privacy monitors the global implementation of and compliance with those policies.\n\nUnder the direction of Sony Corporation\u2019s Senior Vice President responsible for Privacy, Privacy Officers and legal departments responsible for privacy and personal information management at Sony Group companies work together and ensure effective implementation of policies and standards.\n\nStrong executive support for, and governance of privacy are essential. Accordingly, executives at Sony headquarter and each Sony Group company take responsibility for playing an active role in managing privacy risks within their organizations and instilling a culture that respects privacy and builds trust.\n\nSafeguarding Privacy and Personal Information\n\nSony continues to enhance protection of personal information by evaluating and addressing privacy risks through the use of a global privacy management framework that promotes the integration of privacy principles and requirements into Sony\u2019s data processing activities. To maintain the stakeholders\u2019 trust, Sony continuously looks for ways to improve practices, implement stronger controls, and provide more robust security to protect personal information and other information entrusted to its care.\n\nEmployee Training\n\nSony believes every employee has a role to play in safeguarding privacy. To increase the education and awareness of our workforce, Sony requires all employees to receive information security and privacy training.\nManagement Approach\n\nMateriality Rationale\nSony understands the impact of its global business operations on human rights. It recognizes its responsibility to respect the human rights of all stakeholders involved in its business operations, including its employees and suppliers\u2019 workers, and its responsibility to ensure labor practices are appropriate.\n\nBasic Approach\nSony strives to respect human rights in all of its business operations in accordance with the Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights issued by the United Nations Human Rights Council. Sony\u2019s policy requiring respect for human rights is set forth in the Sony Group Code of Conduct. Sony expects all group companies to pursue responsible business conduct by respecting all human rights in compliance with its Code as well as relevant laws and regulations.\n\nGovernance Structure\nThe CSR Section at Sony headquarters is supervised by the Corporate Executive Officer in Charge of CSR. It assesses and monitors human rights risks throughout the Sony Group\u2019s business activities and supply chains. Employees\u2019 rights are addressed by a diversity committee at each Sony Group company in Japan. These committees conduct workshops on human rights and diversity. Sony has also established systems and mechanisms for employees seeking consultation on human rights issues and risks in order to ensure a quick response when problems arise.\n\nMain Achievements in Fiscal 2019\nHere are the main results of fiscal 2019 initiatives:\n- Continued to train employees about respect and protection of human rights\n- Continued to address human rights risks in the supply chain of its electronics products\n- Continued to make efforts based on Sony Group AI Ethical Guidelines\n\nMilestones\n1987: Human Rights Office established\n1991: Human rights lectures for employees launched\n1995: Sony Group Human Rights Committee established\n1998: Counseling services on human rights and equal opportunities for employees initiated\n2000: Philosophy and basic approach to human rights established\n2003: Sony Group Code of Conduct established\n2011: Human Rights Committee changed name to Diversity Committee\n2012: Human right risks analyzed\n2018: Sony Group Code of Conduct revised\nSony Group AI Ethical Guidelines established\nHuman rights risk analysis updated\n\nLooking to the Future\nSony is committed to making reasonable efforts to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts that may arise from its operations, products, services and/or business relationships.\n\nRelated Documents\n- Sony Group Code of Conduct [PDF: 762KB]\n- Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines [PDF: 44KB]\n- Sony Group Statement on UK Modern Slavery Act\nHuman Rights Initiatives\n\nIn response to the growing concern regarding the impact of increasing globalization on human rights, the United Nations Human Rights Council endorsed the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in 2011. These Principles identify steps that global companies can take to prevent and mitigate the potential adverse human rights impact in their business operations and supply chains. In accordance with the Principles, Sony respects the human rights of all stakeholders in its business operations and supply chains and strives to ensure good labor practices in all of its business activities to prevent and mitigate potential adverse human rights impact.\n\n\u25a0 Human Rights Policy\n\nSony\u2019s overall commitment to ensuring the protection of human rights in its operations, supply chains and products is set forth in the Sony Group Code of Conduct. The Sony Group Code of Conduct is applicable to all directors, officers, and employees of Sony Group and provides: \u201cSony believes that all human beings should be treated with dignity and respect. Sony is committed to uphold internationally recognized human rights of all people. We will all use reasonable efforts to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts that may arise from our operations, products, services and/or business relationships and will act diligently to help remediate any impacts that may occur.\u201d\n\nSony Group Code of Conduct [PDF: 762KB]\n\n\u25a0 Framework for Respecting Human Rights\n\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct was established with the approval of the Sony Corporation Board of Directors and sets forth Sony\u2019s basic commitment to human rights. The CSR Section at Sony headquarters in Tokyo is responsible for analyzing and monitoring human rights risks throughout the Sony Group\u2019s business activities and supply chains. The CSR Section reports to the Corporate Executive Officer in Charge of CSR and works with relevant functions such as procurement, legal, compliance and human resources to effectively manage potential human rights issues related to Sony\u2019s business activities and supply chains.\n\n\u25a0 Assessing and Monitoring Human Rights Risks\n\nSony\u2019s CSR Section leads Sony\u2019s efforts to assess and monitor human rights risks throughout Sony\u2019s operations and supply chains. In 2012 Sony engaged BSR, an independent, non-profit, global organization devoted to building a just and sustainable world, to conduct an initial analysis of potential human rights risks across Sony\u2019s various business operations and supply chains, which include electronics, entertainment and finance, as the salient human rights issues vary depending on the business segment. The initial BSR assessment identified potential human rights considerations in the electronics business supply chain, including materials procurement. In order to address our key risks, we collaborated with industry-wide efforts to protect and empower workers in the global electronics supply chain and were a founding member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). Manufacturing sites of Sony\u2019s electronics business and their suppliers were required to comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, which incorporates the provisions of the RBA Code of Conduct. The Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is also consistent with the human rights commitment expressed in the Sony Group Code of Conduct. Sony\u2019s electronics suppliers are also subject to ongoing assessments and monitoring for human rights risks. In 2018, Sony retained BSR to review and update its analysis of human rights risks in all Sony business areas to reflect the current state of global affairs, stakeholder concerns, evolving human rights laws and changes in Sony\u2019s business activities. In particular, Sony referenced the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international treaties on human rights to identify issues that are relevant to its business activities, and reviewed media and NGO reports to identify the human rights risks for these issues. This information was compared to Sony\u2019s areas of business to identify underlying risks of greatest relevance to Sony. This updated analysis identified human rights risks related to workers in the electronics industry supply chain, which has long been a key focus of Sony\u2019s efforts, as well as risks related to new technologies such as AI. Sony continues to monitor and address these and other human rights risks across its operations.\n\n> Responsible Supply Chain\n\n\u25a0 Human Rights Education and Training\n\nSony Group provides training to all of its employees worldwide in order to familiarize them with the Sony Group Code of Conduct and to encourage ethical business conduct, including respect for human rights. Relevant organizations within Sony Group conduct additional specialized training for pertinent personnel to help detect and address human rights risks.\n\n> Ethics and Compliance Program\n> Human Rights in the Workplace\nReporting Mechanisms\nSony provides multiple channels, including the Ethics & Compliance Hotline, for employees to raise concerns and seek guidance about possible violations of laws or internal policies, including violations of the Sony Group Code of Conduct. Additionally, Sony operates a supplier hotline for business partners, and a Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals Hotline for reporting violations of the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals and other applicable policies. These channels of communication enable Sony to rapidly address human rights concerns.\n\n- Promoting a Speak Up/Listen Up Culture\n- Human Rights in the Workplace\n- Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals Hotline\n\nGlobal Social Justice Fund\nSony is committed to respecting and valuing diversity, inclusion and the human rights of all people. Sony believes that all human beings should be treated with dignity and respect. As Diversity is one of our core Values, Sony believes in building a culture that makes business and employee diversity a strength.\n\nTo further these efforts, in June 2020, Sony Music Group spearheaded the creation of 100 million USD Global Social Justice Fund with the full support of all Sony Group companies. The Fund will be used to promote diversity and inclusion and to support social justice and anti-racism initiatives around the world.\n\nHuman Rights in Products and Services\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct states: \u201cWe will all use reasonable efforts to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts that may arise from our operations, products, services and/or business relationships and will act diligently to help remediate any impacts that may occur.\u201d\n\nSafety and Accessibility of Products and Services\nSince the start of its operations, Sony has been firmly committed across all of its businesses to providing customer-oriented, high-quality products and services. Sony continuously strives to comply with or exceed legally mandated standards in all business activities to ensure the safety of its products and services. Accessibility concerns are also incorporated into the planning and design of Sony products and services in order to serve all kinds of people regardless of age or disability.\n\n- Improving the Quality, Safety and Long-Term Reliability of Products\n- Usability and Accessibility\n\nInformation Security and Privacy\nSony is continuously improving its information management and security systems and initiatives to help ensure the privacy and security of information received from customers, employees, business partners, and other stakeholders.\n\n- Information Security\n- Privacy\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Ethics\nThrough the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI), Sony aims to contribute to the development of a peaceful and sustainable society while delivering kando \u2014 a sense of excitement, wonder or emotion \u2014 to the world. At the same time Sony understands that the influence of AI on society is still unknown and a topic of much discussion.\n\nSony established the Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines in September 2018 to guide all Sony officers and employees to utilize AI and/or conduct AI-related R&D in a manner that fits within emerging social norms. The guidelines were subsequently revised to align with Sony\u2019s Purpose established in January 2019 to \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.\u201d\n\nIn order to help solve ethical challenges that may arise from the use of AI, Sony also communicates with diverse stakeholders. For example, in May 2017, Sony became the first Japanese company to join the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society, a non-profit organization created to contribute to solutions for some of humanity\u2019s challenging problems, including advancing the understanding of AI and addressing ethics surrounding AI technology. One of the most common issues in AI ethics is that of fairness, accountability, and transparency, abbreviated \u201cFAI.\u201d Sony utilizes knowledge it has gained from its AI and robotics-related research, development, and business ventures and contributes to a number of working groups addressing this issue. Sony chaired the Social and Societal Influences of AI Working Group, which focuses on the social impacts of AI, and currently serves as an expert advisor to the group. Sony also serves on the steering committee for ABOUT ML, an initiative to improve the transparency of machine learning. Sony is also involved with Japanese initiatives to establish principles and guidelines that promote the utilization of AI for social good. These initiatives include the AI Utilization Strategy published by Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) in February 2019 and the Social Principles of Human-centric AI published by the Cabinet Office in March 2019.\nTo contribute solutions for ensuring FAT in AI development, Sony released Grad-CAM, a plug-in for Sony\u2019s Neural Network Console, AI development tool, in July 2019, and a similar plug-in LIME in December 2019. These tools create visualizations of input data that significantly impacts AI recognition results and provide explanations of the rationale for the decisions made. Sony is developing and delivering technology to make reliable AI a reality, including the launch in June 2019 of Prediction One, an explainable AI machine learning tool.\n\nSony uses e-learning tools to promote an understanding of AI ethics among its employees and invites speakers from outside the company to discuss this issue at lectures and symposia. Sony also has established a network system to promote information-sharing related to products, services, and internal operations that utilize AI in each Sony Group business unit and is also building a system for conducting AI ethics reviews.\n\n*1 ML is an abbreviation of machine learning.\n\nSony Group AI Ethics Guidelines [PDF:44KB]\n\n### Advertising Creativity and Content Services\n\nAs a company that conducts business in a number of regions and countries, we recognize that conduct that is socially and professionally acceptable in one culture or region may be viewed differently in another culture and we take those differences into account in our decision making. Advertising personnel from Sony Group companies in Japan regularly meet to exchange information on and study human rights issues in advertising. Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. applies Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO), Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), and Pan European Game Information (PEGI) ratings to its PlayStation game titles, adhering to the age-based recommendations of ratings organizations in Japan, the United States, and Europe, respectively.\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment (\"SPE\") also implemented various Diversity & Inclusion initiatives that impact every area of its business, including its content. For example, SPE\u2019s Motion Picture Group collaborated with the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, a non-profit organization, to identify ways to increase positive and diverse gender images onscreen. Sony Pictures Animation was also recognized for its work in creating content featuring diverse characters in such films as the Academy Award-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which presented \u201cMiles Morales,\u201d an African-American/ Latinx Spider-man in the lead role.\n\n\u203a Human Rights in the Workplace\n\u203a Usability and Accessibility\nHuman Rights in the Workplace\n\nSony is committed to creating a workplace where human rights are respected and equal employment opportunities that allow all individuals to make the most of their capabilities are provided. Sony also helps to ensure that workers\u2019 rights are protected by adhering to worker protection laws, regulations, and standards in the regions where it does business.\n\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct, which sets forth Sony\u2019s global policy on respect for human rights, also includes Sony\u2019s policy on equal opportunity in employment and non-discrimination and expressly states: \u201cSony strives to promote diversity and seeks to create a culture that allows all Sony personnel to contribute their unique talents and skills so as to provide the best products and services to our customers, and Sony is committed to recruiting, hiring, training, promoting and otherwise treating applicants and employees without discrimination based on factors that are unrelated to Sony\u2019s legitimate business interests.\u201d\n\nHuman rights issues facing corporations today are increasingly complex and wide-ranging; Sony believes that a crucial first step in addressing these issues is to raise awareness and build a common understanding among employees.\n\nSony Group Code of Conduct [PDF: 762KB]\n\nSony\u2019s Organization for Ensuring Respect for Human Rights\n\nSony Corporation has established the Diversity Promotion Committee, chaired by the Corporate Executive in Charge of Human Resources and General Affairs. All Sony Group companies in Japan have formed diversity promotion committees, which conduct workshops on human rights, diversity, and related matters as well as to share knowledge among colleagues. Sony Corporation\u2019s Diversity & Engagement Department oversees the activities of these committees. Sony Group companies outside of Japan have similar programs in place to ensure respect for human rights in the workplace.\n\nDiversity Promotion Organization Chart (Sony Group in Japan)\n\n- **Diversity Promotion Committee**\n  - Chairperson: Corporate Executive in Charge of Human Resources and General Affairs at Sony Corporation\n\n- **Central Committee**\n  - HQ General Affairs Department, Corporate Communications & Sustainability Department, and Electronics Human Resources Division at Sony Corporation\n\n- **Diversity promotion committees in group companies**\n\nEmployee Counseling Resources\n\nIn addition to the Ethics & Compliance Hotline and other reporting mechanisms, each Sony Group company in Japan maintains an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counseling hotline (accessible both internally and externally), to enable it to take immediate action against potential human rights issues, including harassment. This makes it easy for employees to consult with Sony\u2019s properly trained counselors on a wide range of equal opportunity-related issues concerning all types of harassment (sexual harassment, power harassment, \u201cmaternity harassment\u201d), work-life balance, parenting, caregiving, and LGBT and other issues, and facilitates coordination among relevant departments in the response, as needed. These counseling services equip Sony to respond quickly and appropriately while giving full consideration to personal privacy. Sony strictly enforces confidentiality and ensures that employees are not subject to reprisal for reporting or using these services.\n\nEducation and Training\n\nSony provides Code of Conduct training to all newly hired Sony Group employees. The Code of Conduct course emphasizes the value of respecting human rights and covers proper workplace conduct. In Japan, all newly hired employees are also provided training on the importance of protecting human rights and the value of diversity, while specific training programs on the protection of human rights are regularly offered to managers. In addition, an e-learning course focusing on the protection of human rights is provided to all employees of Sony Corporation and 37 of its affiliates. In fiscal 2019, 90% of eligible employees took the e-learning course.\n\nSharing of Activities\n\nEvery December, in support of Human Rights Week, an awards ceremony is held in Japan for all Sony Group companies to recognize departments that have been successful in their efforts to promote diversity. In addition, Sony has established a communication practices study group composed of Sony personnel working in advertising and communication practice in Japan. This study group meets regularly to share information about communication practices related to human rights.\nManagement Approach\n\nBasic Approach\nSony conducts research and development based on its Purpose, which is to \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology\u201d and management direction, \u201cgetting closer to people,\u201d incorporating the viewpoint of getting closer to the motivations that drive people, including both users and creators. For Sony to continue creating new value as products, content and services are becoming increasingly digital, it is essential to empower diverse businesses through technology. Learn more at the link below.\n\nCorporate Report 2020 (Page 34, Technology)\n\nStructure\nThrough Corporate R&D (Sony\u2019s research and development organization), Sony is realizing contributions to the entire Sony Group, setting the direction for robust technological development over the mid- to long-term, and enhancing open innovation. While supporting R&D activities in each business, Sony is connecting multiple businesses through technology as well as promoting initiatives in fields such as sensing, agent processing and output expression that contribute to differentiation in key areas. In carrying out Corporate R&D activities mainly focused on the next three- to ten years, Sony shares the results of its research with the outside world as intellectual property, and then uses feedback from outside the company on that research to refine its development roadmap and periodically review how its R&D activities are aligned with its corporate strategy. From the standpoint of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Environment, Social and Governance (ESG), Sony also aims to contribute widely to society through technology, by delivering safety and security and by solving problems surrounding resources and the environment.\n\nSony carries out Corporate R&D activities in collaboration with multiple R&D centers in Japan, China, Europe and the United States, utilizing the different characteristics and strengths of each area. Additionally, Sony is proceeding with preparations to establish a new R&D center in India in an effort to strengthen its R&D presence overseas, and is also enhancing ease of movement for management and personnel between each R&D center and strengthening its R&D from more diverse perspectives. For cross-sectional projects such as those in the Entertainment and Financial Services areas, Sony assembles teams with members from various organizations to promote R&D activities through the flexible and efficient collection of knowledge. Sony is also proactively taking part in open innovation, including collaboration with universities and other research institutions, in an effort to gain insight into the motivations of creators and users from a wider perspective to enhance the potential of its business.\n\nSony also established the research subsidiary, Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc., to conduct R&D that contributes to humanity and society by pioneering new research areas and new businesses. Moreover, Sony has specific mechanisms in place for generating innovation, including the Sony Startup Acceleration Program (SSAP), which creates startup projects and supports their business operations, and the Sony Innovation Fund, which serves as a corporate venture capital fund.\n\nRelated Links\nTechnology > About\nSony Innovation Fund\n\nCorporate Report 2020\nDeveloping the Environmental Technologies of the Future (Environment)\nManagement Approach\n\nMateriality Rationale\nSince its establishment, Sony has sought to remain at the forefront of technological development, building continuously on its achievements to deliver new value for people everywhere. In these efforts, Sony recognizes the people who work at Sony to be its most important resource. Employees are important stakeholders in Sony\u2019s diversified, global business and are the key to its efforts to generate sustainable social value and a high level of profit. Sony is committed to increasing employee engagement by leveraging the diversity and ambitions of its people and maximizing their talents. Sony seeks to sustainably elevate its talent and organizational capabilities in order to raise its overall business performance.\n\nBasic Approach\nSony considers employees to be among its most important stakeholders and views them not as a group, but as individuals. Sony values employee engagement as the key to unleashing the full potential of individual employees with their own strong motivation, autonomy and desire to grow. Sony\u2019s Founding Prospectus, written in 1946 by co-founder Masaru Ibuka, states that Sony should \u201cestablish an ideal factory that stresses a spirit of freedom and open-mindedness, where engineers with sincere motivation can exercise their technological skills to the highest level,\u201d and it should \u201cplace emphasis on a person\u2019s ability, performance and character,\u201d so that \u201ceach individual can fully exercise their abilities and skills.\u201d This approach has been passed down unchanged to the present day. The partnership of choice between Sony and each individual employee is defined as one where each party is accountable for being responsive to the needs of the other. Sony believes that the growth of the individual will lead to growth of the organization and, in turn, the growth of Sony. Its sustainable growth brings opportunities for employees to take on new challenges and grow. The diversity of Sony\u2019s businesses and people is one of its strengths and a driver for creating value. For Sony to sustainably create value by striving for diverse businesses and taking on unique employees, it is essential that employees are fully aware of and resonate with Sony\u2019s Purpose & Values. Sony has defined \u201cWhat we offer our people\u201d and \u201cPeople we look for\u201d to be shared across the Group to illustrate the kinds of people Sony wants.\n\n\u201cWhat We Offer Our People\u201d and \u201cPeople We Look For\u201d\n\n| What We Offer Our People | People We Look For |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| \u2022 Environment that respects and supports each individual\u2019s challenging spirit and willingness to grow to realize our dream and aspiration to fill the world with emotion | \u2022 Pioneer the future with dreams and curiosity |\n| \u2022 Accumulation and evolution of a wide range of technologies that fully utilize individual creativity and serve as the foundation for creating new value | \u2022 Pursue the creation of the very best by harnessing diversity and varying viewpoints |\n| \u2022 Wide variety of global career opportunities and possibilities unique to the Sony Group\u2019s diverse business portfolio | \u2022 Earn the trust for the Sony brand through ethical and responsible conduct |\n| \u2022 Inclusive culture harnessing the diversity of teams, viewpoints and cultures | \u2022 Fulfill our stakeholder responsibilities through disciplined business practices |\n\nSony seeks to maximize the talents of each employee and to foster innovation. Sony respects and fosters an inclusive acceptance of diversity in its many forms including race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, beliefs, disability, gender, age, birthplace, sexual orientation, values, and workstyles. Sony\u2019s vision of diversity and inclusion seeks to build an organizational culture that respects diversity and helps create value for customers. Sony\u2019s HR strategic framework has three components: \u201cAttract\u201d (talent acquisition), \u201cDevelop\u201d (learning and development), and \u201cEngage\u201d (employee engagement). Under the framework, Sony pursues a broad range of activities,\nbuilding on a commitment to offering working conditions that contribute to the health and safety of employees.\n\n**Structure**\n\nSenior management meet to discuss and decide upon important matters relating to employees at the Sony Group and guide the HR strategies implemented by Sony Group companies. Sony shares a common HR strategic framework across the group. However, each business is responsible for the independent development and implementation of its own detailed strategies.\n\nSony has established the Diversity Committee, which reports directly to the CEO, to ensure that diversity & inclusion is addressed as a high-priority issue. Sony also operates reporting hotlines and other avenues for employees to get consultation on a broad range of issues including human rights, work-life balance, parenting, nursing care, and LGBT concerns.\n\nWhen it comes to occupational health and safety (OHS), Sony has migrated its site-based management systems worldwide, which were based on OHSAS18001, to the Sony Occupational Health and Safety Management System, which is based on ISO 45001,* thereby strengthening and facilitating its OHS activities.\n\n* International standard for OHS management systems\n\n**Main Achievements in Fiscal 2019**\n\nHere are the main results of fiscal 2019 initiatives:\n\n- **Diversity & Inclusion**\n  - Held Sony Diversity Week around the world since 2015 to raise awareness and promote action for change by enhancing recognition and understanding of the significance of diversity\n  - Joined The Valuable 500, an international initiative launched at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos to promote participation by individuals with disabilities so that they can demonstrate their latent potential to bring value to business, society, and the economy\n  - As a co-sponsor of Pride House Tokyo 2019, co-hosted a lecture and panel discussion entitled, \u201cDiversity Talk with UDA,\u201d with the University Diversity Alliance (UDA)\n  - Held communication workshops on managing non-Japanese employees as part of efforts to build greater trust in relationships with and boost the motivation of non-Japanese employees\n\n- **Talent Development**\n  - Promoted the use of the PORT, a venue for developing new talent that offers access to training and interviews related to skill development and career paths, various events and seminars, and employees\u2019 self-organized community activities for continuous education\n  - Carried out Sony University global leadership programs in and outside of Japan (continued from 2000)\n  - Continued operating the Sony Outstanding Engineer Award, the most prestigious personal award for engineers in the Sony Group, and the Distinguished Engineer as a group-wide designation system\n  - At Sony Technology Exchange Fair, a group-wide exchange event for engineers, held seminars and panel discussions chaired by its Distinguished Engineers and Open Innovation Showcase for recipients of investments from the Sony Innovation Fund (SIF).\n\n- **Employee Engagement**\n  - Facilitated communication between top management (including the CEO) and Sony employees in and outside of Japan (direct dialogue, dispatch of information)\n  - Conducted global employee engagement surveys and held workshop based on results (continued from 2011)\n  - Group companies in the USA and UK in the music business adopted policies to extend the parenting leave if an employee or their spouse gives birth prematurely\n  - Sony Group companies in Japan in the electronics business continued a work-style reform project\n  - Continued to implement initiatives to create attractive workplaces worldwide.

Sony will provide opportunities for employees to improve and make the most of their character, skills and capabilities.\nEmployee Data\n\nAs of March 31, 2020, Sony had approximately 111,700 employees, a decrease of approximately 2,700 employees from March 31, 2019. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, despite an increase of employees in the Game & Network Services (G&NS) (outside of Japan), Imaging & Sensing Solutions (I&SS) (within Japan), Music and Financial Services segments, there was a decrease of employees in the Electronics Products & Solutions (EP&S) and Pictures segments, as well as in All Other.

Sony leverages its diverse businesses and workforce as strengths in its business strategy. The Sony Group Diversity Statement was established in 2013 to serve as a global policy to further highlight the importance of diversity in the workplace. Sony embraces diversity as a key management strategy and respects the individuality of each employee and encourages them to inspire each other through ongoing dialogue, and is convinced that this will create new value and drive further growth for the company.\n\nSony Group Diversity Statement\nIt is in Sony\u2019s DNA \u2014 and a source of our innovation \u2014 to value different perspectives and backgrounds as we conduct our business activities globally and rise to new challenges. Sony promotes diversity across the Sony Group as a key management strategy by ensuring an inclusive work environment and by recruiting, hiring, training and promoting employees from diverse backgrounds.\n\nDiversity Week\nDuring Sony Diversity Week, many events are held at Sony Group companies around the world to raise awareness and promote action for change by enhancing recognition and understanding of the significance of diversity. These events are designed to encourage employees to think deeply about diversity in its many forms \u2014 from race, nationality, disabilities, and gender, to sexual orientation, viewpoints, and workstyles \u2014 as well as to facilitate new perspectives and active communication. These events also engage the wider community by involving other companies and outside organizations.\n\nBusiness and Geographies\nCross-Business Collaboration\nThe Sony Group is engaged in a broad range of businesses, and its diverse employees collaborate across them to take on new challenges in development of products, services and content, and marketing. In fiscal 2019, the Sony Group transferred a total of 2,200 employees to other Sony Group companies to enable them to branch out in their careers and build cross-business connections, and this is creating new opportunities for collaboration around the Group.\n\nEmployees Activities Across Regions\nAs of March 31, 2020, approximately 1,100 employees were posted to other Sony Group companies worldwide as part of Sony\u2019s global deployment of personnel, to transfer technology and knowledge, and launch new businesses. This includes some 130 employees dispatched from group companies outside of Japan, working in various businesses around the world, 35% of whom are in upper management positions. The Sony Group operates job transfer policies to efficiently facilitate international transfers. The policies are routinely updated with input from experts in human resources worldwide to support different types of international assignments.\n\nTo better support employees of all nationalities and languages, Sony Group companies in Japan follow up on employees after hiring and assist employees in their networking and career development. To facilitate English communication among employees from around the world, intranet content and systems for personnel and accounting are offered in both English and Japanese. Furthermore, in collaboration with the project members of DIVI@Sony (Diversity Initiative for Value Innovation at Sony), Sony Group companies in Japan have conducted surveys and interviews with non-Japanese employees, their managers and colleagues. Using these results, those companies have identified issues they face and are working on devising and implementing necessary measures.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Sony held communication workshops on managing non-Japanese employees as part of its efforts to build greater trust in relationships with and boost the motivation of non-Japanese employees. The Group also held cross-cultural communication workshops to provide tips on working with people from different culture and philosophies. Non-Japanese employees and Japanese employees who have the opportunity to work with people both in and outside of Sony from a variety of backgrounds participated in these workshops. Sony also hosts the Sony Happy Hour, an ongoing networking event for non-Japanese employees.\nTalent Acquisition\nAs a company with manufacturing, design, sales, service and R&D bases in many different countries and regions around the world, Sony promotes the localization of these operations by securing local talent that can meet national, regional and local needs. Sony ensures diversity and inclusion in hiring and works with external organizations to promote hiring of minorities. In Japan, Sony has long recruited international talent regardless of nationality in order to advance its global R&D and businesses and has been increasing the hiring of talented university graduates from around the world. Sony also taps the cooperation of local group companies outside Japan to help secure top-level talent. Under its Global Internship Program, Sony welcomes university students from a variety of countries/regions, including Japan and other Asian countries, Europe, and North America, to offices in its major business fields.\n\nGender, Sexual Orientation, Disabilities\nPromoting Greater Opportunities for Women\nSony embraces diversity and the working contributions of women, who accounted for 35.6% of the workforce and held 28.3% of management positions at the Sony Group worldwide as of the end of fiscal 2019. In Japan, Sony has set a target to be achieved by end of fiscal 2020 for women to hold 10% of management positions in the Sony Group and 15% of management positions at Sony Corporation, and pursues initiatives to actively hire, develop, and promote women. Sony carries out \u201cdisclosure of information\u201d and \u201cdisclosure of action plans\u201d in accordance with the provisions of Japan\u2019s Act on Promotion of Women\u2019s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace, using the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare\u2019s \u201cDatabase of Corporate Performance in the Area of Women\u2019s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace.\u201d\n\nBoth in and outside Japan, Sony operates a leadership program to develop leadership skills and mindsets among women and support their networking, by providing opportunities for career development and assisting the professional growth of women. In March 2020, Sony celebrated International Women\u2019s Day with an online lecture by Sally Helgesen, a pioneer in developing women\u2019s leadership, connecting North American and Japan.\n\nAct on Promotion of Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation Sony Corporation\u2019s Action Plan\nWomen Empowerment Law Sony Corporation\u2019s Action Plan\n\nWomen in Management Positions at Sony Group in Japan\n\n| Year | Women in the workforce | Management positions held by women |\n|------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 2014 | 27.2%                  | 15.9%                             |\n| 2015 | 29.5%                  | 22.2%                             |\n| 2016 | 29.3%                  | 23.9%                             |\n| 2017 | 33.6%                  | 25.3%                             |\n| 2018 | 34.3%                  | 27.3%                             |\n| 2019 | 35.6%                  | 28.3%                             |\n\nPercentage of women in the workforce and management positions held by women\n\n| Region | Women in the workforce | Management positions held by women |\n|--------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Sony Group | % | % |\n| Japan | 18.6% | 21.3% |\n| United States | 36.1% | 37.5% |\n| Mainland China and Hong Kong Region | 44.6% | 43.8% |\n| Asia-Pacific | 46.2% | 43.8% |\n| Europe | 36.0% | 34.5% |\n| Other Areas | 38.1% | 41.4% |\n\n*1 Totals are based on data provided by Sony Group companies as of the end of each fiscal year (March 31).

During Diversity Week, Sony hosted lectures on the practices necessary to increase one\u2019s influence in the workplace.\n\nWith its campaign to improve its employment brand, which aims to boost employment of women, Sony North America was featured in four employment-related articles on women\u2019s job sites, with a 16% increase in job applications from women and an average of 2,000 additional monthly LinkedIn followers.\n\nSony UK Technology Centre invites women students from local schools and universities who are interested in STEM* subjects to participate in the center\u2019s \u201cWomen in STEM\u201d events, where they can enjoy dialogues with women engineers and plant tours.\n\n* STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n\nPromoting Greater Opportunities for Individuals with Disabilities\n\nThe Sony Group employs and supports individuals with disabilities in compliance with the laws, regulations, and rules of the countries and regions in which it operates, while endeavoring to create inclusive working environments that enable employees to build successful careers regardless of any disabilities they may have. Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka once recalled the day when an initiative was launched, saying, \u201cWe had a spirit of autonomy and a belief in creating workplaces that do not offer charity, but rather creating an environment that makes it possible for individuals with disabilities to manufacture products that exceed those manufactured by individuals without disabilities.\u201d The Sony Group strives to realize an environment in which individuals do not feel held back by their disability and disabilities do not create barriers, enabling everyone to thrive.\n\nAt Sony Group companies in Japan, a dedicated department within the Human Resources Division compiles employment know-how and experience gained in the past, particularly at the special-purpose subsidiaries Sony Taiyo Corporation, which was established in 1978 prior to the legal institution in Japan of this type of subsidiary, and Sony Kibou/Hikari Corporation, which specializes in providing employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual and mental disabilities. These departments also address such issues as reasonable accommodation and how to improve the employment environment. In addition, leveraging the advantages of its status as a corporate group, Sony has carried out joint hiring for individuals with disabilities for more than a decade, focusing on approaches at the Group level. In March 2019, Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. established Sony Life Business Partners Co., Ltd. which became the Group\u2019s third special-purpose subsidiary. Sony Life Business Partners provides outsourced administrative services to Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd., creating an environment that enables individuals with disabilities to thrive in their own way and build their own futures.\n\nIn addition to employing people with disabilities at special-purpose subsidiaries, Sony Group companies in Japan are working to build inclusive working environments and actively employing individuals with disabilities themselves. Group companies have created guidelines for equipping their working environments to accommodate individuals with disabilities and to raise employee awareness, and they hold awareness-raising and other training programs that are designed by individuals with disabilities at the special-purpose companies. Reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities are provided through extensive discussions with each individual based on group guidelines (which were established in advance of regulatory changes in Japan in 2016).\n\nGroup companies outside Japan work with each country\u2019s organizations for individuals with disabilities to create job opportunities and engage in philanthropy to raise employee awareness.\n\nSony also seeks to address these social issues in Japan. Sony organizes events for university students with disabilities to make them aware of employment opportunities and encourage them to build careers, aiming to help them with the job search so that they can play an active role in society in the future. Sony Taiyo Corporation holds inclusion workshops aimed at providing opportunities for elementary and junior high school students with and without disabilities to experience together the fun of science firsthand.\n\nSony Kibou/Hikari Corporation has been given new responsibilities within the Group and provides opportunities for employees with mental health disabilities to utilize their skills and strengths as part of the team. Collaborating on trial monitoring of products that have passed the Sony Startup Acceleration Program (SSAP) auditions and are being prepared for the market, Sony works actively to incorporate the perspectives of individuals with disabilities into the development of Sony Group products. Working with outside organizations, Sony strives to visualize the necessary accommodations for and strengths of each individual to ensure that growth for individuals with intellectual disabilities not only spurs their personal development, but also helps shape the industry to better leverage their individual talents.\n\nIn this way, Sony supports people with disabilities to play an active role in society, making accommodations in its working environments and raising awareness of diversity and inclusion, beyond the requirements of legal compliance. In fiscal 2019, employees with disabilities accounted for 2.81% of Sony Corporation\u2019s workforce, while the average for Sony Group companies in Japan (with over 101 employees, consolidated basis) was 2.41% as of March 2019, both above the 2.2% mandated by Japanese law for companies over a certain size.\n\n* Sony Taiyo\u2019s first special-purpose subsidiary, has implemented concepts such as universal design and inclusive design\u2014a comprehensive workplace design concept that emphasizes usability, environment and education to meet the needs of all people\u2014to create a work environment in which anyone can work with and without disabilities.\nKey Activities to Promote Career Development of Individuals with Disabilities at the Sony Group around the World\n\nSony Group (Global)\nSony Corporation joined The Valuable 500, an international initiative launched at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in January 2019 to promote participation by individuals with disabilities so that they can demonstrate their latent potential to bring value to business, society, and the economy. The key to Sony\u2019s continued success is its people. Creating a work environment in which everyone is respected and promoting a corporate culture that respects diversity fosters the diverse talent that underpins Sony\u2019s growth and leads to the next level of innovation and value creation for society.\n\nSony Group (United States)\nTo ensure appropriate employment for people with disabilities in the U.S., the Sony Group actively collaborates with non-profit organizations, councils, universities, and other groups, partnering with Specialists to promote diversity in employment through programs that employ the visually impaired and students with disabilities.\n\nElectronics Business (Asia)\nDiversity officers from Sony China visited Sony in Japan to learn more about how to employ individuals with disabilities in China by discussing the topic at the relevant departments at Sony Headquarters and observing Sony\u2019s special-purpose subsidiaries in Japan.\n\nSony Group (Japan)\nSony Assurance Inc. offers a Sign Language and Written Communication Service, which provides real-time communication in sign language, written communication, and online chatting in the event of an accident. This service ensures that claims payments and other matters are handled smoothly in all circumstances.\n\nLGBT Inclusivity\nThe Sony Group globally strives to provide LGBT* employees with working environments in which they can feel comfortable being themselves.\nIn Japan, Sony has expanded certain personnel programs*2 to encompass same-sex partners and implements an e-learning course for all employees that covers LGBT issues, while also offering LGBT workshops.\nSony also supports the diversity of employees in other ways, such as enabling employees to use their preferred names at work, providing multipurpose restrooms, using gender-neutral uniforms, making it optional for job applicants to indicate their gender on applications, and providing private toilet and shower facilities in each room at corporate dormitories.\n\n*LGBT stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. The expression is broadly used to refer to persons with diverse sexualities.\n*2 Personnel programs that have been extended to same-sex partners include monetary gifts and leave for bereavement, rent subsidies, and participation in employee family events.\n\nLGBT Initiatives by the Sony Group around the World\n\nSony Group (Japan)\nThe Sony Group was a co-sponsor of Pride House Tokyo 2019. Together with the University Diversity Alliance (UDA), Sony also co-hosted Diversity Talk with UDA (lecture and panel discussion). In addition to Sony employees, some 400 individuals from companies, universities, and organizations participated in the event, which was broadcast to five university satellites across Japan.\n\nSony Group (United States)\nIn the United States, Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., Sony Corporation of America, Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. and Sony North America Inc., all achieved the maximum score of 100% based on assessments in the Corporate Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, recognizing them as companies that create ideal working environments for LGBT employees. These scores reflect the level of fairness achieved within the organization toward LGBT employees, which is underpinned by rules designed to support these employees. Additionally, managers and employees participate in LGBT pride parades to raise awareness.\n\nSony Group (Europe)\nManagers and employees participate in LGBT pride parades to raise awareness.\nTalent Development\n\nEmployee Development and Vitality Drives Sony\u2019s Dynamic Growth\nSony recognizes its people as its most important management asset and the growth of its people as a crucial aspect of its management foundation. Sony strives to further enhance motivation and encourage personal growth for its employees through on-the-job learning, as well as through access to a variety of programs designed to enhance individual abilities and skills and tailored to local needs.\n\nAs a company that does business in a variety of countries and regions, Sony recognizes the importance of cultivating future business leaders with a global perspective. Accordingly, Sony is implementing initiatives aimed at fostering such employees and bringing their capabilities into full play.\n\nLearning and Career\n\nLearning and Development\nSony has defined the global behaviors it wants to see among employees: \u201cInspire and Be Inspired,\u201d \u201cStay on Point,\u201d and \u201cBreak Through Barriers.\u201d Sony is strengthening its systematic training to give employees the skills they need in various formats including group training and e-learning. Given the important role that management plays in the growth of the company and its employees, the Sony Group in Japan conducts programs to equip management with practical people management skills so that they can maximize the potential of organizations. Sony is also strengthening its overall management using leadership development and coaching strategies in the electronics business (North America, South America, Europe, and Asia regions) and in the entertainment business encompassing music and film.\n\nIn addition to mandatory training, Sony supports employee-driven development by offering seminars, courses at outside institutions, and a growing range of online courses to fit the needs of employees. Sony Corporation of America piloted LinkedIn Learning, which allows employees to utilize online courses covering a wide range of topics. Sony Music Entertainment operates the My Learning portal as a global learning management system with diverse and personalized learning content.\n\nInformation on training sessions conducted in fiscal 2019 is shown below.\n\n| Participation in Companywide Training in Fiscal 2019 (Sony Group in Japan) |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Targeted | Mandatory | Elective (Technology-related) | Elective (Others) | Total |\n| Number of programs | 18 | 41 | 309 | 23 | 391 |\n| Number of times offered | 94 | 334 | 458 | 41 | 927 |\n| Participants | 338 | 52,985 | 15,782 | 5,537 | 74,642 |\n| Cumulative total training time (Hours) | 12,485 | 112,261 | 75,305 | 15,752 | 215,803 |\n\nIn fiscal 2019, human resource development expenditure per employee at Sony Corporation was about 290,000 yen.\n\nCareer Development\nSony has always encouraged its employees to take on new challenges, fostering this mindset both to further the growth of its employees and its growth as a company. Back in 1966, Sony became first in the Japanese industry to launch an internal job posting program, which has now been in place for 50 years. The program provides an avenue for employees to explore career opportunities while serving to optimize the assignment of personnel and strengthen key parts of Sony\u2019s business. To date, more than 7,000 employees have moved to new positions via the program, which has become essential to Sony\u2019s personnel strategy of developing employees who are eager to take on new challenges. Sony also expanded its Global Job Posting program for employees around the world in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2015, Sony introduced two new programs that greatly expand on its existing internal recruitment program. Sony adopted a free agent program that gives talented employees the ability to declare their availability to Sony Group companies, which provides them with greater opportunities to branch out and pursue job opportunities in new fields. In the same year, Sony adopted Career Plus, a program that enables employees to remain in their current positions while also being involved in other jobs and projects posted by the company by holding concurrent or secondary positions. The program enables personnel to broadly leverage their expertise and knowledge while also building up their networks within Sony.\n\nEvery autumn, Sony holds its Career Month, an initiative to foster employee growth that offers employees the opportunity to attend seminars on career and professional development and to receive career counseling, as well as to meet directly with their supervisors to discuss development plans regarding their careers and growth. This initiative facilitates carefully tailored support for career building.\nMoreover, seeking to support employees\u2019 growth through work experience, in fiscal 2016, the New Performance Management Program used at Sony Corporation and its group companies in the electronics business was revised. The program fosters year-round communication between personnel and their superiors, enabling employees to set individual goals and track their progress while incorporating feedback on everyday conduct to better reflect individual observations and foster growth. Sony is pursuing its purpose of \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology\u201d by encouraging its employees to take on new challenges and supporting their career development by giving them professional experience within the Sony Group.\n\nPORT\u2014An Ideal Venue to Develop New Talent\n\nIn order for Sony to sustainably create value and continue to grow into the future, Sony recognizes it must leverage and ensure the continued evolution of the diversity of its businesses and workforce, which has been a strength of Sony corporate culture since the beginning. PORT is a place where ambitious employees who hold diverse values \u2014 people from various specialized fields and backgrounds \u2014 can organically interact across business and geographic boundaries. The concept is for Sony Group employees to gather, connect, and create synergies, in order to grow as individuals and foster human resources who can navigate Sony into the future.\n\nOpened at Sony City headquarters building in November 2018, PORT embodies this concept by serving as a venue for training, interviews, events, and seminars related to skills and career development, as well as providing a venue for employees to engage in spontaneous discussions, brainstorming, and workshops to stimulate shared learning. Many voluntary communities are working to foster continuous learning.\n\nCareer support for senior employees\n\nIn today\u2019s era of extended longevity, work and life planning are not the same, and each individual has different needs and values. Sony has deployed the Career Canvass Program for veteran and senior employees to encourage them to think about, design and implement their own life plans while working actively within Sony. In line with Sony\u2019s founding philosophy of \u201cbuilding one\u2019s own career,\u201d we offer a variety of programs, including workshops on career development and financial assistance, to help employees relearn how to keep developing themselves.\n\nEngineering Talent\n\nTo pursue its purpose of \u201cfill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology,\u201d Sony must engage in innovation to win new customers. Sony continues creating new technologies so that its engineers can develop products that provide functional value while appealing to people\u2019s sensibilities and inspiring them.\n\nUsing Field-Specific Technology Strategy Committees to Achieve Inter-organizational Collaboration\n\nSony aims to create long-term social value, in addition to generating sustainable, strong revenues. In order to create sustainable value and continue growing, Sony must leverage the diversity of its businesses and employees to further evolve. Lively interaction among employees from different backgrounds who hold diverse values leads to their own continual growth and ultimately drives the growth of Sony. Technology strategy committees are given the role of sharing knowledge from various fields across organizations, systematically advancing the technologies, and promoting the growth of human resources. The committees are highly significant in Sony\u2019s efforts to create sustainable value and secure ongoing growth. Sony formed field-specific technology strategy committees in fiscal 2015, and they involve approximately 1,000 employees.\n\nField-Specific Technology Strategy Committees\n\nA technology strategy committee is established for each field. Each one consists of specialists who are selected from across Sony Group companies. These committees work to achieve technical innovation and roll out organization-specific technologies across the Group. Technology is developed by people, so technology strategy committees implement related human resource measures. Sony offers talent development programs such as a key technology training course as well as personnel recruitment; this approach accounts for the special features of different technologies, and transcends the boundaries between different Sony Group companies.\nTechnology Training Courses\nAt the Sony Group in Japan, approximately 300 Sony engineers with frontline expertise in key technological fields develop curricula and textbooks for use in core technology training courses, aiming to enhance the expertise of engineers. These courses, which are designed to provide a basic understanding of technical matters, have been in continuous development since the 1980s. In fiscal 2019, a total of 16,000 employees took courses. The courses are used to expand their knowledge of specialized subjects, brush up on their knowledge for application in other areas, or re-learn subjects.\n\nSony develops the basic skills of its new recruits by offering them general technological training designed by leading Group engineering experts, as well as specialized training programs developed by each of Sony\u2019s business units, which are designed to familiarize the trainees with technologies specific to each business. Engineers are provided with various opportunities to gain advanced knowledge in related fields and foster their ongoing professional development by participating in sponsored courses, seminars given by outside experts, and employee open houses.\n\nCorporate Distinguished Engineer Program\nBased on Sony\u2019s purpose of \u201cfill the world with emotion through the power of creativity and technology,\u201d the Corporate Distinguished Engineer program is designed to accelerate formulation and implementation of technology strategies that support sustainable growth and the development of talent.\n\nThe Distinguished Engineer (DE) program designates those engineers group-wide who possess outstanding expertise and technical knowledge in key technological fields and are capable of carrying out the DE mission, shown below. As the face of Sony technology, the DE program highlights the importance of Sony\u2019s role as a leader in formulating technology strategies and supporting talent development. By publicizing this program group-wide, Sony enables its Distinguished Engineers to serve as role models for younger engineers.\n\nThe Distinguished Engineer\u2019s Mission\nThe DE is to formulate and execute technology strategies while identifying signals of change, and support the development of talent in order to ensure Sony\u2019s sustainable growth. The DE:\n- Formulates the technological strategies that underpin Sony\u2019s corporate strategy beyond the existing frameworks\n- Supports the execution of corporate strategies through technology by building global network and identifying signs of change\n- Discovers engineers with high potential and supports their development\n\nSony Technology Exchange Fair\nThe annual Sony Technology Exchange Fair (STEF) provides an opportunity for Sony Group engineers to present their R&D work to colleagues and create new value by sharing information and ideas among more employees. In addition to providing a space to present technologies developed by Sony Group companies in the segments of electronics, semiconductors, games, music, movies, and financial services, STEF also seeks to enhance expertise and knowledge, featuring lectures and seminars by invited speakers from inside and outside the group, panel sessions chaired by Distinguished Engineers, and the Open Innovation Showcase featuring exhibits by companies receiving investment from the Sony Innovation Fund (SIF). The event has served as a launchpad for numerous business applications since it was first organized in 1973. In 2019, more than 10,000 employees from Sony Group companies in and outside of Japan attended the fair, resulting in a lively exchange of opinions among employees. Sony is committed to innovation that helps shape the future and fosters this by positioning technology as the driver of its broad portfolio of people-centric businesses, encouraging employee interaction across product, service and organizational boundaries and promoting integration of technologies.\nLeadership and Future Leaders\n\nSony is developing talented core people who can excel globally. Sony University was established with the mission of developing the people who will shape and lead Sony\u2019s management vision and strategy, perpetuating the Sony Spirit, and building strong personal networks that facilitate Group management. Under this mission, Sony University programs are designed to foster top management candidates and global leaders who will play key roles in driving the business forward. The courses offered include a program for leading managers from different Sony organizations around the world to foster innovative thinking and polish their skills. Managers from Sony Group companies in Japan who show promise as potential business leaders are selected to participate in a half-year program focusing on management literacy and interpersonal skills. These courses encourage personal interaction and mutual learning to facilitate the development of business leaders.\n\nMain Initiatives to Develop Future Leaders at the Sony Group around the World\n\n| Initiative | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Electronics Business (USA) | Sony North America\u2019s mission, vision and values, including the organization\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit and willingness to take risks, is epitomized by the company\u2019s Talent Strategy. The Fast Forward Initiative, as part of this strategy, includes more than 100 diverse employee volunteers with different viewpoints, collaborating openly and respectfully to develop innovative programs that provide valuable support to the company\u2019s business, team, and community \u2014 all with the common goal of creating a rich pipeline of ready-now successors in a sustainable, inclusive, best-place-to-work environment. |\n| Music Business | Sony Music Entertainment has established the Amplify program to combine talent development and business innovation. This program focuses on getting the most out of an engaged and skilled workforce by inspiring them to be real innovators and on investing in the early career pipeline as a real differentiator, covering the various elements over a period of seven months. This program has achieved real business results through experimentation. |\n| Movie Business | To support the development of top talent, Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. facilitated three programs intended to build leadership and industry acumen at key stages in an employee\u2019s career. The Take The Lead program aims to equip people managers to effectively lead their teams and drive engagement. The Business of Entertainment 101 program provides an overview of the entertainment business to emerging leaders to develop their business acumen. The Business of Entertainment 201 program provides a deep-dive into industry trends and research, to stimulate new ideas and deepen collaborative relationships between leaders across the company. |\nEmployee Engagement\n\nSony\u2019s original Founding Prospectus set forth a management commitment to enable each individual to fully exercise his or her abilities and skills. Sony co-founder Akio Morita once said to the company\u2019s newest recruits, \u201cIf you ever find yourself regretting that you joined Sony, quit right away. You only live once. Once you truly commit to working at Sony, there is a mutual responsibility. I hope you won\u2019t arrive at the end of your life with regrets about having worked at Sony.\u201d\n\nTo fulfill these founding principles, Sony is constantly working to enhance working conditions and keep employees motivated by offering a mutually stimulating environment in which diverse individuals can enjoy work-life balance, have confidence in the company and management team, and share a commitment to creating value in Sony\u2019s businesses. Sony implements diverse structural, environmental, and cultural initiatives, so that ambitious and self-motivated employees can grow with Sony and continue to create value.\n\nWork-Life Balance and Well-Being\n\nSony believes that strong revenues are sustained by providing a worker-friendly environment where all employees can perform to their full potential. Under this vision, Sony considers employee health and work-life balance as essential to creating innovation and sustaining strong revenues as a company. Sony offers flexible working provisions and work conditions for employees to realize this work-life balance, while adhering to the customs and laws in countries and regions where it does business.\n\nEach employee of the Sony Group plays a part in the sustainable growth of the company. As part of its commitment to diversity and inclusion, Sony has an important responsibility to create inclusive workplaces with attractive working conditions, and to encourage ways of working that enable employees to make the most of their talents while balancing their work responsibilities with events in their personal lives, including parenting, nursing care, and medical treatment. Sony recognizes the need to accommodate diverse ways of working to secure the health and motivation of employees.\n\nSince 2017, Sony Group companies in Japan in the electronics business have been implementing a work-style reform project that is furthering existing initiatives such as a day for leaving work at the prescribed time and encouraging employees to take their paid leave. Meanwhile, the Sony Group worldwide is sharing and adopting best practices such as business process improvements and techniques for making meetings effective.\n\nIn Japan, Sony Corporation has introduced a flex-time system, a discretionary working system, and an advanced professional system which enable employees to work with versatile options. Sony employees regularly use a high percentage of their allotted annual paid days off. In fiscal 2019, employees of Sony Corporation took an average of 17.8 days off and employees of the Sony Group in Japan took an average of 15.5 days off, compared with the national average of 10.9 days off at other companies.\n\nAverage Annual Paid Holidays for employees at Sony corporation and Sony group companies in Japan in Fiscal 2019\n\n|                      | Average for other companies in Japan | Sony Corporation | Sony Group in Japan |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| (days)               | 10.9                                | 17.8             | 15.5               |\n\n*Average for other companies in Japan* is based on figures for the category of companies with 1,000 or more employees in Fiscal 2019 General Survey on Working Conditions, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan.\n\nMain Work-Life Balance Initiatives at the Sony Group around the World\n\n| Initiative                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Movie Business (USA)                                                      | Some group companies provide services and take other steps designed to promote employee health, such as offering on-site fitness facilities and dental clinic, and holding in-house sports competitions. |\n| Music Business (USA, UK)                                                 | In order to support the work-life balance of parents, group companies in the USA and UK have adopted policies to extend the parenting leave if an employee or their spouse gives birth prematurely. Additionally, group companies assist breastfeeding mothers by contracting with an external service that ships breast milk home when employees are away on business. |\n| Electronics Business (Sony Corporation of America)                       | Sony Corporation of America provides employees with access to the Backup Care program, a network of high-quality childcare centers and in-home care providers to respond to various life stage changes. |\n| Electronics Business (Japan)                                             | Some group companies provide a private area for nursing mothers, emergency child care and other services for employees who are raising and/or expecting children. There are also child-raising support programs that aim to build communities of employees who are parents to facilitate the sharing of information on such topics as children\u2019s education. |\n| Sony Group (Japan, China, USA)                                           | On annual family day, family members are invited to see and get to know where employees work.                                                                                                                                 |\n| Financial Services (Japan)                                               | Group companies are adopting provisions for working from home and remote work, as well as extending the eligibility to more employees. Some group companies permit employees to primarily work from home. |\nFlexible Work Options for Diverse Lifestyles\n\nThe Sony Group in Japan offers human resources programs that enable employees to make the most of their talents within their preferred lifestyles. In 2015, Sony Corporation began offering a Flexible Career Leave program that enables employees to take up to five years off to pursue studies or work on upgrading their language or communication skills, when accompanying a spouse who has been assigned abroad or embarks on international studies or take up to two years off to pursue studies at their own expense to further develop their expertise. In 2018, Sony Corporation expanded the scope of its Telework policy by making all employees eligible. At the same time, it also broadened the condition to allow up to ten full telecommuting days per month and in principle removed restrictions on the number of partial telecommuting days that employees can take. Accordingly, it was renamed the Flexible Work policy. The company will continue to expand programs to provide employees with flexible and efficient work options, with the aims of enhancing the business efficiency of its organizations, fostering an organizational culture that generates ideas, and increasing the productivity and output of each employee.\n\nSupporting Employees Balancing Work with Child Care, Nursing Care, and/or Medical Treatment\n\nThe Sony Group in Japan promotes the Symphony Plan, a system to support the work-life balance of employees that is focused on the three areas of child care, nursing care, and medical treatment. The plan is designed to help Sony employees achieve work-life balance by creating an environment in which they can make the most of their skills at all stages of their career and throughout the various events in their lives. Under the Symphony Plan, the Sony Group in Japan has various support programs including Child Care Paid Leave (up to 20 days), which can be used in conjunction with Child Care Leave, a Childcare and Nursing Care Leave Grant, which enables employees to take leave without having to worry about finances, and Accumulated Leave, which can be used for pregnancy, childbirth, child rearing, fertility treatment, nursing care, and medical treatment purposes. These programs are widely used by employees. For employees who have child care or nursing care responsibilities and fertility or cancer treatment, Sony provides support by offering the option of reduced working hours and allowing use of paid annual leave on an hourly basis for childcare or nursing care.\n\nIn fiscal 2017, Sony Corporation introduced a Career Plus program that supports career development while employees take parenting or nursing leave, by enabling employees to keep doing some work from home and also by subsidizing development programs such as language courses. The program provides greater flexibility for employees to continue their career development.\n\nPercentage of Employees Using Child Care Programs at Sony Group in Japan in Fiscal 2019*1 **2\n\n|

Group in Japan strives to create a corporate culture in which employees seeking to balance the demands of child care (or nursing care) and work can build careers. Sony conducts seminars for employees who will be taking maternity leave. At these seminars, employees gain knowledge and information that will be useful during leave, review their career so far, and start career planning for their return. Follow-up seminars are offered to those employees after returning to work. Both seminars are also attended by their managers. In addition, Sony conducts seminars for men in the workforce who are considering taking parental leave, to inform them about the various provisions available to them including paid and unpaid leave. The seminars include a Q&A with colleagues who have taken parental leave. Starting in 2018, Sony established a tie-up with a daycare provider to assist employees of Sony Group companies in Japan in the electronics business who find it difficult to secure a daycare for their children and return to work. The tie-up enables the use of corporate-led daycare facilities* throughout Japan.\n\nTo meet the needs of the growing number of family caregivers, Sony also conducted seminars and lectures on strategies for balancing nursing and work, while providing essential information about nursing. Through these initiatives, Sony is helping employees to continue developing their careers while balancing it with parenting and nursing.\n\n* Under amendments to Japan\u2019s Child and Child Care Support Act, which came into effect in April 2016, the Cabinet Office of Japan introduced provisions to allow for corporate-led daycare facilities in an effort to address shortages of and wait lists for daycare facilities, so that parents can work. The provisions enable corporations to organize the establishment and operation of daycare facilities.\n\nDiversity Week  >  External Evaluation\n\nOrganizational Culture and Communication\n\nCommunication\n\nSony values employee communication. Embracing a corporate culture that promotes the spirit of freedom and open-mindedness passed down since its founding, Sony fosters diverse forms of communication both within workplaces and across organizational boundaries in order to create value.\n\nCommunication between Top Management and Employees\n\nSony treats communication between top management, including the CEO, and employees as a priority. Through the corporate intranet, information is provided on progress made in the Group\u2019s businesses, and communications are exchanged via e-mail and other media. Sony also works to create many other opportunities for direct dialogue between top management and employees. For example, Sony management holds regular informal gatherings and town hall meetings with employees, which cover a wide variety of themes, from technology to management. By sharing opinions from both perspectives, not only do employees gain a closer affinity with management, but the views of employees can also be used to enhance the quality of management.\n\nEmployee Engagement Surveys\n\nSony\u2019s electronics business and game & network service business implement global employee engagement surveys to collect information that is used to increase the engagement of each employee and energize the organizations. The surveys gather and analyze information on key factors for continuously improving employee engagement such as employees\u2019 trust in the company and attitudes about value creation, work efficiency and effectiveness, job satisfaction, career and growth. The survey results are used to identify areas for further improvement and effective action. The survey results and analysis in 2019 indicated a strong degree of confidence in the future of the Sony Group overall, but there was room for improvement in employees\u2019 perceptions of the efficiency and effectiveness of work. The survey results were used as the basis for detailed analyses of each business segment and senior management discussions on effective action. The improvement initiatives were shared with employees via the corporate intranet and general meetings, with periodic review of results to monitor progress. The survey results were disclosed to managers on the day of the survey to facilitate open discussions with employees on improvements that can be made with regard to issues for each organization based on the results and comments from staff who provided them.\n\nSony makes the most of these employee surveys to shed light on employee engagement and incorporate results into ongoing discussion and action across its organizations. Sony\u2019s entertainment business and finance business are also implementing similar kinds of surveys.\n\n2019 Survey Response Rate\n\n88%\n\n2019 Employee Engagement Index*\n\n85%\n\n2018 Survey 91%\n2017 Survey 90%\n\n2018 Survey 86%\n2017 Survey 86%\n\n* Percentage of employees who did not give an unfavorable response to four questions regarding employee engagement\nCommunication among Employees\n\nSony is exploring new avenues for fostering even more active communication. Sony Group companies in the picture business and the electronics business operating in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region have adopted a system that allows employees to recognize and give accolades to peers for their contributions. Sony employees are voluntarily creating various communities across business and organizational boundaries, which serve as platforms for information exchange, learning, and idea creation. There are roughly 1,000 of these employee-driven communities active worldwide. Sony actively supports these communities by providing venues and platforms, providing endorsement from the management team, and asking management to be involved in planning various activities.\n\nLabor Unions\n\nSony maintains excellent labor-management relations. Approximately 11% of the overall workforce is unionized.\n\nWorkplace\n\nSony strives to create appealing workplaces that foster Sony\u2019s corporate culture and make it possible for people to work in diverse ways, while encouraging employees to take on new challenges and pursuing greater employee engagement.\n\nFostering Sony\u2019s Corporate Culture\n\nSony endeavors to create appealing workplaces that foster a corporate culture that will lead the company into the future. At the Sony City headquarters building, Sony\u2019s corporate culture is enhanced through user experience such as employee collaboration and variety of events. Sony has created a history wall outlining its corporate history with quotes from the founders and has also opened a lounge in the ground floor entrance hall of the headquarters building to communicate Sony\u2019s principles and corporate culture. Sony Group companies are also creating workplaces with their own unique identities and corporate cultures that add to Sony\u2019s diversity.\n\nMaking It Possible for People to Work in Diverse Ways\n\nSony\u2019s offices utilize open floor plans that encourage collaboration and foster the creativity and productivity of employees. Sony embraces an activity-based work-style concept to create functional workplaces that flexibly adapt to different styles of working and environments according to the work objectives and situation, enabling its diverse workforce to achieve a good work-life balance.\nEncouraging Employees to Take On New Challenges\n\nSony endeavors to create spaces that encourage employees to take on new challenges, guided by its vision of creativity and spirit of taking on challenges. The Creative Lounge at the Sony City headquarters building, Bridge Terminal at Sony City Osaki, and Comi-chika at the Atsugi Technology Center serve as creative collaboration spaces for open communication and idea generation, supporting employees as they take on new challenges. Sony operates the Sony Startup Acceleration Program to accelerate the development of new business applications based on ideas generated from these creative spaces.\n\nIncreasing Employee Engagement\n\nSony is increasing employee engagement by creating appealing workplaces that help to foster communication by offering amenities that enable employees to refresh the mind and body with good food and exercise. Sony collaborated with the lifestyle magazine Jiyujin to open The Farm, a cafeteria at the Sony City headquarters building that offers food made with fresh and seasonal ingredients in an urban office setting.\nOccupational Health & Safety\n\nSony has articulated a philosophy for Sony Group companies worldwide that states, \u201cThe Sony Group regards it as one of the critical values to secure the health and safety of workers. The Sony Group is committed to aiming at ZERO injury and ZERO illness, and to securing a safe and engaging environment in the workplace for all workers in any business activity.\u201d To fulfill this commitment, Sony works hard to build safe, healthy, and accident-free working environments.\n\nGlobal Occupational Health and Safety Initiatives\n\nSony Group OHS Vision\n\nSony has formulated the Sony Group OHS \u201cVision Zero\u201d with the ultimate objective of ensuring ZERO injury and ZERO illness.\n\nSony Group Global Policy on Occupational Health & Safety: Philosophy\n\nThe Sony Group regards it as one of the critical values to secure the health and safety of workers. The Sony Group is committed to aiming at ZERO injury and ZERO illness, and to securing a safe and engaging environment in the workplace for all workers in any business activity.\n\nSony Group OHS \u201cVision Zero\u201d\n\nSony does not tolerate occupational accidents and has set an ultimate goal of ZERO injury and ZERO illness.\n\nSony Group Global OHS Mid-Term Plan\n\nTo achieve its Vision Zero objectives, Sony is working to meet its OHS Mid-Term Plan, which is a globally shared plan. Sony has five action items under its OHS Mid-Term Plan for fiscal 2019-2021, as set out below.\n\n[All Sites]\n- Transition to ISO 45001 standard\n- Reduction of accidents caused by unsafe behavior\n- Reduction of health risks\n\n[Manufacturing Sites]\n- Better management of chemical substances\n- Reduction of accidents caused by machinery\n\n- Transition to ISO 45001 Standard\n\nSony used to operate its global OHS management system based on the OHSAS 18001 international standard. To further strengthen and promote OHS activities, Sony has started to operate an OHS management system based on the ISO 45001 international standard. In addition, Sony is working steadily to obtain ISO 45001 external certification beginning with manufacturing and distribution sites around the world and proceeding to other worksites from there. One worksite in Japan/East Asia, three in Pan Asia, and one in Europe have already obtained ISO 45001 external certification.\n\n- Reduction of Accidents Caused by Unsafe Behavior\n\nThe global occurrence of OHS incidents has been trending downward each year in terms of both numbers of incidents and lost work days, but Sony is still working to further reduce risks. An analysis of OHS incidents in all regions has prompted Sony to identify collisions, slips and falls due to unsafe behavior as a global priority due to the especially high number of such incidents. The target is to reduce the number of such incidents by 2021 to half the number of 2018.\n- Measures to Reduce Health Risks\nIf employees are to work with a sound body and mind, perform at peak capacity, and innovate, the company must provide them with dynamic and appealing work environments. To achieve this, Sony is carrying out assessments of harmful workplace risk factors, and these assessments cover mental health issues. Sony then implements health risk reduction measures and health promotion activities based on the results of these assessments. The goal is to increase employee engagement, thereby enabling people to work and grow in good health and spirit.\n\n- Improving Management of Chemical Substances / Reducing Accidents Caused by Machinery\nSony\u2019s R&D facilities and manufacturing sites use a wide variety of chemical substances and machinery, and reducing the risks associated with that use is an important determinant of the level of safety and health. Sony is establishing a risk assessment system that will not just identify hazards relating to chemical substances, machinery, and work modes, but will also check that legal requirements are met. This system will be deployed globally.\n\nGlobal OHS Organization\nTo ensure that all group companies operate under a single management structure, Sony has established six Regional Safety Offices (Japan/East Asia, China, the Pan Asia, Latin America, North America, and Europe Region) that are responsible for implementing cross-regional programs, and it has appointed Regional Safety Officers in each region.\n\nActivities of the Sony Headquarters OHS Office\n- Monitoring\nTo achieve the Vision Zero goals, the HQ OHS Office regularly collects information on the occurrence of occupational accidents and illnesses at Sony Group companies and sites, and information on the OHS activities carried out there. To collect information, Sony holds regular meetings with regional safety officers to share examples of good practices and events in the region, and this information is used in problem solving. Regional meetings are hosted by safety officers and attended by representatives from worksites in the region to gather opinions from individual workplaces and share about any issues. In addition to regularly including information on good practices collected by the HQ OHS Office in in-house newsletters, each time a significant incident occurs or information on an accident comes to light, the office also instructs that actions be taken to prevent a recurrence.\n\n- Global Audit System\nAt Sony\u2019s sites, internal audits, corporate audits and external audits are employed to examine the effectiveness of OHS management systems. Internal audits are conducted for sites to examine the effectiveness of their own OHS management system in order to continuously improve the system and ensure that occupational accidents are prevented. The HQ and Regional Safety Offices carry out corporate audits to examine compliance with corporate rules. External audits are conducted to provide confirmation of the effectiveness of the OHS management system by a third-party certification body. These three types of audits combine to determine the effectiveness of the Sony Group OHS management system as a whole. The HQ OHS Office is responsible for training corporate auditors and examining the effectiveness of audits carried out at the regional level. The Office, having established an in-house auditor system and determined auditor qualification requirements, conducts periodic auditor training to enhance auditing skills.\n- Management Review\nThe HQ OHS Office facilitates annual management reviews conducted by the officer in charge of human resources and general affairs based on each region\u2019s reports to evaluate OHS activities; the occurrence of occupational accidents and illnesses in each region; and the level of achievement of activity goals. Management comments set out in management reviews are reflected in the OHS Mid-Term Plan, and are fed back to each Regional Safety Office and to sites within each region.\n\n- OHS Education\nSony provides regional education tailored to its businesses in each region. Sony has added a new training program for internal auditors conducted by the HQ OHS Office to help business sites obtain external ISO 45001 certification. In Japan/East Asia, the Japan/East Asia Regional Safety Office provides group training to ensure that OHS managers and employees of business sites have the required skills.\n\nFiscal 2019 Japan/East Asia Regional Safety Office OHS Training\n\n| Training program                  | Target group                                      | No. of trainees |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| OHS Managers Basic Training       | Newly appointed worksite OHS managers             | 11              |\n| Accident Prevention Managers Basic Training | Newly appointed worksite accident prevention managers | 13              |\n| Workers Comp Basic Training       | Worksite OHS managers                             | 11              |\n| Laser Safety Management Training  | Worksite employees responsible for handling equipment | 60              |\n| Chemical Substance Handling and Risk Assessment Training | Worksite chemical substance managers | 9               |\n| Machinery/Equipment Handling and Risk Assessment Training | Worksite employees responsible for handling machinery and equipment | 17              |\n| Internal Auditors Training        | Worksite OHS managers                             | 18              |\n\n- OHS Risks\nIn Japan/East Asia Region, Sony is transitioning to occupational health and safety systems based on ISO 45001, and is acquiring ISO 45001 certification focusing on its manufacturing sites. Sony has set a medium-term goal of reducing accidents caused by unsafe behavior, aiming to reduce the number of accidents causing absence from work to 50% of fiscal 2018 levels by fiscal 2021, working toward its Vision Zero objectives.\n\nDespite these efforts, in fiscal 2019, some business sites recorded accidents in non-routine work as well as similar accidents occurring due to insufficient cause analysis. As a result, the number of accidents causing absence from work increased. Sony\u2019s Japan/East Asia Regional Safety Office issued instructions to the business sites concerned to make urgent improvements, focusing on accident reduction initiatives.\n\nIn addition, all Sony business sites are implementing initiatives involving reinforcement of fundamental safety practices, awareness of near-miss accidents, and comprehensive risk assessment. All Sony sites are working hard to improve their worksites and prevent occupational accidents from occurring, based on employee input.\n\nOccupational Health and Safety Initiatives by Region/Business\n\nOccupational Health and Safety Initiatives in Japan/East Asia\nTo achieve the Sony Group Global OHS Mid-Term Plan, Sony\u2019s business sites in Japan have addressed three categories of risk \u2014 occupational health and safety (OHS) risks, health risks, and fire risks \u2014 since fiscal 2019.\n- **Health Risks**\nIn addition to continuing with existing measures such as \u201cno overtime day,\u201d Sony strives to raise the implementation ratio of workplace improvements through stress checks and other measures and shares information on good practices throughout the group, as part of its effort to maintain and promote mental health.\nIn addition, Sony provides support for non-smoking activities, working toward the goal of keeping workplaces free of second-hand smoke.\n\n- **Fire Risk**\nAs part of their efforts to reduce fire risks, all Sony sites in Japan/East Asia use a fire risk checklist that is developed with disaster prevention managers, mainly at manufacturing sites. The fire risk checklist is used to assess fire risks, develop risk reduction measures, and reassess fire risks after implementing reduction measures.\nAt each site, a Fire and Disaster Prevention Committee is incorporated into the existing Occupational Health and Safety Committee, which identifies the key points, shares them throughout the group, and works to ensure that fire and disaster prevention measures are thoroughly implemented.\n\n**Occupational Health and Safety Initiatives in China**\nIn China, Sony is leveraging its accumulated knowledge and experience to implement occupation health and safety initiatives, based on the Sony Group Global Policy on Occupational Health and Safety.\n\n- **Accident Reduction Initiatives**\nSince fiscal 2015, Sony\u2019s business sites in China have continued to implement various accident reduction initiatives including initiatives that involve raising awareness of near-miss accidents, safety slogans, safety simulations for electric motorbikes, and production of safety videos. These initiatives were developed based on employee input and are directly implemented by employees, and have been successful in increasing employee awareness of safety. As a result, there was an 87% decrease in accidents in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2015. Notably, Sony has been implementing initiatives to reduce traffic accidents involving electric motorbikes for three straight years. In 2019, a member of the China Regional Safety Office gave a presentation at the 78th National Industrial Safety and Health Convention organized by the Japan Industrial Safety and Health Association (JISHA). Sony\u2019s sites in China have been acquiring OHSAS 18001 certification for occupational safety and health management systems since fiscal 2011. Starting in fiscal 2020, Sony sites, focusing on manufacturing sites, will transition to ISO 45001 and will acquire ISO 45001 certification.\n\n**Occupational Health and Safety Initiatives in North America**\nSony operations in North America consist of a diverse group of companies across many fields. Site headcounts range from fewer than 10 to more than 1,000 employees. The Sony Group Global Policy on Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) serves as the underlying guidance documentation. Sony DADC Terre Haute and Sony DADC in Bolingbrook are beginning their ISO45001 implementation. Operations strive for a well-balanced program of safety, health and wellness initiatives, in keeping with the type and size of operation.\n\n- **Safety**\nEmployee safety and regulatory compliance is a primary focus at all locations. Training is provided as needed on subjects ranging from ergonomics to chemical safety. Site-directed policies and procedures are also in place. Sony DADC Bolingbrook has a safety committee led by its Safety department. Team members across various operations meet quarterly to review audit findings. The team recently added P3 Load Levelers in the packaging department to prevent ergonomic-related injuries. As layers of boxes are added or removed, the P3 Load Leveler maintains pallets at the comfortable working height automatically, preventing stooping, stretching, or walking while loading and unloading pallets.\nOccupational Health and Safety Initiatives in Latin America\n\nIn Latin America, Sony has worked to establish OHS campaigns, internal audits focused on health, safety, and the environment, and has held proactive events. Each Sony location has an emergency preparedness plan in place, tailored to meet the potential emergencies that may occur at that site.\n\nThis includes the site response to fire, medical emergencies, earthquakes, hurricane and utility failures. Employee training and evacuation drills are conducted annually.\n\nOccupational Health and Safety Initiatives in Europe\n\n- Occupational Health and Safety Risk Reduction Program\n\nIn Europe, Sony has identified occupational health and safety (OHS) management as a top priority and has implemented an OHS risk reduction program since 2004. The program aims to lower OHS risk by reducing occupational accidents and strengthening the health and well-being of employees.\n\n- Sony UK Technology Centre has promoted a positive approach\n\nAt this site, the OHS team produces material monthly that is distributed throughout the site to all employees. To ensure that everyone gets to see the information, they make use of digital display screens, internal newsletters, and \u201cToolbox talk\u201d publications. Each month a Toolbox talk is produced on a different subject and communicated to each employee in departmental communications. The subject is selected from current trends on site, i.e. accident/near miss information. This keeps training up to date and relevant, keeps team players engaged with current safety information, and reinforces a positive safety culture throughout the site.\n\nOccupational Health and Safety Initiatives in Pan Asia\n\nAll manufacturing sites and some of non-manufacturing sites in Pan Asia Region have implemented a new OHS Management System based on ISO45001. It aims to prevent and reduce any kind of incident or occupational health and illness from affecting employees and others working to support our Sony operations through raising safety awareness by providing training, education and initiatives. In fiscal 2019, the injury case reduced more than 20% compared to fiscal 2018. three manufacturing sites have acquired ISO45001 certification and other four sites plan to be audited by the end of fiscal 2021.\n\n- OHS award recognition\n\nIn fiscal 2019, three sites in the Pan Asia Region were recognized with third-party OHS awards. These awards provide further motivation to ensure that operations continue to comply with the safety criteria of each award and that our employees and other stakeholders can work safely at Sony.\nGlobal Workplace Injury Statistics\n\nSony employs a global data collection system to gather occupational health and safety data in the countries and regions in which it has operations on a quarterly basis. Sony analyzes these statistics to gain an understanding of circumstances and trends in terms of country/region and accident type, in order to help prevent recurrences.\n\nWorkplace Accident Frequency Rates\n\n| Industry          | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Manufacturing     | 1.06 | 1.15 | 1.02 | 1.20 | 1.20 |\n| Electronics       | 0.54 | 0.51 | 0.45 | 0.58 | 0.54 |\n| Sony sites in     | 0.17 | 0.26 | 0.15 | 0.14 | 0.18 |\n| Japan/East Asia   |      |      |      |      |      |\n\n*1 Figures for Sony refer to the frequency rate of accidents causing one or more days of absence from work, including for external contractors, at the Sony Group\u2019s manufacturing, non-manufacturing, logistics and R&D sites in Japan/East Asia.

physically healthy if they are to perform at their best and create innovation. Sony focuses on enhancing organizational and personal wellbeing (health and happiness) by fostering a corporate culture that values both body and mind in order to help ensure sustained growth for both the company and employees.\n\nUsing data from checkups and stress checks, Sony is addressing employee health issues involving mental health, balancing medical treatment and work, and lifestyle disease and taking a number of steps to resolve these issues. Sony is focused on early detection and prevention of health problems, improving the workplace environment, and the health literacy of employees, and provides attentive, individualized support, offers education and training for line managers, and disseminates information and raises awareness via a variety of channels.\n\nPromoting Mental Health\n\nSony implements comprehensive mental health support measures with the aim of helping employees demonstrate their full potential. These efforts are focused particularly on preventing health problems and motivating employees and organizations.\n\nAnalysis of various health-related data has shown that the less stress-driven fatigue and anxiety employees experience, the more engaged they are. To bolster the ability of the individual to manage stress, which is a key to a vibrant organization, Sony holds mindfulness workshops for employees. In addition, medical personnel in the Sony Occupational Health Department focus on developing comfortable working environments by addressing mental health issues in each workplace and providing line managers with tips on addressing this issue. Sony also takes steps to bolster mental health training via group sessions and e-learning programs.\n\nSupport for individual employees is also important. Sony has established health-counseling services, offering access to in-person counseling with psychologists, as well as online counseling. Sony also works with outside professional organizations to implement a program under which employees returning to work after taking mental health leave receive help readjusting to the workplace via Sony\u2019s employee assistance program (EAP). Sony has in place a mental health support program to provide employees with psychological care in the event of natural disasters and other incidents, as well.\n\nHelping Employees Receive Treatment while Working\n\nFor employees who receive treatment for cancer or other illnesses while continuing to work, Sony offers counseling sessions with occupational health physicians and occupational health nurses, who reduce such employees\u2019 health risks by devising job arrangements tailored to each individual situation. Also, to ensure that employees are able to choose flexibly among a diverse array of working styles, Sony\u2019s managers, Human Resources Department, and Occupational Health Department work together to provide the most appropriate employment support. The company actively seeks to provide support that will enable employees to strike a proper balance between treatment and employment, and to work with fulfillment and motivation. In fiscal 2020, Sony introduced the Symphony Plan, a program to help employees strike this particular balance. Going forward, Sony will continue to enhance the support provided by incorporating expert perspectives, increasing the involvement of medical professionals and coordinating between internal and external stakeholders on working conditions tailored for individual treatment plans.\n\nManaging Health of Employees Who Work Long Hours\n\nAs part of the comprehensive efforts to help employees stay healthy and prevent health problems, Sony employees who work long hours are seen by occupational health physicians and occupational health nurses. Sony provides education and training for line managers on the health impact of working long hours to help these managers increase their understanding of and boost their skills in managing the work hours and health of the employees they manage. Working long hours for an excessive period of time can not only cause physical and mental health issues, but also reduce job satisfaction of employees and risk the health of the organization as a whole. Sony actively works to create a better work environment in both respects. Line managers, the Human Resources Department, and the Occupational Health Department work together to improve work environments, with workplace structures that do not place an excessive burden on certain employees and a focus on workplace culture in which employees feel comfortable consulting with their superiors.\n\nPreventing Lifestyle Diseases\n\nPreventing lifestyle diseases caused by lack of exercise and/or sleep, irregular eating habits, and other aspects of an imbalanced lifestyle is a major challenge for corporate employees. Sony makes sure that employees undergo comprehensive medical checkups and examinations and then receive personal health advice from occupational health physicians and occupational health nurses, as well as support for follow-up examinations at medical institutions if needed. Sony also focuses on counseling and advice dealing specifically with managing metabolic syndrome. In addition, Sony works on creating environments that foster better lifestyle habits by sharing health information via a variety of channels, improving employee cafeteria menus, and taking other steps based on employee health issues indicated by statistical figures derived from medical examinations and data analysis.\nHelping Employees Quit Smoking and Preventing Passive Smoking\n\nSony actively encourages employees to quit smoking and works to prevent second-hand smoke from affecting non-smokers. With Japan\u2019s amended Health Promotion Act, which calls for the elimination of unwanted passive smoking, going into effect in April 2020, Sony is doing more than simply eliminating cigarettes and smoking areas from work environments by reducing the number of smoking rooms in buildings and moving smoking areas outdoors. Sony hopes to make its work environments completely smoke-free by motivating smokers to quit, striving to ensure that they correctly understand the health risks to themselves and, through second-hand smoke, to those around them. Toward this end, Sony occupational health physicians and occupational health nurses work closely with employees who are smokers to provide one-on-one counseling and support. Other support measures include providing financial assistance for employees to participate in stop-smoking support programs, support for outpatient stop-smoking medical consultations, and information and awareness-raising via a variety of channels. These efforts are gradually reducing the percentage of Sony employees who smoke, which is now below 10%.\n\nResponding to Infectious Diseases\n\nWith today\u2019s increasing globalization of business, the risk of pandemics is on the increase. In addition to protecting employees from these threats by arranging for employees to receive necessary vaccinations if they work in or travel on business to countries at risk, Sony also provides information on safety and infectious diseases in specific countries, issues alerts, and implements such safety measures as restrictions on business travel under certain circumstances. Timely information on such infectious diseases as malaria, hepatitis, and HIV is also provided to employees. In Japan, if there is an outbreak of a new strain of influenza, tuberculosis, rubella, measles, or other illness, Sony cooperates with the government and other entities as necessary in order to respond flexibly while staying ready to implement business continuity plans.\n\nResponding to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sony places the highest priority on the safety and health of employees and their families and works to ensure that all employees are aware of measures to take to prevent the spread of infection. The Sony Occupational Health Department has also set up a hotline to provide support to employees who are dealing with anxiety and stress during this time. In addition, Sony has established a system under which occupational health physicians and occupational health nurses follow up individually with employees who are pregnant or have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, or respiratory disease and at high risk of becoming seriously ill in the unlikely event of infection, and proper consideration is given to their working conditions. Finally, to help employees stay healthy as they spend more time at home and telecommuting, Sony provides information based on the advice of medical professionals about working from home, lifestyle and habits, and techniques for managing stress.\n\nHealth Management for Employees Transferred Overseas\n\nAt present, Sony employees and their family members from Japan are stationed in 40 countries worldwide. This is why Sony has established a health management system that ensures that staff transferred overseas or traveling on business can work in safety and good health when they change workplaces. Before departing for an overseas post, in addition to receiving healthcare information, medical checkups, and vaccinations, employees are provided with information on the medical, health, hygiene conditions and medical facilities in the country where they will be stationed. Employees also receive online health guidance and counseling and regular healthcare information during their period of stay. Sony offers employees stationed overseas with the same stress checks that employees in Japan receive, working to improve work environment and support mental health at the place of assignment. In addition, Sony works to prevent disease and mitigate risk, with occupational health physicians making the rounds of worksites and medical facilities overseas to provide the support that employees working overseas need to feel secure.\nExternal Evaluation\n\nThe Sony Group\u2019s initiatives have earned high marks from various global institutions.\n\nSony Group in Japan\n\n- Received a gold rating in the Pride Index for its LGBT initiatives for four consecutive years since 2016. The Group\u2019s rating highlighted its equal treatment policy for same-sex partners and heterosexual spouses in its employee benefit and welfare policy.*\n\n* The employee benefit and welfare policy includes recognition of transfers to new posts away from family and separation allowances, congratulatory and condolence payments, congratulatory and condolence leave, school bag presentation ceremonies, Sony Family Day (family visits to the workplace), babysitter/child care subsidies, childcare leave, reduced working hours for childcare, care receiver conditions under the nursing care-related policy, and eligibility for Sony Family Cards.\n\nSony Corporation\n\n- In 2017, won the Grand Prix of Ikumen Award from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare\n- In 2016, awarded the highest level of \u201cEruboshi\u201d certification by Japan\u2019s Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare in recognition of its outstanding performance in promoting women\u2019s interests. This recognition was granted because Sony was found to satisfy all five criteria set out in the Act on Promotion of Women\u2019s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace: (1) hiring; (2) continuous employment; (3) work hours and other working conditions; (4) women\u2019s share of management positions; and (5) diversity in career path options.\n- In 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2015, certified by the Tokyo Labor Bureau as a company that actively supports parenting initiatives in line with the Law for Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation.\n\nSony Group companies outside Japan\n\n- Sony Corporation joined The Valuable 500, an international initiative launched at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in January 2019 to help business leaders make the changes that allow individuals with disabilities to demonstrate their latent potential to bring value to business, society, and the economy.\n- Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Corporation of America, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Sony North America all received a 100% rating in the Corporate Equality Index (Rating Workplaces on LGBTQ Equality) operated by Human Rights Campaign.\n- Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. was recognized by the National Business Inclusion Consortium and the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce as a 2019 Best of the Best Corporation for Inclusion.\n\nMoving forward, Sony will continue working in line with its Diversity Policy to build a work environment where employees will all be able to fully demonstrate their individuality and abilities, and diverse employees can play major, meaningful roles.\n\nKey Activities to Promote Women\u2019s Career Development at the Sony Group around the World\n\n- LGBT Initiatives by the Sony Group around the World\n- Key Activities to Promote Career Development of Individuals with Disabilities at the Sony Group around the World\n- Main Work-Life Balance Initiatives at the Sony Group around the World\nManagement Approach\n\nMateriality Rationale\nIn recent years, stakeholders have grown increasingly aware of how crucial it is that companies fulfill their overall responsibilities throughout their supply chains, including procurement and production. Sony takes these stakeholder concerns seriously and is working closely with its suppliers on initiatives in fields such as human rights, labor conditions, health and safety, and environmental protection. These initiatives cover not only Sony\u2019s own sites, but sites throughout the supply chain \u2014 from parts and material suppliers, to mineral mining operations, to production sites operated both by Sony and by subcontractors.\n\nBasic Approach\nThe foundation of Sony\u2019s efforts to build a responsible supply chain is the compliance of each and every director, executive, and employee with the Sony Group Code of Conduct and ethical business practices. Based on this approach, Sony focuses on supply chain management and responsible procurement of minerals and works with suppliers and subcontractors to establish a responsible supply chain that ensures compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct and the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals. These efforts are undertaken in collaboration with relevant industry organizations and other stakeholders.\n\nStructure\nAt Sony, the CSR and compliance groups at the head office and Sony Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation (SGMO) take the lead in promoting responsible sourcing activities in cooperation with other related head office divisions, business groups and relevant functions at manufacturing sites. The CSR group at the head office formulates group-wide supply chain management policy. With guidance from the corporate executive officer in charge of production and procurement, the representative director and president of SGMO is responsible for the implementation of the policy.\n\nSony also operates the Supplier Hotline for complaints and the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals Hotline for stakeholders to report possible policy violations in the supply chain. These hotlines help Sony to improve its responsible sourcing.\n\nMain Achievements in Fiscal 2019\nHere are the main results of fiscal 2019 initiatives:\n- Conducted CSR self-assessment surveys at 14 Sony manufacturing sites in Japan, China, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, the UK, and Brazil\n- Conducted in-person interviews of on-site contractors at a number of manufacturing sites in Japan, covering their hiring process for technical intern trainees and the labor conditions of trainees\n- Conducted CSR assessments at 162 Sony suppliers\n- Requested secondary suppliers to comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct\n- Conducted on-site assessment at supplier plants to assist with labor and health/safety management\n- Encouraged cobalt refineries in supply chain to join the audit program, and donated funds to the foundation that covers the cost for refineries to undergo assessments\nSupply Chain Management\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nSony supply chain management focuses not only on its own production sites, but also on those of suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nBasic Structure of the Supply Chain\n\nEstablishing and Promoting the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct\n\nBasic Approach\n\nSony recognizes the increasing importance of global companies\u2019 responsibility to manage their supply chains responsibly as diligent members of society and is taking a variety of steps to structure a responsible supply chain. Sony works with its suppliers to address issues such as human rights, labor conditions, health and safety, and environmental protection throughout its supply chain.\n\nMilestones\n\n2004: Sony joins the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC, now the Responsible Business Alliance) as a founding member\n2005: Sony Supplier Code of Conduct established\n2006: EICC self-assessment started at electronics manufacturing sites\n2012: Sony Supplier Code of Conduct revised to create second edition\n2014: Sony Group Conflict Minerals Policy established and a survey on use of conflict minerals started\n2016: Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct established and cobalt supply chain assessment started\n2017: Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct revised to create second edition and Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals established\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nIn order to further strengthen efforts to establish a responsible supply chain, Sony will expand assessments of its own sites and its suppliers, for example by having primary suppliers request secondary suppliers and other subcontractors to comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Sony remains committed to ongoing efforts to raise awareness, educate, and provide training not only to the employee, but also across the supply chain, communicating with suppliers to raise awareness and the capacity to respond effectively to responsible supply chain issues. Sony will also continue to strengthen its countermeasures of high-risk minerals in its procurement.\nSony Supply Chain\nThe Sony supply chain stretches across the entire globe. As of March 2020, the Group has its own electronics manufacturing facilities in Japan, China, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, the UK, and Brazil. In fiscal 2019, the value of transactions with parts suppliers and OEM/ODM suppliers by geographic area was as follows: Mainland China and Hong Kong Region (41.3%), Japan (24.1%), Asia-Pacific (16.5%), Europe (10.6%), the US (below 0.3%), and other areas (7.3%).\n\nElectronics manufacturing facilities at Sony\n[UK]\n- Sony Europe B.V.

Conduct at Sony production sites is guided by the code issued by the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA*), which Sony joined when the alliance was established in 2004. All Sony electronics manufacturing sites are involved in ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with the RBA Code of Conduct, which represents industry best practices. Recognizing that parts suppliers, subcontractors in design and production, and other partner firms are all involved in the production of Sony products, and seeing the need to address these issues within a framework that meets Sony\u2019s standards, in 2005 Sony established the Sony Supplier Code of Conduct, based on the RBA Code of Conduct.\n\nTo enhance its CSR management in the supply chain, in 2016 Sony replaced the Sony Supplier Code of Conduct with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. The new code adopts the RBA Code of Conduct to govern all manufacturing processes at both Sony\u2019s own electronics manufacturing sites and those of its suppliers. The RBA Code of Conduct has been translated into 26 languages including English, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Malay, and was updated from Version 5.1 to the current Version 6.0 effective January 1, 2018. Accordingly, the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct was updated to Version 2 to adhere to the changes in the RBA Code of Conduct.\n\nCompliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is included in the contract signed when Sony begins doing business with a supplier. As a part of the customer requirements under this Code of Conduct, Sony requests compliance with Green Partner Environmental Quality Approval Program and the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals.\n\n*1 The Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) changed its name to the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in October 2017.\n\nIssues Covered in the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct\n\n| A.

Under the supervision of the Senior Executive Officer in charge of CSR, the Sony CSR group at the head office assesses external trends and communicates with stakeholders, drawing on both to formulate basic company-wide supply chain management policy. The Senior Executive Officer in charge of Production and Procurement and the Senior Executive Officers in charge of each business unit appoint managers responsible for implementing the Rules in relevant areas and set up administrative offices.\n\nImplementation Framework of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct\nThe administrative offices are responsible for the general execution of the Operational Rules for the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, which includes ensuring compliance with the Code at electronics manufacturing sites both at Sony and its suppliers, conducting risk assessments and regular monitoring, and implementing necessary improvements. The offices are also working to provide training to improve awareness and boost the relevant skills of procurement personnel.\n\nIn cases where assessments or external sources indicate any possibility of violations of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct or a material legal violation, or in cases where the supplier does not provide adequate cooperation with assessments and audits, the managers responsible for implementing the Rules work together with the CSR and compliance groups at the head office to determine the facts and take action deemed necessary, and the situation is immediately reported to the relevant manufacturing site or the Senior Executive Officer in charge of the business unit engaged with that supplier.\n\n**Initiatives at Sony Electronics Manufacturing Sites**\n\n**Conducting Regular Assessments**\n\nAs part of its efforts to ascertain Sony manufacturing sites\u2019 compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, Sony uses standard tools provided by the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) to check compliance, assess improvements, and implement other monitoring activities. Specifically, Sony utilizes the RBA questionnaire as an annual CSR self-assessment survey at all of its electronics manufacturing sites in and outside of Japan to evaluate compliance in five categories designated by the RBA Code of Conduct: labor, health and safety, ethics, environment, and management systems. At manufacturing sites where self-assessment surveys indicate issues with compliance and further evaluation and improvement in these areas are deemed necessary, appropriate measures to improve compliance are developed and implemented. In fiscal 2019, 14 manufacturing sites in Japan, China, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, UK, and Brazil completed self-assessment surveys. The results showed that risk of non-compliance was low at all manufacturing sites. In cases where any possibility of violations of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is reported by external sources, such as NGOs or media reports, the manufacturing site in question determines the facts of the case. If this determination confirms the reported violations, Sony ensures that appropriate action is immediately taken, including an RBA audit conducted by a third-party auditor.\n\n**Assessment of Hiring and Labor Conditions for Foreign Workers**\n\nThere are mounting social expectations for global corporations to conduct human rights due diligence for their supply chains. For example, the United Kingdom enacted the Modern Slavery Act to prevent modern forms of slavery such as forced labor in supply chains. Malaysia in particular has many foreign workers who are employed at manufacturing facilities for electronic products and components. An international human rights non-governmental organization has issued a report citing forced labor conditions among foreign workers in Malaysia\u2019s electronics industry. The practices cited include workers being charged excess commissions upon hiring and employers retaining workers\u2019 passports, making it difficult for workers to get their passports back when they needed them. These conditions limit the freedoms of foreign workers who are living away from their home countries, leading to forced labor conditions.\n\nSony also employs many foreign workers at its manufacturing sites in Malaysia. In response to social concerns over forced labor, Sony commissioned a third-party assessment involving a fact-finding survey and risk identification regarding employment of foreign workers and their labor conditions at Sony manufacturing sites in Malaysia in fiscal 2016. The assessment was conducted by the non-profit Business for Social Responsibility, which provides its member companies with research and consulting services relating to corporate social responsibility.\n\nThe third-party assessment was implemented by interviewing management, HR department staff, and foreign workers from Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, as well as interviewing temporary staffing agencies acting as intermediaries for foreign workers either in their home countries or Malaysia. Personnel from the CSR department in Japan were dispatched to Malaysia to observe the assessment, which covered the entire process from before hiring (prior to leaving the home country) to actual hiring and conditions after termination of employment (after expiry of the employment contract). The assessment did not find any cases that qualified as serious legal violations, but identified some areas for improvement that Sony is currently working to address. For example, the assessment found that living conditions for foreign workers hired through temporary staffing agencies could be improved in terms of the cleanliness of dormitories, living space provided, and surrounding environment. Sony is working with temporary staffing agencies to make improvements by implementing follow-up visits to dormitories, as well as recognizing agencies that have made positive improvements and sharing their initiatives among agencies.\n\nMany foreign workers including technical intern trainees are employed in Japan across various industries, including manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and construction, and as caregivers. With the increase in media coverage, allegations of foreign worker exploitation have been recognized as an important social issue in Japan. Since fiscal 2017, Sony has been conducting surveys of actual work conditions and risk assessments to monitor the employment status and labor conditions of foreign workers at Sony manufacturing sites in Japan. The assessments check whether the site has any foreign workers or not (in either direct or indirect employment) and confirm the hiring processes and labor conditions. The surveys of actual conditions are conducted for select manufacturing sites.\nIn 2019, a number of manufacturing sites conducted in-person interviews of on-site subcontractors to verify their hiring processes for technical intern trainees in Japan and the countries in which they were hired, as well as the labor conditions of trainees.\n\n**Education to Raise the Awareness of Procurement Personnel**\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Sony conducted group training on the requirements of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct for all procurement personnel in Japan, in an effort to ensure socially responsible supply chains. The training educated employees on the importance of socially responsible procurement and how it relates to their work and assessed their general understanding. Sony will continue to work to raise awareness of socially responsible procurement.\n\n**Sony\u2019s Approach to Supplier Relations**\n\n**Monitoring Activities and Follow-up Measures to Ensure Compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct**\n\nThe Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct outlines Sony\u2019s expectations of its suppliers. Compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is included in contracts signed when Sony begins doing business with a supplier. Suppliers are kept informed of changes to the Code of Conduct and receive updated documents. To further ensure that suppliers are taking action to comply with the Code of Conduct, Sony regularly reminds suppliers of their responsibilities and obtains a written confirmation of compliance from suppliers. In fiscal 2019, Sony reminded all suppliers of their requirements under the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, which include observing the rights of workers to choose employment freely, to receive humane treatment, and not to face discrimination. Sony also requested all suppliers to further tighten their supply chain management to prevent forced labor.\n\nAs part of its efforts to ascertain supplier compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, Sony conducts assessments based on the supplier\u2019s risk level, for all new suppliers and their manufacturing facilities. If Sony does not deal directly with the manufacturing facility, the assessments are conducted through the trading company or manufacturer that Sony does business with.\n\n**Risk-Based Supplier Assessment**\n\nAll direct suppliers and their manufacturing facilities are requested to comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Suppliers and their manufacturing facilities are categorized by risk level, based on such factors as the country and region in which they are located, size of business, industry, and type of business. Suppliers and their manufacturing facilities conduct a CSR self-assessment using questionnaires from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), and the questionnaire results are analyzed to identify potential risks. Based on the results, Sony evaluates whether suppliers are complying with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct at each of the suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities. In recent years, forced labor and other social issues have become more and more serious around the world. In 2020, Sony expanded the scope of the document assessments in order to address these supply chain risks.\nIf a manufacturer is suspected to be in violation of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, an on-site visit is conducted to verify the actual management situation. Sony issues improvement instructions if needed, verifies the improvement results, and assesses to start business dealings. If there is any doubt about compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct at a supplier\u2019s manufacturing facilities, the supplier is removed from consideration for starting business dealings with Sony.\n\nThe following are examples of serious violations:\n- Forced labor\n- Child labor\n- Inhumane working conditions\n- Unlawful discrimination\n- Lack of an emergency and disaster action plan\n- Presence of risks that cause a serious life-threatening accident to a worker\n- Significant environmental pollution issue\n\nMajor OEM suppliers that do sizable business with Sony continue to conduct annual self-assessments using RBA Online even after starting business dealings. In fiscal 2019, Sony requested that all suppliers including existing suppliers comply with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, and conducted document assessments for 92 companies. Based on the document assessment results, Sony identified nine high-risk suppliers and conducted on-site assessments of 8 companies that were determined to be at risk of violating the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Sony conducted assessments of approximately 619 companies over a three-year period.\n\nExamples of Instructions for Improvement Based on Observations from On-Site Assessments\n- **Working hours**\n  - **Observation:** Excessive working hours at a supplier in China (over 60 hours per week)\n  - **Improvement instructions:** Requested systematic improvement of working hours (to bring them below 60 hours per week), and regular monitoring until improvements are completed\n- **Employment of foreign workers**\n  - **Observation:** Passports belonging to foreign workers were being held by a supplier in Malaysia\n  - **Improvement instructions:** Requested that workers be allowed to keep passports themselves or that passports be held but available to workers at any time. The improvements were confirmed to have been implemented.\n- **Young workers and student workers**\n  - **Observation:** Young workers and student workers were working long hours or at night shifts at a supplier in China\n  - **Improvement instructions:** Made the supplier prepare an improvement plan to eliminate long working hours and night shifts. The improvements were confirmed to have been implemented.\n- **Employment-related fees**\n  - **Observation:** Workers at suppliers in China were paying for medical checkups out of pocket\n  - **Improvement instructions:** Made suppliers refund checkup fees and produce verified refund records\nIn cases where any possibility of violations is reported at a secondary supplier, Sony works with the primary supplier to ensure that remedial action is carried out.\n\n**Initiatives for Secondary and Further Suppliers**\n\nSony requires that its primary suppliers ensure that the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is observed by secondary and further suppliers. Primary suppliers conduct self-assessments to verify their understanding of the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct and to ensure that it has been communicated internally and is being complied with. Additionally, primary suppliers communicate the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct to their own supply chains and require compliance.\n\n**Communicating and Partnering with Suppliers**\n\nSony has appointed CSR specialists to communicate directly with suppliers to provide education and training opportunities to improve their capabilities. These CSR specialists strive to ensure that suppliers make continuous efforts to improve management systems and other organizational structures, by communicating with them and providing direct guidance on ways to improve. Personnel who are involved in parts procurement receive training on socially responsible procurement and the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct is factored in when choosing suppliers, who are assessed and selected based on their human rights, ethical, environmental, and health and safety initiatives, one of the key criteria used by Sony in supplier selection.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Sony took steps to further tighten supply chain management to prevent forced labor. Through its supplier portal site, Sony posted information on recent legislative and regulatory trends concerning human rights and provided industry examples of human rights issues. Sony also posted the Code of Conduct and provided assessment tools through the portal.\n\nSony will continue to educate and support suppliers with their CSR initiatives encompassing health, safety, and the environment, through various means including regular meetings with suppliers.\n\n**Supplier Hotline**\n\nSony has established a Supplier Hotline which suppliers may use to report conduct by a Sony Group company executive or employee that violates laws, regulations, the Sony Group Code of Conduct, or the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, as well as conduct that violates the company\u2019s agreements with suppliers. The hotline is part of a framework that Sony is building to facilitate sharing of concrete information on cases where the conduct of a Sony Group company executive or employee has been identified to be in violation (or possible violation) of any laws, regulations, the Sony Group Code of Conduct, the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct or an agreement between Sony and a supplier.\n\nWhat Sony Expects of Suppliers\nWorking with Industry Groups\n\nParticipation in the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)\n\nSupply chains overlap considerably in the electronics industry, with multiple manufacturers of finished products sharing the same subcontractors and parts suppliers. Accordingly, there are fears that the introduction of independent, company-specific standards for socially responsible management will cause confusion and constitute a significant burden on companies in the supply chain. With the aim of improving processes in the electronics industry supply chain, in 2004 Sony and other companies established the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC, currently the RBA). The alliance then developed the RBA Code of Conduct (formerly the EICC Code of Conduct) incorporating best industry practices.\n\nThe RBA is working with its member companies to develop tools that help to establish and manage codes of conduct, Web-based systems, and skills development programs for suppliers. As of June 2020, the RBA consisted of 158 participating companies from Europe, the Americas and Asia, and members included manufacturers and OEM companies. The RBA has membership categories for different levels of engagement and has granted Full Member status to Sony, its highest membership category. Sony was granted representation on the RBA Board of Directors in 2020.\n\nThe RBA promotes corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supply chains through the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which addresses issues with minerals procurement, the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI), which addresses human rights issues such as forced labor, and other programs.\nResponsible Sourcing of Minerals\n\nIn recent years, stakeholders have become increasingly concerned about violations of the human rights of workers and environmental issues in the sourcing of mineral resources essential for the manufacture of electronic products. Sony is working with its suppliers to address issues related to human rights, labor conditions, health and safety, and environmental protection at production sites, as well as in its procurement of minerals.\n\nEstablishing the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals\n\nSome minerals that are used in Sony products carry human rights and environmental risks in the extraction process. Sony has pledged its strong commitment to ethical business conduct and respect for human rights in the Sony Group Code of Conduct, which sets forth such core values and establishes basic policies including the prohibitions of using any form of forced labor, and specifically, child labor. To ensure compliance with the same standards throughout the electronics supply chain, including its own manufacturing sites, Sony has established the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct. All the suppliers are requested to fully comprehend and comply with the Code in supplier contracts. In addition, in October 2017, Sony established the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals, replacing the Sony Group Conflict Minerals Policy that was established in 2014. In the policy, Sony pledges that, in order to avoid contributing to conflicts or serious human rights abuses through its sourcing practices, Sony identifies certain minerals that are sourced in conflict-affected and high-risk areas and that are high-risk for Sony from the corporate social responsibility viewpoint (\u201cHigh-Risk Minerals\u201d). Sony\u2019s policy is to refrain from knowingly purchasing any products, components or materials that contain the High-Risk Minerals that contribute to conflicts or serious human rights abuses in the chain of custody. At the same time, in implementing the policy, Sony makes sure that it is still able to source responsibly from those areas and avoid a de facto embargo. Sony currently identifies tantalum, tin, gold, tungsten and cobalt as High-Risk Minerals.\n\nTo obtain full compliance with this policy, Sony requires its suppliers to source from smelters that comply with the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) program of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which was established by the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), or from smelters certified as being free from involvement in any armed conflicts or any serious human rights abuses, based on another trusted traceability project.\n\nSony has designed an internal due diligence framework to determine the country of origin and chain of custody for any High-Risk Minerals in its supply chain. This due diligence framework is designed to conform with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Guidance).\n\nAddressing the Issue of Conflict Minerals\n\nAddressing US Law on Conflict Minerals\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its adjacent countries have been mired in conflict with armed groups perpetuating human rights abuses in that region. These armed groups have been trading in certain minerals commonly found in that region to finance their activities. These minerals, tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten (\u201cthe four minerals\u201d) are commonly found in many products, ranging from jewelry to electronics to airplane components. Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the United States, which first became effective in January 2013, defines the four minerals as \u201cconflict minerals.\u201d This law seeks to ensure transparency and reporting related to conflict minerals and requires companies whose stock is listed on a US stock exchange, as Sony\u2019s is, to conduct an inquiry into the origin of the four minerals in their supply chains. On May 29, 2020, Sony submitted its seventh report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) based on its review of its supply chain activities for the 2019 calendar year.\n\nSurvey and Results on Use of the Four Minerals\n\nThe four minerals enter global supply chains from numerous countries. Determining the mine of origin for these minerals requires the cooperation of many levels of suppliers and intermediaries in the supply chain. Sony is committed to working with suppliers to continuously improve supply chain transparency and reduce risk.\n\nIn investigating the origin of the four minerals used by the Sony Group overall, Sony first checks its operations to see where the four minerals are used in its products, and then identifies relevant products that are manufactured or outsourced for manufacturing by Sony in the survey year concerned. The survey is then conducted targeting electronic products requiring any of the four minerals either for product functionality or manufacture, including game consoles, in order to identify the smelters or countries of origin for the procured minerals concerned. The survey is conducted using the RMI Conflict Minerals Response Template (CMRT), the industry standard, and target suppliers are asked to participate by filling out a survey response for each product concerned. The smelters indicated in the survey responses are then carefully compared to the RMI smelters list.\n\nIn 2019, while the results of Sony\u2019s due diligence for the report to the SEC did not reveal that any of the tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold in Sony\u2019s electronics products was\nsourced from the DRC or any of its adjacent countries, Sony concluded that it lacked sufficient information at this time to definitively determine the country of origin of all such minerals in its electronics products. Sony identified a total of 326 smelters and refiners as potential sources of the four minerals and, of those, 270 smelters and refiners** were compliant with RMAP or were currently under the RMAP audit process; 88 of these smelters and refiners*** in the supply chain were reported to procure materials from the DRC and its adjacent countries.\n\n*2 Includes smelters under RMAP assessment\n*3 Please refer to the smelter list in the aforementioned Sony report to the SEC, which includes smelters confirmed as conflict-free through Sony\u2019s traceability program.\n\nExpectations for Sony Suppliers of the Four Minerals\n\nIf it is determined that any of the four minerals is used in the manufacture of products, Sony requires relevant suppliers to comply with the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals and to fully cooperate with its due diligence efforts regarding sourcing the four minerals in accordance with the terms of this policy. In addition, to ensure that products, components or materials delivered to Sony do not contain any conflict minerals, Sony expects suppliers to have in place pertinent policies, a due diligence framework and a management system consistent with the OECD guidance.\n\nApproach to Mitigating Risks in the Supply Chain\n\nIn the event that Sony confirms that any of its products, components or materials may contain conflict minerals, Sony, in collaboration with relevant suppliers, shall take actions reasonably necessary to eliminate such minerals from such products, components or materials and shall request that the suppliers makes necessary improvement to its sourcing practices. This includes adoption of a conflict-free sourcing policy, increased responsiveness and accuracy of the supplier survey, and increased use of the four minerals sourced from smelters or refiners participating in the RMAP program. Further, in the event that Sony confirms that a supplier has failed to cooperate sufficiently with a due-diligence investigation, fails to follow Sony requests for remediation or has otherwise violated this policy, Sony shall take necessary actions, including without limitation, termination of business with such supplier by stopping new orders. As part of its efforts to promote RMAP-conformance among smelters, Sony identifies non-conformant smelters and works with them to gain certification. In 2019, 88 suppliers specified in their CMRT that they source from smelters that were not listed as conformant and that were unwilling to undergo an RMAP assessment. As a result of an improvement request by Sony, 38 suppliers conducted investigations and responded that the non-compliant smelters were not in fact in their supply chains, while 22 replied that improvement measures would be taken.\n\nSony has also established a hotline to allow any interested party to voice concerns regarding the circumstances of mineral extraction, trade, handling and/or export in conflict-affected and other high-risk areas. In addition to its internal risk assessments, the hotline enables Sony to be alerted to risks in its supply chain.\n\nSony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals Hotline\n\nManaging the Cobalt Supply Chain\n\nCobalt is an important mineral used in lithium-ion batteries for smart phones, electric vehicles, and other electronic products. There have been concerns about child labor and working conditions at sites where it is extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country known to have the largest reserves of cobalt in the world.\n\nSony recognizes the human rights risks that exist at cobalt mining sites. In fiscal 2016, all Sony suppliers of lithium-ion batteries and their parts were evaluated for compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct, and the chains of custody in the cobalt supply chain were examined. As a result, it was discovered that some battery parts procured by Sony contained cobalt produced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Sony has since required that all its surveyed suppliers, as well as upstream suppliers, be fully compliant with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct.\n\nBased on these results, Sony established the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals in October 2017. This policy is a revision of the Sony Group Conflict Minerals Policy, which targeted the four minerals. In addition to the four minerals, Sony has recognized cobalt as another high risk mineral and launched efforts to build a responsible cobalt supply chain. Since then, Sony has continued to manage its cobalt supply chain based on industry standard tools, such as the development of the Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) by RMI and the start of third-party RMAP audits of cobalt refineries.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Sony conducted another survey using CRT of nine lithium-ion battery suppliers and identified 17 cobalt refineries in the supply chain. Of these refineries, 14 were confirmed as RMAP compliant or had RMAP-based third-party audits in progress*. In addition to directly making requests to the remaining three refineries to undergo third-party RMAP audits, Sony also asked the two battery suppliers with these three refineries in their supply chains to encourage the refineries to undergo third-party audits. In addition, Sony has been a regular donor to the RMI Initial Audit Fund since fiscal 2016. The fund helps cover the costs for cobalt refineries to undergo third-party RMAP audits.\n\n*4 As of March 2020\nMulti-Stakeholder Cooperation\n\nSony recognizes that multi-stakeholder collaboration is the key to identifying and mitigating the adverse human rights impact that can be associated with mineral extraction in high-risk areas. Specifically, Sony continuously collaborates with various multi-stakeholder efforts such as RMI in order to participate in the development of the due diligence process and mitigate human rights risks in the supply chain.\n\nParticipating in Industry Groups and the Public-Private Alliance\n\nSony actively participates in and supports industry groups and alliances that seek to identify and prevent or mitigate the adverse impact associated with mineral extraction in high-risk areas. The Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC, currently RBA) was founded with the objective of addressing social and environmental issues in the electronics supply chain. In 2011, the EICC launched the Conflict-Free Smelter Program (CFSP, currently RMAP), to provide leadership to the industry in this area. With the aim of promoting collaboration with other industries and multiple stakeholders, in August 2013 the EICC/GeSI launched the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI, currently RMI). Sony is a founding member of the initiative. Sony utilizes the frameworks developed by the industry groups and alliances as part of its efforts to ensure responsible sourcing of raw materials. In 2016, Sony took steps to help all smelters in its supply chain to acquire CFSP validation by donating funds to help support the Initial Audit Fund. The fund is currently operated by the RMI and serves as an initiative to encourage smelter participation in RMAP by covering the expenses involved for smelters undergoing the initial audit for RMAP validation inspection.\n\nSony also participates in the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA), a joint effort of government, industry and civil society organizations led by the U.S. government to support responsible mineral trade from the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. Since its establishment, the PPA has supported the creation of a pilot supply chain management system that includes certifying conflict-free mines, that is, mines that engage in responsible trade practices. The PPA also provides a platform for coordination among government, industry and civil society actors seeking to support conflict-free sourcing and self-sustaining trade from the DRC and the Great Lakes Region, and its website serves as a resource for companies seeking information regarding how to source responsibly.\n\nMoreover, as part of its overall effort to achieve conflict-free supply chains, Sony promotes active, ongoing dialogue with civil society organizations, industry groups and other external stakeholders for further improvement of conflict-free sourcing practices. For example, RMI holds workshops for discussions with NGOs, socially responsible investors, local government representatives and other stakeholders, in which Sony participates. Sony also works to support the industry initiatives of the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA).\n\n- Academic Research Project on Small-scale Mining in Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\nIn fiscal 2017, to better understand the current situation of artisanal and small-scale mining in the DRC, Sony supported an independent academic research project conducted by the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) at the University of Berkeley together with several other companies. The research aims to provide rigorous empirical data on households engaged in artisanal mining, and it involves collecting survey data from households, children, village leaders, and local mineral traders in 150 communities that are representative and cover the full geographical extent of the DRC Copper Belt. Sony will continue to manage its cobalt supply chain and ensure that it procures cobalt produced in refineries that have been determined not to be contributing to conflicts or serious human rights violation.\n\n- Supporting Sustainable Tin Mining Practices in Indonesia\n\nUnsafe working conditions and environmental concerns in Indonesia\u2019s tin industry identified in some reports are a major factor why Sony has been a member of the Tin Working Group (TWG) since its launch in 2014. The goal of the TWG is to positively contribute to addressing the sustainability challenges of tin mining and smelting in Indonesia, including labor conditions, environmental issues, and impact on local communities, while recognizing the economic benefits of the sector in terms of poverty reduction. In 2014, the TWG was established with a membership comprising global tin users (downstream and midstream industry), RBA, an international environmental NGO, and a global tin trade association. The TWG, which has been operating under RMI since 2017, works with local partners from the Indonesian tin industry and the Indonesian government both at the federal level and local level from Bangka and Belitung.\n\nThe TWG started its work with a situational analysis conducted to better understand the issues requiring\nattention in the tin mining industry in Indonesia. Subsequently, the TWG started working closely with key local industry players to address issues via multi-stakeholder dialogue. With funding received from the European Partnership on Responsible Minerals (EPRM), the TWG supported land reclamation projects at former mining sites as well as occupational health and safety programs from 2017 to 2019. The results were put together to create a toolkit and a set of guidelines, and the initiative is contributing to the sustainability of tin mining in Indonesia. In 2019, the TWG visited these projects and compiled a roadmap for responsible tin production activities in Indonesia based on previous efforts and successful cases of problem-solving. At the same time, RMI, together with the International Tin Association (ITA), developed evaluation criteria for tin refining processes in order to improve the accuracy of tin smelter audits.\n\n*5 The EPRM is a multi-stakeholder partnership that encompasses international organizations, citizen groups, and the governments of the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands.\nQuality and Services\n\nManagement Approach\n\nMateriality Rationale\nIn recent years, customers and other stakeholders have become increasingly concerned about the protection of consumer rights. Product safety, security, and accessibility are very important in this respect. Sony is expected to provide products and customer services that are high in quality from its customers\u2019 viewpoints.\n\nBasic Approach\nTrue to its Philosophy and Policy for Product Quality and Customer Services, Sony is wholeheartedly committed to improving product and service quality from its customers\u2019 viewpoints in order to maintain and enhance satisfaction, confidence, and trust. In particular, Sony is working to ensure product quality and improve Usability and Accessibility, in the conviction that its most important goal is to remain a highly trusted partner to all customers.\n\nStructure\nSony has configured its global quality management system by defining quality management mechanisms across all processes, from product development, planning, design, and manufacturing through sales and customer service. This has included defining the roles, responsibilities, and authority of those responsible for product and customer service quality and establishing guidelines.\n\nIn addition, in order to respond effectively to quality problems and customer inquiries, Sony is opening more Customer Service Centers and reinforcing its customer service network all around the world.\n\nTo foster Usability and Accessibility, Sony incorporates human-centered design processes and operates within a structure of intradepartmental cooperation that ties Sony Headquarters with the company\u2019s business units, approaching the planning, design, and testing of its products and services from the viewpoint of the user.\n\nMain Achievements in Fiscal 2019\nHere are the main results of fiscal 2019 initiatives:\n\n- Delivered product quality and customer service that exceeds customers\u2019 expectations by adhering to a wide range of internal standards\n- Gathered regulatory information as regulators in countries/regions move to establish laws and regulations concerning IoT security, as well as established and implemented internal frameworks to secure regulatory compliance\n- Developed startup guides with a focus on connecting and setting up products, using basic functions\n- Customer support staff attended regular training and seminars on new technologies and shared information on problem-solving to ensure truly useful service and information for customers.\n- Analyzed customer feedback (including on social media) to improve product and service quality\n- Posted convenient instruction manuals online to enhance searchability and improved online support\n- Received HCD-Net AWARD 2019 and IAUD International Design Award for CAVE without a LIGHT, an experiential exhibition that can be enjoyed without relying on the sense of sight\n- Exhibited at accessibility-related events around the world including Sight World for the visually impaired and TechShare Pro\n- Employed testing by users with disabilities to evaluate BRAVIA\u00ae and other products\n- Established an internal educational framework for human resources development focused on human-centered design\n- Held internal lectures and training courses on human-centered design and accessibility\nPhilosophy and Policy for Product Quality and Services\n\nMilestones\n2001: Sony CS Charter established\n2004: Corporate quality standards established from the customer\u2019s perspective\n2006: Corporate executive in charge of product quality and safety appointed, and rules enhanced for rapid reporting of product incidents to management\n2007: Sony Pledge of Quality established (revised in 2012), and quality officers established for each electronics affiliate and region\n2009: Product security system enhanced, and Quality and Reliability Lab opened\n2014: Secure@Sony program established, allowing anyone to report security issues relating to Sony products, services, or websites\n2017: Sony Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) launched and external initiatives enhanced\n\nLooking to the Future\nSony continues to be committed to a fundamental policy of ensuring product safety, security, and accessibility, taking its customers\u2019 viewpoints into consideration in order to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed their expectations. With these aims in mind, Sony will continue leveraging its worldwide network to collect and analyze information which can then be reflected in the next releases of products and services.\n\nPhilosophy and Policy for Product Quality and Services\n\nSony is committed to improving product and service quality from its customers\u2019 viewpoints and works hard to maintain and enhance their satisfaction, confidence and trust. This effort is driven by Sony\u2019s most important goal: to remain a highly trusted partner to its customers.\n\nPhilosophy and Policy\nSince the start of its operations, Sony has been firmly committed across all of its businesses to providing customer-oriented, high-quality products and services. This philosophy is set forth in the Founding Prospectus drafted in 1946 by Sony\u2019s co-founder, Masaru Ibuka.\n\nThe Sony Group Code of Conduct mandates that Sony continuously strive to comply with or exceed legally mandated standards in all business activities to ensure the safety of its products and services.\n\nSony has established the Sony Pledge of Quality, which lays out its basic policy on product and customer service quality. This is aimed at reinforcing awareness of Sony\u2019s commitment to ensuring that the quality of its products and customer services exceeds the expectations of its customers around the world.\n\nThe Sony Pledge of Quality\nOne Sony For All Customers\n\nSony employees will always respect our customers\u2019 viewpoints in striving to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed their expectations.\n\nKenichiro Yoshida  President and CEO\nProduct Quality and Quality Management\n\nThe Sony Pledge of Quality declares that \u201cSony employees will always respect our customers\u2019 viewpoints in striving to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed their expectations.\u201d To this end, Sony makes continuous, decisive efforts to enhance product quality and to reinforce its quality management system.\n\nSony\u2019s Quality Management System Framework\n\nSony has configured its quality management system by defining quality management mechanisms across all processes, from product planning, development, design and manufacturing to sales and customer service. This has included defining the roles, responsibilities and authority of those responsible for product and customer service quality and establishing guidelines.\n\nFramework of Sony\u2019s Quality Management System\n\nBased on this quality management system, Sony is implementing measures on an ongoing basis to improve the quality of its products and services. Examples of such measures are given below. Sony:\n\n- Has appointed the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality and has tasked this person with coordinating efforts to improve product and customer service quality and ensure timely responses to problems;\n- Has appointed Quality Officers within each business unit and has tasked them with promoting activities to improve product quality and spearheading initiatives to enhance the quality of products and services in specific business areas under the direction and supervision of the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality and the head of the relevant business unit;\n- Has appointed CS Officers responsible for improving the quality of customer service in markets around the world where Sony products are sold and has tasked them with spearheading a network of global-level initiatives under the supervision of the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality and the individual in charge of the relevant regional headquarters;\n- Has created a framework for promoting business unit- and region-specific initiatives to ensure Sony\u2019s products comply with pertinent laws and regulations;\n- Has obtained certification under ISO 9001 for all sites manufacturing electronics products;\n- Has formulated mid-term plan and fiscal year targets for the quality of and customer service related to Sony products, as well as key quality-related indicators for business plans, with the aim of fulfilling the Sony Pledge of Quality. Business units and regional headquarters subsequently devised their own fiscal year quality and customer service targets and business plans, in line with which they continue to promote quality improvement initiatives;\n- Has held meetings of top managers of the electronics business to deliberate and decide on key strategies related to product quality and customer service;\n- Has held regular meetings of Quality Officers from business units to evaluate the progress of quality-oriented business plans, promote initiatives aimed at achieving targets, and debate specific activities and responses to quality-related issues and common challenges;\n- Has held meetings of business unit Quality Officers and regional CS Officers to evaluate the progress of quality and customer service business plans and promote initiatives aimed at achieving targets, and to share information on customer service and product quality activities and common challenges, thereby contributing to global efforts to improve product quality and customer service;\n- Has formulated and administers Sony quality standards applicable to Sony\u2019s electronics products and related customer services, which focus on such criteria as product safety and performance, labeling and customer services. These standards are updated continuously to reflect technological advances, changes in applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and social changes, aiming to ensure Sony\u2019s ability to deliver quality and services that exceed the expectations of customers; and\n- Has strengthened rules worldwide to ensure prompt reporting to the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality when Sony receives information about an incident involving a Sony product that affects customer safety or has the potential to do so. Based on the reports received, the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality provides the necessary follow-up and instructs the relevant divisions to investigate the incidents and respond appropriately to the customer. Under a similar system, Sony has been addressing software security issues found in products and managing potential software security issues.\nResponding to the Customer\n\nSony makes active use of customer feedback to improve its products and customer services. Sony customer information centers promptly and accurately evaluate customer opinions, reports of malfunctions after purchase, questions regarding use, and other feedback. The planning, design and product quality groups work together to improve product quality and strengthen product performance, reporting progress to top management on an as-needed basis.\n\nIn recent years, the communication tools used by customers have become more diverse. In order to meet broader customer expectations, Sony has started to analyze customer feedback on social media, as well.\n\nQuality Hotline\n\nIt is vital to detect product quality-related problems at the earliest stage possible. To that end, Sony has established the Quality Hotline to gather product quality-related information, including reports of problems, as well as opinions from Sony Group employees. Group employees can use the Quality Hotline, an in-house website, to send messages regarding matters that are too difficult to handle at their workplace such as certain product quality issues. They can also share findings identified during customer use of products and any problems with the quality of product-related customer services as perceived by customers who have made use of those services. Upon investigating a problem to ascertain the veracity of the information received, the Quality Hotline office proposes and introduces measures to prevent previous problems from recurring and precluding potential new problems.\n\nMarket Quality Improvements\n\nSony has established dedicated quality management organizations in each of its business areas that are responsible for improving the quality of pertinent products in each market. At Sony headquarters, information related to quality issues arising in the marketplace is gathered in a timely manner from a broad range of sources in Japan and overseas and reported weekly to headquarters quality management and technical specialists. Based on the reported information, Sony ascertains whether or not issues in the marketplace have been addressed appropriately. In addition to ensuring that such issues are thoroughly addressed, Sony is accelerating its quality improvement performance by promoting measures to prevent recurrence and proactive measures in relation to quality issues.\n\nResponses to Quality Issues\n\nSony recognizes that ensuring its customers\u2019 satisfaction, confidence and trust is one of its most important management tasks and strives to prevent quality-related problems through the systems and efforts described above. Sony responds swiftly in the event of a quality-related issue, with the relevant departments working together to investigate facts and take appropriate action on a global scale. When such an issue arises, Sony decides upon the need for public announcements and market action for customers and implements any needed steps, after undertaking various studies of the issue, following a process common to all Sony products. This process starts with the gathering of information from customer service centers worldwide and collaboration with concerned local parties to ensure an accurate grasp of the issue. Based on information collected, Sony then works to determine the correct response by identifying the cause of the issue, implementing countermeasures and promptly verifying the effectiveness thereof, and reviewing the issue from the customer\u2019s perspective. Sony also cooperates with CS officers at sites in each region to ensure the same level of service is provided to customers the world over.\n\nWith regard to methods and media for issuing public announcements of product quality-related issues, Sony examines the effectiveness of the various means at its disposal, including the Internet, e-mail, notification via app, or other media.\n\nImportant notices regarding products and services\nImproving the Quality, Safety and Long-Term Reliability of Products\n\n\u25a0 Improving the Quality of Products\nSony strives to maximize product quality by improving design, manufacturing, and parts.\n\n\u25cf Design-related quality initiatives\nIn the initial stages of the design process, the individual in charge of a particular business unit verifies new technologies and new parts and, from the user\u2019s perspective, determines how a product is to be used. At the conclusion of the design process, the individual in charge confirms the degree to which the intended level of product quality, reliability has been realized. In addition, to ensure that customers are provided with products of a quality worthy of the Sony brand, Sony requires relevant departments including original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and original design manufacturer (ODM) companies to comply with group-wide quality standards. Compliance with these standards is also tested at the end of the design process. Such approaches prevent the occurrence of problems pertaining to new technologies and new product parts, while also ensuring that product designs incorporate consideration of user convenience.\n\n\u25cf Manufacturing-related quality initiatives\nIn its effort not to receive, manufacture or ship anything with quality-related problems, Sony adheres to a policy of workmanship at all of its manufacturing sites that ensures customers can use Sony products with confidence. Initiatives include setting important targets at each site and implementing Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) processes, thereby facilitating the achievement of such targets and the continuous improvement of product quality. Sony has also established standard product quality rules to ensure Sony products manufactured by OEM/ODM companies are of the same high quality as those manufactured at Sony production sites.\n\n\u25a0 Parts-related quality initiatives\nRecognizing the importance of parts and determined to manufacture products built for long-term use, Sony carefully selects key parts independently for each of its major product categories and is pursuing focused efforts aimed at increasing the reliability of the parts it uses through cooperation among relevant departments.\n\n\u25a0 Improving Product Safety\nProviding reliable products that customers can use safely is top priority for Sony. Accordingly, at every stage of its business activities, including product planning, development, design, manufacturing, marketing, and after-sales service for all products and services, Sony takes steps to comply with safety standards based on laws and regulations while constantly striving to surpass those standards in order to maintain the safety of its products. As part of these efforts, Sony has established a team in charge of product safety assessment from a medical perspective. When developing products employing new technologies and using new technologies at events, Sony also seeks advice on product safety from a medical perspective from outside experts in order to ensure products do not affect customer health, and this advice is then incorporated into technology assessment, product development, design and engineering. When deemed necessary, Sony also conducts evaluation tests to assess safety with the assistance of a specialized organization.\n\nIn addition, Sony strives to ensure that the safety-related explanations and information it provides to customers are accurate, easy to understand, and clearly presented. If a safety-related problem involving a Sony product is reported, Sony immediately collects information and examines the facts, and then takes the steps necessary to rectify the problem.\n\n\u25a0 Improving the Long-Term Reliability of Products\nSony has established a Quality Reliability Lab tasked with enhancing the long-term reliability of its products, supporting Sony\u2019s commitment to deliver safe, durable and reliable products to customers. The Quality Reliability Lab has assigned specialists to work full time on improving technologies essential to product reliability and continues working to ensure the long-term reliability of products by developing elemental technologies for preventing the deterioration, wear and corrosion of materials and parts, as well as technologies necessary to ensure the reliability of new technologies and products and to evaluate such technologies and products. The reliability and evaluation techniques, and the information obtained through these activities, are utilized to improve design and parts selection processes. Sony also presents some of its own knowledge on evaluation techniques at academic meetings and industry conferences and gatherings, seeking to go beyond its own walls and contribute to the industry.\nEfforts to Improve Quality of Product Security\n\nWith more products connecting to networks, there is a heightened danger of, among others, personal information leaks, the falsification or destruction of data, and product hacking. As a consequence, it is very important to improve the quality of the security of products and services. Sony has a function for collecting security risk-related information from outside experts, researchers and other individuals. Sony assigns managers responsible for the software security of products and has a dedicated department for it at headquarters. The department coordinates with business units to address issues with the security of products. Based on the information received, the department led by these managers assesses the impact of risk on customers from a software security perspective and implements appropriate measures.\n\nTo deliver products that customers can use with confidence, Sony has security design and response systems that ensure the security of products over their entire life cycle \u2014 from planning and shipment to disposal \u2014 such as conducting security risk assessments, using product security vulnerability detection tools, and security inspections prior to product shipment. Sony has also established internal guidelines pertaining to the security of products and continues to implement employee training programs to strengthen product security.\n\nDue to growing concern over security issues with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, regulators in countries/regions are developing new laws and regulations concerning IoT security. Sony is establishing internal frameworks for gathering and responding to regulatory information in order to secure regulatory compliance.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nIn addition to continuously improving product quality, Sony is taking various steps to improve its responsiveness and its customer service capabilities, in line with its commitment, set forth in the Sony Pledge of Quality: \u201cSony employees will always respect our customers\u2019 viewpoints in striving to deliver product quality and customer service that exceed their expectations.\u201d In customer service, this includes responding to changing customer needs, and in repair services, building organizations designed to ensure the best possible repair service quality.\n\nSystem\n\nSony has assigned CS Officers responsible for improving the quality of customer service in markets around the world where Sony products are sold. Under the guidance and supervision of the Corporate Executive in charge of Product Quality, and of regional headquarters, Sony has also introduced a set of key performance indicators to enhance customer service quality on a global level. Sony has also established a network of bases through which it provides services tailored to the needs of customers in each region.\n\nTraining for Customer Support Staff\n\nCommitted to providing high-quality services to customers around the world, Sony provides ongoing training for employees and the staff of service partners. In addition to focusing on the acquisition of new service technologies and the sharing of solutions to ensure issues are swiftly and effectively addressed, staff are trained to help customers get the greatest possible enjoyment from their Sony products.\n\nCustomer Information Centers and Customer Service Improvements\n\nSony established its first Customer Information Center in 1963 in Japan to respond to customer inquiries. Today, Sony has Customer Information Centers worldwide, enabling it to provide prompt responses to customer needs that reflect customers\u2019 perspectives, thereby helping Sony to improve the quality of its customer service.\n\nIn addition to support via telephone and e-mail, in several regions Sony provides customer support via such means as live Internet chat sessions, support using social media and messaging apps, and online community forums where customers can share information to help each other find solutions. In these ways, Sony tailors its support to meet the increasingly diverse needs of its customers in every region of the world. In addition, Sony conducts surveys to determine customer satisfaction at various touchpoints, and makes improvements based on the survey results in its efforts to continually improve customer satisfaction.\n\nMore Convenient, Eco-Friendly Instruction Manuals\n\nTo provide better explanations on how to use its products, Sony is bolstering its online support and providing online instruction manuals for improved searchability and greater convenience so that users are able to quickly find what they are looking for.\n\nThe Sony website has a support section that offers not only information on the products themselves but also additional support information on software upgrades and network service updates. This is designed to help users better understand Sony products, software, and services, as well as to enable them, when needed, to troubleshoot as quickly as possible. To accommodate a variety of user environments, Sony also provides support information compatible with mobile devices for greater customer convenience.\nWhen it comes to printed product manuals, Sony provides brief \u201cstartup guides\u201d that focus on the information needed to begin using a product, such as how to connect and set up, and how to use the basic functions. For some products sold globally, Sony has developed instruction manuals with minimal text and more extensive visuals, making it possible to include multiple languages in a single manual, which is expected to contribute to environmental protection by reducing paper consumption.\n\n### Repair and Service Network\n\nCurrently, there are 3,900 Sony repair service locations worldwide. To enhance customer satisfaction, Sony is working to meet customer needs by performing immediate problem diagnosis at the repair reception desk, improving repair quality and reducing the number of days required for repairs, among other efforts. In addition, Sony is continuously enhancing its service network to ensure that it can respond appropriately to repair requests in each region for each product. By strengthening the feedback mechanism for product quality based on repair information, Sony also aims to keep enhancing quality.\n\n#### Consumer AV Product Service Locations (Fiscal 2019)\n\n| Region                                      | Number of Repair Service Locations |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Japan                                       | 463                                |\n| United States/Canada                        | 742                                |\n| Europe                                      | 949                                |\n| Mainland China and Hong Kong Region         | 555                                |\n| Asia-Pacific *1                            | 618                                |\n| Others *2                                   | 573                                |\n\n*1 Southeast Asia, Oceania, India, South Korea and Taiwan Region\n*2 Middle East, Latin America and Africa\n\n### Usability and Accessibility\n\n\u201cUsability and Accessibility\u201d is an essential aspect of quality at Sony. Sony aims to create products and services that people can use with ease\u2014indeed, independent of age and disabilities.\n\n#### Structure\n\nSony\u2019s Usability and Accessibility initiatives are overseen by the Corporate Executive Officer in charge of Product Quality. The main implementers are the Quality Management Department and the HR Department at Sony headquarters, Sony Global Solutions Inc., and the Quality Management Promotion Division at Sony Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation, with further cooperation from other related departments and Sony Group organizations. Products and services are becoming more multifunctional all the time, and their user interfaces also tend to be more complex with the advance of technology. Sony employs intradepartmental cooperation on development to deliver products and services that people can use with ease and comfort. In order to deliver a superior user experience, Sony employs human-centered design processes and takes a user-centered approach to the planning, design, and testing of its products and services.\n\n### Providing Products and Services That Meet User Needs\n\n#### Using Human-Centered Design in Product and Service Development\n\nTo develop products and services that meet users\u2019 essential needs, Sony employs human-centered design processes and takes a user-centered approach to the planning, design, and testing of its products and services. Sony conducts worldwide user research including home visits and user interviews. In order to improve usability factors such as visibility, understandability, and responsiveness, Sony repeats cycles of detecting and correcting problems, employing prototyping and usability testing. In addition to pre-release testing, Sony also conducts long-term use surveys after products go on sale to gain an understanding of customer satisfaction and any usability problems that arise when products are used on a day-to-day basis. In all these ways and more, Sony takes a multifaceted approach to human-centered design, always aiming to deliver an inspiring user experience.\nFormulating Internal Standards and Applying Acquired Expertise\n\nProduct and service designers from across the Sony Group meet to formulate UI design standards for interactions, use of words and icons on devices and screens, and so on. The knowledge gained through usability testing, the expertise of the product development departments, and specific examples of human-centered design are shared across the Group, as well. UI design standards and expertise are posted on Sony\u2019s internal portal site to ensure that everyone in the Sony Group has access to them. This information is used in product and service development as Sony continues to work to enhance usability for customers.\n\nSony also conducts human resource development focused on human-centered design, implementing an internal education framework that includes training courses and workshops on human-centered design. These initiatives are helping to increase the capabilities of employees who are variously engaged in developing products and services, while providing them with important knowledge on human-centered design.\n\nEmployee Education on Accessibility\n\nSony holds forums and seminars led by experts to increase employee understanding of accessibility. In May 2019, in conjunction with Global Accessibility Awareness Day,* Sony sought to raise awareness among all Sony Group employees by showcasing accessibility initiatives by group companies via the corporate intranet. Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC (US) and Sony North America also held internal events at their offices.\n\nEnsuring That as Many People as Possible Can Enjoy Sony Products and Services\n\nEase of use for everyone \u2014 that is what accessibility means to Sony. Sony is fully committed to incorporating accessibility into the planning and design of products and services, aiming to maximize the number of people who can use and enjoy its products and services with ease. In December 2019, Sony signed on for The Valuable 500*, an international initiative created to promote the participation of persons with disabilities in business. To enhance accessibility and enable more people including persons with disabilities to enjoy its products and services, Sony incorporates feedback gained through the participation of employees with disabilities in the planning and development process, interviews with people with disabilities, and usability tests.\n\nIn developing televisions, Sony asks users with visual impairments to try the products for a designated period of time and provide feedback on how to improve product design. In developing the system software for PlayStation\u00ae4, Sony employs iterative cycles of user testing to improve the accuracy of accessibility functions. Employees with disabilities evaluate products to drive improvements on products such as the Walkman\u00ae and apps for Sony audio equipment. Sony received a Bronze Award in the category of Product Design under the IAUD International Design Award 2019 for a wireless handy TV speaker that can be easily used by various people including persons with disabilities.\n\nAt South by Southwest (SXSW) 2019, held in Austin, Texas in the U.S. in March 2019, Sony featured CAVE without a LIGHT, an experiential exhibition that could be enjoyed without relying on the sense of sight. A diverse range of employees from across the Sony Group, transcending differences in ability, gender, culture and language\u2014including employees with visual impairments\u2014created this exhibition using inclusive design.* The exhibit earned Sony a Silver Award in the category of Interaction Design under the IAUD International Design Award 2019 and the Excellence Prize of the HCD-Net AWARD 2019.\n\nIn November 2019, Sony exhibited at Sight World 2019, Japan\u2019s largest accessibility event for the visually impaired, showcasing the accessibility features of Sony Group products such as BRAVIA\u00ae and open-ear stereo headset. In the same month, Sony exhibited at the TechShare Pro conference for accessibility professionals in the U.K.\n\nIn addition, Sony actively works to promote the standardization* for persons with disabilities to drive industry-wide accessibility improvements.\n\n*1 The Valuable 500 was launched in January 2019 at the World Economic Forum\u2019s Annual Summit in Davos to call on business leaders to make changes so that persons with disabilities can engage in business, social, and economic value creation.\n\n*2 Inclusive design is an approach that obtains new insights into designs for all by ensuring that the needs of a wide range of users are included and understood.\n\n*3 IEC 62313 Text-to-speech for television; IEC 62944 Digital Television Accessibility; IEC TC 100/TA16 (active assisted living (AAL), accessibility, and user interface).\n\nSpecific examples of this approach to products and services are described on the Sony Accessibility page at the Sony website.\nWorking to Enhance Sony Website Accessibility\n\nThe Sony Group\u2019s effort to make its websites more accessible began with a set of Website Accessibility Guidelines issued on July 1, 2007. Over the years, the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 have become the international standard. Recognizing this, Sony replaced its guidelines with the Sony Group Website Accessibility Policy, which is based on WCAG2.0, on April 1, 2016. This policy also requires the Sony Group\u2019s external facing websites to comply within a specific period of time.\n\nBy designing and producing accessible websites based on the Sony Group Website Accessibility Policy, Sony is striving to improve and maintain the accessibility of all its websites so that every visitor can enjoy a more user-friendly experience.\n\nCreating an Environment for Carefree Internet Use\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment Inc. (SIE) aims to make games as popular as music, movies and broadcasting and has been developing the PlayStation\u00ae business for users in all age groups.\n\nConsole game industry organizations have responded to the proliferation of new game genres by introducing rating systems for customers in Japan, the United States and Europe (CERO, ESRB and PEGI, respectively), based on games\u2019 target age groups. The U.S. system has operated for more than 20 years and won top marks from the public, not only for indicating age categories but also for being the first to add descriptions that detail the contents of a game. PEGI is endorsed by the European Commission as a paradigm of self-regulation in the entertainment industry. In Japan, measures are being promoted to make the system more effective, including, with the cooperation of retailers, the voluntary refusal to sell software rated by CERO for ages 18 and above to underage customers.\n\nTo regulate access by underage users, SIE has included a Parental Control function in PlayStation\u00ae4, PlayStation\u00ae3 and PlayStation\u00aeVita. This function enables customers to adjust access levels and limit children\u2019s access only to appropriate software across the PlayStation\u00ae platform.\nManagement Approach\n\nMateriality Rationale\nSony\u2019s corporate activities are only possible if the earth, which sustains all life on earth, is healthy. This is why Sony is so determined to fight climate change, preserve resources, manage chemical substances, conserve biodiversity, and take other needed steps to protect the environment. True to this commitment, Sony conducts its business in a sustainable manner and provides environmentally conscious products and services, always seeking to deliver innovation and develop uniquely superior technologies. Sony also works hand-in-hand with stakeholders to help build a more sustainable society.\n\nBasic Approach\nSince the early 1990s, Sony has pursued environmental initiatives in accordance with its environmental principles and targets. In April 2010, Sony announced the \u201cRoad to Zero,\u201d a new global environmental plan, the goal of which is to realize a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of its products and business activities by the year 2050. Working toward a zero environmental footprint by 2050, once every five years Sony sets concrete environmental mid-term targets for each stage of the life cycle for its products with respect to climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity.\n\nStructure\nSony has built and is continually improving its globally integrated environmental management system with the aim of realizing the Sony Group Environmental Vision, achieving the environmental mid-term targets, and complying fully with legal requirements, regulatory demands, and internal policies adopted by the Group. Sony has also established specialized functions at the Sony Group\u2019s environmental headquarters, which is overseen by a corporate executive officer of Sony Corporation.\n\nMain Achievements in Fiscal 2019\nUnder the Green Management 2020 environmental mid-term targets, Sony put forward specific goals for each stage of the product lifecycle. Here are the main results of fiscal 2019 initiatives:\n\n- Annual energy consumption of products: Down 52% (compared with fiscal 2013)\n- CO\u2082 emission reduced by using renewable energy: 327 thousand tons-CO\u2082 (Cumulative total since fiscal 2016)\n- Greenhouse gas emissions at Sony sites: Down 12% (compared with fiscal 2015)\n- Waste generated at Sony sites: Down 20% (compared with fiscal 2015)\n- Conducted biodiversity protection and education activities at all Sony sites\n- CO\u2082 emissions from logistics: Down 64% (compared with fiscal 2013)\n- Raised awareness and inspired action by reaching an audience of over 2.3 billion through events and social media.\n- Promoted the One Blue Ocean Project worldwide, encouraged reduction of single use plastic use at Sony sites, and performed plastic waste cleanup activities in communities.\nMilestones\n1976: Company-wide Sony Environmental Conference established\n1993: Sony Global Environment Policy and Environmental Action Program developed\n1995: Began to acquire ISO14001 certification at manufacturing sites in Japan\n2002: Green Partner Environmental Quality Approval Program introduced\n2006: Integration of environmental management systems at sites around the world completed\n2009: 100% renewable electricity use achieved at European sites\n2010: Road to Zero environmental plan aiming to realize a zero environmental footprint announced\n2018: Sony Corporation joins RE100, a global initiative whose members commit to sourcing 100% renewable electricity for the worldwide operations\n\nLooking to the Future\nActing on the basis of Green Management 2020, which sets environmental mid-term targets for fiscal 2016-2020, Sony seeks to strengthen its own internal initiatives, encourage environmental initiatives in its entire value chain, and appeal to consumers and the public to take action. Sony will also focus on achieving its goal of sourcing 100% renewable electricity for all business sites by 2040. Aware of the risk of growing environmental impact as certain products get bigger and production increases, Sony is adopting even stronger measures to achieve its goal of \u201czero environmental footprint\u201d by 2050.\n\nRelated Links\n- Environmental Data\n- Sony\u2019s Global Environmental Plan\n- Green Management 2020\n- Sony Group Portal Website \u201cEnvironment\u201d\n\nEnvironmental Policies and Targets\n\nSony Group Environmental Vision\nThe Sony Group Environmental Vision presents a philosophy and principles for environmental management activities throughout the global Sony Group with the aim of contributing to the realization of a sustainable society. Since enacting the Sony Global Environmental Policy which is a predecessor of the Sony Group Environmental Vision and the Environmental Action Program, in 1993, Sony has pursued a broad range of environmental initiatives. Concurrent with the formulation of its Road to Zero global environmental plan, in 2010, Sony revised the Sony Group Environmental Vision.\n\nPhilosophy\nSony recognizes the importance of preserving the natural environment that sustains all life on the earth for future generations and thereby ensuring that all humanity can attain a healthy and enriched life. In order to realize such a sustainable society, Sony strives to achieve a zero environmental footprint throughout the lifecycle of our products and business activities.\n\nPrinciples\nSony reduces our environmental footprint and prevents environmental pollution throughout the lifecycle of our products and business activities by complying with all applicable environmental regulations and also by continually improving our global environmental management systems. Sony formulates the following goals in four key environmental perspectives and takes proactive actions to achieve those goals.\n\n- Climate Change\nSony reduces energy consumption and strives to achieve zero emissions of greenhouse gases* generated throughout the lifecycle of our products, service and business activities.\n\n- Resources Conservation\nIn order to minimize resource inputs for our business activities, Sony identifies \u201cKey Resources\u201d and strives to achieve zero usage of those virgin materials. Sony also uses water efficiently, minimizes wastes from sites and maximizes our effort for take back and recycling products from markets.\n\n- Management of Chemical Substances\nSony minimizes the risk of chemical substances that we use causing serious harm to human health and the environment. Sony maintains strict control over the chemical substances we use, while, in line with the precautionary approach, taking steps whenever possible to reduce, substitute and eliminate the use of substances that have potentially significant impacts on the environment even in the cases where scientific evidence is not fully proven.\n\n- Biodiversity Conservation\nSony protects and utilizes ecosystem services in a sustainable manner, while actively promoting maintenance and recovery of biodiversity through our business and local contribution activities.\n\n* Gases that raise the temperature of the earth\u2019s surface by absorbing infrared radiation from reflected sunlight. Seven typical examples are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxides, hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)\nIn order to realize the Environmental Vision, Sony formulates targets and concrete plans and initiates actions to implement, while contributing to a better society through partnerships and communications with internal and external stakeholders.\n\n### Environmental Plan and Mid-Term Environmental Targets\n\nSince the early 1990s, Sony has pursued environmental initiatives in accordance with its environmental principles and targets. In April 2010, Sony announced the \u201cRoad to Zero,\u201d a new global environmental plan. This plan consists of the Sony Group Environmental Vision and several sets of mid-term environmental targets, which form key milestones on the road to achieving the Vision.\n\n**\u201cRoad to Zero,\u201d Sony\u2019s Global Environmental Plan**\n\nAs stated in the Sony Group Environmental Vision, Sony strives to realize a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of its products and business activities. It is this long-term goal that prompted Sony to name its new global environmental plan \u201cRoad to Zero.\u201d Under this plan, Sony aims to bring its environmental footprint to zero by 2050 and works to achieve incremental mid-term environmental targets toward this end.\n\n[Sony\u2019s Global Environmental Plan](#)\n\n### Environmental Mid-Term Targets\n\nSony is working toward its goal of having a \u201czero environmental footprint\u201d by 2050, setting mid-term (5-year) environmental targets progressively backcasted from 2050, and adjusting fiscal year targets based on current achievement levels. This approach will enable Sony to work steadily toward achieving the zero environmental footprint goal, while making ongoing adjustments based on current progress. In 2011, Sony established the Green Management 2015 environmental mid-term targets (fiscal 2011-2015), which was its first step on the road to a zero environmental footprint, achieving almost all of its targets by 2015. Currently, Sony is implementing initiatives to achieve the goals it has set under the Green Management 2020 environmental mid-term targets (fiscal 2016-2020).\n\n### Policies on Four Environmental Perspectives\n\nSony carries out initiatives under the following policies, which it has outlined for four environmental perspectives of climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity, in order to achieve its environmental mid-term targets.\n\n- **Policy on Climate Change**\n  Sony strives to achieve zero emissions of greenhouse gases from its business activities and throughout the life cycle of its products and services. Sony sites make it their highest priority to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, use energy more efficiently, and switch to energy sources that generate less greenhouse gas emissions, while also promoting renewable energy use. Sony also develops and supplies energy efficient, environmentally conscious products and services, and works with manufacturing subcontractors and suppliers of components and raw materials in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions both directly and indirectly.\n\n- **Policy on Resources**\n  Sony seeks to minimize the consumption of resources and maximize resource recycling in order to use resources effectively in its business activities and throughout the life cycle of its products and services, while striving to achieve zero consumption of new materials made from \u201ckey resources.\u201d Sony minimizes resource consumption by reducing the weight of products and utilizing resources more efficiently in its internal operations. Sony is also working to extend the life of products through quality and durability enhancements, to indirectly reduce resource consumption. In terms of waste, Sony recycles waste generated from internal operations, with the goal of eliminating landfilled waste. Additionally, Sony designs products to facilitate recycling and implements ongoing programs to collect and recycle end-of-life products according to the needs of local communities, while also promoting advanced recycling with recycling companies.\n*1 At Sony, \u201ckey resources\u201d are designated by taking the following factors into account: resource depletion, resource availability, environment impact of resource extraction, and loss of biodiversity and community impacts from resource extraction.\n\n**Policy on Water Use**\nAlthough water circulates around the earth continuously through the water cycle, the amount of water available for use by the planet\u2019s inhabitants is limited. With population growth and other issues putting further pressure on water supplies, the importance of conserving this resource will increase in the years ahead. Taking into account the locations of its sites, as well as regional differences, Sony will continue taking steps to minimize its withdrawal of water and to ensure the water it returns to water sources is of a quality that does not negatively impact the environment.\n\n**Policy on Paper Resources**\nRecognizing that paper resources are limited, under the Sony Group Paper / Printed Material Purchasing Policy, Sony constantly works to reduce paper consumption while prioritizing the procurement of environmentally preferable paper, such as paper made from resources sourced from certified forests and recycled paper.\n\nSony Group Paper / Printed Material Purchasing Policy [PDF:306KB]\n\n**Policy on Chemical Substances**\nSony endeavors to minimize the risk that chemical substances it uses might cause serious harm to human health and the environment. Chemical substances used in Sony products are suitably managed based on available data including national regulations, toxicity, environmental impacts, applications, and content level in components and products. Sony adopts a precautionary approach and takes steps to identify and strive to eliminate substances considered to be high-risk, even in cases where scientific evidence is insufficient, thereby reducing potential impact on the environment. Sony manages the type and application of chemical substances used at business sites, and for high-risk substances sets criteria for managing each substance to either prohibit their use or reduce emissions or amounts transferred. Sony also prohibits the use of certain substances in manufacturing processes in the supply chain which are restricted under international frameworks because of environmental impacts throughout the life cycle.\n\n**Policy on Biodiversity**\nRecognizing the importance of natural capital and the ecosystem services it supplies, Sony endeavors to conserve natural capital and biodiversity, both in its business activities and through community initiatives. Sony has identified the following basic principles*2 to guide its initiatives.\n\n1. Sony recognizes the importance of biodiversity issues. Sony recognizes that biodiversity is an important issue in its business activities, endeavors to reduce the impact of its business activities on biodiversity (both directly and indirectly in the supply chain), *3 and engages in community initiatives that help to conserve natural capital and biodiversity.\n2. Sony helps achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets by engaging in initiatives to conserve natural capital and biodiversity throughout the life cycle.\n3. Sony cooperates with stakeholders where needed in pursuing the above principles.\n4. Sony actively discloses information about these initiatives and endeavors to raise awareness about biodiversity.\n\n*2 For Sony\u2019s stance on the consumption of paper resources as it relates to biodiversity, please refer to \u201cPolicy on Paper Resources.\u201d\n*3 This includes reducing the environmental impact of Sony\u2019s business activities, such as reducing greenhouse gases, conserving resources, and comprehensively managing chemical substances, while also reducing the impact on biodiversity as a result of achieving these environmental targets.\n\u201cGreen Management 2020\u201d\nEnvironmental Mid-Term Targets\n\nTaking Environmental Initiatives to the Next Stage\n\nSony is working to reduce its environmental footprint to zero by 2050, and has set a series of environmental mid-term targets to get there. As the first step, Sony set the Green Management 2015 environmental mid-term targets which spanned fiscal 2011 to 2015. In April 2016, Sony introduced the Green Management 2020 environmental mid-term targets to be achieved by fiscal 2020. This transition takes Sony\u2019s environmental activities to the second stage of its journey to a zero environmental footprint.\n\nThe Process of Formulating Green Management 2020\n\nWhen formulating Green Management 2020, Sony examined its past environmental activities and conducted a materiality analysis* in order to incorporate the viewpoints of stakeholders outside the Sony Group. Based on these results, Sony specified raw materials, energy, atmospheric emissions, effluents and waste, and products and services as priority areas to tackle by 2020. It then designated water, biodiversity, and environmental assessments of suppliers as important issues to deal with. Sony has been addressing all of these issues already, and continues to focus on initiatives to address them through fiscal 2020.\n\nSony Environmental Materiality Analysis\n\nUnder the Green Management 2020 environmental mid-term targets, while the Sony Group is strengthening its internal initiatives to reduce power consumption in products and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from sites, Sony is expanding the reach of its environmental initiatives to outside the company such as: reaching more than 500 million people worldwide with its campaigns to raise awareness of sustainability issues, and encouraging consumers and other social groups to take action, and working with its component suppliers and manufacturing contractors to reduce their environmental footprint.\n\nExpanding Sony\u2019s Environmental Activities under Green Management 2020\n\nSony is being recognized by stakeholders for setting goals and taking action under the Green Management 2020 targets. Sony\u2019s climate change targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. This, in turn, led to Sony\u2019s involvement in the \u201cTake Action\u201d climate change initiative of the We Mean Business, an international coalition of businesses and investors. Starting in fiscal 2017, Sony will also participate in the We Mean Business coalition\u2019s \u201cImprove Water Security\u201d initiative to reduce water risks.\n\nSpecific targets of Green Management 2020\n\nSony organized its activities under Green Management 2020 according to the six stages of the product lifecycle: product/service planning and design, operation, raw materials and components procurement, logistics, take-back and recycling, and innovation. In each of these stages, specific targets are set under the four categories of climate change, resources, chemical substances and biodiversity.\n\n* A materiality analysis is a method for identifying and specifying important issues for a company and its stakeholders.\n### Green Management 2020 Targets and Progress\n\nUnder the Green Management 2020 environmental mid-term targets, which spanned from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2020, Sony categorized targets and activities accordingly to product lifecycle stage. The targets and progress of activities for each stage are outlined below.\n\n#### Product/Service Planning and Design\n\nSony is committed to delivering products and services with low environmental impact in all of its businesses. In electronics, Sony designs and manufactures products to have a low environmental impact throughout the product\u2019s entire lifecycle. In motion pictures, music, and other areas of its entertainment business, Sony makes the most of the content it creates to develop and implement environmental campaigns.\n\n| Targets (base year: Fiscal 2013) | Progress in Fiscal 2019 |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Overall**                      |                         |\n| Employ environmental features in products | Created environmentally conscious products in major product categories. |\n| Promote environmentally conscious design throughout the life cycle (during production, in use, at disposal, etc.) | Raised awareness and inspired action by reaching an audience of over 2.3 billion through events and social media. |\n| Raise awareness and inspire action on issues of sustainability from over 500 million people in the world through the entertainment business |                         |\n| **Climate Change**               |                         |\n| AC powered devices**: Reduce annual energy consumption by 30% (average reduction rate) | Approx. 52% reduction |\n| Mobile phones and tablets: Power consumption at no load condition and in battery maintenance mode: No more than 0.03W | All smart phones launched in fiscal 2019 less than 0.03W in no load condition |\n| DC powered devices**: Improve energy efficiency and charging efficiency | Improved energy savings and charging efficiency in many models. |\n| **Chemical Substances**          |                         |\n| Eliminate high-risk applications of \u201cControlled Substances\u201d ** that are of high concern (polyvinyl chloride, brominated flame retardants, etc.) and use alternative substances** | Promoted use of alternative substances based on Sony standards for management of chemical substances. |\n| **Biodiversity**                 |                         |\n| Promote the use of recycled paper and certified paper | Promoted use of recycled and certified paper based on purchasing policy for paper and printed materials. |\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1.

Acquisition of ISO 14001 certification at all sites was completed in fiscal 2000. Since then, Sony has expanded this effort, establishing a group-wide environmental management system integrating its headquarters with environmental departments, business units and sites globally, while taking advantage of the management systems already operational at each business site, and acquiring integrated ISO 14001 certification for the entire Sony Group in fiscal 2005. As of March 31, 2020, integrated ISO 14001 certification had been obtained by 97 of the Sony Group\u2019s business units and sites around the world.1,2\n\nSpecialized Functions for Environmental Management\n\nIn order to promote a wide range of measures, such as manufacturing and sales of environmentally conscious products, recycling of its products and environmental management at its sites, Sony has a dedicated headquarters that oversees environmental management for the entire Group based on the Sony Group Environmental Vision. It sets goals and rules and monitors performance. There are also specialized functions at this environmental headquarters, specifically in the areas related to energy consumed at sites and by products; resource conservation, including recycling; chemical substance management; biodiversity conservation; procurement; logistics; and communications. Each specialized function is integrated and linked with related fields and internal organizations such as quality assurance, customer service, occupational health and safety, and disaster prevention, to create an even more effective management system. The environmental headquarters is overseen by senior management, and a Sony Corporation corporate executive officer assumes ultimate responsibility. The president of Sony Corporation and other executives share information on environmental issues of importance to the Sony Group in regularly-held executive meetings. Additionally, to promote integrated environmental management globally, Sony has established six regional environmental offices to facilitate region-wide environmental management activities, such as a better understanding of local legal and regulatory trends, effective communication of standards and instructions set forth by headquarters to the regional divisions and sites, and effective performance of audits at all regional business divisions and sites. These are the North America environmental office, Latin America environmental office, Europe environmental office,1 Japan/East Asia environmental office,2 China environmental office,3 and Pan Asia environmental office.4\n\nThe Sony Group Global Environmental Management System (As of March 31, 2020)\n\n1 The Europe environmental office supervises divisions/sites in the nations of Europe, Israel, Turkey, Russia, and former Soviet Union (except for Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan).\n2 The Japan/East Asia environmental office supervises divisions/sites in Japan, South Korea and the Taiwan Region.\n3 The China environmental office supervises divisions/sites in the mainland China and Hong Kong Region.\n4 The Pan Asia environmental office supervises divisions/sites in Mongolia and other Asia (except for divisions/sites supervised by the Europe environmental office, the Japan/East Asia environmental office, and the China environmental office), Africa, Middle East, Oceania, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\n1 Sites refers to manufacturing and non-manufacturing sites.\n2 The scope of integrated ISO 14001 certification is all manufacturing, distribution centers with 100 or more employees and non-manufacturing sites with 1,000 or more employees.\nContinual Improvement by Using the PDCA Cycle\n\nIn compliance with ISO 14001, the global standard for environmental management systems that is based on the rationale of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, Sony\u2019s corporate headquarters conducts annual assessments of the environmental impact of the entire Sony Group and, after identifying risks and opportunities, incorporates its findings into mid-range environmental targets and annual plans. In line with these plans, individual business units and sites establish and implement their own annual plans, incorporating essential elements of guiding principles established by the headquarters. Progress on the implementation of these business plans is reviewed regularly by a committee that is headed by the officer in charge of environmental affairs, contributing to ongoing improvement efforts. Awards are given annually at the global level to recognize outstanding activities in core businesses. These activities are counted as part of overall annual performance evaluations for main business units and sites and the results of these assessments are reflected in the bonuses awarded to management-level employees. To gauge the progress of these environmental activities, Sony has developed an online data system for periodically collecting performance for, among others, power consumption by products, energy used by sites, and volume of waste generated. To ensure the effective functioning of the PDCA cycle, Sony has created an environmental document structure in line with the requirements of ISO 14001. The structure covers overall elements of environmental management such as management procedures on site and in the business groups, internal environmental communications, efforts to make products more environmentally conscious, and internal audits.\n\nAnother means by which the Sony Group facilitates environmental action is to provide broad environmental education for employees that is tailored to specific objectives or the type of work they perform.\n\nThe Sony Group\n\nEnvironmental Management System PDCA Cycle\n\n- **Plan**\n  - Sony Group Environmental Vision\n  - Environmental Mid-Term Targets\n  - Formulation of Sony Group environmental rules and annual business plans\n  - Implementation of environmental management based on the annual business plan\n\n- **Do**\n  - Audit and review of annual business plan and Environmental Mid-Term Targets, as well as performance assessments and decisions regarding awards\n\n- **Check**\n  - Review by top management, continual improvements\n\n- **Act**\n\nEnvironmental Audits\n\nSony has established an integrated environmental audit system that combines three kinds of audits \u2014 internal, corporate and external \u2014 and aims to facilitate continual improvements to the Sony Group\u2019s environmental management system, prevent environmental accidents at sites, and ensure the reliability of environmental data. In internal audits, business units and sites independently confirm the effectiveness of their own organization\u2019s environmental management system. In corporate audits, headquarters or regional environmental offices conduct audits of business units and sites in order to verify compliance with corporate rules. In external audits, an external certification body conducts audits to determine the effectiveness of environmental management systems throughout the Sony Group.\nOverview of Sony\u2019s Environmental Impact\n\nAssessing Greenhouse Gas Emissions over the Entire Value Chain\n\nThe recent escalation of climate change issues has prompted corporations to broaden the scope of efforts to ascertain the greenhouse gas emissions not just of their own operations but also those throughout their entire value chain. Sony has determined emissions from its major component suppliers and manufacturing contractors. Furthermore, based on the level of emissions identified, Sony has estimated greenhouse gas emissions for its entire value chain. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions from Sony\u2019s overall value chain in fiscal 2019 is estimated to be approximately 16.24 million tons. The largest volume of emissions, approximately 9.57 million tons, was from \u201cenergy consumed during product use.\u201d The next-largest category was \u201cgoods and services procured,\u201d which includes raw materials and components, at approximately 3.316 million tons. Sony plans to build its own system for identifying greenhouse gas emissions over the entire value chain and will work to enhance the accuracy of the system and strengthen management of emissions.\n\n*1 Value chain refers to the entire product life cycle process, from procurement of materials through to manufacturing, use and disposal. It includes upstream and downstream manufacturing processes.\n\n*2 Estimated greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s scope 3 accounting and reporting standard and guidelines published by Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment.\n\nPlease refer to \u201cEnvironmental data\u201d for details.\n\nEnvironmental Data\nOverview of Environmental Impact\n\nThe chart below shows Sony\u2019s impact on the environment over the entire life cycle of its business activities, including energy and resources used in business activities, energy consumed by Sony products when used by customers, and the recycling and disposal of products after use. The chart shows the principal environmental impact during fiscal 2019 for items that Sony can recognize and manage directly.\n\nEnvironmental Data Collection Methods and Rationale\n\nOverview of Sony\u2019s Environmental Impact\n\n- Energy consumption by sites: 24,000 TJ\n  - Electricity: 22,000 TJ\n  - Gas: 2,000 TJ\n  - Renewable Energy: 500 TJ\n  - Others: 400 TJ\n\n- Water consumption by sites: 15.30 million m\u00b3\n  - Industrial water: 10.00 million m\u00b3\n  - Well water: 5.77 million m\u00b3\n  - Municipal water: 1.99 million m\u00b3\n\n- Introduction of renewable energy certificates and credits: 1,000 TJ\n\n- Energy used on employee business trips: 1,300 TJ\n  - Jet fuel: 1,300 TJ\n\n- Handling volume of chemical substances: 181,000 tons\n\n- Product shipped: 426,000 tons\n  - Television: 203,000 tons\n  - Audio and Video: 81,000 tons\n  - Game: 59,000 tons\n  - Software: 52,000 tons\n  - Others: 30,000 tons\n\n- Energy used in logistics: 2,300 TJ\n  - Jet fuel: 1,100 TJ\n  - Others: 1,200 TJ\n\n- Energy during product use: 192,000 TJ\n  - Television: 148,000 TJ\n  - Game: 26,000 TJ\n  - Audio and Video: 13,000 TJ\n  - Others: 5,000 TJ\n\n- CO\u2082 emissions from product transport: 154,000 t-CO\u2082\n  - International: 109,000 t-CO\u2082\n  - Regional: 45,000 t-CO\u2082\n\n- CO\u2082 emissions from product use: 9.57 million t-CO\u2082\n  - Television: 7.50 million t-CO\u2082\n  - Game: 1.13 million t-CO\u2082\n  - Audio and Video: 0.62 million t-CO\u2082\n  - Others: 0.32 million t-CO\u2082\n\n- Volume collected: 75,000 tons\n  - Europe: 10,000 tons\n  - Japan/East Asia: 11,000 tons\n  - Others: 14,000 tons\n\n- Product recycled: 7,300 tons\n  - Iron: 2,700 tons\n  - Glass: 1,200 tons\n  - Copper: 100 tons\n  - Others: 3,300 tons\n\nNote: Business processes other than those shown in this chart\u2014including the production of purchased materials used and the recycling of products\u2014may also have an impact on the environment.\nTackling Ocean plastic pollution\n\nSony has established the Green Management 2020 Environmental Mid-Term Targets based on its Road to Zero environmental plan. It is actively working to reduce the amount of virgin oil-based plastic used per product, while curbing the amount of waste generated at each site, and protecting the surrounding biodiversity. On top of that, Sony has taken on the issue of plastic pollution in the oceans, which has become a worldwide crisis in recent years. In August 2019, Sony launched the One Blue Ocean Project, an initiative to help reduce ocean plastic pollution. It involves promoting even more activities to reduce the amount of plastics used in products and in workplaces, as well as collection of plastic waste and cleanup activities at each Sony site.\n\nOne Blue Ocean Project Activities and Fiscal 2019 Results\n\nSony is promoting this project based on the following four initiatives. The main achievements of fiscal 2019 are also outlined below.\n\n(1) Reducing plastic in products and proactively using recycled materials\nFor a wide range of products, Sony is reducing the size and weight of plastic parts, minimizing plastic packaging, and expanding the use of recycled plastic.\n\n[Fiscal 2019 Results]\nFor the fiscal 2019 results, please refer to \u201cReducing Use of Virgin Plastics\u201d on page 117.\n\n(2) Reducing plastic usage in production activities\nSony is further reducing the amount of plastic used at production sites.\n\n[Fiscal 2019 Results]\nIn fiscal 2019, Sony decreased the amount of plastic waste generated from its production sites by approximately 1,456 tons.\n\n(3) Reducing or discontinuing the use of single-use plastics in conference rooms and onsite shops\nBy fiscal 2020, Sony aims to eliminate the use of single-use plastics such as plastic bottles, straws, and cups in conference rooms and reception rooms. In addition, plastic bags will no longer be provided at in-company shops and cafes, and the use of single-use plastics such as straws and cups will reduce and gradually phased out. At the same time, Sony is working to cultivate awareness among employees about the use of reusable shopping bags and personal cups.\n\n[Fiscal 2019 Results]\nBy the end of fiscal 2019, plastic bottles had been removed from conference rooms at approximately 64% of Sony Group sites, including the Sony headquarters building. Plastic bags are no longer provided at shops and convenience stores located in about 86% of sites, while straws have been eliminated from cafes in about 68% of sites.\n\n(4) Expanding local cleanup activities along rivers and shorelines\nSony employees at certain sites and group companies all over the world have been carrying out community cleanup activities along rivers and seashores, and these activities will be steadily expanded to even more sites. Employee awareness of measures to combat ocean plastic pollution will also be further enhanced.\n\n[Fiscal 2019 Results]\nIn fiscal 2019, a total of approximately 6,700 Sony Group employees and their family members participated in cleanup activities, and collected about 1,100 45-liter bags of waste, and about 30 ton of waste.\n\nThrough the One Blue Ocean Project, Sony will continue to accelerate activities toward the goal of reducing its environmental footprint to zero by 2050, as outlined in the Road to Zero environmental plan.\nDisclosure of Climate-related Information in Accordance with the TCFD Recommendations\n\nSony recognizes that its business depends upon the sustainability of the global environment and societies where people can live in security. Based on this understanding, Sony is constantly moving forward with environmental and social initiatives throughout the value chain. In particular, Sony is tackling climate change as one of its priority issues.\n\nOn May 27, 2019, Sony announced its endorsement of the final report published by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the \u201cTCFD Recommendations\u201d) established by the Financial Stability Board. Sony also participates in the TCFD Consortium, which was established to facilitate implementation and discussion among companies and financial institutions that endorse the TCFD Recommendations in Japan. Sony will continue to improve its climate-related information disclosure in accordance with the TCFD Recommendations.\n\nPolicy on Climate Change\n\nSony reduces energy consumption and is striving to achieve zero emissions of greenhouse gases throughout the lifecycle of its products, service and business activities. Specifically, Sony has designated the following initiatives to achieve its environmental mid-term targets.\n\nThe main initiatives implemented by Sony business sites are reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy usage efficiency, switching to energy sources that are lower in greenhouse gas emissions, and using renewable energy. In addition to the efforts of its business sites, Sony develops and supplies energy efficient, environmentally conscious products and services, and also works with manufacturing subcontractors and suppliers of components and raw materials in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions both directly and indirectly.\n\n- Sony Group Environmental Vision: Principles\n- Environmental Plan and Mid-Term Environmental Targets\n\nGovernance\n\nUnder the Companies Act of Japan, Sony has adopted the \u201cCompany with Three Committees\u201d corporate governance system as the most appropriate system for the company. Under this system, the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) determines Sony Group\u2019s fundamental management policies and other material matters, while broadly delegating the decision-making authority to conduct Sony\u2019s business operation to Senior Executives in line with their respective responsibilities as defined by the Board, with a view to promoting timely and efficient decision-making within Sony Group.\n\nThe Board regularly deliberates and decides upon the mid-term management plan and annual business plan, taking into account various risks and opportunities, including climate change, in its deliberations and decisions. Senior Executives implement strategies according to the management plans and the business plan while carrying out business execution, and the Board receives and discusses reports on the status of business execution as needed.\n\nWith authority delegated by the Board, the CEO of Sony, who is a member of the Board has responsibility and authority to establish and determine the Sony Group Environmental Vision, which stipulates the corporate philosophy on the global environment and corporate principles including on climate change matters and mid-term environmental targets (Green Management 20XX) both are applicable to entire Sony Group. This is because environmental activities including climate change are the activities for the entire Sony Group. The Senior Executive in charge of environment matters, who is appointed by the Board, then established the Sony Group Environmental Management Structure, which consist of internal regulations that stipulate the basic framework for global environmental management at Sony. The same Senior Executive supervises the initiatives implemented by each business unit and business site to achieve the Sony Group Environmental Vision, and also supervises their operation of and adherence to the Sony Group Environmental Management Structure. In order to address the TCFD Recommendations, environmental department leads the analysis and identification of climate-related risks and opportunities through scenario analysis and review the countermeasures. (For more details, see \u201cStrategies\u201d below.) The progress on initiatives implemented under this environmental execution framework are regularly reported to and reviewed by the Board.\n\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to determine the compensation policy on the content of individual compensation for Senior Executives and other officers, including CEO, and to determine or oversee the amount of individual compensation paid to Senior Executives. Environment related matters are taken into account as a factor in evaluating the remuneration linked to business results of Senior Executives and Senior Vice Presidents in charge of each business unit.\n\n- Sony Group Environmental Vision\n- Environmental Management Structure\nStrategies\n- Identifying and Addressing Business Risks\nTackling environmental issues is consistent with Sony\u2019s commitment to build a sustainable world and is important in terms of ensuring business continuity. Sony seeks to identify various environment-related risks and address foreseeable risks. This applies to transition risks such as adoption of carbon taxes, regional expansion of emissions trading schemes, stronger regulation of energy efficiency standards for products, and market changes driven by shifting consumer attitudes. It also applies to physical risks such as abnormal weather events and sea level rise due to climate change.\n\n- Creating and Expanding Business Opportunities\nSony believes that tackling environmental issues also leads to business opportunities. For example, the Paris Agreement*1 that emerged from the COP 21*2 meeting in December 2015 addressed climate change issues, and with increasing public awareness, consumer demand is shifting toward energy-efficient products. Sony has already increased the energy efficiency of many of its products. In light of these social trends, demand for energy-efficient products may continue to grow. For instance, Sony manufactures image sensors that deliver high performance and low power consumption, which could lead to broader applications such as for automotive use.\n\n*1 The Paris Agreement was adopted at COP 21 held in Paris, France and serves as an international framework for climate change action starting from 2020.\n*2 COP 21 refers to the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\n- Scenario Analysis\n  - Analysis Methodology and Assumptions\nIn accordance with the requirements of the TCFD Recommendations and advice from external experts, Sony conducted scenario analyses of climate change impacts on the entire Sony Group (excluding the financial business; the same applies to the \u201cScenario Analysis\u201d part) from September 2019 to July 2020. To assess the impact of climate change on the entire Sony Group, each business segment assessed the degree to which climate change impacts its industry on a four-point scale of \u201cVery Significant,\u201d \u201cSignificant,\u201d \u201cModerate,\u201d and \u201cMinor.\u201d The rating was based on how often climate change impacts were mentioned in the guidelines and assessment methodologies for investors, ESG assessment institutions, and investor initiatives. Based on the analyses, climate change was found to have a moderate impact on the Imaging & Sensing Solutions (I&SS), Electronics Products & Solutions, and Game & Network Services segments, while having a minor impact on the Music and Pictures segments.\n\nOf the three business areas that are moderately impacted by climate change, the I&SS segment generates the most greenhouse gas emissions. Sony conducted scenario analyses using multiple scenarios for the segment, in order to identify the risks and opportunities from changes in the external environment that are connected to climate change. For simplicity of analysis, it was assumed that the major businesses comprising the I&SS segment would not change significantly from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2030. The International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA\u2019s) scenarios for a 2\u00b0C temperature rise (Sustainable Development Scenario, 2\u00b0C Scenario, and Beyond 2\u00b0C Scenario) and a 4\u00b0C temperature rise (Stated Policies Scenario, New Policies Scenario, Current Policies Scenario, and Reference Technology Scenario) were used.\n\n- Analysis Results and Countermeasures\nSony identified the following respective risks based on the analysis results using the 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios. The 2\u00b0C scenarios would see national governments introduce tougher regulations driven by decarbonizing policies, which would bring about transition risks as well as the possibility that carbon pricing adoption will raise crude oil and fossil fuel electricity costs. For example, carbon pricing in Japan is projected to be around 1000USD per ton of CO2 in 2030. (Source: IEA World Energy Outlook 2019)\n\nUnder both the 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios, progressive temperature rise will cause abnormal weather events to increase both in severity and frequency, which could inflict damage on Sony\u2019s manufacturing sites and suppliers, or reduce demand from B2B customers due to the disruption of supply chains. Moreover, although there is also an increased risk of droughts, which would impact essential water supplies for semiconductor manufacturing, the drought risk was assessed as having a limited impact.\n\nSony is implementing the following initiatives to address the identified risks.\nAs a member of the RE100*1 initiative, Sony is working toward using 100% renewable electricity throughout its operations, including in the I&SS segment, by fiscal 2040. Specifically, Sony is examining measures such as directly purchasing renewable electricity from Japanese power utilities and purchasing renewable electricity certificates at manufacturing sites outside of Japan. Sony will expand the use of renewable energy, closely watching renewable energy trends.\n\n*1 RE100 is a global initiative led by the non-profit The Climate Group in partnership with COP in which participating companies set a goal of procuring 100% renewable electricity for power used in their global business operations.\n\nIn each business segment, the Sony Group develops and enhances risk management and business continuity plans (BCPs) from the perspective of improving risk management across supply chains, through the identification, analysis, and assessment of business continuity risks. Flood damage has grown in recent years due to the impact of climate change, prompting Sony to reassess the flood risk at its main manufacturing sites in Japan and implement preventative measures that will mitigate flood damage and facilitate rapid recovery. Sony is collaborating with relevant companies and organizations, and conducts hands-on drills to address foreseeable risks, in an effort to enhance business continuity and accelerate flood recovery. Sony will continue to increase its resilience to climate change, based on its analyses and initiatives.\n\nNote: The above scenario analysis was conducted using IEA\u2019s scenarios for 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C temperature rise and based on multiple assumptions. Actual events may differ from the scenarios.\nRisk Management\nEach business unit, subsidiary/affiliated company and corporate division of Sony periodically reviews and assesses risks for the area of which it is in charge and works on finding, reporting, reviewing and responding to the risks. In addition, Senior Executives have established and maintain a system to identify and control risks that may cause losses to Sony, in the areas of which they are in charge. The Corporate Executive Officer in charge of group risk control comprehensively promotes and manages the establishment and maintenance of the systems as stated above through the activities with related departments. The Board of Directors receives regular reports on the framework and its operational status, to confirm the validity of the framework. Under the framework, each business unit, subsidiary/affiliated company and corporate division also assesses and analyzes climate-related risks, when assembling business strategies and business plans. As mentioned above, from September 2019 to July 2020, Sony conducted scenario analyses as per the TCFD Recommendations to assess and analyze climate-related risks.\n\nMetrics and Targets\nIn accordance with the Sony Group Code of Conduct, Sony recognizes the importance of reducing the global environmental footprint of the Group\u2019s business activities, including addressing climate change. In 2010, Sony formulated the Road to Zero global environmental plan, which aims to reduce its environmental footprint to zero by 2050. From a climate change perspective, Sony is developing and supplying environmentally conscious products and services in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions not only from manufacturing at its sites, but also throughout the life cycle of its products. Sony is also making energy-efficiency improvements at its business sites and shifting to renewable energy, while encouraging contract manufacturers and component suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Green Management 2020 environmental mid-term targets that Sony is working to achieve by the end of fiscal 2020, the life cycle of products has been divided into six stages: product and service planning and design, operations, raw materials and components procurement, logistics, take-back and recycling, and innovation. For each stage, Sony has set specific targets from the four perspectives of climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity, and implements initiatives to achieve these targets. For example, from the perspective of climate change, Sony is targeting an average 30% reduction in the annual energy consumption of Sony products, and a 300,000-ton reduction of CO2 emissions at Sony business sites by shifting to renewable energy.\n\nSony also joined the global Renewable Energy 100% initiative in September 2018, making a commitment to the goal of sourcing 100% renewable electricity for the worldwide operations of the Sony Group by 2040.\n\n> Green Management 2020 Targets and Progress\nEnvironmental Technologies\n\nDeveloping the Environmental Technologies of the Future\n\nIoT for a Sustainable Society\n\nIn order to realize a sustainable society, it is necessary to continue the conservation of various regions such as mountain forests, satoyama (woodlands surrounding rural settlements), rivers, and coasts. Furthermore, it requires the detection of anomalies to prevent problems from arising, instead of addressing environmental pollution after it has already arisen. Such systems can only be realized through the ability to acquire and transmit data extending to mountainous and coastal areas not serviced by conventional mobile networks. They also require devices and networks that can function in areas where electricity service is difficult. To address these needs, Sony is pursuing R&D for a system that provides sensing almost anywhere on the planet, and employs AI processing to provide society with essential information. The system combines ultra-low power SPRESENSE\u2122 edge AI devices that offer advanced sensing in a battery-powered device, with Sony\u2019s expertise in edge AI technology for embedded devices led by Neural Network Console software, and ELTRES\u2122 IoT network service that enables low power and low bitrate data transmission with a range over 100 km. Sony is advancing the system through a number of projects including a pilot project in the mountains of Nagano Prefecture. These projects will help to prevent environmental pollution and predict emergencies such as volcanic eruptions, river floods, and wildfires, as well as increase agricultural and livestock productivity.\n\n- SPRESENSE\n- Neural Network Console\n- ELTRES IoT network service\n\nSynecoculture\u2122\n\nConventional agriculture largely focuses on increasing productivity from a single crop, by plowing top soil, spreading fertilizer, and applying pesticides based on the characteristics of the crop. These practices damage ecosystems and cause environmental problems. Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL) is testing applications for Synecoculture, a sustainable agricultural practice that highly balances productivity and biodiversity. Synecoculture eliminates the need for plowing, fertilizing, and pesticide use that impact the environment, by taking maximum advantage of the material cycling that occurs naturally in ecosystems, aiming to create rich ecosystems with a diverse mix of plants that coexist together and grow lushly. Synecoculture requires vast knowledge of plant ecology, and for several years Sony CSL has been conducting tests at a number of farms, cultivating a blend of plants in order to collect data on plant compatibility and soil conditions. Sony CSL is also using IT to develop systems to support greater social ecological diversity including Synecoculture. The Synecoculture project is directly related to 11 out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is registered as a good corporate practice with the Japan SDGs Action Platform promoted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.\n\n- Renewing agriculture to rebuild a broken environment with Synecoculture (Movie)\nOpen Energy Systems\u2122\n\nAlthough renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power generation have been attracting much attention in recent years, there are significant issues to overcome before widely distributed renewable energy can be utilized effectively. Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL) is conducting research on Open Energy Systems (OES), a whole new type of bottom-up, distributed electric power system, which mainly uses renewable energy sources. Sony CSL and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) are conducting a joint research project for OES. (The project was supported by Okinawa Prefecture as a subtropical and island energy infrastructure technology research subsidy program from fiscal 2013 to 2016 and as an energy infrastructure research program using advanced technology from fiscal 2017 to 2019.) Under the project, Sony CSL has installed photovoltaic panels and energy storage systems at 19 faculty housing units on the OIST campus, and built a DC-based OES (DCOES) to interconnect the housing with DC power lines. The installation has been used to test automatic power exchange between the housing units since fiscal 2014. The OES Project is directly related to seven out of the 17 SDGs, and is registered as a good corporate practice with the Japan SDGs Action Platform promoted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.\n\nMore information about Open Energy Systems\n\nDCOES Powering\n19 Residences in the OIST Faculty Housing Area\n\nProducts and Services\n\nReducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nReducing CO\u2082 Emissions from Product Usage\n\nSony products consume electrical power while used by their owners, resulting in indirect emissions of CO\u2082. Sony has adopted the target of reducing annual energy consumption per product*1 from product use by 30% by fiscal 2020 compared to the fiscal 2013 level. To achieve this, Sony is working to incorporate energy-saving features in a wide range of product categories. In fiscal 2019, annual energy consumption per product was 52% lower than in fiscal 2013. Since setting the target, Sony has made great progress, especially in reducing the power consumption of flat screen televisions and game consoles.\n\nTotal CO\u2082 emissions in product use over the lifetime of all products sold in fiscal 2019 were approximately 9.57 million tons, which was 10% lower than in fiscal 2018.*2\n\n*1 Energy-using products which operate the intended main function with energy input from a commercial power supply\n*2 In theory, emissions during product use in the current fiscal year should be calculated from the total quantity of electrical power consumed by previously sold Sony products that are still in use by consumers in the current fiscal year. However, given the difficulty of determining how many previously sold Sony products are still in use by consumers of the total number of Sony products sold to date, Sony uses the total quantity of electrical power consumed while in use over the lifetime of Sony products sold in the current fiscal year as an indicator for CO\u2082 emissions during use.\n\nReducing Product Power Consumption\n\nSony sets specific fiscal year targets to reduce product energy consumption in every product category. To achieve these targets, Sony engages in ongoing technology development to improve energy efficiency, while continually studying products for potential improvements and implementing diverse measures to reduce energy consumption. Regulations governing energy efficiency of products, such as the Energy-related Products Directive (ErP) enacted in the European Union in 2010, are enforced in countries around the world, and Sony products are ready for compliance in every country before these regulations go into effect.\n\nReducing the Power Consumption of PlayStation\u00ae\nReducing the Power Consumption of Data Projectors\nConserving Resources\n\nReducing Resources Used in Products\n\nUnder its targets for minimizing resource inputs, Sony worked to reduce the average mass of products. In fiscal 2019, the total volume of resources used in products was approximately 426 thousand tons, which was down some 16% from fiscal 2018 due to the overall decline in the sales volume of products.\n\n* Total volume of resources used is the total weight of resources used in products, accessories, instruction manuals and packaging materials. The weight of total products shipped is used to represent this value.\n\nTotal Volume of Resources Used in Products\n\n(Thousand Tons)\n\n| Year | Television | Audio and Video | Imaging Products & Solutions | Game | Software | Devices and others |\n|------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|------|----------|-------------------|\n| 13   | 668        | 653             | 606                         | 568  | 578      | 426               |\n| 14   | 668        | 653             | 606                         | 568  | 578      | 426               |\n| 15   | 668        | 653             | 606                         | 568  | 578      | 426               |\n| 16   | 668        | 653             | 606                         | 568  | 578      | 426               |\n| 17   | 668        | 653             | 606                         | 568  | 578      | 426               |\n| 18   | 668        | 653             | 606                         | 568  | 578      | 426               |\n| 19   | 668        | 653             | 606                         | 568  | 578      | 426               |\n\nUsing Fewer Resources in Products and Packages\n\nSony is working to make its products and packages even more lightweight and compact across a wide range of product categories in order to conserve resources.\n\n- Reducing the use of resources in the body of PlayStation\u00ae\n- Reducing the use of resources in the body for soundbars and home theater systems\n- Reducing the use of resources in the packages for soundbars and home theater systems\n- Reducing the use of resources in the camera lenses\n\nDigitization of Product Manuals\n\nSony is conserving resources by making documentation digitally available for downloading, while working to keep documents readily understandable as documentation volume grows in support more multi-functional products. As a result, customers can more readily view documentation on a variety of devices including PCs, tablets, and smartphones, while the amount of paper used to print documentation is being reduced. Fewer printed pages also mean less carbon emissions from printing and having to ship documentation with products.\n\nTextless Quick Start Guides\n\nIn fiscal 2015, as part of initiatives to conserve resources in documentation, Sony started to adopt textless quick start guides for Sony Walkman\u00ae, headphones, wireless speakers, and high power audio systems sold in markets outside of Japan that require instructions in multiple languages. These universal quick start guides, included with each product, use illustrations to guide consumers through setup and basic operation, replacing conventional multilingual documentation that used to be written in as many as nine languages. With textless quick start guides, consumers can directly comprehend the instructions without text, thereby reducing the waste generated by unneeded language documents. Sony introduced the textless quick start guide for Sony Walkman and for headphones in fiscal 2015, for wireless speakers in fiscal 2017, and for high power audio systems in fiscal 2018. By adopting these textless guides, Sony has reduced the use of paper by approximately 924.5 tons. Textless quick start guides also help to reduce the bulk and weight of product packaging. Sony received a Good Design Award 2015 in recognition of its fresh approach to using textless documentation.\n\nSony Financial Group\u2014Going Paperless\n\nThe Sony Financial Group has been reducing the use of paper for contracts and transactions, both to conserve paper resources and reduce mailing, which produces carbon emissions. Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. has introduced a paperless application that enables customers to use an electronic signature to complete new contract application procedures as well as various post-contract procedures, such as changing contractual coverage, thereby realizing a reduction in paper usage. Sony Assurance Inc. enables customers to apply for automobile, medical, fire, and overseas travel insurance online, eliminating the printing and mailing of application forms. Customers who apply for automobile and fire insurance online can also opt out of receiving a printed copy of their insurance policies, receiving up to a 500-yen discount off the price of their insurance for going paperless. Sony Bank Inc. is also working to go paperless, providing transaction slips, product explanation...\nmaterials, and transaction documents for customers only on websites or via electronic delivery as a general rule.\n\nMore information about paperless initiatives at Sony Life Insurance (only in Japanese)\nMore information about paperless initiatives at Sony Assurance (only in Japanese)\nMore information about paperless initiatives at Sony Bank (only in Japanese)\n\nReducing Use of Virgin Plastics\n\nVirgin Plastic Used Per Product\n\nSony has set a target of reducing virgin plastic used per product by 10% from the fiscal 2013 level, by fiscal 2020. To achieve this target, Sony has been working to expand its use of recycled plastics and make its product chassis more lightweight and compact while also minimizing plastic packaging materials. In fiscal 2019, virgin plastic used per product was up 10% from the fiscal 2013 level. Factors contributing to this increase include difficulty in procuring recycled plastics due to stricter regulations on import and export of used plastic, and the expansion of the average TV screen size. On the other hand, as a positive example of packaging reduction, Sony worked to minimize packaging volume and decreased the amount of Styrofoam used to package the 85X85G and 85XGBS LCD TV series released in fiscal 2019 by up to 19% compared to an earlier LCD TV model. The packaging for batteries employed in digital still and video cameras is being converted from blister packs to paper boxes, and the switchover is to be completed for all models by the end of fiscal 2020.\n\nIncorporating Recycled Plastic\n\nTo reduce the consumption of virgin plastic, Sony has expanded the use of recycled plastics in a broad range of product categories by developing recycled plastics while elevating quality and reducing manufacturing costs. Sony recently developed a recycled plastic for audio products that actually improves sound quality while retaining a high percentage of recycled content. This recycled plastic was used in soundbars and home theater systems that were sold in 2016. In fiscal 2019, the Sony Group used some 15 thousand tons of recycled plastic in its products. This amount consisted of approximately 56% recycled plastic content from scraps and other waste materials generated from manufacturing by the Sony Group and other companies, and approximately 44% post-consumer recycled plastic content from used products, containers, and other sources.\n\nMore information about recycled plastic for high quality sound\nNew, recycled packaging for aibo\nUsing recycled plastic in soundbars and home theater systems\nPackaging made with post-consumer recycled PET bottles\n\nSORPLAS\u2122, Sony\u2019s Original Flame-Retardant Recycled Plastic\n\nIn 2011, Sony began practical use of Sustainable Oriented Recycled Plastic (SORPLAS), a flame-retardant recycled plastic made possible by a proprietary compounding technology that combines an original, non-halogen and non-phosphorus flame retardant\u2014itself produced using a Sony-developed process\u2014and waste plastics (polycarbonate resin) from various sources in an optimal blend. Thanks to Sony\u2019s novel flame-retardant, which makes it possible to impart flame-retardancy by the addition of a very small amount of less than 1% of total content, SORPLAS not only surpasses conventional flame-retardant plastics in terms of durability, flame-retardancy and recyclability, but also achieves an outstanding utilization rate of up to 99% waste plastics. The effective utilization of SORPLAS has been shown to reduce CO2 emissions in product manufacturing by up to 80%.* Moreover, Sony\u2019s versatile waste-plastic compounding technology makes it possible to tailor SORPLAS to the needs of a variety of products. Sony first used SORPLAS in its products in 2011 and has since incorporated it into a wide variety of Sony products. Then, in 2014, Sony commenced external sales. Sony will continue to make SORPLAS widely available also outside the group, promote resource recycling, and contribute to society with a reduced environmental impact.\n\n* In the case of SORPLAS in the BRAVIA\u2122 LCD TV KDL-40EX52H.

To prevent such environmental harm, some countries and regions have introduced laws and directives. In European Union, certain chemical substances in products are restricted by Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive*1 and REACH*2 regulation. In Japan, products that contain certain chemical substances are required to carry the J-Moss*3 mark, while in China it is required to disclose information on chemical substances contained in products in line with the Management Methods on the Pollution Control of Electronic Information Products, often referred to as China RoHS.*4\n\nIn light of the global nature of its markets and supply chains, Sony has established its own global standards for the management of chemical substances, titled \u201cManagement Regulations for the Environment-related Substances to be Controlled which are Included in Parts and Materials (SS-00259).\u201d*5 Taking into account the related laws and regulations around the world and simultaneously the opinions of various stakeholders. In line with these standards, Sony ensures globally consistent management of chemical substances in parts and materials.\n\nComplying with Regulations Governing Chemical Substances in Products\n\nSony has set up necessary procedures to ensure compliance with the EU\u2019s REACH regulation requirements and revised RoHS Directive. In response to its obligation under REACH to provide information to customers, as well as to the CE marking requirement of the RoHS directive, Sony has adopted the chemSHERPA*6 scheme based on IEC62474.*7 This enables Sony to collect data on specified chemical substances in parts and materials purchased from suppliers for management in an internal database.\n\nThree Core Principles for Managing Chemical Substances in Products\n\nTo guide its efforts to manage chemical substances in products in compliance with Sony\u2019s own global standards for management of chemical substances, titled \u201cManagement Regulations for Environment-related Substances to be Controlled which are Included in Parts and Materials\u201d (SS-00259), Sony has established three core principles:\n\n- Upstream management\n\nIn 2002, Sony established the Green Partner Environmental Quality Approval Program, which outlines Sony\u2019s Green Partner Standards for chemical substance management. Sony audits suppliers based on these standards. Sony purchases electronic parts only from suppliers who have passed this audit and have been certified as Green Partners. Sony also applies the Green Partner Environmental Quality Approval Program to manufacturing partners. To further enhance the efficiency of the system to manage chemical substances, in 2003 Sony introduced the Green Book, a raw materials database, which was made available to Sony\u2019s direct suppliers via its electronic supplier portal. In the Green Book, Sony has registered only those materials that it has measured and confirmed compliance with the SS-00259 standards for Sony\u2019s designated raw materials such as recycled plastics and wires, and also for molding resins, paints, inks, and other materials that are commonly used by multiple first tier suppliers. To assist REACH compliance, Sony has collected information on raw materials listed in Green Book data on the content of certain chemical substances and makes this data available to its suppliers and contract manufacturers.\n\n- Management in Quality Control/Quality Assurance processes\n\nNew parts and materials are tested to ensure conformity with SS-00259 standards in addition to compliance with conventional quality control standards. Data on the content of certain chemical substances collected from suppliers are thoroughly evaluated for this purpose. By implementing these strict management procedures worldwide, incomppliant products are prevented from entering the market.\n\n- Utilization of chemical analysis\n\nTo prevent prohibited substances from accidentally entering products, Sony requires suppliers to conduct ICP analysis on the specific parts and materials. For some high-risk substances Sony has also implemented internal control systems that involve using, for example, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and other measurement devices, to Sony sites worldwide, to help confirm that prohibited substances are kept out of products.\nSystem for Managing Chemical Substances in Products\n\nManagement of Chemical Substances in Packaging Materials\n\nSony also takes precautions to increase the safety of its packaging materials and ensure that hazardous substances, including heavy metals, are not mixed into packaging materials by managing materials in line with its proprietary \u201cManagement Regulations for Environment-related Substances to be Controlled which are included in Parts and Materials\u201d (SS-00259). The packaging section of SS-00259 is based on, among others, EU directives on packaging and waste.\n\nReduction and Replacement of Chemical Substances of Very High Concern\n\nSony defines \u201cEnvironment-related Substances to be Controlled\u201d (hereafter \u201cControlled Substances\u201d) as certain chemicals that it has determined to have significant impact on both humans and the global environment, including substances that may not be controlled by laws. (Please refer to \u201cControlled Substances -SS-00259 for General Use-\u201d)\n\nSony either prohibits the use of these substances in parts or phases them out wherever a viable alternative that meets all product quality and technical requirements is available. In its Green Management 2020 mid-term management targets, Sony specifies high-risk applications from collected application- and content-related information, considering the hazardous nature and extent of exposure (volume) as risk factors, and proceeds to prohibit the \u201cControlled Substances\u201d in the specified use.\n\nPolyvinyl Chloride (PVC)\n\nImproper disposal of PVCs poses a risk of generating hazardous substances. For example, Sony is concerned about the possibility that its small electronic products, in particular, could be collected to obtain valuable materials, and then the unwanted parts could be improperly incinerated and disposed of in landfills, thus causing adverse environmental impacts. In addition, there are also concerns about the environmental and health impact of some of the substances used as plasticizers and stabilizers in PVCs. Although PVCs are not currently regulated by any laws that apply to chemical substances used in electronic products, Sony works to reduce PVC content in individual components. As a result, Sony does not use PVCs in product packaging materials (with the exception of some packing materials for devices, semiconductors, batteries, and similar items) or in sheets/laminates used for product housings, contactless IC cards, and carrying bags/cases for products (excluding those for professional use). Sony has also successfully replaced PVCs by substitute materials for internal components that are difficult to remove prior to recycling, such as flexible flat cables, insulation plates, and heat-shrink tubes (excluding those for batteries). Also, Sony is working to end the use of PVCs in the housings and internal wiring of small electronic devices (the adoption of alternatives is subject to the ability to resolve issues relating to quality, technology, and supply). As of the end of July 2020, Sony has replaced PVCs in new products and new models in the following products with alternative substances.\n\nSony Mobile Critical Substance List [PDF:545KB]\n\nControlled Substances -SS-00259 for General Use-\nBeryllium Compounds\n\nSony has designated beryllium oxide as \u201cControlled Substances\u201d since 2007 and is working to eliminate these substances. No beryllium oxide is used in any of its products. Sony has also succeeded in eliminating beryllium compounds from Xperia\u2122 smartphones.\n\nArsenic Compounds\n\nIn accordance with the 13th edition of the SS-00259, released in 2014, Sony has banned the use of LCD panels containing diarsenic trioxide and diarsenic pentoxide.\n\nCreating Environmentally Conscious Products\n\nPromoting Environmentally Conscious Design\n\nThe Sony Group\u2019s mid-term targets include targets for products, which involve the reduction of annual power consumption, the promotion of resource conservation and the management of chemical substances. Business units identify the environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of target product categories and formulate their targets based on the category\u2019s specific characteristics. Then, they execute environmentally conscious design by setting environmental mid-term targets for each product. They review progress against their environmental mid-term targets for each product, and report results to the department in charge of environmental functions at headquarters. In turn, this department evaluates the targets and progress of each business unit, using these evaluations as the basis for its review of the Sony Group\u2019s progress in achieving its environmental mid-term targets. Based on the results of this review, Sony determines areas of focus and revises targets for the subsequent fiscal year. This method enables Sony to execute ongoing environmentally conscious processes for each business unit and product, which in turn ensure the development of environmentally conscious products.\nDesigning Recyclability into Products\n\nOne initiative Sony is taking to ensure that its products are environmentally responsible involves designing them with recyclability in mind. This means, for example, reducing the number of screws, and labeling the material type of plastic used in parts to make it easier to extract resources from used products during recycling. For example, Sony has issued Environmental Design Standards and Guidelines for TVs, which are used when planning and designing new products. These design standards and guidelines reflect the trends in regulations inside and outside of Japan as well as Sony\u2019s mid-term environmental targets. Additionally, Sony conducts an annual review and revision of these guidelines based on industry trends and the latest recycling information, which is gathered via regular sharing of information and opinions with the Green Cycle Corporation, a Sony Group company engaged in the recycling business.\n\nUtilizing Life Cycle Assessments (LCA)\n\nProduct life cycle assessments (LCAs) are a means of identifying and quantifying the environmental impact of products at all stages of their life cycles, which include the manufacture of materials and parts used in products, the assembly and transport of products, product use and standby mode, and end of life (i.e., disposal and recycling). LCAs of major products help us to clarify priorities for product improvement for all product categories and reduce the environmental impact of Sony products.\n\nAs shown in the chart titled \"Breakdown of CO\u2082 Emissions Over the Life Cycle of Signature Sony Products,\" we see that the life cycle stages responsible for generating a large portion of a product\u2019s CO\u2082 emissions differ depending on the product category. For example, for product categories such as LCD televisions, and Blu-ray Disc\u2122/DVD players, emissions during product use account for a large proportion of total emissions. For this reason, reducing the power consumption of these products during use is particularly important. Conversely, among product categories such as smartphones and digital video cameras, a large portion of CO\u2082 emissions occur at the manufacturing stage and in the production of materials and parts, rather than during use. For these products, such measures as reducing the parts count are crucial in lowering life cycle CO\u2082 emissions. LCA results are reflected in mid-term environmental targets and utilized in product design for environment.\n\nBreakdown of CO\u2082 Emissions Over the Life Cycle of Signature Sony Products\n\n| Product Category | Materials and parts | Production | Transport | Use | Disposal / recycle |\n|------------------|---------------------|------------|-----------|-----|-------------------|\n| BRAVIA\u2122 LCD televisions | | | | | |\n| Blu-ray Disc\u2122 / DVD players | | | | | |\n| Xperia\u2122 Smartphone | | | | | |\n| Handycam\u00ae video cameras | | | | | |\n| Cyber-shot\u2122 digital still cameras | | | | | |\n| WALKMAN\u00ae memory-type portable audio players | | | | | |\n\nSony calculated the emissions based on the following assumptions:\n- Place of sale: Japan\n- Product transportation: 500 kilometers by truck in Japan: by ship or by air for international transport\n- Years of use: Walkman Memory Type portable audio players: 5 years; Cyber-shot compact digital camera: 2.7 years; Handycam digital camcorder: 6.4 years; Xperia Smartphone: 4 years; Blu-ray Disc / DVD players: 7 years; BRAVIA LCD television: 10 years\n\nNotes:\n- This chart shows the proportion of CO\u2082 emissions at each stage of the life cycle.

Signature products for these efforts are introduced on Sony Group Portal Website \u201cEnvironment.\u201d\n\n[Environmental Features in Sony Products]\n\nEnvironmentally and Socially Beneficial Products and Services\n\nDigital Cinema Systems\n\nSony developed the HDW-F900, the world\u2019s first digital video camera for cinema production, back in the year 2000. Then, in 2007, Sony released 4K digital cinema projection systems featuring Sony SXRD projectors. These products helped usher in the era of energy- and resource-saving digital cinema, replacing traditional film, which uses water and chemicals for film manufacturing and processing. While remaining compact and lightweight, the Venice Digital Cinema Camera released in 2018 is capable of 6K recording.\n\n[More information about the compact and lightweight VENICE]\n\nLicense of New Material Triporous\u2122\n\nTriporous is a plant-based porous carbon material with excellent adsorption qualities. Sony obtained an end-to-end patent on this material and began licensing Triporous in 2019. Made from rice husks, Triporous has a unique microstructure that enables easy adsorption of substances with large molecular weights, which conventional activated charcoal does not easily adsorb. These substances include organic substances that cause water pollution, as well as allergens, viruses, and bacteria. The properties of Triporous can be leveraged to develop high-performance environmental cleaning filters that remove pollutants in water and air, and it is expected to have applications for plant wastewater treatment facilities and water purification systems in developing countries. Japan alone generates around two million tons of rice husks per year, and this surplus biomass is part of more than 130 million tons generated annually worldwide. By promoting Triporous globally as an innovative way to utilize rice husks, Sony is helping to realize a more environmentally conscious, recycling-oriented society.\n\n[Triporous official website]\n\nExternal Sales of SORPLAS\u2122 Recycled Plastic\n\nSony commenced external sales of its proprietary Sustainable Oriented Recycled Plastic (SORPLAS) in 2014. SORPLAS is a flame-retardant recycled plastic that offers excellent heat resistance, durability, and recyclability. It contains up to 99% recycled materials. SORPLAS was first used in Sony products in 2011 and has since been incorporated into a wide variety of Sony products. By now offering SORPLAS to other companies, Sony aims to promote the recycling of resources and help reduce the environmental impact of society as a whole. Many companies are interested in using SORPLAS. It is already being used in a wide variety of products, including televisions, smartphones, lighting fixtures, and office supplies.\n\n[More information about SORPLAS]\n\nNews Release: Sony commences external sales of SORPLAS flame-retardant recycled plastic material that achieves high durability and heat resistance, and comprises up to 99% recycled content\n\nSony\u2019s proprietary flame retardant (in vial) and two types of SORPLAS recycled plastic pellets\n\nTriporous a new material made from rice husks\nFeliCa\u2122 IC Card Passenger Ticketing Systems\n\nSony\u2019s smart card passenger ticketing system, based on FeliCa contactless IC card technology, is helping to alleviate air pollution in Bangladesh. The city is facing serious air pollution issues due to increasing traffic congestion. The national bus company decided to adopt a FeliCa smart card passenger ticketing system in order to encourage the residents of Bangladesh to use municipal buses. The FeliCa-based system has made it easier for users to get on and off buses. This added convenience has attracted more riders, which is in turn helping to alleviate traffic congestion.\n\nSupporting Environmental Projects Using Drones\n\nThe Sony Group company, Aerosense Inc., supplies industrial solutions integrating drone technology with cloud services. High-precision drone surveying saves labor at civil engineering sites nationwide, and in recent years Aerosense has also supported a wide range of environmental projects and operations carried out by companies and local governments. In March 2016, the company worked with Minamisoma-shi in Fukushima Prefecture, which was carrying out decontamination work following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster. For three years, Aerosense drones regularly monitored the upper surface of a sheet covering contaminated materials in a temporary storage facility. Since September 2016, Aerosense has also been involved in a project tackling pine wilt disease in protected coastal forests, which is a serious problem across Japan. The Aerosense drones use their cameras to precisely identify damaged trees. This technology is helping to establish new methods of maintaining and managing protected coastal forests. In 2018, Aerosense participated in a CO2 emissions reduction project sponsored by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism to promote the feasibility of delivery using unmanned aircraft in sparsely populated areas. It conducted an experiment for drone delivery beyond the visual line of sight to Genkai Island in Fukuoka Prefecture.\nSuppliers and Outsourcing Contractors\n\nReducing Environmental Impact at Suppliers and Outsourcing Contractors\n\nWorking with Component Suppliers and Manufacturing Outsourcing Contractors to Reduce the Impact on the Environment\n\nAs part of its efforts to reduce environmental impact across the supply chain, Sony has been working with key component suppliers and manufacturing outsourcing contractors since fiscal 2016 to reduce their environmental footprint. For example, Sony has asked its manufacturing outsourcing contractors to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and reduce water use intensity by 1% per year, while asking component suppliers to set voluntary reduction targets. Sony also collects data on greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption relating to the manufacturing and shipping of products and components delivered to Sony. In fiscal 2019, Sony obtained answer to the questionnaire about these data from component suppliers which account for approximately 80% of the total transaction value and from manufacturing outsourcing contractors which account for approximately 90% of the total transaction value.\n\nPrioritizing Energy-Efficient Data Centers\n\nSony offers a wide variety of network services including gaming, Internet, and streaming services for movies and music. These services rely on data centers with facilities and components for transmitting large volumes of data to ensure seamless services for users. The amount of electricity consumed by data center equipment and facilities is increasing with the growth of network businesses. Sony\u2019s environmental mid-term targets include the target of prioritizing the use of energy-efficient data centers. Sony has been working on this by developing guidelines in fiscal 2016 that have been put into effect since fiscal 2017.\n\nPromoting Green Purchasing\n\nHaving set internal standards for green purchasing, Sony chooses environmentally conscious products when procuring nonproduction materials such as printing paper, stationery and office equipment in Japan. At the same time, in principle, Sony carefully examines needs, amounts to be used and stock levels to purchase appropriate quantities. In addition, when choosing products to be purchased, Sony prioritizes select recommended products in consideration of environmental impact at all stages of a product\u2019s life, from resource extraction through to production, distribution, use and disposal. Information on recommended products is included in Sony\u2019s purchasing system of nonproduction materials, making it possible for individuals in charge of purchasing decisions to give priority to environmentally conscious products.\nSites\n\nReducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions at Sony Sites\n\nUnder the Green Management 2020 mid-term environmental targets, Sony is working to achieve an absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 5% from the fiscal 2015 level by fiscal 2020. Main efforts toward this end include striving to reduce greenhouse gases such as CO\u2082 related to energy consumption and cutting emissions of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and other gases. In fiscal 2019, Sony\u2019s emissions of greenhouse gases totaled approximately 1.38 million tons. This represents a decrease of approximately 12% compared with fiscal 2015 and an increase of 3% compared with fiscal 2018.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions from Sites\n\nCO\u2082 Emissions from Energy Use at Sites\n\nIn fiscal 2019, emissions of CO\u2082 from energy use at Sony sites*1 accounted for approximately 1.29 million out of the approximately 1.38 million tons of total emissions at Sony, up by about 27,000 tons from fiscal 2018. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in semiconductor device production volumes. The above CO\u2082 emissions resulting from energy use at Sony sites include emissions from fuel used by Sony-owned business vehicles. In fiscal 2019, CO\u2082 emissions resulting from fuel used in vehicles amounted to approximately 12,000 tons.\n\nGoing forward, Sony will take efforts to restrict greenhouse gas emissions through infrastructure-related measures, including the installation of high-efficiency equipment and the promotion of energy recycling, and to enhance nonstructural measures, notably the introduction of training programs designed to foster energy-saving leaders.\n\n*1 Emissions of CO\u2082 from energy use at Sony sites include CO\u2082 emissions from fuel use of business vehicles owned by Sony.\n\nEmissions of PFCs and Other Greenhouse Gases\n\nPFCs and other greenhouse gases with high global warming potential are used in cleaning and etching processes during the manufacturing of semiconductors. Emissions of PFCs and other greenhouse gases in fiscal 2019 (calculated in terms of CO\u2082) totaled approximately 80,000 tons, up about 10,000 tons from fiscal 2018. Introduction of gas abatement equipment and other reduction initiatives have been carried out, but the total emissions increased due to the growth in semiconductor production. Sony is taking further steps to reduce emissions, including installing gas abatement equipment.\n\nPromoting Efficient Energy Use\n\nTo achieve its fiscal 2020 reduction targets, Sony is working on various energy conservation activities at its sites around the world. A sample of these initiatives follows.\n\n- Energy-Efficient Air Conditioning System\n\nSony Device Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (SDT) rebuilt its clean rooms used for semiconductor manufacturing to incorporate energy-efficient air conditioning (AC) systems. These systems use the warm air rising from heat-producing machinery to carry dust particles away from clean room work surfaces. The warm air is circulated through the ceiling to supply fresh air, keeping work surfaces clean with less air flow than a conventional AC system. The new systems reduce CO\u2082 emissions by roughly 67%, saving approximately 2,700 tons of emissions annually compared to a conventional system.\n\nHelping to reduce our plant\u2019s footprint\n- Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by improving specifications of plasma abatement equipment\n\nSony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Nagasaki Technology Center (Nagasaki TEC) has improved the specifications of its plasma abatement equipment that treats PFC gases emitted by semiconductor manufacturing, thereby reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Previously, Nagasaki TEC\u2019s plasma abatement system was designed with two units that ran continually in order to have a backup ready in case one unit malfunctioned. Working with the equipment manufacturer, Nagasaki TEC modified the system so that only one unit runs continuously while the other stands by with an instant startup function, enabling it to immediately kick in should the first unit malfunction. As a result, Nagasaki TEC reduced its annual CO\u2082 emissions by 3,392 tons thanks to a significant reduction in power consumption. In addition, this measure is now being implemented at other semiconductor manufacturing sites in the Sony Group.\n\n- Energy Conservation: Initiatives Driven by Plant Employees\n\nSony promotes a broad range of energy-saving efforts at its sites around the world. In addition to increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and equipment, in recent years Sony has actively implemented activities for reducing energy consumption suggested by manufacturing site employees. These activities focus on the formulation and implementation of energy-saving solutions for manufacturing sites, which consume more electricity than any other part of Sony\u2019s manufacturing operations. Employees set ambitious project targets and take steps to shed light on energy consumed in different manufacturing processes. This enables employees to identify unnecessary uses of energy in such processes, as well as to develop and test solutions and, having confirmed the effectiveness thereof, to effect ongoing improvements. Particularly outstanding solutions are subsequently expanded to other sites. These activities were prompted by the effectiveness of the Eco Challenge Project implemented in 2009 at Sony Corporation\u2019s Sendai Technology Center and Sony Storage Media Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Tagajo site. Similar energy conservation activities are now being implemented at Sony manufacturing sites around the world.\n\n- Use of Renewable Energy\n\nEfforts to Reduce CO\u2082 Emissions by Using Renewable Energy\n\nSony\u2019s Green Management 2020 environmental mid-term targets include reducing cumulative CO\u2082 emissions by 300,000 tons by using renewable energy* for the period from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020. In order to achieve this target, Sony is working to adopt renewable energy in ways suited to the regional circumstances of its business locations worldwide, employing strategies such as installing solar power systems in site buildings, procuring renewable energy from power utilities, and utilizing renewable energy certificates.\n\nIn order to accelerate the utilization of renewable energy, in 2018, Sony became a member of RE100*. Sony\u2019s goal is to source 100% renewable electricity for its worldwide operations by 2040. Since joining the RE100 initiative, Sony has installed approximately 7.3 MW worth of new solar power equipment at various sites. It now operates a total of about 7.97 MW of solar power equipment, including systems already installed before joining RE100.\n\n* Renewable energy includes solar, wind, water, geothermal, and biomass. This is energy that comes from sustainable sources.\n\n* RE100 is a global initiative led by the non-profit The Climate Group in partnership with CDP in which participating companies set a goal of procuring 100% renewable electricity for power used in their global business operations.\n\nNews Releases: Sony Joins the Global Initiative RE100 in Pursuit of Operating with 100% Renewable Electricity\nMajor Sony sites that have installed solar power equipment\n\n- Japan\n  - Green Cycle\n    - Capacity: 0.28 MW\n  - Sony Europe\n    - UK Technology Centre\n      - Capacity: 0.25 MW\n  - Sony DADC Europe\n    - Thalgauf Plant\n      - Capacity: 0.84 MW\n  - Sony Technology (Thailand)\n    - Chonburi Factory\n      - Capacity: 1.8 MW\n\n- USA\n  - Sony Pictures Entertainment Studio\n    - Capacity: 1.8 MW\n\n- Japan\n  - Sony Music Solutions\n    - JARED Oigawa Center\n      - Capacity: 1.7 MW\n  - Sony Customer Service (Japan)\n    - Togane Technology Site\n      - Capacity: 0.20 MW\n  - Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing\n    - Kumamoto Technology Center\n      - Capacity: 1.1 MW\n\nIn fiscal 2019, the total amount of CO\u2082 emissions reduced by using renewable energy at Sony worldwide was approximately 89,000 tons. By region, renewable energy input breaks down to 58,000 tons in Japan and East Asia, 20,000 tons in North America, 10,000 tons in Europe, and 1,000 tons in Pan Asia. Of the electricity used at Sony worldwide, electricity generated by renewable energy accounted for approximately 5%. The cumulative total of CO\u2082 emissions reduced by using renewable energy since fiscal 2016 is 327,000 tons.\n\nJapan: Increasing the Utilization of Renewable Energy\n\n- First Intracompany Electricity Transfer Service in Japan using a Megawatt-class Solar Power System\n  Sony has begun using the surplus power generated by the megawatt-class solar power system installed at one of its sites to supply power to another Sony site. The first case involves Sony Music Solutions (SMS), where a solar system of about 1.7 MW has been installed on the roof of the JARED Oigawa Center to provide electricity for the building. The surplus power not consumed by the building is transferred to the SMS Shizuoka Production Center via power company lines. As a result, SMS will be able to consume all the power it generates, and expects to reduce its CO\u2082 emissions by about 1,000 tons per year.\n\nMore information about the intracompany electricity transfer service at SMS\n\n- Utilizing Various Forms of Renewable Energy\n  In fiscal 2019, in Japan, Sony used Green Power Certificates* that amounted to 8,394 MWh of green electricity and 181,210 GJ of green heat, equivalent to approximately 14,996 tons of CO\u2082 emissions. Sony also used other renewable energy credits in addition to Green Power Certificates, which were equivalent to approximately 37,620 tons of CO\u2082 emissions. In addition, since fiscal 2017, Sony has been seeking power company contracts to directly purchase renewable electricity. In fiscal 2019, a new manufacturing facility of Sony Taiyo Corporation in Oita Prefecture signed a contract with Kyushu Electric Power Co., Inc. to ensure that 100% of its purchased electricity comes from renewable energy. Using this kind of renewable energy contract with power companies across Japan Sony saved an equivalent of 3,526 tons of CO\u2082 emissions.\n  Sony is also promoting the installation of solar power equipment at its sites. Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Kumamoto Technology Center installed a 1.1 MW solar power system, which it has been operating it since 2019. The equipment generated about 1,240 MWh of electricity in fiscal 2019.\n\n* The Green Power Certification System was jointly developed in 2001 by Sony and power utilities. The scheme issues green certificates representing the environmental value of electricity, heat and other renewable energy generated by power plants across Japan. Entities can purchase and trade these green power and green heat certificates. They are considered equivalent to purchasing renewable energy, even if generated at a distant location.\nEurope: Continuously using 100% Renewable Electricity\n\nIn Europe, Sony has been using renewable electricity since 2002. From fiscal 2008 onward, 100% renewable electricity usage had been achieved by Sony sites* in Europe through the onsite photovoltaic power generation, through the direct purchase of electricity generated from renewable sources, and through the purchase of Renewable Electricity Certificates if direct purchase or onsite generation of renewable electricity is not possible. In fiscal 2019, Sony used a total of approximately 40,492 MWh of renewable electricity in Europe.\n\nThe Sony UK Technology Centre (UK TEC) and the Thalgau Plant of Sony DADC Europe in Austria are examples of Sony sites that have installed large-scale solar power systems to generate their own power. UK TEC generated about 225 MWh of electricity in fiscal 2019 with 897 solar panels installed on the company\u2019s building. The Thalgau Plant installed 2,700 solar panels (about 0.84 MW) in August 2019, and produced 360 MWh of electricity by the end of 2019. Its remaining electrical needs are being met through the purchase of renewable energy certificates, thereby realizing 100% renewable energy usage.\n\n*1 Sony sites in Europe that have obtained ISO 14001 certification\n\nNorth America: Promoting the Use of Renewable Energy by Various Regional Group Companies\n\nBeginning April 2008, four of Sony\u2019s sites in the United States\u2014the Pitman (at the time) and Terre Haute plants of Sony DADC U.S. Inc., the New York office of Sony Corporation of America (SCA) and the San Diego office of Sony Electronics Inc. (SEL)\u2014signed Renewable Energy Certificate contracts. Subsequently, the scope of purchases were expanded to cover additional sites, and in fiscal 2019 Green Power Certification purchased by the Sony Group covered more than 45,800 MWh of electricity in the United States at the following sites: Sony DADC\u2019s Terre Haute plant; Sony DADC\u2019s Bolingbrook distribution center; the New York office of SCA; Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (SPE), and major facilities of SEL. This is enough green power to meet an estimated 49% of these entities\u2019 electricity use in the United States.\n\nIn addition, the SPE headquarters installed a new 1.6 MW solar power system in fiscal 2019. This brings the company\u2019s total solar capacity up to 1.83 MW, covering about 8% of the electricity used by all the SPE film studios. In fiscal 2019, approximately 550 MWh of electricity was provided by the company\u2019s own solar power equipment.\n\nPan Asia: Solar Energy System Deployed in Thailand\n\nIn the Pan Asia region, the Chonburi Factory of Sony Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (STT-C) began operating a large 1.8 MW solar energy system on its factory roof in 2019. This system generated about 2,264 MWh in fiscal 2019. STT-C is also pursuing energy-saving measures throughout the plant in order to reduce energy use.\nReducing Waste Generation\n\nAbsolute Waste Amount at Sony Sites\n\nSony implements a variety of measures to reduce waste and use resources more effectively in line with its targets to achieve an absolute reduction in waste amount at Sony sites of 5% from the fiscal 2015 level. In fiscal 2019, absolute waste amount of Sony sites was approximately 48 thousand tons. This was down approximately 20% from the fiscal 2015 and 1% fiscal 2018 levels, respectively. Sony reuses the used packaging materials when shipping parts\u2014a major component of waste generated by manufacturing sites\u2014and pursues reuse and recycling throughout the Sony Group.\n\nWaste at Sites\n\n(Thousand tons)\n\n| Fiscal | Japan/East Asia | North America | Europe | Latin America | Mainland China and Hong Kong Region | Pan Asia | North America | Japan/East Asia*1 |\n|-------|----------------|---------------|--------|---------------|-------------------------------------|---------|---------------|------------------|\n| 15    | 60             | 50            | 55     | 49            | 48                                  | 57      | 19            | 18               |\n\n*1 Japan, South Korea and Taiwan Region\n\nLandfilled Waste Rate for Sony Sites\n\nIn fiscal 2019, the landfilled waste rate for all Sony Group sites was approximately 0.7%. The rate for sites in Japan was 0.2%. However, the landfilled waste rate for Sony sites became approximately 2% when the calculation includes waste that Sony is required by law or ordinance to dispose by landfills. Sony strives to reduce the rate of waste disposed in landfills by recycling wastes generated by sites.\n\nManagement of Industrial Waste\n\nSony takes precautions to ensure waste from its sites is not inappropriately disposed of. For example, in Japan Sony has set consistent internal standards for selecting waste disposal contractors and inspecting disposal sites on an ongoing basis. It has also established an internal system of accreditation for disposal site inspectors, and is stepping up efforts to minimize risks associated with contracting out waste disposal. To reinforce this system, Sony implements periodic on-site inspections in the waste disposal contractors, thereby ensuring rigorous management procedures.\n\nExample of Waste Reduction\n\nAll Sony Group sites are making efforts to cut down on waste. Sony EMCS Penang Tec has taken the initiative to recycle scrap wood left over from the manufacture of speaker cabinets. In the past, wooden planks were disposed as landfilled waste because the vinyl sheets attached to the wood made them difficult to recycle. After trying various measures in collaboration with the local government and waste treatment firms, the company found a way to recycle wood waste without separating the vinyl sheets. This led to a reduction in the amount of waste disposed in landfills and improved the production plant\u2019s overall recycling rate. In addition, other types of production wood wastes are now also recyclable under this project.\n\nImproving Component Packaging\n\nAt all of its sites, Sony works to reduce the amount of waste through overall reviews of the packaging used in components and the optimization of this packaging. For example, a range of measures are employed to reduce the amount of materials used in component packaging materials and hence curb the amount of waste. These include the complete elimination of protective bags for components, modifications to increase the capacity of containers used to store components, and the switch from disposable containers to multi-use returnable boxes. In particular, Sony is working to standardize the sizes of, and materials used in, returnable containers while aiming to expand the range of items for which such containers are used.\n\nReducing the Environmental Impact of Logistics\n\nReturnable container used to transport components at Sony Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation\n\nSony EMCS Penang Tec made it possible to recycle scrap wood from speaker cabinets\nReducing Water Consumption\n\nWater Consumption at Sony Sites\nUnder the Green Management 2020 mid-term environmental targets, Sony is working to reduce the consumption of water at its sites in line with its target of achieving an absolute reduction of 5%, compared with the fiscal 2015 level, by fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2019, Sony sites used approximately 15.3 million m\u00b3 of water, increases of approximately 24% and 12% compared with the fiscal 2015 and 2018 levels, respectively. The primary cause was attributable to an increase in semiconductor device production volumes. Sony also takes steps to ensure the quality of wastewater at its sites. In addition to observing related laws and regulations in each of the countries and territories in which it operates, Sony manages wastewater quality using stricter criteria than is required. For example, the introduction of sophisticated water treatment facilities has enabled it to reduce BOD and COD levels*1 in wastewater.\n\n*1 Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels are common measures of water pollution.\n\nWater Consumption at Sites\n\n![Water Consumption Chart]\n\nProper Water Management to Protect the Local Environment\nAvailable water resources vary greatly in terms of quantity and quality, depending upon the region. In manufacturing, it is necessary to consider water resources from the perspective of securing enough water for production while maintaining good stakeholder relations. Sony uses water risk assessment tools provided by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to perform water risk assessments for the regions where Sony sites are located. Sony is working to ensure proper use of water by promoting activities that reflect the water risks in each region. Sites that use large quantities of water are working to reduce their water use and make it more effective, while minimizing the impact of wastewater discharge on the surrounding environment.\n\nReducing Water Use at Manufacturing Sites\nFor semiconductor and consumer electronic products, vast amounts of water are needed not only in the manufacturing process but also in the recycling process. At its plants all over the world, Sony is taking a variety of measures to preserve local water resources, including wastewater, recycling and initiatives for reducing water consumption. Examples of these initiatives are described below.\n\n- Increasing Semiconductor Production while Reducing Water Usage\nAs the image sensor business continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturing sites throughout Japan are increasing their production capacities. Consequently, Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation is working toward reducing the amount of water it uses for this production. As a reduction example, the Nagasaki Technology Center is working to reuse wastewater from gas detoxifying equipment used in the semiconductor manufacturing process, and is reusing about 80% of the wastewater. The Kumamoto Technology Center (Kumamoto TEC) is aiming to reduce water usage for combustion treatment to remove exhaust gas emitted from the semiconductor production lines. To do this, they have enhanced the equipment to increase the proportion of recycled water, thereby lowering the amount of fresh water needed by about 45%. In addition, in order to help preserve the abundant aquifer in the Kumamoto region, Kumamoto TEC has for many years been conducting \u201cgroundwater recharge\u201d efforts. This involves flooding fallow fields with river water that slowly permeates into the water table. In fiscal 2019, approximately 2.46 million m\u00b3 water usage was recharged.\n\nKumamoto TEC\u2019s facility for recovery of water used for gas combustion treatment\n- Reducing Water Usage in Various Ways\nThe Sony Group is making effective use of water resources through various methods, such as the use of river water and treated wastewater, along with the collection and use of rainwater, thereby reducing the amount of water intake required. One example of a water-saving organization is Green Cycle Corporation, a Sony Group company that engages in the recycling of waste home appliances and other products. The company began harvesting rainwater in fiscal 2014 in an effort to reduce its water use. Rainwater was initially tested to confirm that it would not affect the recycling processes and now it is used in the recycling processes that involve crushing machine (and etc.) as well as the water for cleaning in toilet. In 2018, when the company renovated its warehouse, it also redesigned the entire 2,500 m\u00b2 rooftop to serve as rainwater collection area, replacing the existing 80 m\u00b3 underground rainwater storage tank. As a result, 1,361 m\u00b3 of rainwater was collected in fiscal 2019, and rainwater made up about 35% of the plant\u2019s total water consumption. In addition, the Sony headquarters building uses treated wastewater to cool its heating equipment. By using water treated at the nearby Shibaura Water Reclamation Center to cool heating equipment, the amount of clean water normally used to replenish the water in the cooling towers has been reduced by approximately 25,000 m\u00b3 per year.\n\nManaging Chemical Substances\nThe Sony Group has developed a group-wide approach to the management of chemical substances used at sites where the use of these chemicals is controlled by legislation, designated as having a potentially harmful impact on the environment, or used in large quantities.\n\nReinforcing Standards for Managing Chemical Substances\nUnder the Green Management 2020 environmental mid-term targets, chemical substances are categorized into four classes. Sony carefully manages and reduces the amount transferred as air, water, or soil emissions and waste. In countries where no legal reporting requirements exist for chemical management, Sony sites apply standards based on Japan\u2019s Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) as internal rules. Chemical substances are classified as follows:\n\n| Class 1 substances | Prohibit use |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| The substances regarded as having a serious impact on the human body or environment (carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, toxicity for reproduction, acute toxicity, ecotoxicity, etc.) which are prohibited to be produced or used under international treaties or individual countries\u2019 regulations |\n| The substances considered to have a high risk of environmental pollution such as soil contamination |\n\nList of Chemical Substances Registered as Class 1 (Prohibition of Use) in Site Operation by the Sony Group. [PDF:92KB]\n\n| Class 2 substances | Prohibit use (Exemptions granted for certain applications) |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| The substances regarded as having a serious impact on the human body or environment (carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, toxicity for reproduction, acute toxicity, ecotoxicity, etc.) which are subject to regulations that require their registration or to monitor the amounts released and transferred because they are of high risk. |\n| The substances recognized as needed to be eliminated because they are regarded as high risk in their management after considering the trend of regulations or the social circumstances. |\n\n| Class 3 substances | Reduce the amounts released and transferred |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| The substances having a serious impact on the human body or environment, which are subject to regulations requiring monitoring of the amounts released and transferred. |\n| The substances which are recognized as needed to be reduced in the amount of release and transfer after considering the trend of regulations or the social circumstances. |\n| Volatile organic compounds (VOC) other than Classes 1 and 2 |\n\n| Class 4 substances | Comply with the relevant laws and regulations and use under appropriate control |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The substances not classified as Class 1, 2, or 3. |\n| Note that water and air are not required to be managed as chemical substances. |\nEfforts to Reduce Atmospheric Emissions of VOCs\n\nSony is working to achieve its targets for reducing the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released into the air by 50% from the fiscal 2000 level. VOC emissions into the air were approximately 566 tons in fiscal 2019, 69% lower than fiscal 2000 levels and down 4% from fiscal 2018. At its semiconductor fabrication facilities, which are the main source of VOC emissions, Sony is replacing VOCs with alternative substances and reducing VOC use in manufacturing processes. Sony has also been developing compact VOC treatment systems, and it is steadily installing them.\n\nRelease of VOCs into the Air\n\nExample of Reduction in Chemical Substance Usage\n\nSony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (SCK) collaborated with an equipment manufacturer to develop a proprietary volatile organic compound (VOC) treatment system as part of efforts to reduce the amount of VOCs released. Conventional VOC treatment systems are installed near ventilation duct outlets. Since such equipment is designed to treat extremely rarefied organic substances, it is very large, making space and cost constraints an issue for semiconductor plants that want to install these types of systems. SCK responded by focusing on production equipment for highly concentrated organic substance and developed a small, fixed condensing-type VOC treatment system in conjunction with an equipment manufacturer. The newly developed system can be installed near production equipment and is able to treat VOCs efficiently.\n\nOzone-Depleting Substances\n\nSony succeeded in completely eliminating first-generation chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from its manufacturing processes in 1993 and banned the use of second-generation hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) at the end of fiscal 2000. Sony business sites currently prohibit the use of ozone-depleting substances stipulated under the Montreal Protocol. Sony uses CFCs as a refrigerant in some air-conditioning units only. Compliance with laws and regulations in each country is ensured, and strict care is taken to prevent leakage of CFCs from these units during maintenance.\n\nEnvironmental Risk Management at Sony Sites\n\nTo carry out effective risk management of chemical substances and emergency responses, the Sony Group has enacted the Sony Group Standards for Site Environmental Risk Management, which set the management standard and give examples of improvement measures. Based on these standards, at each site Sony has implemented accident prevention measures, including prohibiting the burial of tanks for chemical substances and pipes, and various leak prevention measures. In addition, Sony rigorously works to prevent environmental accidents through ongoing improvements to its systems based on regular audits at each site, information sharing among sites and other initiatives. Sony has established a system whereby its sites are required to promptly report environmental accidents to the authorities and to take appropriate countermeasures. No such accidents were reported at any of Sony\u2019s sites in fiscal 2019.\nResponse to Soil and Groundwater Contamination\n\nIn the event that an incident of soil or groundwater contamination is identified at a Sony site in a voluntary check or other assessment, remediation processes are implemented in compliance with pertinent local laws and ordinances. For example, Sony Group companies in Japan deal with the occurrence of contamination of soil and groundwater at Group sites by taking steps in line with the Sony Group Standard for Assessing Soil and Groundwater, an internal document that sets out procedures that comply with Japanese laws and ordinances. This manual stipulates that issues be addressed through the following three phases:\n\n**Phase 1:** Investigate past and present chemical use and confirm the existence or otherwise of used or unused underground tanks, buried piping, other similar equipment, or previous incidents, at the site. Perform an inspection of the site to ascertain whether there is any residual soil or groundwater contamination.\n\n**Phase 2:** Based on the investigations undertaken in Phase 1, carry out an assessment of the areas that are potentially contaminated. Undertake measurements at these locations in line with the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act.\n\n**Phase 3:** If any contamination is identified based on these results, carry out prevention and remediation procedures.\n\nIncidents of soil and groundwater contamination resulting from operations have been confirmed at Sony Group sites, as shown below. In response, Sony has been remediating the contamination and submitting regular reports to authorities.\n\n### Progress of Soil and Groundwater Remediation\n\n| Site | Date Contamination Confirmed | Substance(s) Detected | Cause | Response/Current Status |\n|------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|\n| Sony Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation\u2019s Inazawa Site (Japan) | June 2001 (Result of voluntary assessment) | Fluorine | Leak from crack in drainage pipe | The site has discontinued use of the equipment that caused the contamination, removed the contamination, and is monitoring groundwater. Analysis conducted in fiscal 2019 found a groundwater concentration of 1.14 mg per liter, compared with a standard value of 0.8 mg per liter. |\n| Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Nagasaki Technology Center (Japan) | July 2019 (Result of assessment based on Article 3 of Soil Contamination Countermeasures) | Fluorine and its compounds | Leakage due to overflow in wastewater system | Based on results reported to the government, the site has been designated as an \u201carea that poses no risk of damage to human health.\u201d The conclusion is that despite soil contamination having been confirmed within the site, there is no likelihood of contamination into neighboring sites, based on the condition of water veins and wells adjacent to the site. A soil boring survey to confirm the scope of the contamination has been completed, and the contaminated soil is being systematically removed. |\n### Guiding Principles for Biodiversity Conservation Initiatives and Case Examples\n\n#### Guiding Principles for Conservation Initiatives\n\nSony has established a Basic Policy on Biodiversity Conservation, pledging its commitment to help achieve the twenty Aichi Biodiversity Targets by conserving natural capital and biodiversity through the entire product life cycle. Sony business sites are intricately connected with the natural environment and ecosystems that surround them. In light of this, Sony is focused on helping to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets by promoting activities to protect biodiversity in these regions and further afield. Sony introduced its Green Star Program in fiscal 2011 as an internal framework for assessing the green performance of business sites and advancing green measures, and categorizes biodiversity considerations and initiatives as outlined below. Sony also communicates with employees about the importance of pursuing initiatives under the Green Star Program as a way to help achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, working to build a shared recognition of the significance of these initiatives that will encourage action.\n\n> Policy on Biodiversity\n\n[Link to Aichi Biodiversity Targets at the Convention on Biological Diversity website]\n\n---\n\n#### Biodiversity Considerations/Initiatives and Associated Aichi Biodiversity Targets\n\n| Measures | Main Associated Aichi Targets |\n|----------|-------------------------------|\n| **Education and awareness** | Target 1 Awareness increased: Focus on raising awareness of the value of biodiversity and protective measures |\n| \u25cf Conduct education, seminars, and lectures concerning biodiversity | |\n| \u25cf Conduct nature observation programs | |\n| **Improve ecosystems** | Target 5 Habitat loss halved or reduced: Cut the loss of natural habitats, including forests, to at least half; significantly reduce degradation and fragmentation |\n| \u25cf Improvement of environment for living things | |\n| \u25cf Give consideration to ecological network and green corridor | |\n| \u25cf Give consideration to three-dimensional vegetation | |\n| \u25cf Adoption of local species | |\n| **Measures against negative impact** | Target 10 Pressures on vulnerable ecosystems reduced: Protect coral reefs and other ecosystems that are particularly susceptible to environmental changes |\n| \u25cf Measures against alien species | |\n| \u25cf Give consideration to bad effects on ecosystems caused by emissions | |\n| **Protection and conservation of ecosystem services** | Target 8 Pollution reduced: Control contamination from chemical substances, fertilizers and pesticides to within parameters that are not harmful |\n| \u25cf Grasp and conserve endangered species | |\n| \u25cf Conserve a wildlife sanctuary | |\n| \u25cf Groundwater recharge | |\n| **Management** | Target 9 Invasive alien species prevented and controlled: Control or eradicate invasive alien species |\n| \u25cf Ensure the appropriate management and use of chemical substances | |\n| \u25cf Ensure the effective use of organic resources | |\n| \u25cf Promote procurement that leads to biodiversity | |\n| **Cooperation with stakeholders** | Target 11 Protected areas increased and improved: Protect at least 17% of terrestrial areas and 10% of marine areas |\n| \u25cf Cooperation with stakeholders | |\n| \u25cf Support for organizations that engage in biodiversity conservation activities | |\n| **Investigation** | Target 14 Ecosystems and essential services safeguarded: Restore and safeguard ecosystems that provide natural abundance |\n| \u25cf Monitor living things | |\n| \u25cf Give consideration to the ecological services related to site and business | |\n| \u25cf Grasp status of land use | |\n| \u25cf Give consideration to local biodiversity preservation plans | |\n| **Associated targets depend on focus of activities** | |\n| **Target 19 Knowledge improved, shared and applied: Improve related knowledge, science and technology** | |\nEducation and Awareness\nPromoting initiatives for biodiversity conservation starts with getting people in diverse positions to better recognize and understand the value of biodiversity. With the understanding that awareness leads to conservation, Sony engages in a broad range of biodiversity education and awareness initiatives including organizing nature walks, biodiversity-themed photo contests, environmental education for students, and art competitions, as well as using social media to raise biodiversity awareness. These initiatives will enable Sony to help achieve Target 1 \u201cAwareness increased\u201d of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\n\n- Wow! Wow! Biodiversity Project\nTogether with the Nature Conservation Society of Japan, Sony launched the Wow! Wow! Biodiversity Project in fiscal 2015, as a platform for organizing nature appreciation events, holding photo contests for the general public and spreading awareness of biodiversity through social media. In fiscal 2016, Sony China joined this project and is conducting similar awareness-raising activities in various cities across China. The annual photo contests have become popular in both Japan and China. Through the submission of photos, the splendor of nature and the importance of biodiversity are conveyed to more and more people. About 6,000 entries were submitted to the Chinese photo contests from 2016 to 2019, and they were shared through social media with approximately 330,000 people, including Sony Group employees in China and their friends. In addition to holding exhibitions of the winning photo entries in Japan and China, the project has been providing other opportunities for the public to think about the importance of biodiversity, through activities such as biodiversity lectures and photographing living organisms workshops using Sony cameras.\n\n- Improve Ecosystems\nSony\u2019s business sites endeavor to protect biodiversity through conservation of the environment that provides a habitat where local species can hide and lay their eggs. Business sites carry out various activities intended to preserve the environment in consideration of local ecosystems, from planting local varieties of trees and composting fallen leaves and trimmings to installing birdhouses and constructing ponds and waterways. These initiatives are enabling Sony to help achieve Targets 5 \u201cHabitat loss halved or reduced\u201d and 10 \u201cPressures on vulnerable ecosystems reduced\u201d of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\n\n- Conservation Activities in Sony Forest to Promote a Richer Ecosystem\nSince its inception in 1972, the Kohda Site of Sony Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation in Japan has protected a natural woodland on its site, naming it \u201cSony Forest.\u201d In 2008, Sony began creating an owl-friendly environment in the forest by building spaces for owls to fly and feed, and by installing nest boxes. Then, in 2011, the Kohda Site began carrying out activities to secure and share seedlings of native species, necessary for regeneration of the local ecosystem. It has been promoting this through collaboration with local government, residents, and companies. In recognition of these activities, Sony Forest was certified by the Japan Committee for the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity as the sixth exemplary project in 2015.\n\n- Volunteers Work to Protect Nature Reserve in the UK\nFor more than a decade, employees of Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe (SIEE) have been volunteering with the Vinters Valley Nature Reserve, an area run by the local community in Maidstone in the United Kingdom. In 2019, under the guidance of the nature reserve manager, a team of SIEE volunteers removed alien fauna and flora from the protected meadows to enhance local biodiversity. SIEE volunteers have also been working to support native insects and honeybees by sowing flowers and by making log pyramid homes for stag beetles.\n- Other initiatives\n\nOld Growth Conservation Efforts in Kunisaki City, Oita Prefecture\nParticipation in Project to Plant 10,000 Trees at Kirishima City\nSony India supports \u201cTrees for Life\u201d \u2013 an agro forestry project\nPromoting Forest Management Activity at So-net Forest (only in Japanese)\n\nMeasures Against Negative Impact\n\nThe Sony Group has been taking measures to remove non-native species that negatively affect local ecosystems. Furthermore, Sony Group\u2019s sites limit the harmful effects on local ecosystems by using only appropriate amount of pesticides and chemical fertilizers at their green spaces in order to prevent soil pollution and the buildup of excessive nutrients in the soil. Since August 2019, Sony has also been addressing ocean pollution issue caused by plastic waste through the One Blue Ocean Project. The project focuses on reducing plastics, such as \u201creducing virgin plastic in products and product packaging and internally reducing single-use plastics (plastic shopping bags, straws, etc.) used by employees\u201d and \u201caddressing pollution by cleaning up rivers, beaches and communities near Sony business sites.\u201d These initiatives are enabling Sony to achieve Targets B, \u201cpollution reduced,\u201d 9, \u201cinvasive alien species prevented and controlled,\u201d and 12, \u201cextinction prevented,\u201d of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\n\n- Removal of Invasive Species in Yamagata Prefecture\n\nLocated in Tsuruoka City, Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation\u2019s Yamagata Technology Center (Yamagata TEC) is participating in the removal of invasive species from the local Miyakozawa wetland. This wetland extends to the edge of Oyama Shimoike Pond, designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. It is a valuable ecosystem home to various native species. In recent years, however, invasive species such as the Procambarus clarkii and a Solidago altissima have become a problem. Therefore, each year under the guidance of the Tsuruoka city government and local organizations, Yamagata TEC employees participate in activities such as the removal of invasive plants and the targeted capture of crayfish, while protecting medaka, a native fish species in Japan.\n\n- Biodiversity Event Focusing on Bees in Sweden\n\nSony Mobile Communications Corporation (SOMC) has been holding events at its development site in Sweden, as part of efforts to protect dwindling wild bee populations. In fiscal 2019, SOMC encouraged not only its own employees and their families, but also those from nearby companies to participate. The recent event included an awareness campaign on the importance of bees as pollinators, designed to draw attention to the current crisis and the need for their protection. Specifically, participants were asked to set up \u201cbee hotels\u201d for wild bees in their home gardens, to grow flowers such as dandelions for bees, and to set up bee drinking stations. SOMC also held a charity sale of office equipment and donated the proceeds to the local nature conservation society.\n\n- Other initiatives\n\nRestoration activities of rivers in UK\nVolunteer activity in Wuxi, China, for collecting litter\nCleanup activity in Vietnam to reduce plastic in the ocean\nCleanup activities across China to reduce plastic in the ocean\n\nProtection and Conservation of Ecosystem Services\n\nSony is working to conserve ecosystem services through activities such as groundwater recharging, identifying and protecting threatened species, and protecting wildlife and flora. These initiatives are enabling Sony to help achieve Targets 11, \u201cProtected areas increased and improved,\u201d and 14, \u201cEcosystems and essential services safeguarded,\u201d of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\n\n- Other initiatives\n\nProtecting Spawning Grounds of the Endangered Loggerhead Turtle in Japan (Movie)\nEnvironmental protection activity in New York\nEnvironmental improvement activities of \u201cThe Home of Firefly\u201d (only in Japanese)\nCoral conservation activity in Nagasaki Prefecture\nManagement\nSony works to ensure that chemical substances are properly managed; organic resources are effectively utilized, including composting fallen leaves; and the items it procures have been produced with biodiversity in mind. These initiatives will enable Sony to help achieve Target 4 \u201cSustainable consumption and production\u201d of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\n\n- Environmentally Preferable Paper Purchasing\nRecognizing that paper resources are finite, Sony strives to use paper in an environmentally responsible manner, and it has established a related purchasing policy for paper and printed materials. Accordingly, Sony makes a point of purchasing environmentally preferable paper, such as recycled paper and forest-certified paper.\n\n> Policy on Paper Resources\n\nCooperation with Stakeholders\nWith a view to make its initiatives to protect biodiversity even more effective, the Sony Group seeks the opinions of related experts, NGOs, and other stakeholders while carrying out environmental conservation activities. For example, Sony works with research organizations when conducting studies and nature conservation groups when becoming involved in conservation activities. It also cooperates with governments and NGOs when maintaining the natural environment. In addition, Sony provides support and assistance to organizations involved in protecting biodiversity.\n\n- Initiatives\n  - Participating in the Forest Conservation Project in Sumatra\n  - Participating in Panama\u2019s Biodiversity Event Festi Harpia 2019\n\nInvestigation\nAs part of their environmental conservation activities, various Sony sites survey the natural habitats located on their grounds and in the surrounding areas by monitoring and fixed-point observations. They then reflect the results of these studies in conservation plans, allowing them to carry out activities in consideration of the local ecosystem. The disclosure of the survey results will enable Sony to help achieve Target 19 \u201cknowledge improved, shared and applied\u201d of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\n\nThe Green Star Program\nIn fiscal 2011, Sony launched the Green Star Program, an in-house system for assessing the environmental performance of Sony Group sites worldwide. Under the program\u2014one of several initiatives designed to ensure achievement of the ultimate goal of Sony\u2019s \u201cRoad to Zero\u201d global environmental plan\u2014each site\u2019s activities are evaluated comprehensively through quantitative and qualitative assessments from four key perspectives: climate change, resource conservation, chemical substance management and biodiversity conservation. The achievement levels are indicated by number of stars. Implementation of the Green Star Program shows how well each site is performing and elucidates their strengths and weaknesses, thus indicating what needs to be done next. The program is useful as a tool for ongoing efforts to make improvements.\n\nSony\u2019s Green Management 2020 environmental mid-term targets run through fiscal 2020. Sony has been working to achieve them under updated evaluation standards since fiscal 2016. Progress against the mid-term environmental targets is indicated by up to as many as seven stars.\n\nExample of qualitative assessment criteria\n\n| Climate change | Monitor and analyze energy use with an appropriate monitoring system; adopt highly efficient systems and equipment for effective operation; and promote activities to improve energy savings in the manufacturing process |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Waste          | Reduce generated waste; promote resource recovery and recycling; and ensure proper management of waste disposal contractors |\n| Water          | Monitor and analyze water use; take steps to promote the efficient use of water and reduce water consumption, etc. |\n| Chemical substances | Properly manage handling of chemical substances; monitor and analyze handling amount and amount released and transferred; and reduce volume used and replace with alternative substances |\n| Biodiversity   | Implement biodiversity conservation plans that give consideration to the characteristics of regional ecosystems; promote land use and green space management that take the importance of biodiversity into account |\nLogistics\n\nResults for Environmental Impact Reduction in Logistics\n\nCO\u2082 Emissions from Transport of Finished Products\n\nSony has set a goal to reduce absolute CO\u2082 emissions related to logistics between nations and within regions by 10% (compared with fiscal 2013) by fiscal 2020. To achieve the goal, Sony is working to reduce transport weight by making products smaller and lighter, while optimizing transportation efficiency and switching to transportation methods that have a low impact on the environment. CO\u2082 emissions generated by product transportation (both international and intraregional transportation*) in fiscal 2019 was approximately 143 thousand tons, an approximate 64% reduction from fiscal 2013 and an approximate 24% reduction from fiscal 2018. These results are due to switching to low-emission modes of transport and shortening transportation routes, as well as increased load efficiency achieved by downsizing product packaging and improving component packaging, in addition to change in shipping volume.\n\n* Some countries and regions are excluded from \u201cintraregional transportation.\u201d\n\nCO\u2082 Emissions from Product Transportation\n\n(Thousand t-CO\u2082)\n\n| Fiscal | 2013 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | Target |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|------|--------|\n|        | 396  | 224  | 199  | 189  | 143  | 356    |\n\nNote: Corrected emission amount of fiscal 2016\n\nReducing the Environmental Impact of Logistics\n\nSony is reducing energy consumption from transport and packaging materials in all aspects of logistics, from international freight transport to the movement of goods at business sites. Discussed here are just a few of the ways in which Sony is reducing the environmental impact of logistics.\n\nPromoting Modal Shift\n\nAs a part of its efforts to reduce environmental impact from the transport of finished goods, Sony promotes modal shift, switching the modes of transport it uses from air to sea and from truck to railroad.\n\n- Modal Shift Outside Japan\n\nSony\u2019s efforts to advance modal shift also include transport in markets outside Japan. In Brazil, Sony has been switching from air and truck transport to marine transport for freight destined for Sao Paulo shipped out of the Manaus Plant of Sony Brasil Ltda. Since fiscal 2015, nearly all freight over this route has been shipped by marine transport, significantly reducing CO\u2082 emissions from transport.\n\nSony Electronics Inc. (SEL) in the United States has optimized the use of rail transport for product shipments from the West Coast to reduce CO\u2082 emissions generated during transport. SEL has also increased loading efficiency reducing number of shipments. In addition, SEL has participated in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s SmartWay program and has used environmentally responsible logistic partners.\n- Modal Shift in Japan\nIn Japan, Sony has promoted modal shift from truck to rail transport. For large-sized products in particular, such as BRAVIA\u2122 LCD/OLED TVs, Sony proactively uses railroad, which accounts for more than 15% of all long-distance (500km or more) domestic transport. Recognizing these efforts, since 2011, Sony has been certified by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism as a certified company in the \u201cEco Rail Mark\u201d system, while BRAVIA LCD/OLED TVs have earned product certification. Sony also promotes domestic sea transport. In fiscal 2019, CO\u2082 emissions attributable to the transport of products in Japan were approximately 283 tons lower than would have been the case if products had been transported by truck.\n\n![Logo indicating Eco Rail Mark certification for businesses](image)\n\nImproving Transport Efficiency with Joint Delivery and Milk Runs\nEfficient transport realized by maximizing loading volume per truck reduces environmental impact. Sony seeks to improve transport efficiency by utilizing joint delivery with other companies and milk runs.*1 Sony has been using joint delivery by truck in some regions of Japan. In China, Sony has been improving transport efficiency, which helps to reduce CO\u2082 emissions, using a combination of transport solutions such as milk runs*1 and round trips.\n\n![The shape of the shipping boxes was changed to optimally suit the products being shipped](image)\n\nPromoting the Use of Reusable Bands for Products and Parts Transport in Manufacturing Sites and Warehouses\nTo keep stacked cartons from collapsing during transport of products and parts in manufacturing sites and warehouses, Sony employs reusable bands as one of packaging materials. This has contributed to the reduction of use and disposal of packaging materials such as stretch films.\n\n![A reusable band in use](image)\n\n*1 In a milk run, a truck follows a route to collect parts from several suppliers, thereby improving transport efficiency compared with the routing method of separate runs to each supplier.\n\nRaising Transport Efficiency by Improving Shipping Boxes\nAt Sony DADC US Inc., warehousing, packaging, returns processing and distribution of assorted media had previously used regulation size boxes. Space inside the boxes was often left unused depending on the shipment size and number of orders. Cushioning material was also needed inside the empty spaces to protect the goods during transport, which resulted in additional expenditures for materials. In response to these circumstances, the Bolingbrook Distribution Center improved the boxes by redesigning them into a shape optimally suited for the size and amount of products to be shipped. Ultimately, the Distribution Center eliminated the wasted space in the boxes, increased the rate of products shipped, and substantially improved transport efficiency. The initiative also helped to reduce the amount of cushioning material used.\nProduct Recycling\n\nProduct Recycling Policy and Performance\n\nSony\u2019s Product Recycling Policy\nSony subscribes to the principle of individual producer responsibility (IPR), that is, the idea that a producer bears responsibility for its products over their entire life cycle. Accordingly, Sony is focused on recycling-oriented product design, collection and recycling used products, and building global recycling systems that suit the needs of individual countries and regions. Sony recognizes its social responsibility as a manufacturer to deal with its used products and actively promotes product collection and recycling, and complies with recycling laws and regulations in countries and regions around the world.\n\nProduct Recycling Initiatives\nIn the treatment of used products, Sony complies with recycling laws and regulations in countries and regions around the world, including Japan\u2019s Home Appliance Recycling Law, the EU\u2019s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive), state recycling laws on waste electrical and electronic equipment in the US, China\u2019s Management Regulations for Recycling and Disposing of Consumer Electronics and Electronic Waste, and India\u2019s recycling laws on electronic waste.\n\nSony\u2019s Recycling Record\nIn fiscal 2019, Sony collected approximately 75 thousand tons of end-of-life products (as of July 2020). Sony\u2019s overall take-back volume fell in fiscal 2015 due to the decrease of collection points in North America. However, the take-back volume increased in Europe in fiscal 2016, and since then the overall volume has been steady.\n\nImproving Product Recyclability\n\nWorking with the Sony Group\u2019s Specialized Recycling Company\nAs one of its strategies for resource efficiency, Sony works to increase the recyclability of its products. When examining various related measures, Sony receives feedback from Green Cycle Corporation, a Sony Group company specializing in the recycling business. Green Cycle Corporation presents ideas and proposals for improvements to Sony headquarters departments with environmental responsibilities, including how to make it easier to disassemble products and separate materials, based on the expertise it has gained through recycling used electronic products and personal computers. Practical measures incorporating those ideas are then drawn up and submitted to design departments for each product category. Meanwhile, Sony supports the efforts of Green Cycle Corporation to improve its recycling technologies while sharing the latest information on product manufacturing.\n\nGreen Cycle Corporation also offers plant tours allowing ordinary customers to witness the significance of electronic product recycling.\n\nInformation for Green Cycle plant tour (only in Japanese)\nResults of Green Cycle plant tour\n\nHolding Workshops on TV Recycling\nSony has been regularly holding workshops on TV recycling since 2006 at Green Cycle Corporation. Its product designers, mechanical designers and other employees in various positions participate. The workshops aim to reaffirm the importance of and need for considering recyclability in product designs, and to ensure those ideas are later applied when creating products. During the workshops, the participants first observe a television disassembly line onsite, and then try to take apart an LCD television themselves. Afterwards, line managers at Green Cycle Corporation explain current challenges and needs, and then exchange ideas with the participants in a discussion. Participants then apply what they have learned when designing products that will be sold worldwide, with a first-hand understanding of the difficult work of disassembling products and ways to make it easier, as well as an appreciation of the importance of reusing materials that have been separated from used products.\nRecycling Activities in Japan\n\nSony recycles televisions and personal computers in line with applicable recycling-related laws in Japan. Sony also bears the cost of recycling lithium-ion batteries and other small rechargeable batteries, as well as packaging materials, as required by law.\n\nRecycling of Television Sets\n\nJapan\u2019s Home Appliance Recycling Law, which came into effect in April 2001, initially covered four major home appliances: televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners. In April 2009, the law was revised to also cover LCD and plasma televisions and clothes dryers. Among applicable products, Sony manufactures televisions* (CRT, LCD and plasma models). The Home Appliance Recycling Law requires consumers to pay collection, transport and recycling fees when disposing of applicable home appliances, retailers to take back such appliances and return them to manufacturers, and manufacturers to recycle these appliances.\n\nSony has established a nationwide cooperative recycling network with four other manufacturers. As a consequence, Sony-manufactured televisions are now recycled at 15 recycling plants across Japan. One of these plants is operated by Green Cycle Corporation, which manages a recycling business as a Sony Group company.\n\nAt these recycling plants, TVs are manually disassembled, and the parts are crushed and sorted using various equipment. Materials such as iron, copper, aluminum, and plastic are then separated out and sold to businesses that produce raw materials, making them available for reuse. In addition, certain harmful substances such as lead and mercury found in some older products and parts are removed and disposed of properly in accordance with the law.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Sony recycled approximately 156,000 CRT televisions and 325,000 flat-screen televisions. The Home Appliance Recycling Law obliges manufacturers to maintain recycling rates of at least 55% for CRT televisions and at least 74% for flat-screen televisions. Sony has consistently exceeded these rates since fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2019, the recycling rate for Sony-manufactured CRT televisions was 74%, while for Sony-manufactured flat-screen televisions it was 87%.\n\nRecycling of Personal Computers\n\nAlthough Sony sold off its personal computer business in July 2014, it is collecting and recycling its PC products in Japan that are no longer used by households and businesses, including long-time corporate users, in accordance with Japan\u2019s Act on the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources. Items being recycled are desktop PC units, notebook PCs, CRT displays, and LCDs.\n\nThe many used computers made by Sony are being recycled with close attention to information security, with hard drives being physically destroyed in a dedicated work space at Green Cycle Corporation. In fiscal 2019, Sony collected and recycled a total of approximately 26,000 units, for a total weight of approximately 168.7 tons.

A full music studio was recently added to the Tech Center, allowing visitors to record and produce their own music.\n\nOver 50 Sony employee volunteers are involved in mentoring the students each year, covering topics such as photography, videography and editing. In 2019, the Center welcomed hundreds of visitors and cultivated a robust social media presence that showcases the technology, students and volunteers.\n\n* KOOV\u2122 is an all-in-one coding, robotics and design kit that combines digital coding with physical building to foster the next generation of innovators.\n\nEstablishment of Sony Global Relief Fund for COVID-19\n\nIn April 2020, Sony established the Sony Global Relief Fund for COVID-19, a 100 million USD fund (equivalent to approx. 10.8 billion yen) to support those around the world affected by the COVID-19 virus. With this fund, Sony provides assistance in three main areas: medical, educational, and for the creative community.\n\nIn terms of medical support, the fund provided donations to support health workers treating COVID-19 and organizations on the frontline of response efforts, as well as assistance delivered in collaboration with M3 Inc. and the production and donation of medical face shields.\n\nIn the area of education, the fund provides educational programming kits and other types of assistance that leverage Sony technology to support children who are currently losing learning opportunities as a result of school closures.\n\nFinally, to support the creative community, which includes those working in the music, movie and gaming industries, the fund works with Sony entertainment companies to support artists, creators, and game developers who have been severely affected by the cancellation of concerts and interrupted production of film, television programs, and other content.\n\nBoys & Girls Club of San Marcos\n\nSony Global Relief Fund for COVID-19\nDisaster Relief and Humanitarian Aid\n\nSony provides humanitarian aid in response to large-scale disasters and emergency crises around the world, taking into account the degree of urgency and its relationship with the region.\n\nSony Group Disaster Relief\n\nIn fiscal 2019, the Sony Group made monetary donations to assist areas and victims affected by natural disasters and humanitarian crises, as listed below.\n\n| Date disaster occurred | Incident | Amount of donation (yen, approx.) | Recipient |\n|------------------------|----------|----------------------------------|-----------|\n| February 2020          | COVID-19 virus* | 47.5 million | \u2022 Embassy of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Japan  \n\u2022 China Charity Federation  \n\u2022 Zhong Nanshan Medical Foundation  \n\u2022 Xinwu District, Wuxi |\n| January 2020           | Bushfires in Australia | 5.2 million | \u2022 Save the Children  \n\u2022 Australian Red Cross, etc. |\n| January 2020           | Floods in Indonesia | 1 million | \u2022 Save the Children |\n| October 2019           | Typhoon Hagibis (Typhoon No.19) | 45 million | \u2022 Central Community Chest of Japan  \n\u2022 Save the Children  \n\u2022 Japanese Red Cross Society |\n\n*1 In April 2020, Sony established the Sony Global Relief Fund for COVID-19\n\nOctober 2019 Typhoon Hagibis Assistance\n\nThe Sony Group provided approximately 45 million yen worth of assistance to support the regions and people affected by Typhoon Hagibis. These funds include donations from Sony Group employees in Japan, Sony corporate donations to match funds raised by employees, financial donations to the victims, and contributions from the Emergency Disaster and Recovery Fund for Children, which is co-operated by Save the Children and Sony. Additional donations include financial donations made by Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd., matching funds for proceeds raised through So-net point reward programs operated by Sony Network Communications Inc., and donations of TVs and other products to affected regions. In addition, funds were also raised at a family concert held in November 2019 by the Sony Brass Band organized by Sony Group employees. Panels illustrating humanitarian activities by Save the Children and Sony were displayed at the concert, drawing attendees\u2019 attention to disaster relief efforts.\n\nEmergency Disaster and Recovery Fund for Children\n\nIn 2016, Sony, in partnership with Save the Children, co-established the Emergency Disaster and Recovery Fund for Children, which provides immediate support upon the sudden onset of natural disasters or humanitarian crises as well as medium-to-long-term recovery support to children. The fund pools a certain amount of funds at all times, which enables a rapid response to crises around the world by making monetary disbursements to Save the Children\u2019s relief activities. The funds are used to deploy everyday goods and hygiene kits, to create Child Friendly Spaces, which are safe and secure settings for children to play and spend time in, and to provide training in Psychological First Aid for Children, an approach used to reduce the initial distress of children exposed to crisis situations.\n\nSupporting Children\u2019s Mental Health and Providing Psychosocial Support in Times of Emergencies\n\nIn 2013, Save the Children developed an approach called Psychological First Aid for Child Practitioners (PFA for Children), based on the \u201cPsychological First Aid: A Guide for Field Workers\u201d manuals issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners. PFA for Children is designed to reduce the initial distress of children caused by accidents, natural disasters and conflicts according to their stage of cognitive development. Since 2014, Sony has been supporting Save the Children\u2019s training programs and public awareness activities, aiming to ensure that PFA for Children can be utilized by anyone when disasters occur to provide psychosocial support for children. Save the Children conducted the training 53 times in 2019, with a total of 10,891 participants from 2014 to the end of March 2020.\nRaising Awareness Through Sports\nAs a new approach to raising awareness on social issues through sports, the field hockey teams Sony HC BRAVIA Ladies and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Orange United, in partnership with Save the Children, held a game at the Prince Takamado Hockey Japan League 2019 as \u201cSony-GSK Save the Children Charity Match.\u201d The purpose of the charity match was to raise awareness on the importance of supporting children through hockey and to expand the support for these activities. Sony, GSK, and Save the Children set up a joint booth at the match and exhibited panels to show an overview of their support for children. The event also included an interactive hockey space for children and fundraising activities. A portion of the money raised was donated to the Emergency Disaster and Recovery Fund for Children, which is jointly operated by Save the Children and Sony and is used for disaster relief activities in Japan and other countries.\n\nVolunteer Systems for Employees\n\nEmployee Participation in Social Contribution Initiatives\nSony uses a three-step approach to engage its employees in social contribution initiatives: raising awareness of social issues, encouraging volunteering, and leveraging job skills.\n\nEmployee Participation in Social Contribution Initiatives\n\n- Programs\n  - Sony Science Program (instructors/staff)\n  - Career-oriented classes (instructors)\n  - Volunteer work in areas affected by natural disasters\n  - Community cleanup and greening programs\n  - Donations for emergency humanitarian assistance\n  - South Africa Mobile Library Project\n  - e-learning\n    - Sustainability Forum\n    - In-house newsletter\n\nVolunteer Work by Employees in Social Contribution Initiatives\nIn fiscal 2019, a total of approximately 69,000 Sony Group employees*1 participated in volunteer initiatives. Employees at Sony sites served as instructors and staff members for Sony Science Program workshops and also volunteered in the Kando Experience Program.\n\n*1 Cumulative participants in fundraising initiatives, blood drives and other activities.\n\nLeave for Volunteering Purposes\nTo support employee participation in volunteering activities, Sony Corporation has an employee volunteer support system, making it easier for employees to participate in these activities by allowing them to use accumulated holidays for initiatives requiring extended leaves of absence. Employees participate as volunteers in educational support activities and disaster relief activities.\n\nCharitable Donation Systems for Employees\nSony has introduced several measures to encourage employees to make contributions toward emergency relief and other worthy causes, including matching gift programs. In addition to disaster relief, Sony employees raise funds at events related to supporting refugees and solving environmental issues and provide support to non-profits and other organizations.\n\nRelated Information\nOrganizational Structure\n### Datasheet\n\n#### Corporate Governance\n\n| Item | Scope | Unit | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|------|-------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Composition of Sony Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors*1 | Sony Corporation | Total | Persons | 12 | 13 | 12 |\n| | | Outside Directors | Persons | 9 | 10 | 9 |\n| | | Women | Persons | 2 (16.7%) | 4 (30.7%) | 4 (33.3%) |\n| | | Non-Japanese Nationals | Persons | 2 (16.7%) | 3 (23%) | 4 (33.3%) |\n| Composition of Sony Corporation executives*1*2 | Sony Corporation | Total | Persons | 41 (1)*1 | 41 (2)*1 | 42 (2)*1 |\n| | | Women | Persons | 2 (4.9%) | 3 (7.3%) | 3 (7.1%) |\n| | | Non-Japanese Nationals | Persons | 5 (12.2%) | 5 (12.2%) | 6 (14.3%) |\n\n*1 As of end of August for each year\n*2 Chairman, Vice Chairman, President, Executive Deputy Presidents, Senior Executive Vice Presidents, Executive Vice Presidents, and Senior Vice Presidents.\n*3 Number in parentheses refers to the number of people who concurrently serve as director.\n\n#### Ethics and Compliance\n\n| Item | Scope | Unit | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |\n|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of reports to Sony Ethics & Compliance Hotline | Sony Group | Reports | Approx. 300 | Approx. 400 | Approx. 440 |\n\n#### Respect for Human Rights\n\n| Item | Scope | Unit | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |\n|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| Percentage of employees participating in human rights-related e-learning course | Sony Corporation and Group companies in Japan | % | 90% | 90% | 90% |\n\n#### Employees\n\n| Item | Scope*1 | Unit | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |\n|------|---------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of employees | Sony Group | Total | Persons | 117,300 | 114,400 | 111,700 |\n| | | Regular employees | Persons | -

Data\n\nCollection Period:\nApril 1, 2019-March 31, 2020\n\nIn principle, data for results was compiled in the period stated above. Estimates have been used, however, at some sites where the impact on overall results is deemed to be extremely minor.\n\nScope of Data Collection\n\nSite data: All ISO 14001-certified sites as of March 31, 2020\nAmong Sony Group consolidated sites, all manufacturing sites, distribution sites with 100 or more employees, and non-manufacturing sites with 1,000 or more employees are, in principle, expected to obtain ISO 14001 certification.\n\nProduct data: Data covers all products manufactured by the Sony Group and sold outside the Group. Accessories, semi-manufactured products and components are included. Weight data includes the weight of packaging materials.\n\nData Accuracy\n\nSite data: Chemical substance data and environmental cost data collected from certain sites may be slightly less accurate than other data.\n\nProduct data: Data for some semi-manufactured products, components, and some products produced and sold overseas may be slightly less accurate than other data.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Related Data Collection Methods and Rationale\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions from Sites\nQuantity of power, heat, and fuel usage and quantity of greenhouse gases used for manufacturing process, within facility and others are collected.\n\n- CO\u2082 emissions from energy consumption (energy-related)\nCO\u2082 emissions from energy consumption are calculated by multiplying the quantity of electrical power, heat and fuel (including fuel for motor vehicles, etc.) used at sites by the CO\u2082 conversion rate. For energy consumption using renewable energy including certificates, the CO\u2082 conversion rate is zero.\n\n- Emissions of PFCs and other greenhouse gases (non energy-related)\nEmissions of PFCs and other greenhouse gases are converted to CO\u2082 by multiplying greenhouse gas emissions from each site by global warming potentials. Global warming potentials are based on the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n- CO\u2082 conversion rates\n[Electricity]\nJapan: Rates for fiscal 2014 provided by the Federation of Electric Power Companies in Japan\nCountries other than Japan: Rates for 2013 provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA)\n\n[Fuel and Heat]\nWorldwide: Rates based on Japan\u2019s Law concerning the Promotion of the Measures to cope with Global Warming\n\nTotal CO\u2082 Emissions from Product Use\nCO\u2082 emissions from product use are calculated by multiplying the quantity of electrical power consumed throughout the lifetime of products sold in the current fiscal year by the CO\u2082 conversion rates. (In other words, it is not the actual quantity of CO\u2082 emitted in the current fiscal year.) CO\u2082 emissions from product use are calculated by the following equation.\n\nSales x (Operating power consumption x Hours of operation per year + Power consumption during standby time x Standby time per year) x Years of product use x CO\u2082 conversion rate\n\nIn theory, emissions during product use in the current fiscal year should be calculated from the total quantity of electrical power consumed by previously sold Sony products that are still in use by consumers in the current fiscal year. However, given the difficulty of determining how many previously sold Sony products are still in use by consumers of the total number of Sony products sold to date, Sony uses the total quantity of electrical power consumed while in use over the lifetime of Sony products sold in the current fiscal year for CO\u2082 emissions during use.\n\nThe hours of operation per year, standby time per year, and years of product use are calculated based on data obtained by various surveys. In Japan, Sony uses the 2014 CO\u2082 conversion rate provided by the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan. Outside of Japan, it uses the 2013 country-specific CO\u2082 conversion rates provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n**CO\u2082 Emissions from Logistics**\n\nTotal CO\u2082 emissions from logistics include emissions arising from international logistics and logistics within over 40 countries and regions such as Japan, the United States, Europe, and Asia associated with Sony Group\u2019s electronics products. For logistics within Japan, CO\u2082 emissions from parts logistics are partially included.\n\nCO\u2082 emissions from logistics are primarily calculated by multiplying ton-kilometers transported (weight of goods transported x distance traveled) by the CO\u2082 conversion rate. In certain instances, CO\u2082 emissions arising from transport by truck are calculated by multiplying the amount of fuel used (fuel consumption per kilometer x number of kilometers traveled) by the CO\u2082 conversion rate. For international transport by ship, the calculation uses the weight of goods transported including the weight of shipping containers.\n\nFor international transport, the CO\u2082 conversion rate used to calculate CO\u2082 emissions is based on the emissions intensity supplied by the GHG Protocol. For regional transport, priority is given to using the rate supplied by the region or country. For Japanese domestic transport by truck, CO\u2082 emissions calculations multiply the weight of freight transported by two factors: the amount of fuel used per unit of freight transported, as defined in the Law concerning the Rational Use of Energy, and the emissions factor of fuel type used, as defined by the Law concerning the Promotion of Measures to Cope with Global Warming. For transport in the United States, Sony uses the emissions rate supplied by the SmartWay Transport Partnership, which is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n**CO\u2082 Emissions from Employee Business Trips**\n\nEmissions are calculated for business trips undertaken by employees in central departments, which account for the largest share of business trips taken by employees of Sony Corporation and Sony Group Electronics Business companies in Japan, Europe and North America and for business trips taken by employees from some electronics-related companies in Asia. (In the case of Japan and North America, some music-related companies are included.) CO\u2082 emissions are calculated by multiplying the distance traveled by the number of employees traveling using the basic unit of output by class type proposed by the GHG Protocol.\n\n**Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Using Renewable Energy**\n\nSony\u2019s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy include using electrical power produced from renewable energy sources, purchasing electrical power produced from renewable energy sources, and purchasing green energy certificates and other carbon offset credits. The greenhouse gas emissions reduction achieved by using renewable energy is calculated by multiplying the renewable energy used by the CO\u2082 conversion rate.\n\n---\n\n**Overview of Calculation for Scope 3 Emissions**\n\n| Category | Overview of Calculation |\n|----------|-------------------------|\n| Category 1 | Purchased goods and services |\n| Category 2 | Capital goods |\n| Category 3 | Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in scope 1 or scope 2) |\n| Category 4 | Upstream transportation and distribution |\n| Category 5 | Waste generated in operations |\n| Category 6 | Business travel |\n| Category 7 | Employee commuting |\n| Category 8 | Upstream leased assets |\n| Category 9 | Downstream transportation and distribution |\n| Category 10 | Processing of sold products |\n| Category 11 | Use of sold products |\n| Category 12 | End-of-life treatment of sold products |\n| Category 13 | Downstream leased assets |\n| Category 14 | Franchises |\n| Category 15 | Investments |\n\nEmissions associated with raw materials and parts for use in electronics products sold by and the goods purchased by the Sony Group, from the extraction of resources through to production, as well as emissions related to certain data center use.\n\nEmissions associated with the production of capital goods invested in by the Sony Group.\n\nEmissions associated with procurement of fuels and energy consumed by Sony Group sites.\n\nEmissions associated with the transportation and storage of electronics products sold by the Sony Group and purchased parts.\n\nEmissions associated with the treatment and disposal of waste generated by Sony Group sites.\n\nEmissions associated with travel (by air) for business purposes by Sony Group electronics group companies employees, mainly in Japan, Europe, and North America.\n\nEmissions associated with employees\u2019 commutes from their homes to their workplace.\n\nNot applicable (accounted for in other categories)\n\nEmissions associated with the distribution of electronics products sold by the Sony Group from retailers to consumers.\n\nEmissions associated with the assumed post-sale third-party processing of electronics products sold by the Sony Group.\n\nEmissions associated with the consumption of electricity over their lifetime by electronics products sold by the Sony Group.\n\nEmissions associated with the assumed end-of-life recycling or disposal of electronics products sold by the Sony Group.\n\nNot applicable\n\nEmissions associated with the business activities of companies in which the Sony Group has invested.\nResource Related Data Collection Methods and Rationale\n\nVolume of Waste Generated at Sites\nTotal volume of industrial waste and non-industrial waste.\n\nVolume of Water Consumption/Discharged\n- The volume of water consumption represents the total volume of water used at sites (municipal water, industrial water, well water); for municipal water and industrial water, purchase volume is substituted for the purpose of calculation.\n- The volume of water discharged represents the sum of discharges of water to rivers and to sewerage. For Sony sites where it is not possible to accurately grasp actual discharge volume, a calculation based on the volume of water used x average per-site rate for volume of water discharged is substituted.\n\nProduct Resource Input\nTotal volume of resources used in products, accessories, manuals and packaging materials. Total weight of products shipped is used as a substitute.\n\nVolume of Reused/Recycled Materials\nTotal volume of reused/recycled materials and vegetable-based plastics used for products, accessories, manuals and packaging.\n\nVolume of Resource Recovery from End-of-Life Products\nVolume of products collected from recycling multiplied by the reused/recycled ratio.\nVolume of products collected from recycling is the weight of recycled products in Japan/East Asia, Europe, North America, Pan Asia, and Latin America. Some amounts calculated based on the recycling expenses are included. The reused/recycled ratio is the volume reused/recycled compared with the total volume collected. The amount of collected end-of-life products is substituted under the current situation.\n\nOther Data Collection Methods and Rationale\n\nVolume of Chemical Substances Handled/Emitted\nClass 3 and Class 4 chemical substances for which the amount handled annually is 100kg (Class3) /1,000kg (Class4) or more are subject to reporting.\n- The volume of chemical substances handled represents the volume of chemical substances used at sites; purchase volume is substituted when exact volume of usage cannot be determined.\n- Volume of chemical substances released from sites in relation to their operation; calculations are based on purchase volume x distribution coefficient.\n\nEmissions of Water Pollutants (BOD, COD)\nConcentrations in water emitted x volume of water emitted. Sites that are requested by law and/or by other demands such as contracts are subjected to this data collection.\n\nEmissions of Air Pollutants (NOx, SOx)\nVolume calculated by multiplying emission volume by emission concentration. Sites that are requested by law and/or by other demands such as contracts are subjected to this data collection.\nIndependent Assurance Statement\n\nPurpose and Scope of Verification\n\nSony has obtained third-party verification since fiscal 2001 to ensure the credibility of data reported and facilitate the ongoing improvement of its environmental management.
