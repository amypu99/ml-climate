That is our aspiration at JBS. This is what drives us on to overcome challenges and make a difference in the world. In 2020, facing unprecedented challenges we put people and the planet first, as the actions and initiatives we describe in this Sustainability Report show.\n\nSustainability is the foundation of our business strategy, and this focus led us to the achievements we will present in the following pages. A solid foundation on which it was possible, in 2021, to make our most significant commitment: to be Net Zero by 2040. We are going to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by reducing direct and indirect emission intensities, while offsetting residual emissions.\n\nIt is a bold target, but we are certain it is achievable. We are going to invest US$ 1 billion over the next ten years in initiatives to achieve this objective, of which US$ 100 million will go to scientific research in the search for new solutions.\n\nThis new commitment reflects our trajectory and the fast and excellent way in which we operate. Every day, from breakfast to dinner, millions of families consume food produced by JBS around the globe. Throughout 2020, our global brands innovated to respond to and anticipate the changes in consumption, offering a diversified portfolio of products for the demands that arose in a rapidly transforming world.\n\nThe pandemic has been a massive demonstration of the resilience of our company and our entire global\nSustainability is the foundation of our business strategy. A solid foundation on which it was possible, in 2021, to make our most significant commitment: to be Net Zero by 2040.\n\nWe weathered a year like 2020 thanks to our people, our culture and our capacity to innovate. These have allowed JBS to operate in an excellent manner, growing, responding to new standards of consumption, setting ourselves apart and presenting consistent results year after year for our team members, clients, consumers, shareholders, investors and the community. Because a company will only truly prosper when the community where it is located prospers.\n\nGilberto Tomazoni\nGlobal CEO\nThe year 2020 will be remembered as the one when more than ever before we had to overcome challenges and take on enormous responsibilities. At JBS, day in, day out, we demonstrated our mission of feeding the world with the best there is. We took care of our people, so that we could not only put food on the tables of millions of consumers, but also continue to grow through innovation, responding quickly to new demands and, as always, guided by the essence of our business strategy: sustainability, in every sense of the word.\n\nWhen the whole world was trying to adapt to the radical transformations caused by the pandemic, our global teams leapt into action to understand the change in consumer habits and adapt our portfolio. This was possible thanks to our simple and flexible way of working, with each business enjoying extensive autonomy in its market. Our agility ensured that our clients received the products they needed, while we were looking after all our stakeholders.\n\nBut this was only possible because, from the outset, our priority lay in protecting our team members from COVID-19 through investments amounting to R$ 2.8 billion, to adopt strict measures that remain in force to this day around the world.\n\nWhy sustainability guides our business\nThere was also clear sense of urgency in supporting the communities where we are located. We rolled out an unprecedented social responsibility program, the highlights being Hometown Strong, in North America, and Good Deeds Are Good, in Brazil, investing a total of R$ 700 million in actions that bequeath a legacy to hundreds of cities, especially where healthcare is concerned. The following pages will provide you with details about this program, of which we are very proud.\n\nThe strength of our operations, assured by caring for people and the planet, enabled us to maintain the pace of our investments, continuing to grow organically and with room for new acquisitions that made sense for our business.\n\nAt the same time, the data we are presenting in this report, especially the historical volume of R$ 5 billion invested in sustainability actions, unequivocally demonstrate our responsibility to the planet and to future generations. This was what drove us to assume the commitment to be Net Zero by 2040. This is an ambitious target, especially bearing in mind that we were the first global company in the food sector to assume something of this nature.\n\nThe Company\u2019s track record on environmental issues is very clear, as the content of our sustainability reports over the years demonstrates. Take the beef cattle supply chain, for example. JBS has for 10 years maintained a policy of zero tolerance of illegal deforestation, monitoring its suppliers using advanced technology to ensure respect for this and other socioenvironmental criteria. In 2020, we rolled out the Transparent Livestock Farming Platform, a blockchain technology tool that extends socioenvironmental monitoring to the suppliers of our suppliers. As the implementation of this platform advances, by 2025 we will have guaranteed zero illegal deforestation in our entire production chain in every Brazilian biome where we operate: the Amazon, the Cerrado (Savannah), the Pantanal Wetlands, Mata Atl\u00e2ntica (the Atlantic Forest) and the Caatinga (semi-arid region) \u2013 something also unprecedented within the sector.\n\nLast year, we also created the JBS Fund for the Amazon dedicated to supporting and financing initiatives aimed at the sustainable development of the Amazon Biome. We are going to invest at least R$ 250 million in the first five years, with the target of reaching a total of R$ 1 billion with contributions from partners. Six projects are already under way.\n\nThe year was also one of progress in the governance pillar. Since 2020, our Board of Directors has a majority of independent members, with women currently representing 20%. In addition, our Audit Committee became statutory last year.\n\nYear after year, we have evolved in Compliance, with a well-structured area that has made JBS a benchmark in the market and worldwide. We have ensured a legitimate commitment to independence on this issue by having the area report directly to the Board of Directors. Today, we have seven Ethics Committees around the world, able to monitor the risks and opportunities for the future of the Company. Training, which now includes conflict of interest and antitrust issues, has been given to 100% of our team members, and is now being extended to contractors who are part of our value chain.\n\nAll these initiatives and investments on the social, environmental and governance fronts demonstrate our clear understanding that the perpetuity of our business depends on us being increasingly sustainable for all our stakeholders, including society.\n\nJeremiah O\u2019Callaghan\nChairman of the Board of Directors\nWith 250,000 team members driven by the purpose of feeding the world with the best there is, JBS takes excellence and innovation, every day, to many countries, through its products and services.\n\nFrom the origin to the consumer\u2019s table, JBS\u2019 care goes beyond quality, food safety and economic-financial performance. Today, its entire strategy is designed based on the best sustainability practices so that its actions generate positive impacts for team members, suppliers, customers, society and the planet.\n\nReaffirming this commitment, JBS presents in its 2020 Sustainability Report the main actions on production, distribution and sale of its products in the various countries where it is present \u2013 Australia, Brazil, Canada, United States, Mexico, New Zealand and countries in Europe. GRI 102-45\n\nThe purpose of this document is to report on how the Company conducts business and carries out its mission of ensuring the best products and services for customers, a relationship of trust with our suppliers, profitability for our shareholders and the opportunity for a better future for all of our team members. This is the tenth edition of this report. It follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: core option. The reporting structure is indexed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact. In order to increase transparency, for the first time, the Company has used the guidelines of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Integrated Report. GRI 102-45, 102-52\n\nIn line with its operations, JBS recognizes the importance of an open dialog with stakeholders across the many sectors of the production chain. That is why in 2019 it carried out a materiality process to revalidate its four priority topics: Animal welfare; Environmental stewardship; Product integrity; and Social responsibility (read more on Materiality). The document also gathers information on strategic solutions, quality, innovation, economy, productivity, competitiveness, sustainability and governance. GRI 102-46, 102-47\n\nThis report covers the activities of the companies from January 1st to December 31st, 2020, encompassing operations, business structure and responsible governance practices. GRI 102-50\n\nThe accounting results follow the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and audited by Grant Thornton. Brazilian production and environmental indicators (energy intensity - GRI 302-3; 305-1; 305-2; 305-4; 305-5 -, total water volume by source - GRI 303-1 and 303-3 - and effluents \u2013 GRI 303-2 and 306-1) were audited by SGS, the world\u2019s leading company in inspection, verification, testing and certification.

GRI 102-53\nThe responsible use of natural resources is a condition for the sustainability of our operations and is part of who we are. Our success depends on promoting a diet that allows people to live in balance with the planet.\n\nMeeting humanity\u2019s growing nutritional needs in a sustainable manner is a premise only not for our performance, but also for our entire business strategy.\n\nEstimates by the United Nations (UN) indicate that the global population is expected to exceed 10 billion people by 2050. Sharing of our limited natural resources among so many is a challenge that is already beginning to redefine human behavior and, as a consequence, our food choices. That is why we work to offer consumers options that meet their nutritional needs and ethical expectations.\n\nThis requires looking beyond our operations. From the supply of raw materials to the disposal of packaging, we monitor the impact of our operations throughout the entire value chain. We make it a priority to reduce the environmental impact of the production chain, ensure animal welfare, protect and contribute to the evolution of our team and build a legacy for society, inducing the socioeconomic development of the communities in which we operate.\n\nWe are agents of transformation. We innovate to transform the management of our waste into profitable businesses, combining the implementation of good environmental practices with the generation of jobs and income. In the Amazon, we support forest protection initiatives that promote the sustainable development of the local population.\n\nAs part of our social commitment, JBS pays attention to the needs of consumers and constantly innovates to provide them with an expanding broad product portfolio. Guided by innovation that meets health requirements, and combines nutrition and flavor, JBS\u2019s competitive differential is quality.\n\nBy connecting a purposeful business model to constant technological advances in the processing of animal and plant-based proteins, the Company offers consumers new food experiences.\n\nYear after year, the Company strengthens its core business with technological innovations, expansion of manufacturing units and acquisition of new businesses, in order to balance its financial health with the health of people and the planet.\n\nThe robust and transparent governance system we have built guarantees us the security of evolving in compliance with the highest international standards. With the full support and engagement of the leadership, JBS runs one of the largest compliance programs ever seen in a private company.\n\nThe goal of taking the lead in the food sector requires consecutive investments in production, distribution and marketing. And it demands that we also lead the world\u2019s efforts towards a more sustainable production model.\nJBS developed a materiality matrix that prioritizes sustainability topics for the Company and its stakeholders. In 2019, these topics were revised, after consultation with internal and external stakeholders, and grouped into four new pillars that best represent the Company\u2019s global challenges: product integrity, social responsibility, environmental stewardship, and animal welfare, with its policies and outcomes.\n\nTo create this new matrix, a series of interviews was held with Company leaders from around the world and selected customers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the United States and Europe over six months, based on the materiality process and studies updated in 2019. Based on this consensus-building methodology, items in the JBS materiality matrix are given equal weight and not prioritized. GRI 102-21, 102-40, 102-42, 102-43\n\nJBS manages sustainability in alignment with the international scenario and UN\u2019s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n### SUSTAINABILITY PRIORITIES\n\n| Topics                  | Subtopics                        | Related disclosures | SDG* |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|------|\n| **Product Integrity**   | Guarantee of origin              | 416-1, FP5, FP6, FP7 | 2    |\n|                         |                                  | 417-3, FP8          |      |\n|                         | Supplier relationship            | 308-1, 308-2        |      |\n| **Social responsibility** | Our people                      | 403-1, 403-2, 403-4, 403-5, 403-6, 403-7, 403-9, 403-10 | 1, 4, 8, 10 |\n|                         | Team Member health and safety    | 414-1, 414-2        | 13   |\n|                         | Community                        | 203-1, 203-2        | 15   |\n| **Environmental stewardship** | Water and wastewater management | 303-3, 303-4, 303-5 | 3, 6, 7 |\n|                         | Climate change                   | 305-1, 305-2, 305-3, 305-4, 305-5 | 11, 12, 13 |\n|                         | Energy                           | 302-1               |      |\n|                         | Waste and packaging              | 306-1, 306-2        | 15   |\n| **Animal welfare**      | Breeding                         | FP9, FP10, FP11, FP12 |      |\n|                         | Transportation                   |                     |      |\n|                         | Production                       |                     |      |\n\n* Sustainable Development Goals.\nJBS 2030 GLOBAL GOALS\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL**\n\n**GHG EMISSIONS**\n\n- **NET ZERO**\n  Achieve Net Zero GHG emissions by 2040\n\n- **30% REDUCTION**\n  in GHG emissions from scopes 1+2 and GHG emission intensity compared to a 2019 baseline\n\n- **US$ 100 MILLION**\n  invested in research and development projects to assist producers\u2019 efforts to strengthen and scale regenerative farming practices, including carbon capture and on-farm emissions mitigation technologies\n\n**RENEWABLE ENERGY**\n\n- **REACH 60%**\n  renewable electricity\n\n**WATER**\n\n- **15% REDUCTION**\n  in water use intensity compared to a 2019 baseline\n\n---\n\n* Greenhouse gases.\n\nFor further information access JBS website.\n30% IMPROVEMENT in the Global Safety Index compared to 2019-2020 average baseline\n\nCONTINUED PROVIDING life-changing educational and developmental opportunities for team members and their families\n\nCONTINUED INVESTMENT IN the towns where JBS operates, boosting team member, family, and community well-being\n\n30% IMPROVEMENT in the Global Safety Index compared to 2019-2020 average baseline\n\nCONTINUE to use the Ethics Line, a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool, to assist management and team members in working together to address fraud, abuse, and other misconduct in the workplace, with a focus on cultivating a positive work environment\n\nCONTINUE to advance compliance with all legal and regulatory obligations of the Company in all jurisdictions in which it does business, define and support a culture of ethical business conduct for the Company and its team members, and promote the Company\u2019s Mission and Values\n\n> Animal welfare\n> Community Engagement\n> Deforestation-free Supply Chains\n> Environment and Biodiversity\n> Food waste mitigation\n> Human Rights\n> Packaging and recycling\n> Team member Health and Safety\n> Responsible Raw Material Sourcing\n> Water use\n> Diversity and Inclusion\nESG HIGHLIGHTS\n\nJBS assumes a **global commitment** to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2040.\n\nIn the 3rd edition of the Coller FAIRR Protein Producer Index, JBS was ranked among the **top 10 global companies with the best performance**, and advanced 8 positions in the global ranking from 2019 to 2020.\n\nJBS was once again listed as part of the **Carbon Efficient B3 index portfolio** (ICO2 B3), which takes into account the Company\u2019s commitment to effectively manage its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nJBS recognized by CDP as the **best Brazilian company** in the Food, Beverage & Tobacco sector for its performance against Climate Change criteria.

We are also a reference in businesses linked to the Company\u2019s production chain, such as leather, biodiesel, collagen, personal hygiene and cleaning, natural packaging, solid waste management solutions, recycling, metal packaging and transport, among others. GRI 102-1, 102-2\n\nThe Company has more than 450 production units and commercial offices on five continents and in more than 20 countries, in addition to a workforce of approximately 250,000 team members \u2013 of which around 142,000 are in Brazil, where it is the largest employer. This structure is capable of serving around 275,000 customers in approximately 180 countries on five continents. GRI 102-6\n\nIts portfolio consists of dozens of globally recognized brands: Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, Swift, Just Bare, Seara, Moy Park, Primo, Friboi, Tulip, OZO. The Company includes the units JBS USA Beef, JBS USA Pork and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corporation (PPC), in addition to the two Brazilian operations, JBS Brasil (which consolidates the production of beef, leather and new businesses) and Seara. GRI 102-6\n\nOver the past 20 years, JBS has consolidated itself beyond Brazilian borders, through a global platform diversified by geography and product types. Today, revenue originating outside Brazil accounts for approximately 85% of JBS\u2019 consolidated revenue. With an acquisition strategy that included Swift, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, Swift Prepared Foods (formerly Plumrose) and Tulip Company, leading companies in their segments, among others, the Company has diversified and developed differentials to suit all consumer profiles, with high-value, innovative and quality products.\nThe robustness of its corporate governance processes is part of the commitments of JBS, a publicly traded company whose shares are traded on B3, the Brazilian stock exchange.

The results of the inventory are published annually on the CDP platform. JBS also monitors indicators representing the volume of water and electricity used by its operations in order to optimize production processes and gradually reduce consumption. To reduce the impacts of its operations and create opportunities, the Company has an annual plan to invest in environmental improvements aimed at optimizing use of natural resources, water and waste, energy, recycling and other issues.

Managed by an experienced, professional team with deep knowledge of the sector, the Company\u2019s premise is to serve markets with sustainable businesses capable of guaranteeing its leading role as a food Company. Its focus in the past recent years has been the acquisitions of established brands in relevant markets \u2013 such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Brazil \u2013 and the assembly of platforms capable of supplying customers and consumers in countries with growing demand for food, such as China and Southeast Asian countries.\n\nToday, JBS exports to around 180 countries, including fresh meat and high value-added prepared foods, meeting the needs of the most varied customer and consumer profiles, in addition to the most demanding markets in the world. Through brands such as Pilgrim\u2019s and Seara, for example, it invests in increasingly valued segments of plant-based, organic and healthy foods. Innovation is also key at JBS USA \u2013 in 2020, the startup Planterra Foods was created, which launched a vegetable protein used in the OZO brand product line, also launched by the Company. These efforts reflect JBS\u2019 strategic objective of serving consumers\u2019 needs with healthy, tasty and high-quality products.\n\n**M&A**\n\nIn 2020, acquisition movements were a high point in the United States, by the incorporation for the amount of US$ 238 million of Empire Packing, a company specialized in ready-to-eat products and owner of the retail brand Ledbetter, and, in Brazil with the purchase of Bunge\u2019s margarine and mayonnaise assets in Brazil, through Seara. With these movements, JBS strengthens its presence with higher value-added and branded products in the North American market and, in Brazil, it takes second place in the margarine market, with a 35.5% market share.\n\n**ESG COMMITMENT**\n\nJBS\u2019 business strategy is in direct dialogue with social, environmental and governance criteria \u2013 a journey initiated by the Company more than a decade ago, with significant investments in concrete actions throughout its value chain.\n\nThe Company invests around R$ 2 billion a year globally in sustainability issues. All these initiatives address JBS\u2019 constant need for transparency, control and accountability to the market regarding its sustainable practices in food production and purchase of animal protein.\n\nSome of the main points in 2020 are the acknowledgments related to ESG aspects (read more in ESG Highlights). In 2021, the JBS assumed important global commitments, such as: Net Zero, to achieve net zero emissions by 2040; and the launch abroad of a Sustainability Linked Bond, linked to the Company\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIt is also important to mention the transformation of the Sustainability Committee into the Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee, led by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, promoting the ESG agenda among the Company\u2019s senior management. JBS also manages its impacts considering external agendas, with emphasis on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations and the 2030 Agenda.\nIn the more than 20 countries in which JBS operates, food safety and quality standards are under the supervision of the Global Food Safety and Quality Assurance Department, headquartered in the United States. The implementation of global strategies and procedures is the responsibility of teams specialized in Food Safety and Quality in each business unit.\n\nAll of the Company\u2019s units operate in accordance with the guidelines of a robust food safety and quality program, which brings together standards of operational procedures for sanitation, hazard analysis and critical control points and the implementation of technologies capable of monitoring, preventing and adjusting non-conformities.\n\nThe units still follow additional programs of good manufacturing practices; recall, with pre- and post-trace capabilities to ensure that products and dates can be properly identified; certification of all livestock producers in compliance with local regulations and legislation; and annual certification pursuant to Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standards. The teams receive training in food safety and quality systems at the time of hiring and specific periodic training. In addition to regular internal audits, annual independent audits are carried out at all production units in Brazil, the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia, and 86% of the operations in Mexico.\n\nBy meeting the global premises of food quality and food safety, all Company units, regardless of country of origin, are committed to providing the best products and services to their customers and consumers. To do this, they base their business on 10 practices:\n\n1. Responsible marketing;\n2. Transparency of structure and responsibilities;\n3. Documented risk assessment;\n4. Training and qualification of the team;\n5. Certification audits;\n6. Robust traceability;\n7. Evaluation and development of suppliers;\n8. Incident investigation and corrective actions;\n9. Disclosure of quantitative indicators and targets;\n10. Customer surveys.\nIn 2020, global quality management achieved outstanding results such as in Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, which reduced non-compliance records (NRs) by 9%, complaints by 22% and critical complaints by 17%.\n\nIn Australia, Primo brand operations reduced the complaints rate by 27%, compared to 2019, and the result in food safety and regulation was 28% better compared to the previous year.\n\nWith a US$ 5 million investment in food safety, E. coli prevalence in 2020 reached the target of less than 0.05% in Canada.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, in a satisfaction survey ranking carried out with retailers in the Food Safety/Quality category, the Company was in 7th place in 2020, compared to the 10th position in 2019.\n\nIn 2020 there were no recalls involving Friboi, Seara or Swift products in Brazil.\nINNOVATION\n\nThe Global Innovation Team (GIT) promotes the sharing of experiences between the business units of the five continents where the Company operates, which favors the sharing of innovative practices.\n\nThrough continuous investments in research and cutting-edge technologies, the Company\u2019s innovative culture is present in the development of new products, in the monitoring of raw materials and in manufacturing operations.\n\nTo encourage teams and the exchange of experiences JBS created the Global Innovation Team (GIT) in 2018. In addition to leveraging JBS\u2019 competitive advantages, the GIT promotes the sharing of experiences between the business units of the five continents where the Company operates, which favors the sharing of innovative practices.\n\nThe Company also maintains the JBS Global Food Innovation Center, a partnership with Colorado State University (CSU). The center is a teaching and research unit aimed at improving food safety practices, meat sciences, animal welfare, developing education and training actions, and testing equipment.\n\nManagement tools also help assess the world\u2019s megatrends in food, such as reducing sodium and fat, serving smaller portions and offering special cuts, among others. JBS also created a methodology to monitor regional innovation processes and share the lessons learned globally, especially in the prepared food and brand value creation lines.\n\nINNOVATION PLATFORM\n\nFOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS:\nfoods that are easy to cook, making it easier to spend time with family and friends.\nExamples: Reis da Grelha (Mexico), Zap Wings (England), ready-to-eat and canned products Bordon and Seara Al Fresco (Brazil).\n\nHEALTHY PRODUCTS:\nfunctional products with high standards of traceability and low social and environmental impact.\nExamples: Just Bare and Naked Meats (USA) and Seara Nature (Brazil).\n\nINDULGENCE AND SENSES:\nhigh-quality foods that delight the senses and provide unique experiences.\nExamples: 1953 Friboi, Swift Black and Seara Gourmet (Brazil).\n\nPREPARE, COOK AND EAT:\nproducts that are quick and easy to make, with high nutritional performance.\nExamples: AdapTable (USA) and Pilgrim\u2019s (Mexico).\nIn 2020, global investments in innovation surpassed the **R$ 113.4 millions** mark.\n\n**Innovation in practice**\n\nInvestments in research and technology, together with monitoring changes in consumption profiles, make JBS a pioneer in the development of innovative foods. These are highlights of some countries:\n\n> **United States** \u2013 in 2020, the Company implemented the startup Planterra Foods and developed a portfolio of foods in the plant-based category, through the OZO brand. One of its differentials is the use of sources other than soy in the composition of the food, with results in more flavor and health compared to other products available on the market.\n\n> **Europe** \u2013 in the Moy Park operation, approximately US$ 2.9 million were invested in innovation and part of it was applied in several launches, such as the extension of the hamburger and meatball lines.\n\n> **Mexico** \u2013 with a strategy focused on overcoming the challenges of food consumption in 2020, the Mexican operations reduced the time for product development by one month, with 17 retail launches.\n\n> **Brazil** \u2013 Seara was the first large food company in the country to offer a complete line of 100% plant-based products \u2013 the Incr\u00edvel Seara line. Seara currently has more than ten plant-based products in its portfolio, with launches scheduled for 2021.\n\n> **Australia** \u2013 with an investment of US$ 3.9 million in R&D, among other innovations, the Australian operations increased the shelf life of 38 products by an average of 56%, reducing waste.\nCommitment to sustainability\n\nJBS has a mission to feed the world in equilibrium with the planet\n\nIN THIS CHAPTER\n> PRODUCT INTEGRITY\n> SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n> ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP\n> ANIMAL WELFARE\n> ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE\nCOMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3\n\nBy seeking to generate and share value with society in everything it does, JBS\u2019 commitment goes beyond guidelines for reducing and mitigating the effects inherent to production operations and food sales. With focus on long-term results, investments in policies, innovations and programs promote positive impacts on team members, suppliers, customers, consumers, the community and the environment.\n\nSustainability governance is established by the Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee. To guide its sustainability and ESG management actions, the Company adopts tools such as the materiality matrix \u2013 which prioritizes and defines key topics according to the vision of its stakeholders (read more on p. 70).\n\nMore than **R$ 5 billion** invested in sustainability worldwide in 2020\n\nSustainability priorities\n\nGRI 102-44, 102-47\n\n| Topics                        | Subtopics                                      |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Environmental stewardship    | Water and wastewater management                |\n|                               | Climate change                                 |\n|                               | Energy                                         |\n|                               | Waste management and packaging                 |\n| Product integrity            | Guarantee of origin                            |\n|                               | Supplier relationship                          |\n| Social responsibility        | Our people                                     |\n|                               | Team member health and safety                  |\n| Animal welfare               | Community                                      |\n|                               | Breeding                                       |\n|                               | Transportation                                 |\n|                               | Production                                     |\nProduct Integrity\n\nProduct integrity means respecting the highest food safety, quality and sustainability standards.\nAt JBS, product integrity means respecting the highest food safety, quality and sustainability standards. Therefore, the Company is committed to investing in enhancing operations, manufacturing and product supply, adopting social and environmental practices in its origin and certification of good practices, processes and routines by independent audits.\n\nThe Company is aware of its role as a benchmark in the value chain, which starts with the procurement of raw materials, which has a significant influence on the value chain, from raw material suppliers adopting good practices to the final quality of products. In this sense, JBS establishes a partnership relationship, encouraging and developing actions geared towards enhancing supplier management and practices, by working on two fronts: guarantee of origin and supplier relationships.\n\n**GUARANTEE OF ORIGIN**\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3\n\nThe acquisition of raw materials is based on the principles of responsible procurement, this means they are based not only on compliance with local regulations, but also in line with the most sustainable practices in the sector.\n\nIn Brazil, more than 90,000 livestock supplying farms are monitored every day, in the Amazon, Cerrado, Pantanal, Mata Atl\u00e2ntica and Caatinga biomes. The ranches are analyzed through satellite images, which prevents the purchase of animals raised in deforestation areas and indigenous lands protected by environmental laws.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, livestock suppliers must sign a statement indicating compliance with government regulations and animal welfare certification programs such as Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) or equivalent.\n\nIn Australia, a National Declaration of Suppliers (NVD) is required. In addition, before leaving the property where they were bred the animals must be identified with a device approved by the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS).\n\nThe origin quality of poultry is guaranteed by the partnership between the Company and producers, which includes the supply of all inputs, technical and veterinary support. As for pork, in addition to working together with producers, purchases meet all legal requirements of the country of origin.\n\n**ALLIES OF THE FOREST**\n\nAs part of the efforts to fight deforestation in Brazil, in 2020, JBS launched the Transparent Livestock Farming Platform to identify and monitor all links in the livestock supply chain by the end of 2025. Learn more in the chapter \"Transparent Livestock Farming Platform\", or on the website.\n\n**SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIP**\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3\n\nJBS understands that its relationship with suppliers is essential and relevant to the prosperity of the value chain. That is why the Company developed a series of actions to build closer relationships with its stakeholders that are based on confidence, respect, ethics and transparency.\n\nWith a regular dialog with its suppliers, especially in relation to matters related to respecting human rights and national and local labor laws, JBS has been a signatory of the National Pact to Eradicate Slave Labour since 2007, and has been a member of the Institute for the National Pact to Eradicate Slave Labour (InPACTO) since 2014.\n\n**116,000** beef, lamb, poultry and pork suppliers around the world GRI 102-9\nJBS practices and initiatives to play a leading role in the movement to promote a more diverse and inclusive society.\nJBS is an important employer in several countries, especially in Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Australia. Aware of the role it plays in communities, whether creating jobs directly or indirectly, or as a relevant social investor, the Company strives to produce a positive impact on the qualification of the labor market, on the generation of opportunities, on social projects and in sponsorships, according to the demand of each location.\n\n2020 was a challenging year for JBS given the scope of its social impact \u2013 from preserving the health of its team members to supporting the communities in which they live. JBS\u2019s focus was on adapting operations, understanding the needs of each country and investing in what was urgent and necessary to save lives.\n\nJBS maintains a global policy for the management, based on adherence to the organizational culture and the business mission.\n\nPresent in more than 20 countries on five continents with direct operations (manufacturing or administrative), JBS maintains a global policy for the management of approximately 250,000 team members, based on adherence to the organizational culture and the business mission.\n\nGRI 102-8\n\nThe diversity of ethnicity, culture, religion, languages and country of origin is a characteristic of the Company\u2019s workforce. In Europe alone, 89% are immigrants. In Brazil, the team includes team members from various countries, such as Senegal, Haiti and Venezuela, as well as traditional (indigenous) populations. In Canada, team members communicate in 100 languages and dialects. All foreign team members receive customized documents in their native language. In 2020, JBS employed more than 2,500 professionals from other countries. In 2020, JBS signed the Public Commitment for Racial Equity in Brazil, together with several companies in the consumer goods sector.\n\nIn addition to this scenario, typical of a global company, JBS is committed to hiring and promoting the development of professionals regardless of nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or age, and to encouraging the inclusion of people with disabilities.\n\nThe Human Resources area operates regionally, respecting local laws and regulations, with support from corporate HR and the global head of the area. In addition to working to attract talent, local programs encourage the professional growth of its team members. In Brazil, the Valued Youth and in-house Talents programs (Jovens de Valor and Talentos Internos) for example, are the drivers of this policy, as well as the JBS without Borders Program (Programa JBS sem Fronteiras), which takes professional deboners to Canada.\nAs part of our Hometown Strong initiative, JBS USA and Pilgrim\u2019s U.S. are building the largest free college tuition program in rural America \u2013 Better Futures. Our team members and their child dependents have the opportunity to pursue their higher education dreams for associate degrees and trade certificates at community and technical colleges \u2013 tuition free.\n\nWe recognize and believe in the transformative power of higher education and the opportunities that come from education, coursework and technical skill training.\n\nBetter Futures removes a major financial barrier to college attendance and stands to become the largest free college tuition program in rural America. JBS USA and Pilgrim\u2019s advisors will also help team members \u2013 many from first-generation American families \u2013 navigate the application process, which can be a deterrence to people applying to college for the first time.\n\nThe Better Futures program provides meaningful investments in the futures of our team members, their families and our communities.\n\nAt JBS USA, the highlights are the Leadership Warehouse, trainee and internship programs, and Tomorrow Fund \u2013 Pilgrim\u2019s Pride scholarship program. In addition to numerous community investment projects, JBS USA donated more than 22.4 million (4 oz.) servings of food in 2020. We partner with local food banks and community kitchens to provide fresh meat and poultry produced in nearby facilities.\n\nThe value of dialogue between managers and teams encourages interpersonal relationships, providing opportunities for possible improvements. In the US, in addition to different professional growth and appreciation initiatives, JBS maintains the Open Doors Policy, which encourages team members to present to their supervisors or the HR area any problems that may affect the general work environment. With this policy, it is possible to identify issues related to remuneration, benefits, working hours, safety and relationships with leaders.\nThe priority in team members health and safety was reinforced with COVID-19\u2019s prevention actions at units in all countries. As soon as the authorities confirmed that we were facing a global pandemic, a Crisis Committee was formed to evaluate the operation, composed by the top leadership of JBS, which resulted in a global action protocol, adapted by regional crisis committees, in accordance with norms and demands of each country. The elaboration of the protocol had the assistance of Hospital Einstein and of infectologists, in Brazil; and the hiring of epidemiologists, in partnership with Colorado State University (CSU) and the University of Nebraska, in the United States. The strict monitoring of protocols and the global exchange of experiences allowed for adaptations and improvements, ensuring that the demands of the administrative, operational and commercial units were met, maintaining the Company\u2019s essential activity as a food supplier.\n\nIn order to help fight the spread of the virus and maintain the production and distribution of food, JBS invested around R$ 2.8 billion in health and safety measures to protect its workforce.\n\nHundreds of procedures and policies were implemented to provide a safe working environment for teams, such as: temperature control; additional PPEs; application of safe distancing measures, including staggered shifts and installation of partitions on the production floor and in common areas; control testing of team members; contact tracking; and implementation of ultraviolet sanitization technologies at plants across the United States. In Canada, a total of 233 out of 265 action plans were completed to help team members stay safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Europe, the reinforcement and continuous update of the measures adopted globally also counted with the effective participation of the leadership teams; trips were reduced and there was strict control of visitor access. Since the beginning of the pandemic, JBS has maintained ongoing partnerships with epidemiologists and medical experts to evaluate its protocols.\nTo ensure the well-being and physical integrity of its direct and indirect team members, JBS invests in the prevention and correction of non-compliances. This priority strategy is aimed at eliminating accidents and offering safe working conditions, including individual and collective protective equipment, improving conditions for performing tasks and training programs and campaigns.\n\nSeveral local health and safety programs address principles ranging from strict compliance with local laws and awareness of each team member\u2019s responsibility to continuous improvement of machinery and equipment.\n\nThe main safety indicators are continuously monitored, with daily, weekly and monthly assessments, which allows quick and efficient decision-making. This process makes it possible to monitor the evolution of the indicators of frequency and severity rates, pointing out actions for improvement. Action plans and investigation of pending legal non-conformities identified in safety inspections are also monitored, as well as indicators of mandatory training for each role.\n\nIn 2020, JBS expanded and reinforced investments in communities, in particular, due to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The actions were developed regionally, to meet the real needs of each location, investing in projects with a lasting impact, going far beyond the emergency issues related to the global epidemic.\n\nJBS USA and Pilgrim\u2019s are committed to investing US$ 50 million to support the communities where they operate through the Hometown Strong program. By the end of 2020, more than US$ 27 million had been approved for projects in the United States and Canada. The program goes beyond pandemic emergency relief. The goal is to provide significant investments in projects that will have a lasting impact for generations to come, from education and recreation to health and social services.\n\nIn Brazil, the initiatives ranged from the donation of tests and food to those that left important legacies to the communities, such as the construction of hospitals and investments in scientific research, in addition to the renovation of medical clinics, equipment donation and new beds in public hospitals. With an investment of R$ 400 million, the actions were carried out through the Good Deeds Are Good (Fazer o Bem Faz Bem) program. In 2021, the actions continued with other important donations.\n\nFind out more\nSee the health and safety indicators for the entire Company in the respective business chapters\n\nIn 2020:\nApproximately R$ 3.4 billion invested globally in health and safety\n149,700 participations in training on the subject\nThe significant reduction in the use of natural resources in production processes is, at the same time, a goal and a practice at JBS.\nJBS is committed to taking the lead in the challenge of feeding a growing global population, which is expected to reach the 10 billion mark in 2050, according to estimates by the United Nations (UN). A responsibility that requires efficient operations capable of minimizing the environmental footprint.\n\nTo achieve continuous reductions in environmental impact and reaffirm its commitment to producing quality food, JBS sets goals in its Management System, at all facilities, referring to lower of consumption of water, energy and emission of greenhouse gases.\n\nJBS\u2019 Environmental Management System, based on ISO 14001 specifications and internally audited, allows compliance with various requirements and supports continuous improvement in impact management. Several indicators have been adopted to assess environmental and sustainability issues at the production units, such as water usage, effluent generation and analysis, energy consumption, steam generation, waste generation, transportation, gas coolants, production data and indicators of greenhouse gas emissions, among others. This allows for oversight of plant performance, relating it to the goals for reducing consumption and waste generation.\n\nJBS USA has made several commitments related to the intensity of the use of natural resources and the generation of emissions, and in 2020 they had reached the target by the end of the year.

The Company\u2019s operations are benchmarked to best practices and, are in line with the five fundamental freedoms of animals, as defined by the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC). The Company creates partnerships with producers around the world to ensure they abide by this agenda, while also maintaining specialized species-specific teams that adopt constantly revised techniques and encourage producers to provide the animals with the best treatment.\n\nAt all processing units, multidisciplinary teams are responsible for ensuring compliance with the policies and procedures required by animal welfare programs, for preparing and improving the Company\u2019s practices and for drawing up technical specifications for mandatory adoption by suppliers. Any violations of the JBS Animal Welfare Program (Programa de Bem-estar Animal) by team members or suppliers may result in disciplinary processes that could lead to termination of employment or contracts to supply raw materials.\n\nIn the United States, Brazil and Canada, those responsible for Quality Assurance are specialized in humane handling and hold certification issued by the Professional Animal Auditor Certification Organization (PAACO). In Australia, certification is provided by the Australian Animal Welfare Certification System (AAWCS).\n\nAll operations comply with local laws and technical standards, as well as the principles of animal freedom and humane slaughter. For commercial reasons, JBS adopts religious guidelines that respect the cultural characteristics and diversity of the markets in which it operates.\n\nJBS is constantly working to reduce the use of antibiotics in animals throughout the supply chain. Currently, they are given only in cases of need, always following veterinary recommendations. Antibiotics are not routinely used preventively in production; they are only used as needed and pending an assessment by veterinarians. Use of medications is registered and tracked throughout both the integrated chains and the Company\u2019s.\n\n**Five fundamental animal freedoms**\n\n1. **Freedom from hunger and thirst**\n2. **Freedom from discomfort**\n3. **Freedom from pain, injury or disease**\n4. **Freedom to express normal behavior**\n5. **Freedom from fear and distress**\nINDICATORS AND AUDITS\nJBS\u2019s animal welfare programs are assessed using key performance indicators (KPIs), audited by both internal teams and independent consulting firms, as well as by customers in the domestic and foreign markets. Most are focused on practices that exceed those required by current laws, indicating JBS\u2019s commitment to adopting best practices. There are also certification audits, such as Global GAP and Certified Humane, applied to Seara units, the National Feedlot Accreditation Scheme (NFAS), for Australian operations, and PAACO, at JBS USA and Friboi operations.\n\nAt JBS USA, there is a goal of achieving scores of 90% or better in animal welfare assessments conducted in integrated operations. The Company will adopt a global animal welfare scorecard.\n\nMANAGEMENT\nThe Company monitors the animal control and welfare process at all stages, from breeding, through transportation to production. It is important to emphasize that practices such as cloning and genetic engineering are not adopted in the JBS supply chain. In addition, the Company does not use any type of hormone, in accordance with Brazilian laws.\n\nBREEDING\nBreeding is a fundamental step in monitoring animal welfare practices. Each protein chain abides by best local practices, in line with their particularities.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\nAnimals are transported by specialized and trained drivers using Company or third-party vehicles designed to promote animal welfare. This procedure prevents injuries and minimizes animal stress during transportation, from departure to arrival. There are pre-established maximum transport distances and duration times, while resting feeding and watering procedures also apply according to established intervals. Drivers receive training in safety procedures in the event of emergencies while transporting animals.\n\nPRODUCTION\nThe Company constantly invests in improvements to its facilities, acquiring of the best equipment available on the world market and in the training of specialized teams at production units to monitor the animals and ensure their well-being, from their arrival and reception until they are forwarded for processing. Performance at all stages is regularly assessed and audited, internally and externally, using specific metrics.\n\nFIND OUT MORE\nLearn more about the practices carried out by the businesses in their respective chapters\n\nR$ 179 MILLION INVESTED in animal welfare programs\n\n28,941 TEAM MEMBERS TRAINED\nJBS monitors, evaluates and improves compliance throughout the operation to ensure an ethical and fair environment.\nJBS works to ensure an ethical and fair environment in all its processes.

Today, all Friboi units operate following the Seal protocols and undergo an annual external audit carried out by the Brazilian Certification Service (SBC). GRI 416-1\n\nAlso in 2020, Friboi reached the mark of 96.7% in all quality and food safety analyzes carried out in its own laboratories.\n\nWith 40,200 team members, distributed throughout all regions of Brazil, Friboi has developed training to reinforce the importance of preventing deviations in operations and the role of each one in the technological systematization of the production process. Starting in 2021, the company has launched the Food Safety Quality Culture project to promote among team members the habit of practicing quality, with the company providing the tools. It also coordinates the Continuous Improvement Circle (CMC), a program for improvements in production processes, which makes it possible to internally recognize projects and their creators. GRI 416-1\n\nFriboi received the 2020 Burger King Best Supplier Award for its innovations, rigorous food safety standards and the quality of its products and services. In the case of consumers, the company conducts a satisfaction survey at the end of the hotline service, generating the NPS assessment, a methodology aimed at measuring the customer\u2019s recommendation. In 2020, Friboi\u2019s NPS was 54, within the quality zone (NPS between 50 and 74).\nThe business unit maintains the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) \u2013 An\u00e1lise de Perigos e Pontos Cr\u00edticos de Controle (APPCC) \u2013 program, with the objective of preventively analyzing all production stages, identifying, evaluating and controlling hazards that are significant for food safety. Two of the main achievements in 2020 were the development of the Results Management System and the implementation of the deviation management system. GRI 416-1\n\nMonitoring is carried out using the ADP indicators: Microbiological (Microbiological and Sanitation Quality Index) and Food and Process Safety Route.\n\nThe unit\u2019s operations are based on the Policy and Management System Manual, that sets out the domestic and international procedures and standards to be followed to ensure the quality of its products and services. Additionally, it maintains its own restricted substance control policy, ensuring the safety of its processes and products for its team members, the environment and consumers, and is in line with the most demanding international standards and regulations. It also has a traceability policy that allows for the control and documentation of all processes and inputs used in the processing of its hides, from the meatpacking plant to the finished leather, resulting in greater transparency, quality and safety of its products.\n\nJBS Couros Management System, an extensive program, defines in detail the best way to carry out each process, encompassing all the areas involved.\n\nManagement is based on documents, specifications, work instructions, visual aids, controls, measurement and\nIn Brazil, the Company has 399 certifications and audits at its units, relating to various topics such as the environment, food quality and safety, social responsibility, customers and markets, among others.

JBS food brands in Brazil have launched more than 500 products within their categories to meet this growing demand.\n\nThe Company constantly seeks to develop innovative products that meet the expectations of customers and consumers, a task that is conducted by the Research and Development (R&D) areas of the food business units, which operate in two segments: fresh and prepared. In 2020, more than R$ 23.2 million were invested in R&D.\n\nThe Company also has management tools that help assess the world\u2019s megatrends in food, such as the search for health, with the reduction of sodium and fat; or for practicality, with packaging in smaller portions and easy to prepare meals, among others. In addition, it created a methodology to monitor regional innovation processes and share the lessons learned with businesses globally. In 2018 the Global Innovation Team (GIT) was created to encourage teams and the exchange of experiences. In addition to leveraging JBS\u2019 competitive advantages, GIT promotes information sharing, acceleration of innovation through exchange between countries and the creation of global platforms that favor innovative practices. This is possible because the parent company has other business units on five continents.\nNutritional value and the healthiness of fresh and prepared foods rely on technological innovation, in order to reduce fat, sodium, sugar and the use of artificial preservatives.\n\nFriboi\u2019s products have no preservatives, no added ingredients, and are conditioned in high-tech packaging. Kitut, a brand of prepared foods, launched a ham version with a 30% reduction in sodium. Bordon\u2019s feijoada and meatballs in sauce were reformulated, with the removal of all additives from the recipe, in a development process that maintains the identity of the products, without prejudice to the flavor, texture and safety of the food.\n\nSeara also offers several product lines, such as: Seara DaGranja, a line of chickens raised without the use of antibiotics and with 100% vegetable feed throughout the entire breeding process; Seara Org\u00e2nico, a line of organically certified chickens; Seara Nature, a line without artificial preservatives, 100% natural and with products that have more protein and sodium content below the target stipulated by the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa), in addition to not containing soy protein and lactose; and Incr\u00edvel Seara, made 100% with plant-based protein for consumers who are reducing their consumption of meat, or vegetarians.\n\nSwift has more than 500 product options with a commitment to deliver healthy, practical and sustainably sourced food. It also developed an innovative freezing process that guarantees the characteristics of the fresh product, making them more tender, tasty and succulent, in addition to offering total food safety. Its portfolio includes ready-made handmade dishes, fruits and vegetables, as well as frozen fresh proteins.\n\nThe Company invests in laboratories specialized in nutritional, microbiological and biotechnology analyses, providing indicators for the development of new products and the improvement of the various foods that make up the JBS portfolio, while in the operational process the automated systems evolve every year. The Company adopts state-of-the-art technology that goes hand in hand with a robust training program for administrative and operational teams.\n\nIn 2020, Friboi began the construction of the Meat Study and Technology Center (CETEC), completed in early 2021. The space, which has the latest equipment used for scientific research in renowned laboratories and universities in different parts of the world, will allow the business to guarantee an even more consistent standard of quality in all its products.\nIn 2020, Friboi advanced in the transformation of the value chain with the launch of the first mobile application for the purchase of cattle in the country. The first in the sector, the online platform simplifies the commercial relationship with producers, from the purchase to the processing of the animal, connecting thousands of producers to the best business opportunities. The Friboi Pecuarista app also brings security, democratizes access for livestock farmers of different sizes and affords even more transparency to the entire process, with real time information.\n\nIn 2020, Friboi also launched 30 products, extending the portfolio of the brands Bordon, Do Chef Friboi and 1953 Friboi that meet the needs of customers and the market. In the Kitut line, meatballs with sauce, sausage with sauce and a low-sodium ham version were launched. The portfolio, now broader and with complete options for different meals and snacks throughout the day, also had its visual identity reformulated.\n\nIn 2020, Seara and NoMoo, a Brazilian foodtech pioneer in the manufacture of fermented cashew nut cheeses and yogurts, teamed up to bring an unprecedented product to the market: the Incr\u00edvel Escondidinho (shredded, sun-dried meat), with meat and plant-based cheese flavor. NoMoo cheese is the result of a careful R&D process that allowed the Rio startup to be the only industry in Brazil with the capacity to ferment plant-based milk with the same technology used for the manufacture of conventional dairy products, maintaining the characteristics of grating, slicing and melting, just like the animal-based version.\n\nThe collaboration between Seara and food startups like NoMoo originated at Incr\u00edvel Lab, a research and innovation center focused on plant-based products.\n\nSeara was the first large food company in the country to offer a complete line of products made 100% with plant-based protein \u2013 Incr\u00edvel Seara, which follows the evolution of the food market and consumers who increasingly seek alternatives to incorporate into their daily diet, without giving up on flavor and quality.\n\nDeveloped from a single component, Seara\u2019s exclusive \u201cBiomolecule-i\u201d, it uses the combination of natural molecules that, together, provide the sensation of meat texture and flavor.

The line Turma da M\u00f4nica (Brazilian cartoon characters) ranked second in the marketing and branding category for augmented reality.\nSwift also innovated by launching in 2020 three lines of ready-to-eat dishes, prepared without artificial additives: packaged in reusable pans and suitable for heating; boxes with various items packaged separately, which make up a meal; and hand-made pizzas.\n\nThe Research and Development (R&D) area is one of the pillars of Swift\u2019s constant search for innovation. The main result of the year in product innovation was the development of the first tests and versions of products added with a clean label solution, in line with the company\u2019s guidance on healthiness. Other important advances were: the reduction in the consumption of plastic packaging (with initiatives to reduce thickness, dimensions and waste); and initiatives to make better use of secondary packaging, which reduces cardboard consumption.\n\nJBS Ambiental, responsible for managing the waste generated by JBS Brasil\u2019s operations, intensified its investments in 2020 focused on the development of products from the reuse of plastic waste. The highlight of the year was the launch of the Green Flooring, with a solution for the use of multilayer plastic whose structure is not conducive to recycling. The material, consisting of concrete and plastic, began to be used in the Company\u2019s constructions, such as paved parking lots, sidewalks and patios. The challenge for 2021 will be to launch Green Flooring in the civil construction market.\n\nJBS Ambiental launched Green Flooring, composed of concrete and plastic which, initially, is being used in the Company\u2019s constructions and patios.

A pioneering innovation, it allows livestock farmers to have access to JBS Transportadora\u2019s fleet, with almost 3,000 vehicles, including our own and those of our partners, which travel throughout the country. The service also provides real-time monitoring of the transport of cattle.\n\nWith the technology, JBS assures livestock farmers that the cattle will be transported in accordance with international animal welfare standards, one of the Company\u2019s four strategic sustainability pillars that permeates the entire JBS production chain. Through fleet tracking, the Company reinforces its commitment with the importance of correct handling of cattle, contributing to the reduction of accidents and minimizing stress factors for animals and professionals involved in the process.\n\nThe innovation of the Uboi app contributes to the development of the sector in general, as it helps to expand Brazil\u2019s production capacity, simplifying and facilitating the transport of cattle between rural properties.\n\nJBS COUROS\n\nThis unit invests in and develops innovative and sustainable solutions for products with high added value and quality, important differentials \u2013 such as Kind Leather, which transforms parts destined to become waste into raw material (read more on Value Chain and Environmental Stewardship).\n\nThroughout 2020, JBS Couros carried out work to consolidate the Kind Leather concept in the market, in addition to acting on other fronts: optimization of compacting processes; research into alternative and sustainable forms of tanning; use of certified vegetable tannins; study of optimization of wet processes to reduce the consumption of natural resources; and advances in technical robustness in measuring the impacts of processes through the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The unit\u2019s main product launches were in the Kind Leather and the finished goods line.\n\nJBS Couros has Leather ID (see more at the link), the first online tool for monitoring leather production, available to more than 1,300 customers. Each piece leaves the tannery with an identification tag, whereby typing the code on the website, the group of farms where the raw material originated, date and processing plants, can all be traced in addition to the that produced the leather tannery.\n\nIt provides the Leather Labs platform, which gives digital access to all those interested in working with JBS leather \u2013 small and medium-sized manufacturers, architects, decorators, artisans, upholsterers and end-customers. The platform also has a virtual store with various items and complete craft kits to support of small entrepreneurs.\nGuarantee of origin\n\nWith the Certified Guarantee of Origin Program (Programa Garantia de Origem Verificada), launched in 2020, JBS raises beef to an unprecedented level of quality, using the most sophisticated technology to improve the traceability process and allow the consumer to obtain a history of the product on the packaging, through a QR Code. It is a quick tool for researching and verifying the traceability of products, among other information regarding the origin of that item, taking certified inputs of internationally recognized quality to the final market.\n\nGRANJA 4.0\n\nIn 2020, Seara created the Granja 4.0 project, an integrated connectivity and artificial intelligence solution based on three pillars: animal welfare; qualitative gains; and results through cost reduction and added value. Features include the monitoring of the animals' welfare inside the farms, using sensors that provide real-time information on indicators such as the temperature and humidity of the environment, air quality, weight and even the behavior of the animals. Technology-enabled remote monitoring reducing the movement of people on the farms, boosting bio-safety actions. The project is being tested in about 100 partner farms in the western region of Santa Catarina, an it is expected to automate 100% of the management in the short term.\n\nSUPERAPP SWIFT\n\nSuperApp Swift was created to change the way in which protein is purchased, in line with the concept of differentiated service, delivering the Swift experience into the consumer's hands. With Swift's strategy of promoting a new hyper-connected retail sector, SuperApp has become the best and most complete application for protein shopping. Much more than an e-commerce, where you can find the entire variety of products at Swift stores and buy on your cell phone, it explores the multichannel service and interaction, with personalization, variety of content, shopping experience and services, in addition to interaction through the QR Code and search for best prices.\nJBS is a member of food industry associations and trade groups in the food sector and a member of some of the world\u2019s largest industry and sustainability organizations. In Brazil, it is a member of the following professional associations: Poultry Breeders Association of Bahia (ABA); Association of Brazilian Food Industries (ABIA); Brazilian Beef Exporters Association (ABIEC); Brazilian Agribusiness Association (ABAG); Brazilian Plastics Industry Association (ABIPLAST); Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE); Brazilian Animal Protein Association (ABPA); Brazilian Association of Broiler Chicken Producers (APINCO); Poultry Breeders Association of Minas Gerais (AVIMIG); Industrial Association of Meat and Meat Byproducts of Santa Catarina (SINDICARNE SC); Centre for the Brazilian Tanning Industry (CICB); Trade Association of the Poultry Products Industry of the State of Paran\u00e1 (SINDIAVPAR); S\u00e3o Paulo State Cold Products Industry Association (SINDIFRIO); National Animal Feed Industry Association (SINDIRA\u00c7\u00d5ES); and National Union of Beef Industries and Companies (UNIEC).\n\nThe Company is part of class and sustainability advocacy entities, in addition to participating in related roundtables.\n\nThe Company also actively participates in the following working groups and associations, fundamental entities for promoting the advancement of sustainability in the sector:\n\n- Brazilian Animal Protein Association (ABPA)\n- Brazilian Association of the Food Industry (ABIA)\n- Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE)\n- Brazilian Beef Exporters Association (ABIEC)\n- Brazilian Association of Industry and Trade of Ingredients and Additives (ABIAM)\n- Brazilian Association of Pharmaceutical Ingredients Industry (ABIQUIPI)\n- Brazilian Agribusiness Association (ABAG)\n- Brazilian Association of the Personal Hygiene, Perfumery and Cosmetics Industry (ABIHPEC)\n- Brazilian Association of Animal Recycling (ABRA)\n- National Confederation of Industry (CNI)\n- Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock of Brazil (CNA)\n- Santa Catarina Poultry Association (ACAV)\n- Trade Association of the Poultry Products Industry of the State of Paran\u00e1 (SINDIAVPAR)\n- Itaja\u00ed Companies Association\n- Federation of Business Associations of Santa Catarina (FACISC)\n- Federation of Industries of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (FIESP)\n- Federation of Industries of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN)\n- International Life Science Institute (ILSI)\n- Pensar Agro Institute (IPA)\n- Livestock Technical Committee (LTC)\n- World Economic Forum (WEF)\nCommitment to sustainability\n\nJBS has a mission to feed the world in equilibrium with the planet\n\nIN THIS CHAPTER\n> PRODUCT INTEGRITY\n> SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n> ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP\n> ANIMAL WELFARE\n> ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE\n> PERFORMANCE\n> PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES\nOver the years, the Company has perfected itself in order to find solutions that guarantee a portfolio of innovative and quality products to meet the new consumption habits of a growing population, so that food and sustainability always go hand in hand.\n\nJBS\u2019 strategy is linked to environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects, with a focus on the perpetuity of its business. The Company always seeks to generate and share value in everything it does, so that society and other stakeholders can also prosper with it. For this reason, its commitment goes beyond guidelines for the reduction and mitigation of the effects inherent to the production and marketing of food operations. Investments in policies, innovations and programs promote positive impacts on team members, suppliers, customers, consumers, the community and the environment. In Brazil, the diversity of the businesses, combined with regional challenges, demands the constant improvement of measures to meet the specificities of each one, at different times.\n\nThe JBS team is encouraged to engage in ethical, social and environmental causes. Suppliers, in compliance with the policy on the sustainable origin of raw materials, are advised on management, technology and environmental issues by teams of specialists. Customers participate in programs that add value to the business, and consumers have access to innovative and nutritious products on retail store shelves, in food service channels, such as restaurants, and in the company\u2019s own sales channels. The communities where JBS is present are part of this integration, with effective actions to develop and improve the quality of life in the different regions.\n\nGovernance on the subject is established by the Socio-Environmental Responsibility Committee (formerly the Sustainability Committee), a body responsible for discussing strategic and global issues while providing assistance to the Board of Directors. Since 2019, the Chairman of the Board, Jerry O\u2019Callaghan, has also chaired this Committee.\n\nJBS manages sustainability in line with the world scenario and the UN\u2019s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a platform and reference for its sustainability actions.\n\nOver the next few chapters, the following priority topics will be addressed: product integrity, social responsibility, environmental stewardship and animal welfare, with their policies and results.\n\nR$ 1.46 billion\ninvested in sustainability in 2020\nProduct Integrity\n\nProduct integrity means respecting the highest food safety, quality and sustainability standards.\nAt JBS, product integrity means respecting the highest food safety, quality and sustainability standards. Therefore, the Company is committed to investing in enhancing operations, manufacturing and product supply, adopting social and environmental practices at origin, while having good practices, processes and routines certified by independent audits.\n\nThe Company is aware of its role as a benchmark in the value chain, which starts with the procurement of raw materials, following the guidelines of its Responsible Raw Material Procurement Policy, which has a significant influence on the value chain, from raw material suppliers adopting good practices to the final quality of products. In this sense, JBS establishes a partnership relationship, encouraging and developing actions geared towards enhancing supplier management and practices, by working on two fronts: guarantee of origin and supplier relationships. The acquisition of raw materials is based on the principles of responsible procurement; this means they are based not only on compliance with federal and local regulations, but also in line with the most sustainable practices in the sector.\n\nOver the last 10 years, JBS has developed one of the largest supplier monitoring systems in the world, which uses satellite images to monitor an area greater than the territory of France. This tool ensures that the Company only buys from producers who fully meet its social and environmental criteria, including not having areas embargoed by Ibama, not being on the \u201cblack list\u201d of forced labor and zero tolerance to illegal deforestation, in strict compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code.\n\nThrough an advanced Social and Environmental Monitoring System, the Company its Responsible Raw Material Procurement Policy (see more in the link). JBS has been a signatory of the National Pact to Eradicate Slave Labour since 2007, and has been a member of the Institute for the National Pact to Eradicate Slave Labour (InPACTO) since 2014.\n\nIn Brazil, more than 90,000 livestock supplying farms are monitored every day, in the Amazon, Cerrado, Pantanal, Mata Atl\u00e2ntica and Caatinga biomes using satellite images. The practice prevents the purchase of animals raised in areas of illegal deforestation, protected by environmental laws and indigenous lands, areas embargoed by Ibama or properties that use forced labor. The quality of the origin of raw material is still controlled by the Company\u2019s Sustainability area.\n\nWhen farms that do not meet the Company\u2019s criteria and the Supplier Monitoring Protocol of the Federal Prosecution Office of Brazil (MPF) are identified, the system automatically blocks the registration of those supplier farms, making any\ncommercial operation impossible until the situation is regularized. It is also worth noting that the Company is a co-developer of the Supplier Monitoring Protocol of the Federal Prosecution Office of Brazil (see here), in partnership with the NGO Imaflora. Considering the entire Brazilian territory, JBS has more than 90,000 registered cattle supplying farms, of which 30,000 are frequent suppliers. GRI 102-9\n\nAll cattle purchases and the monitoring system itself are independently audited annually by a third-party certifier. The results of the auditors have can be accessed on the JBS website, reinforcing the Company\u2019s transparency. Over the past two years, the audit confirmed that 100% of the Company\u2019s audited direct cattle acquisitions were in compliance with its strict Responsible Raw Material Procurement Policy (read more here).\n\nJBS is also a member of the Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA), an initiative connected to the World Economic Forum, fostering and promoting actions aimed at ending deforestation in the world. The Company is also a member of the Brazilian Roundtable on Sustainable Livestock (BRSL) and the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB), initiatives that foster measures to end deforestation and contribute to improving sustainability across the industry\u2019s entire value chain.\n\nIn the poultry and pork chains, JBS units work in an integrated manner with the producers, in a partnership that guarantees the origin of the raw material. Technical visits are carried out regularly, with guidance on production management, environmental practices and animal welfare. GRI 102-9\n\nSeara employs traceability systems to its more than 9,000 integrated producers to quickly identify and, if necessary, isolate farms with any problems related to quality or safety. The technology also monitors the treatment of poultry at every stage of their lives and the production process.\n\nJBS is leader of the Forest 500 ranking among companies in the protein sector\nWith the aim of producing in an increasingly sustainable way, JBS has been investing in concrete environmental actions for over a decade. The Company uses satellite images to monitor an area that is larger than the territory of France, the largest country in Western Europe. The last two audits, carried out by an independent certifier, attested that 100% of the direct cattle acquisitions audited were in compliance with JBS\u2019 Responsible Raw Material Procurement Policy.\n\nIn 2020, the Company went further, taking on a stronger commitment to sustainability in the region Amazon, by launching the Transparent Livestock Farming Platform, which allows JBS livestock suppliers to include their own suppliers in the register, with the aim of complying with the social and environmental aspects of cattle breeding.\n\nAdherence is voluntary. Cattle producers who directly supply JBS will list their suppliers of animals on the platform developed by specialized company Ecotrace. As the platform is an open one, other companies within the industry can use the system.\n\nThe data will be sent electronically for validation by Agri Trace Rastreabilidade Animal, the system of the Brazilian Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock Farming (CNA). Once authorized by the producer, the CNA checks if the list of suppliers is complete.\n\nCompanies accredited on the platform, will process the socioenvironmental compliance analysis based on the same criteria currently used by JBS, in an agreement with the Federal Prosecution Office (MPF), to check for the existence of: deforestation, respecting the Brazilian Forest Code; invasion of indigenous lands or environmental conservation units; forced labor; and use of areas embargoed by Ibama.\n\nThe outcome of the analysis will be sent directly to the JBS supplier who, for the first time, will be able to view socioenvironmental compliance throughout his entire supply chain. This means they will be able to develop plans to mitigate risks and engage in actions that help producers to regularize their situations when necessary.\n\nAt no time will JBS have access to sensitive information, having access only to the consolidated analysis of its suppliers. Thanks to blockchain technology, it will be possible to maintain the commitment to the confidentiality of third-party information.\n\nA fundamental part of the project is a supply chain engagement strategy that is being developed to accelerate the construction of a positive register of producers in accordance with social and environmental standards. All JBS beef cattle suppliers must sign up the program by the end of 2025.\n\nRecently, JBS has announced that is bringing forward its target of zero illegal deforestation for the suppliers of its suppliers in the Cerrado, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest and Caatinga biomes from 2030 to 2025. This due to the rapid advance of the Transparent Livestock Farming Platform and mirrors the commitment already established for the Amazon.\n\nGreen Offices\nJBS has set up 13 Green Offices at processing units throughout the country: in Marab\u00e1 and Reden\u00e7\u00e3o (PA), Porto Velho and S\u00e3o Miguel do Guapor\u00e9 (RO), and another six in Mato Grosso: Alta Floresta, Barra do Gar\u00e7as, Confresa, Diamantino, Juara and Pontes e Lacerda. The initiative has also reached Goi\u00e2nia and Mozarl\u00e2ndia (GO) and Campo Grande (MS). The teams will mainly help the suppliers of JBS\u2019s suppliers to regularize their environmental situation (learn more at this link).\nThe relationship with suppliers is essential and relevant to the prosperity of the value chain. That is why the Company has developed a series of actions to build closer relationships with its stakeholders based on confidence, respect, ethics and transparency. JBS works alongside the producers, offering technical and management support, combining sustainability and preservation of the suppliers\u2019 businesses.\n\n**BEEF**\n\nAmong the initiatives there is the so-called Araguaia Herd (Rebanho Araguaia) project, which promotes the development of sustainable livestock raising in the M\u00e9dio Vale do Araguaia region, in Mato Grosso, one of the main cattle-producing regions in the country. In partnership with the Araguaia League, whose members include around 60 livestock producers in the region, JBS offers technical support from consultants specialized in pasture lands management, ensuring better productivity in environmentally regulated areas and greater profitability for producers, an action that contributes to the net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAdditionally, JBS developed the Grade 10 Farm (Fazenda Nota 10) program, which offers training for high-performance management, allowing the results of beef cattle farms in Brazil to be maximized. Developed by the Company in partnership with the Instituto Integra, the program is aimed at livestock producers throughout the country. In 2020 alone, more than 100 JBS suppliers participated in the program.\n\nJBS promotes good practices among small livestock producers through the Social Biofuel Seal Program (Programa Selo Biocombust\u00edvel Social), an initiative by the Department of Family Agriculture and Cooperatives (SAF) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Farming and Supply (Mapa). In this program, JBS\u2019 role is to support\nthese ranchers with free technical assistance and guaranteed purchase of animals. Since the early days of the integration of livestock farming with the Seal in 2015, the Company has already acquired over 110,000 animals from 437 properties in the 21 municipalities served by the program in the region of S\u00e3o Miguel do Guapor\u00e9 (RO), in addition to investing around R$ 5 million in free technical assistance focused on efficient and responsible production.

GRI 102-9\n\nPOULTRY AND PORK\n\nThe quality assurance of the production chain is based on the differentiated relationship between Seara and its 9,000 integrated suppliers, who produce exclusively for the Company. It is a partnership in which the breeders receive all the inputs \u2013 1-day-old chicks and piglets, 100% of the feed, technical assistance and freight, which represent 93% of the costs. The producer is responsible for labor, animal care, electricity, facilities, wood shavings and firewood, equivalent to 7% of the costs. In this way, the Company guarantees that the purchase of 100% of the products complies with its purchasing policy. GRI FP1\n\nIn order to strengthen the relationship between integrated producers and the Company, in 2014 Seara created the SuperAgro award, whose objectives are: to reinforce the relationship of commitment and trust; motivate and retain current producers and attract new producers; value the integration system with the community; and recognize producers with the best results and management practices.\n\nThese producers are managed by about 500 professionals who visit the properties periodically and who, in addition to technical assistance in the management of the breeding and sanitation of poultry and pork, provide technical support during and after construction and improvements to the facilities, train and advise the producers in managing the production cost and cash flow of the activity, seeking reduction opportunities and good practices to increase performance, productivity, animal welfare and profitability of the activity. In this way, the Company helps to increase the income of its integrated producers and, consequently, contributes to the economic development of the region.\n\nAnnually, Seara evaluates all its members through the Sustainability Index, which measures from the most basic to the most advanced practices in environmental, economic and social aspects. The results achieved in the 2020 assessment, the first year of application, showed an average score of 71% considering all dimensions assessed.\n\nIn 2020, the highlights (above 90%) for the environmental aspect on the farms were: effluent treatment; compliance with environmental licensing; separation and proper disposal of solid waste; and self-sufficient water farms, which manage the use of this resource and electricity without waste. For the social aspect, they were: telephone communication from the farms; Internet access; animal welfare training; and management standards.\n\nAll units make an action plan with countermeasures for the evolution of items not covered, according to the assessment of each member. The goal is to reach 80% participation for 2021/2022.\n\nThe Integration system with Seara supports and encourages investment in the modernization and adoption of sustainable technologies that offer the activity of cost reduction with increased efficiency and increased productivity, as well as financially encouraging the construction of new projects, with policies of remuneration customized for each animal category.\n\nThe constant technological evolution of this system took an important step in 2020, when Seara launched the Granja 4.0 project, which is expected to automate 100% of operations management in the short term (read more on Innovation).\n\nFriboi and Seara also have two programs with content aimed at livestock farmers and integrated producers. Broadcasted by Canal Rural, the programs Giro do Boi and Ligados & Integrados, respectively, remain a reference for industry professionals, in addition to helping to strengthen JBS\u2019s relationship and dialogue with this audience.\n\nThe Company works alongside its suppliers, offering technical and management support, combining sustainability and preservation of its business.\nJBS\u2019s practices and initiatives to play a leading role in the movement to promote a more inclusive society\nJBS employed more than 142,000 professionals in 2020, an increase of 10.5% over the previous year. In 2020, the Company hired 52,100 new professionals, 28.2% more than in 2019, despite the challenging scenario caused by the pandemic.\n\nThe turnover rate went from 21.38% in 2019 to 24.29% in 2020, considering the total employee base. Considering only the leadership (supervisor, coordinator, manager, director, president and director), the turnover dropped to 11.54% in 2020 \u2013 in 2019, it was 14.59%. The absenteeism rate went from 2.48% in 2019 to 5.57% in 2020, justified by the atypical year experienced in 2020.\n\n91.32% of the team members of Friboi, Seara, Swift, JBS Couros and JBS Novos Neg\u00f3cios are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nIn 2020, JBS employed 2,547 team members from various countries, such as Senegal, Haiti and Venezuela.\n\nThe turnover rate went from 21.38% in 2019 to 24.29% in 2020, considering the total employee base.

It is committed to promoting and defending human rights in its operations and in the value chain, in addition to the communities in which it operates. JBS is a global company and must reflect its diversity of consumers as well as the communities in which it operates. It must also lead efforts towards a more inclusive society. Therefore, it develops diversified hiring and inclusion incentive programs in all its plants and offices, to create an inclusive, pleasant and productive work environment.\n\nThe companies customize documents, employment contracts and manuals in the native language of foreign team members, in addition to promoting their adaptation within the units. In 2020, JBS employed more than 2,500 professionals from different countries.\n\nWith regard to people with disabilities (PwDs), the Company develops a training program, contributing to their inclusion both in its operations and in the labor market. In partnership with public and private institutions, JBS conducts the Experimental Work Project. Its objective goes beyond employability training: it is an instrument capable of consolidating, in practice, the social rights of people with disabilities, creating conditions to promote their autonomy, social inclusion, integration and effective participation in society. In 2019, the project was implemented in 12 schools, with 122 students. But in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the process was temporarily halted.\n\nIn 2020, JBS signed the Public Commitment for Racial Equity, together with several companies in the consumer goods sector. The purpose of the commitment is to reinforce actions to fight structural racism. Together, with organizations and subject matter experts, the companies will create effective and transparent action plan to promote racial equity.\n\nThe Company understands that it is important to assess leadership positions by category, in order to promote gender and racial equality. This entire process is in line with the Diversity and Inclusion Policy, published by the Company in 2021 to promote and defend human rights in its operations and value chain, and in the communities where it operates. The results will be seen over the next few years.\nThe guidelines of this policy are based on three main pillars: Diversity and Inclusion, Equal Opportunities and Respect for Diversity. All actions aim to maintain an increasingly inclusive and welcoming space for differences, to adopt measures that guarantee and promote equal access, permanence and opportunities in all areas and positions for any and all Company professionals, as well as the constant awareness of the impacts of these actions.\n\nTo assist in preparing the actions, the Company hired RM Consulting, led by Rachel Maia, which will develop the social literacy of the senior management of JBS on issues related to Diversity and Inclusion. Additionally, JBS has joined the Women\u2019s 360 Movement (Movimento Mulheres 360), an initiative that brings together more than 60 large companies.\n\nThe objective is to expand the participation of women in the corporate environment.\n\nAs a result of its efforts, JBS received the WOB (Women on Board) certification, which recognizes organizations with at least two women as board or executive board members. Supported by UN Women, Women on Board is an independent initiative whose purpose is to promote good practices in corporate environments, as well as to track the benefits businesses enjoy as a result of diversity in the leadership positions.\n\nJBS is also adhering to the MOVER \u2013 Public Commitment to Racial Equity focus on dismantling structural and institutional racism. Mover aims to generate 10,000 leadership positions for black people in the next 3 years.\n\nJBS is committed to reflect in its leadership the gender, ethnic and racial diversity of the communities in which it operates.\nNEW TALENTS  GRI 103-2, 103-3\n\nThe Valued Youth (Jovens de Valor) program invests in the development of talent, such as specialists and entry-level leadership, in the areas of engineering and labor law. The initiative includes the Valued Youth platform (jovensdevalorjbs.com.br) and a Facebook profile (facebook.com/JovensDeValorJBS). The program ended 2020 with 32 young leaders and engineering specialists having completed their training.\n\nWith an industrial focus, the Internal Talents Program (Programa de Talentos Internos) selects young people with leadership potential, capable of managing processes and teams in the Company\u2019s different business units. In 2020, Friboi had 25 professionals from the Valued Youth (Jovens de Valor) program, 20 of whom were hired. JBS Novos Neg\u00f3cios worked with five trainees, and hired four young people after the program.\n\nPEOPLE DEVELOPMENT  GRI 103-2, 103-3\n\nJBS has a policy of encouraging and supporting the professional development of its team members. The Internal Talents (Programa de Talentos Internos) program trains supervisors for the maintenance, production, transport and logistics areas, based on the selection of team members from the operational areas. With 46 team members trained by the program, in 2020 the Company opened 55 positions, with 46 permanent positions.\n\nThe Labor Lawyer (Advogado Trabalhista) program is open to professionals who have recently graduated in the last two years. Since 2016, 39 lawyers have been trained. Currently, the program is running at nine units of the group and at the Company\u2019s headquarters.\n\nAll JBS business units maintain their universities or training academies, with a focus on qualified training and career development.\n\nIn 2020, the training programs reached the milestone of 220,463 sessions held with team members, 21% more than 2019 (182,079 sessions)  GRI 404-1\n\n> Friboi\nFriboi University, Meat Cutter Training Center (CFF) and the Deboner Training Center (CFD)\n\n> Seara\nSeara University and Quality Academy\n\n> JBS Couros\nLeadership Academy\n\n> Swift\nSales Academy and Leadership Academy\nThe Company has a performance evaluation program, through which team members are evaluated by their peers, subordinates (when applicable), leaders and suppliers and internal customers. The assessment is based on JBS\u2019 values, ensuring that its team members adhere to the Company\u2019s culture. In 2020, more than 75% of the Company\u2019s leaders were evaluated using this methodology.\n\nThe JBS Without Borders program (JBS Sem Fronteiras) values deboning specialists, offering Friboi and Seara team members the opportunity to work at the JBS Canada unit in the city of Brooks, Alberta. The project reinforces the Company\u2019s global position and generates opportunities, international experience, retention and sharing of knowledge among team members.\n\nThe program was created in 2015 and has already sent around 80 professionals from states such as Bahia, Goi\u00e1s, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Par\u00e1, Rond\u00f4nia and S\u00e3o Paulo to Canada.\n\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the 19 professionals selected by Friboi and Seara was postponed.\nThe health and safety of team members are priorities for JBS. The Company invested R$ 323 million in contingency measures, systems and processes, with a focus on COVID-19 prevention at all units in Brazil. The resources were allocated to dozens of actions that are part of the Company\u2019s prevention and protection protocol for the more than 142,000 team members at the Company\u2019s production units, distribution centers, offices and other facilities in the country. During this period, to ensure the measures were implemented and effective, JBS also undertook snap audits at its 135 production plants for an item-by-item verification of each action comprising its strict safety protocol.\n\nTo define its protocol, the Company hired a medical consulting company of specialist infectologists and benchmark institutions like the Albert Einstein Hospital who validated each phase of the Company\u2019s protocol in accordance with the medical and healthcare recommendations and the stipulations of Inter-ministerial Ordinance nr. 19 (Ministries of Health, Agriculture and the Economy), dated June 18, 2020.\n\nAdditionally, JBS hired more than 12,000 professionals nationwide to take the places of team members who had been preventively confined to home for being part of the risk group, including pregnant women and the over-60s. This group is also composed of team members in situations of heightened vulnerability, including indigenous peoples and those with a medical condition. All team members testing positive for COVID-19 are also immediately given leave of absence and remain away from their posts until they have fully recovered. When these situations arise, the Company\u2019s health team provides full service to everyone, in addition to doing active searches among the team members, those they have had contact with and family members.\n\nCOVID-19 \u2013 Main Protective Measures\n\nThe Company also:\n\n> Hired 600 healthcare professionals to assist team members;\n> Doubled the bus fleet;\n> Established the mandatory use of masks for 100% of team members in all areas of the Company;\n> Free vaccination against H1N1 for 100% of the team members;\n> Created campaign cafeterias, expanding service capacity with safe distancing between team members, without crowding;\n> Installed additional ambulatory units in the external areas and annexes to the plants, operating full-time;\n> Expanded covered rest areas, with new spaces in tents and/or containers, with more distance between the seats.\nManagement\nGRI 103-2, 103-3 | 403-1, 403-4, 403-5, 402-6, 403-7\n\nJBS acts in a preventive and corrective manner to ensure the well-being and physical integrity of its direct and indirect team members, with the objective of eliminating accidents and offering safe working conditions, in addition to the continuous improvement of its facilities and strengthening of training programs and campaigns. The Self-Management Health and Safety Program (Programa de Seguran\u00e7a e Sa\u00fade de Autogest\u00e3o) summarizes the Company\u2019s commitments:\n\n> **Motivate, inform, develop, train and qualify** team members, making them responsible for ensuring and promoting a healthy and safe working environment;\n\n> **Anticipate and prevent** accidents, understanding that all accidents can be avoided;\n\n> **Seek to continually improve** processes, machinery and equipment, promoting control actions to eliminate or minimize incidents;\n\n> **Ensure compliance with legal requirements**, the Self-Management Health and Safety Program (Programa de Seguran\u00e7a e Sa\u00fade de Autogest\u00e3o), and other items applicable to health and safety;\n\n> **Build and disseminate** a culture of Health and Safety as a value by leading through example, individual responsibility and shared vigilance.\n\nThe Company also monitors the main health and safety indicators on a daily, weekly and monthly basis so that decisions on the subject are taken quickly and with priority.\n\nMonthly management routines monitor the evolution of the frequency rate and severity rate indicators, in addition to improvement actions. Indicators of mandatory training for each role are also monitored, as well as action plans and investigation of possible disputes linked to incidents of legal non-compliances identified through safety inspections.\n\nJBS in Brazil achieved an accumulated reduction of 70% in the frequency rate of Accidents with leave in the last five years, demonstrating its commitment to that continuously improve health and safety results.\n\n### OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY INDEXES\nGRI 403-2, 403-9, 403-10\n\n| Indicator | 2019 | 2020 |\n|-----------|------|------|\n| Accidents | 467  | 396  |\n| Accidents without leave | 7,346 | 6,841 |\n| Total number of accidents | 7,813 | 7,237 |\n| Rate of injuries with leave | 2.03 | 1.65 |\n| Rate of injuries without leave | 31.99 | 28.53 |\n| Total frequency rate | 34.02 | 30.19 |\n| Lost workdays due to accidents | 17,773 | 12,523 |\n| Severity Rate/Lost Workdays | 186 | 133 |\n| Deaths from typical accidents | 3 | 3 |\n\nR$ 146.2 million invested in 2020\n\n15% reduction in accidents with leave compared to 2019, in addition to the 11% drop in the frequency rate\n\n130,922 team members trained in occupational health and safety\nIn its relationship with communities, JBS contributes to the socioeconomic development of the regions in which it operates.

The company encourages the selective collection of cooking oil used in public schools and other collection points in Lins (SP) and region, raising awareness about the importance of recycling and proper disposal. Once collected, this oil is directed to the production of biodiesel.\n\nIn four years, the program reached 21,000 students, including children, young people, teenagers and even university students. There are 230 collection points, among which 47 are schools and charities. The money raised from the sale of the material to JBS goes to improve the institutions. In 2020, more than 3.6 million liters of used cooking oil were collected in 33 municipalities.\n\nIn 2020, during the quarantine period due to the pandemic, the Company set up a residential collection operation in order to maintain the correct disposal of the oil. It collected more than 4,000 liters, reverting the revenue generated to the health center Santa Casa de Lins, hinterland of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nSupport small livestock producers with free technical assistance, guarantee the purchase of animals and contribute to the sustainability of the Brazilian energy matrix. This is the role of JBS within the Social Biofuel Seal Program (Programa Selo Biocombust\u00edvel Social), an initiative by the Department of Family Agriculture and Cooperatives (SAF) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Farming and Supply (Mapa). Since the early days of the integration of livestock farming with the Seal in 2015, the Company has already acquired over 110,000 animals from 437 properties in the 21 municipalities served by the program in the region of S\u00e3o Miguel do Guapor\u00e9 (RO), in addition to investing around R$ 5 million in free technical assistance focused on efficient and responsible production.\n\nThe program has already guaranteed the small livestock producers involved income of around R$ 120 million. Throughout 2021, the expectation is to add 200 new producers to the program.\nIn 2020, the Company directed the program to communities to fight COVID-19, on three fronts: health, social assistance and science. Decision-making was based on evaluation by three committees, with the participation of external experts: Advisory, Science & Technology and Social. JBS put its operational structure and team members at the service of collating the donation needs of each region and its distribution logistics. By prioritizing actions aimed at the public health network, scientific development and support for NGOs, the Company leaves a legacy to society.

The Company will contribute R$ 250 million to finance the Fund\u2019s actions in its first five years, in addition to inviting its stakeholders to contribute to the initiative. JBS will match its contribution to third-party donations in the same proportion, up to the limit of R$ 500 million. The goal is to bring the fund\u2019s resources to a total of R$ 1 billion by 2030.\n\nWith this Fund, JBS intends to promote the sustainable development of the Amazon biome, promoting the conservation and sustainable use of the forest, improving the quality of life of the population residing there and developing a portfolio of quality sustainable products for the world.\nThe significant reduction in the use of natural resources in production processes is, at the same time, a goal and a practice at JBS.\nIn practice, this commitment is manifested through three aspects:\n\n> Setting of goals and monitoring of environmental indicators by a qualified, trained and dedicated team;\n> Preparation of an annual investment plan for environmental improvements and the engagement of team members and suppliers in sensitive topics to referring this issue;\n> Engagement of the priority raw material supply chain in accordance with the Company\u2019s social and environmental policies and criteria.\n\nJBS has a computerized Environmental Management System that manages environmental and sustainability indicators at production units, such as water usage, effluent generation and analysis, energy consumption, steam generation, waste generation, transportation, gas coolants, production data and indicators on greenhouse gas emissions, among others. This allows for oversight of plant performance, tying it to the goals for reducing consumption and emissions and more efficient use of natural resources. The Environmental Management System adopted at the plants is audited internally and is based on ISO 14001 specifications.\n\n**Investment in environmental management**\n\nJBS has an Investment Plan for environmental improvements. The plan is updated annually and is based on a broad environmental diagnosis carried out by the Company to identify opportunities for improving the environmental indicators of the processing units in Brazil.\n\n**R$ 387.6 million** were invested in environmental management in 2020, 67% more than in 2019\n\n**10,000+** team members received training on the subject in 2020\nThe concept of circular economy is fundamental for the sustainability of JBS\u2019 operations. That is why it has a business unit that reuses the waste generated in manufacturing processes to produce new products, JBS Novos Neg\u00f3cios. Other JBS businesses also carry out innovative improvements, which result in products with a low environmental footprint, such as JBS Couros.\n\nThe main highlights are:\n\n> **JBS Ambiental** \u2013 developed Green Flooring from plastic waste from the Company\u2019s operations. It also produces 100% of the garbage bags used at its processing units in Brazil with post-industrial waste and has developed a new shrink film to package products exported by Seara.\n\n> **JBS Biodiesel** \u2013 is the largest producer of biodiesel from beef tallow and used cooking oil, previously considered as waste, which qualified it for the sale of carbon credits \u2013 in 2020, it generated more than 430,000 Decarbonization Credits (CBios), which equivalent to preventing more than 430,000 tons of greenhouse gases (GHG).\n\n> **JBS Couros** \u2013 developed Kind Leather, whose production process reduces water consumption by 52%, by energy consumption by 62% and solid waste 93% throughout the production chain.\nIn 2020 alone, the Company invested R$ 31.9 million in improvements in the use of water in its operations. Water reuse reached 1.6 billion liters.\n\nAnother important point for the Company is the analysis of the supply risk of its units. JBS conducted a comprehensive water risk assessment at each facility, which identified the facilities at greatest risk. According to the water criticality map, 73% of JBS plants have a low or medium-low water risk level. Plants diagnosed with high risk represent only 2%.\n\nWater risk assessment is a critical element of JBS\u2019 water management strategy, allowing it to identify and prioritize projects that are locally relevant for each river basin, in addition to reducing the Company\u2019s overall impact on water.\n\n### Water withdrawn by source (m\u00b3)\n\n| Source            | 2018       | 2019       | 2020       |\n|-------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Surface water     | 35,777,742 | 39,474,812 | 40,720,148 |\n| Groundwater       | 27,377,071 | 29,693,071 | 32,052,939 |\n| Utility company   | 2,525,455  | 3,131,882  | 3,770,620  |\n| Rainwater         | 158,451    | 125,783    | 117,437    |\n| Other sources     | 0          | 609        | 0          |\n| **Total**         | **65,838,719** | **72,426,157** | **76,661,144** |\n### Volume of effluent generated and treated by type of disposal (m\u00b3)\n\n**GRI 303-4, 306-1**\n\n| Discarded quantity | 2018       | 2019       | 2020       |\n|--------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Water body         | 48,992,146 | 53,664,709 | 57,619,495 |\n| Fertigation        | 5,329,747  | 5,421,658  | 4,775,118  |\n| Public network     | 1,056,564  | 1,025,256  | 1,004,977  |\n| Other sources      | 116,629    | 63,989     | 0          |\n| **Total**          | **55,495,086** | **60,175,612** | **63,399,590** |\n\nAll effluent generated by the operations either goes to on-site treatment stations or to the sewage company\u2019s systems. In 2020, R$ 94.4 million were invested to improve on-site effluent treatment plants.\n\nThe Company constantly tracks the performance of effluent treatment plants and monitors compliance with the physical-chemical standards established by law.\n\nThe effluents generated by the operations are sent to on-site treatment stations or to sewage company\u2019s systems.\n\n83% of collected water is returned treated to the environment.\n\nThe Company reused 1.6 billion liters of water in 2020.\nThe results of initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production processes have been monitored for 12 years through annual GHG inventories, using a computerized system. The information is reported in the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program, in CDP Climatic Changes, in CDP Forests, and to the Paran\u00e1 state government, all on a voluntary basis.\n\nJBS monitors and accounts for its operations\u2019 GHG emissions and reports them within scopes 1, 2 and 3, in accordance with the international methodology of the GHG Protocol.\n\n> **Scope 1 emissions** \u2013 emissions coming from the Company\u2019s own fleets, fuels used to generate energy or heat in operations, effluent treatment ponds, use of coolant gases and CO\u2082 from enteric fermentation from animals on feedlots or Company farms, among others.\n\n> **Scope 2 emissions** \u2013 indirect energy emissions arising from the use of purchased electricity or steam.\n\n> **Scope 3 emissions** \u2013 indirect emissions resulting from the third-party fleet, commercial air travel, decomposition of waste on third-party properties and others. Emissions in this scope are therefore considered to be emissions over which the Company has no operational control or has indirect responsibility.\n\nAmong the highlights of emission reduction are the operations of JBS Biodiesel, a producer of fuel from beef tallow and used cooking oil, collected at 230 points in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. In 2020, the Company was the first Company certified to sell Decarbonization Credits (CBios) through the federal government\u2019s RenovaBio program. More than 430,000 CBios were emitted in 2020, which corresponds to the same volume in tons of CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nIn 2020, JBS Biodiesel was the first company certified to market CBios, emitting more than 430,000\nJBS is committed to reducing emissions and working hard on the transition to a low carbon economy. This positioning was recognized in 2020.\n\n**2020 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\nJBS is committed to reducing emissions and working hard on the transition to a low carbon economy. This positioning was recognized in 2020.\n\n- **CDP** \u2013 the most respected global platform for corporate sustainability information, evaluated JBS on three fronts: Climate Change; Water Security; and Forests, the latter being divided into the Wood, Cattle and Soybean categories. JBS went up from B to A- in Climate Change category, reaching the level of leadership on the topic, and from B- to B in Forests: Soybean, maintaining grade B in the other items analyzed, occupying the best position among Brazilian companies in the Food, Beverage & Tobacco sector.\n\n- **GHG Protocol Gold Seal** \u2013 the Company was awarded the seal for publishing its GHG emissions and for submitting the inventory to external verification, carried out by the certifier SGS.\n\n- **Paran\u00e1 Ouro Climate Seal** \u2013 an initiative of the government of Paran\u00e1 that recognizes the efforts of companies that voluntarily report to the State Department for Sustainable Development and Tourism (Sedest) information regarding the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The Gold Seal category is awarded to companies whose inventories have been audited.\n\n- **ICO2 Index** \u2013 JBS was once again chosen to be part of the B3 Carbon Efficient Index (ICO2 B3) portfolio, which takes into account companies\u2019 commitments to managing their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**NET ZERO 2040**\n\nGlobal warming is one of the greatest challenges in human history. As one of the world\u2019s largest food producers, JBS assumed, in 2021, the commitment to be part of the change, becoming Net Zero by 2040.\n\nJBS will zero the balance of its greenhouse gas emissions, reducing its direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3) and offsetting all residual emissions.\n\nThe Company will provide an action plan, supported by science-based targets, consistent with the criteria established by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBT) \u2013 see more at the link.\n\n**Emissions reduction**\n\nFrom 2016 to 2020 there was a 9.2% reduction in scopes 1+2 emissions by intensity in the South American operations. GRI 305-4\n\n**GHG emissions by scope (tCO\u2082e)**\n\n| Scope  | 2018       | 2019       | 2020       |\n|--------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Scope 1| 668,865.30 | 675,325.70 | 681,325.37 |\n| Scope 2| 188,385.78 | 192,253.33 | 158,383.83 |\n| Scope 3| 433,489.88 | 626,852.60 | 381,889.27 |\n\nIn 2020, GHG emissions by intensity were 3.2% lower than in 2019, considering scopes 1+2.\nIn addition to the efficient use of energy, JBS\u2019 focus is on investing in self-production and the use of renewable energy. The business engineering teams are dedicated to identifying opportunities to reduce energy use, developing eco-efficiency projects, and replacing equipment. The Company also institutes campaigns and promotes awareness training on the subject. In 2020 alone, R$ 21.7 million were invested in energy efficiency projects.\n\nThe Biolins cogeneration unit, located in the Lins Industrial Park, in the hinterland of S\u00e3o Paulo, generates thermoelectric energy and steam from biomass (sugarcane bagasse, eucalyptus chips and various biomass residues), with a generation capacity of around 45 megawatts of energy per hour, enough to supply a city with a population of 300,000. About 33% of the electricity generated supplies the plants of Friboi, JBS Couros and JBS Novos Neg\u00f3cios in the industrial complex where it is located. The remainder is distributed to JBS units and also sold to the domestic market. Steam generation, in turn, is solely used to supply adjacent JBS production plants. Biolins alone generates the equivalent of 20% of total energy used by all JBS factories in Brazil.\n\nAt the Company, the use of renewable energy represents 80% of the total consumed in its production units, and if only the Brazilian operations are considered, this number rises to 89%.\n\nIn 2020, the Company leased a photovoltaic plant to serve nine Swift stores. The expansion to another 50 stores is planned for 2021. In addition to clean energy, 75% of stores have refrigeration equipment that does not use gas and consume 40% less energy. By the beginning of the second half of 2021, 100% of the stores will have this equipment.\n\n---\n\n**Energy matrix (GJ)**\n\n|                | 2018       | 2019       | 2020       |\n|----------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| **Total**      | 54,325,648 | 49,982,588 | 35,449,911 |\n| **Renewable**  | 50%        | 56%        | 80%        |\n| **Non-renewable** | 50%        | 44%        | 20%        |\n\n*Considers as direct energy the generation of electricity, use of fuel for steam generation and thermal heating (stationary combustion) and fuel consumption for the operation of its own vehicle fleet (mobile combustion).*\nAt JBS, all areas are committed to working to recycle, reuse and reduce solid waste generated in industrial processes as efficiently as possible. All production units comply with the National Solid Waste Policy (PNRS) and waste management is based on the Solid Waste Management Plan (PGRS), created by the team members tasked with environmental duties at the unit. This plan defines procedures for collection, transportation and correct disposal, along with good practices to lower the amount of waste generated in specific points in the process.\n\nIn addition, the Company maintains a business unit dedicated to circular economy practices: JBS Ambiental, which is responsible for collecting, recycling, reusing and transforming the waste generated in the Company\u2019s operations. With an exclusive socio-ecological project, in line with determinations of the Ministry of the Environment and other environmental agencies, JBS Ambiental invests in research and new technologies to develop solutions that add value to waste. GRI 301-3\n\nPlastics are recycled and transformed into new products to be used at JBS units in the form of trash bags, plastic tarps, pallet covers, shrink wrap, pallets and injected racks, among others. Plastics are also transformed into recycled resins, to be used as raw material for the manufacture of new products. JBS Ambiental has 12 waste centers and, in 2020, processed approximately 25,000 tons of solid waste, of which 20,000 tons were recycled and returned to the supply chain. GRI 301-2\n\nOne of the main achievements in 2020 was the creation of Green Flooring. The unit has developed a process that makes it possible to transform plastic used in vacuum-wrapped raw products into interlocking flooring suitable for laying in external environments like paving for patios. It also created plastic barriers used as PPE to isolate operational team members, as a preventive measure for COVID-19. In 2020, 2,745 tons of recyclable plastic resins and 2,476 tons of recycled plastic products were produced. GRI 301-2\n\nJBS Couros has further improved the innovative Kind Leather, whose production process removes those parts of the hides not so frequently used, right at the start of the process, since this material can still serve as raw material in other industries, such as the pharmaceutical and food industries, transforming waste into raw materials and significantly contributing to the sustainability of the entire value chain. It also received the best grade in the industry by the Higg Index, an index focused on the sustainability of the fashion industry.\n\nJBS also manages post-industrial waste, which is not reused, in order to ensure it is disposed of in an environmentally correct manner.\n### Waste generated in operations (t) GRI 306-2\n\n| Waste disposal                        | 2018     | 2019     | 2020     |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Total volume of waste - non-hazardous | 1,331,588| 1,380,997| 1,306,900|\n|                                       | 97.83%   | 97.70%   | 98.49%   |\n| Total volume of waste - hazardous     | 29,530   | 32,466   | 20,096   |\n|                                       | 2.17%    | 2.30%    | 1.51%    |\n| **Total volume of waste**             | **1,361,118** | **1,413,463** | **1,326,996** |\n| 1.

For this reason, JBS encourages the return of packaging to the production chain, in an effort to contribute to recycling and diminish the impact of landfill disposal.\n\nAll Company operations invest in research and development to find ways to reduce and optimize the use of packaging, lowering the amount of waste generated by customers and consumers. Packaging meets the environmental labeling rules established by the Brazilian National Standards Organization (ABNT NBR 16182). This regulation standardizes symbols used to inform consumers on how to correctly dispose of post-consumer packaging. This makes it possible to separate dry waste from wet waste, for instance, sending them for separation followed by sorting. This contributes to ongoing improvement in the recycling chains in the various materials sectors.\n\nJBS also develops processes that reduce packaging losses and costs, 86% of which are made of materials from a renewable source. In addition, the Company supports Reverse Logistics programs to comply with the National Solid Waste Policy, such as Prolata, Programa Cidade+ and eureciclo. GRI 301-1\n\nThe main results of the implemented R&D projects are:\n\n**FRIBOI**\n- Reduction of packaging losses during production by 27% compared to 2019;\n- Packaging cost reduction of around R$ 18 million;\n- Migration of frozen products to bags without barriers, enabling the recycling of 294 tons of packaging at its final destination.\n\n**SWIFT**\n- Reduction in the thickness of cardboard boxes;\n- Reduction in the length and thickness of IQF packaging and vacuum-packed parts, with 10 tons of packaging saved;\n- Reduced the use of shrink film, with eight tons of film saved.\n\n**SEARA**\n- Use of PE resins from renewable sources in packaging structures;\n- Use of the recyclability percentage in packaging of the Al Fresco line;\n- Reduced weight of pizza packaging units by 8%;\n- Optimization and reduction of types of boxes (23 items), unifying formats;\n- Optimization of griller boxes, promoting further reductions in cardboard consumption;\n- Unification and reduction of the box area by 21% in Tangar\u00e1 da Serra (MT), generating a consumption reduction of approximately 40 tons of cardboard for the year.\nREVERSE LOGISTICS INITIATIVES\n\nThe Company, through its support for Reverse Logistics Programs in Brazil, is committed to recovering at least 22% of the volume corresponding to the packaging it places on the market.\n\nJBS supports the Program City+ (Programa Cidade+), developed and managed by the NGO Recicleiros, which advises city halls on the implementation of selective collection while enabling companies to comply with Law 12305 National Solid Waste Policy (PNRS), which also requires investment in recyclable material collectors' cooperatives through training, infrastructure, donated equipment, among others. The program is committed to recovering 22% of the contracted volume in five years.\n\nJBS is part of the Prolata Program, an initiative of the Brazilian Steel Packaging Association (Abea\u00e7o), in compliance with the PNRS since 2014. The program operates on three pillars: reception/deposit centers, with a structure to receive large volumes; cooperatives of recyclable material collectors, responsible for the work of social inclusion; and Voluntary Delivery Points (PEV), which interface with the end-consumer.\n\nIn 2020, Swift started a project to offset 100% of its commercialized packaging, with the objective of neutralizing possible impacts of its packaging, going beyond what was established by the PNRS. For this, it signed a partnership with eureciclo, a reverse logistics certifier, resulting in more than 3,000 tons of materials removed from the environment.\n\nAll products with the Swift brand will have the eureciclo seal, which is intended for companies seeking to communicate their concern and efforts to mitigate the impacts of their business on the environment.\n\nWith support for the programs, JBS has initiatives in the following states in the country:\n\n- **South:** PR, SC, RS\n- **Southeast:** SP, RJ, MG\n- **Midwest:** MS, MT, GO, DF\n- **Northeast:** BA, PB, PE, CE\n- **North:** AM, RO\nJBS respects and supports the responsible breeding of animals, based on their fundamental freedoms.\nJBS has an animal welfare program\u2014established in its production chain. Building on regulatory references, global legislation and customer codes of practice, the program is based on concept of the five fundamental freedoms of animals, published by the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) GRI FP10, FP11.\n\n**Five fundamental animal freedoms**\n\n1. Freedom from hunger and thirst\n2. Freedom from discomfort\n3. Freedom from pain, injury or disease\n4. Freedom to express normal behavior\n5. Freedom from fear and distress\n\nIn addition, JBS has an Animal Welfare Committee, responsible for establishing guidelines that improve the Animal Welfare Policies adopted, consisting of representatives from the corporate areas of Sustainability, Quality, Agriculture and Industry, among other members.\n\nAll JBS business units maintain specialized multidisciplinary teams for each animal species, as well as professionals responsible for animal welfare at the corporate level, which undergo constant improvement. They are also responsible for ensuring compliance with the policies and procedures required by animal welfare programs, for preparing and improving the Company\u2019s good practices, offering support to production units, establishing partnerships with researchers, specialized companies and universities, coordinating research and innovation projects, in addition to developing technical specifications that suppliers must adopt.\n\nAt the production units, the Company maintains multidisciplinary Quality Assurance professionals, veterinarians and corporate teams, that oversee the implementation of the animal welfare policy, from the evaluation of facilities and equipment, training programs to continuous monitoring of procedures.\n\nAll professionals in contact with animals periodically receive specific training on humane animal handling and slaughter.\n\nJBS is constantly working to reduce the use of antibiotics throughout the supply chain, so preventive use is not part of the production routine. Currently, they are given only in cases of need, always following veterinary recommendations. The use of medications is registered and tracked throughout the integrated and Company chain of poultry and pork suppliers (read more on website). GRI FP12\n\nR$ 162.9 million invested in 2020\n\n27,663 team members trained in animal welfare\nWith around 30,000 active cattle supplier farms, the Company encourages the adoption of best practices on rural properties, conducting campaigns, lectures and seminars, in addition to sponsoring supplier engagement programs. In its online platform there are technical materials on animal health and welfare prepared by the Company\u2019s own technical staff, as well as manuals on Good Management Practices of the Group of Studies and Research in Animal Ethology and Ecology (Etco Group), sponsored and re-released by JBS.\n\nWhen purchasing animals, suppliers are interviewed by the originators and sign a term of responsibility on the rational use of veterinary products, such as antibiotics and antiparasitics, as well as on the non-use of prohibited substances. Additionally, they are instructed on the best practices for preparing and loading animals.\n\nAll poultry and pigs are raised by more than 9,000 producers on farms with controlled environments, that is, with the best conditions of lighting, ventilation, humidity, temperature, bedding quality (in the case of poultry) and biosecurity. The aviary bed (covering the floor of the sheds) is made of dry, soft material that provides adequate comfort for the animals.\n\nWater quality is routinely monitored. The feed is formulated to meet all the animals\u2019 daily nutritional needs and is produced by proprietary feed factories, where the quality of the inputs is fully supervised by trained technicians.\n\nVarious procedures and controls are part of the routine procedures to ensure animal welfare parameters throughout the entire production chain. The adequacy of structures and equipment is constant and there emergency procedures have been established in case of relevant anomalies in the processes. A series of indicators are used to measure animal welfare conditions, such as: transport time; viability; foot corns; weight gain; density; and hatching. When any deviation in these parameters is verified, corrective actions are taken.\n\nSince adopting the commitment to house 100% collective gestation stalls, the Company has been working with producers to assist in the for migrating the model. By the end of 2020, the Company had 56% of females in collective gestation. It is important to note that, although the percentage meeting the commitment has decreased compared to 2019, the number of mothers in collective gestation increased significantly compared to the previous year. The decrease in the percentage was caused by contracting new producers who became part of the integration system and who for the most part, were not suited to the collective gestation system.\n\nTo learn more about animal welfare indicators and their performance, visit the JBS website.\nSeara has a detailed policy regarding the use of antibiotics. The use of medicines, vaccines and other substances not authorized by Seara is strictly prohibited, and the use of products that are not supplied by the technical assistance team is prohibited.\n\nThe responsible use of medicines and vaccines is one of the requirements listed in the Partnership Agreement, described in the Technical Guidance documents and Batch Monitoring Sheets, in addition to being reemphasized during all training sessions given by the technical team.\n\nThe Company has an internal monitoring plan for approved substances and also for molecules not allowed for use in our plants. Another important tool is the antibiograms, taken from samples collected from the farms, which help to define the best and most efficient molecules to be used. Rotation of antimicrobial molecules within the strictly approved list is also crucial to maintaining the effectiveness of treatments.\n\nBiosecurity is essential for reducing the risk of contaminants and for keeping animals healthier and improving their well-being.\n\nSeara works continuously to reduce the use of antibiotics in poultry and pig farms, improving biosecurity, vaccination schemes, cleaning and disinfection programs, use of alternative products to antibiotics, such as probiotics, organic acids, among others.\n\nAll use of antimicrobials is carried out under prescription from a veterinarian, observing the waiting period of the active ingredients, legislation, customer and market requirements, the dose and the action mechanism indicated for each active ingredient and each challenge to be treated.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that practices such as cloning and genetic engineering are not adopted in the JBS supply chain. In addition, the Company does not use any type of growth hormone, in accordance with Brazilian laws.\nThe Company constantly invests in projects to improve and modernize animal transport vehicles, as well as in the renewal of its own fleet, with the objective of increasing the safety and comfort of animals during transportation. All drivers receive training at least annually.\n\nIn Seara\u2019s live animal logistics, vehicles preferentially take the best access routes, always taking into account distance, travel time and speed along the route. The average distances are 54 km for poultry and 63 km for pigs. At Friboi, the average radius is 191.10 km, with an average transport time of 4.3 hours.\n\nFriboi has controls and targets for sourcing animals from farms close to its strategically located units. Transportation is provided both by JBS and by the service providers\u2019 own vehicles. In both cases, vehicles and drivers are periodically audited by the production unit quality assurance teams, so that the quality of the service provided is maintained and improved.\nJBS constantly invests in innovation and improvements in facilities, acquiring the best equipment and structures available on the market. In addition, it provides training for teams of specialists at the production units to monitor delivery and reception of the animals to ensure their well-being until they are sent for processing. Performance at all stages is regularly assessed and audited, internally and externally, using specific metrics.\n\nAll operations comply with local laws and technical standards, as well as the principles of animal freedom and humane slaughter. For commercial reasons, JBS adopts religious guidelines that respect the cultural characteristics and diversity of the markets in which it operates.\n\nFriboi is a pioneer in the beef processing sector in Brazil in using the camera system to monitor animal welfare indicators.\n\nSeara is committed to acquiring, by 2020, eggs as a raw material exclusively from cage-free origin. The company has fulfilled its commitment to 100% of the product portfolio. However, in December 2020, with the acquisition of Bunge\u2019s margarine and mayonnaise assets, the transition of the new products that integrated Seara\u2019s portfolio will have been completed by 2025. The volume of cage-free eggs acquired in the first semester of 2021 represents 40% of the total purchased.\n\nGLOBAL ANIMAL WELFARE RANKING\n\nThe results of the Company\u2019s initiatives in this area can be seen in The Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare (BBFAW), an annual report with a global reach on good animal welfare practices.\n\nIn 2020, JBS retained its position among the best companies in the world, in Tier 3.\n\nAnimal Welfare Certifications\n\n**BEEF**\n\n- PAACO\n- Supply Chain\n\n**POULTRY AND PORK**\n\n- Certified Humane\n- National Chicken Council Standard (NCC-PAACO)\n- International customer protocols\n\nSPECIAL PRODUCTS\n\nSeara offers three product lines that are internationally certified in animal welfare.\n\n> **Seara DaGranja** \u2013 chickens are bred by exclusive farms and fed with 100% plant-based feed. Breeding is antibiotic \u2013 and anticoccidial \u2013 free. The process is guaranteed by the traceability of the entire production chain.\n\n> **Free-range Chicken Nh\u00f4 Bento** \u2013 specially bred free-range chickens, have access to external paddocks for grazing and are raised at a higher age than traditional chickens.\n\n> **Seara Org\u00e2nico** \u2013 poultry receive a balanced, plant-based diet consisting of GMO-free, 100% organic soy bean and corn, in addition to vitamins and minerals. Animals also have free access to outside areas.\nJBS monitors, evaluates and improves compliance actions throughout the operation to foster an environment of ethics and integrity.\nTo ensure an ethical and fair environment in all of the Company\u2019s businesses, JBS monitors, evaluates and improves the compliance actions adopted through the Always Do It Right (Fa\u00e7a Sempre o Certo) program. Created in 2017 under the responsibility of the Global Compliance Board, which reports directly to the Board of Directors, the program is based on eight pillars of action:\n\n1 Risk assessment\n2 Leadership and governance\n3 Policies and Procedures\n4 JBS Ethics Line\n5 Controls\n6 Training and communication\n7 Third-party due diligence\n8 Assessment and monitoring\n\nCodes of Conduct and Ethics guide the behavior of team members, suppliers and partners, while controls have been implemented for prevention and detection that ensures uninterrupted monitoring and daily notifications of incidents of non-compliances. In 2020, the Codes were revised and expanded.\n\nAlso in 2020, the Compliance area launched a Global Anticorruption Policy, with the objective of guiding and alerting team members about the Company\u2019s guidelines and the behavior expected of them, applicable in all regions where JBS operates. The Company continued to closely scrutinize all donations made by the Good Deeds Are Good (Fazer o Bem Faz Bem) program, as well as analyzing the actions to be undertaken by the JBS Fund for the Amazon. GRI 205-1, 205-2\n\nIn Brazil, JBS has seven Ethics Committees that support and guide Compliance activities. In spite of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the area pushed ahead with remote training of team members, involving the Board of Directors, the Executive Board, administrative teams and production units. The program also enhanced the robustness of the initiatives of the Always Do It Right (Fa\u00e7a Sempre o Certo) program, with the inclusion of the topics of Conflict of Interests and Antitrust. GRI 102-25\n\nIn 2020, there were three mono-thematic training sessions, serving different target audiences: Anticorruption (third version); Conflict of Interest (first version); and Antitrust (first version). All team members received training on the Code of Conduct. GRI 205-2\n\nIn 2020, JBS also provided training for third parties in its value chain (livestock producers and integrated producers) on its Code of Conduct for Business Partners. Livestock producers were trained online, through video, and the content will be available throughout 2021. For integrated poultry and pig producers in Brazil, the training continued until April 2021 through the Company\u2019s extension agents. Training is expected to exceed 7,000 hours, and everyone is entitled to a certificate, valid for two years.\n\nThe requirements for compliance with the best sustainability and Compliance practices are relevant components for decision-making by the main players in the Brazilian and global markets. JBS wants to lead by example and ensure the evolution of the entire production chain, not just the Company.\n\nLEARN MORE\nLearn more about the Compliance program at this link\nCOMPLIANCE 2020 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n- Launch of the Global Anticorruption Policy\n- Evaluation of the Compliance program by an independent external audit, with a 97% adherence to the best practices;\n- Review and improvement of the Codes of Conduct and Ethics and the Code of Conduct for Business Partners;\n- Conflict of Interest Survey with approximately 1,200 team members (including presidents, directors and managers), focused on identifying and dealing with conflict situations to mitigate possible risks;\n- Training cycle on specific Compliance topics (Anticorruption, Antitrust and Conflict of Interests);\n- Training on the Code of Conduct and Ethics, available in different formats, developed for each audience \u2013 executives (including members of the Board of Directors and advisory committees), administrative and operational positions;\n- Hiring an international consultancy for improvements and updates to the due diligence software, with the objective of further improving the third-party reputational assessment process \u2013 more than 5,000 reputational analyzes were carried out;\n- Online third-party training on the Business Partner Code of Conduct;\n- Extensive communication through the monthly Compliance News newsletter;\n- More than 2,400 internal processes evaluated and monitored.\n\nTRAINING IN NUMBERS\n\n- 115,702 team members trained on the Code of Conduct and Ethics, totaling 50,804 hours \u2013 available for all the staff;\n- 21,228 team members trained in anticorruption practices, totaling 21,305 hours \u2013 available for the administrative staff;\n- 20,386 team members trained in conflicts of interest, totaling 20,555 hours \u2013 available for the administrative staff;\n- 683 team members trained in antitrust practices, totaling 341 hours \u2013 available for team members in strategic positions.\nThe Codes of Conduct and Ethics for team members, suppliers and partners were revised and expanded in 2020.\nThe JBS Ethics Line remained in effect and played an important role in complying with COVID-19 sanitary protocols implemented throughout the entire Company. The channel, available 24/7 since 2017 in four languages, is available to receive any reported grievances and situations that violate the Code of Conduct and Ethics.\n\nThe Company encourages the entire team to use the JBS Ethics Line, guaranteeing security and total confidentiality. For JBS, reporting bad practices represents an important value for the Company that is transmitted to team members: ownership.\n\nIn 2020, all reports received were duly processed and investigated. For valid or partially successful cases, disciplinary measures and action plans may be instigated. The Company is committed to closing more than 90% of investigations of complaints received in the channel within 60 days (read more here).\n\nSome policies guide the relationship of team members and third parties with JBS: anti-bribery and anticorruption; conflict of interests; offering and receiving gifts, promotional items, travel and entertainment; donations; sponsorships; and the JBS Ethics Line.\n\nIn 2020, the Company began updating conflict of interest situations, when all directors and managers were consulted, through questionnaires, to reassess situations dealt with in 2018. In 2021, for the first time, all coordinators will be involved in the process and will also respond to the questionnaire.\n\nRegarding political contribution and involvement, JBS does not make contributions to public bodies. Additionally, the Company advises its executives not to make political donations, even as individuals, and has notified all team members that any political manifestation must be of a personal nature and never institutional. The Company is doubly careful during elections, especially at its production units.\n\nJBS uses a due diligence system to assess the reputation of third parties, thereby ensuring greater reliability and security when hiring business partners. Supplier data is automatically cross-checked with various databases and investigation lists. The process ensures that companies and individuals whose practices are in conflict with the organization\u2019s ethical values are not hired.\n\nIn 2020, the Company hired an international consultancy to carry out improvements and updates to the software, with the objective of upgrading and further automating this third-party reputational assessment process.\n\nOver the last two years, the area completed more than 6,800 due diligence processes. If partners and other Company participants are included, the figure exceeds 36,000 in the period.\n\nThe focus of these analyses is reputational. The Compliance area has a team exclusively dedicated to carrying out the analyses, a specific policy on the subject and proprietary software developed to cover risks related to the business.\nThe right safety measures, at the right time, as well as the robust balance sheet and solid structure, helped JBS maintain the sustainability of the business in 2020, despite the uncertainties generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company continued to supply fresh and prepared products to consumers, fulfilling its responsibility in the essential food sector. In order to meet the consumption profile generated by social distancing measures, the Company reinforced the supply of its physical and online stores, offering convenience and new experiences in nutrition and flavor.\n\nIn 2020, JBS Brasil posted revenues of R$ 41.7 billion, an increase of 30.5% compared to 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was R$ 3.1 billion, which represents an increase of 77.5% over the previous year, with the EBITDA margin rising from 5.4% to 7.4% in the same period. The Company continued its constant focus on operational efficiency and on the production of food with higher added value. The Company also invested in expanding its Swift store network, which now includes Bras\u00edlia, and strengthened its relationship with retail chains through strategic partnerships with key customers in the domestic market, such as Top Grade Butcher (A\u00e7ougue Nota 10) and Gourmet Butcher 1953 Friboi (A\u00e7ougue Gourmet 1953 Friboi).\n\nIn 2020, Seara recorded net revenue of R$ 26.7 billion, an increase of 31.3% compared to 2019, with an increase of 87.5% in the adjusted EBITDA in the period, amounting to R$ 4.2 billion, and a margin of 15.8%. Seara has been reaping the fruits of investments in greater operational efficiency, quality and innovation, which has enabled the Company to launch unique products in their categories in the Brazilian market, such as the Fiesta Org\u00e2nico and the Incr\u00edvel Shredded Codfish, the first year-end parties organic and plant-based products, respectively. Seara also launched Pizza Seara Gourmet, Hot Hit Wrap Seara and new plant-based dishes in the Incr\u00edvel Seara range (read more on Innovation). The Seara brand expanded its market share by 3.4% compared to the its nearest competitor in the frozen food category, completing the second consecutive year as market leader. Seara also consolidated its position as market leader in the of portioned deli meats and frozen vegetables categories and has continued to grow in consumer preference, increasing its presence in Brazilian households. In 2020 a growth in penetration and repeat purchase rates were 7 p.p. and 5 p.p., respectively. The company also acquired the assets of Bunge\u2019s margarine and mayonnaise businesses (read more on Our Businesses).\nJBS is always attentive to market opportunities and trends, with a business strategy in line with sustainability.

We provide information about our product options, their nutritional content and the various production methods used during rearing, such as traditional, antibiotic-free and organic. Additionally, our product offerings include options such as reduced fat, reduced sodium and no artificial preservatives, among other. To meet the expectations of our customers and the dynamic lifestyles of our consumers, we engage in continuous dialogue to ensure we provide innovative products that align with their values and meet their needs.\n\nOur Management Approach\n\nThe corporate marketing teams at JBS USA are responsible for developing customer and consumer information. Marketing efforts are led by the Director of Marketing or Chief Marketing Officer, for each business unit, who reports to the President of the business unit or the Vice President of Retail Sales, Pricing and Marketing. These teams conduct their work in accordance with our Responsible Marketing Policy.\n\nWe primarily sell our products to customers who market our product directly to consumers, through foodservice or retail channels. As such, the majority of our marketing information is focused toward these customers.\nTo enhance our ability to more effectively communicate about our diverse product offerings, we have assembled a variety of comprehensive, easy-to-use resources for our customers and consumers to learn more about our products. To facilitate ease of use, we organize customer and consumer resources into protein-specific, customer-focused and consumer-focused websites and communication channels.\n\nMany of our business units have developed customer resource websites, which allow each customer to create a personalized account. Through these accounts, customers gain access to information on point-of-sale materials, packaging specifications, brands, premium programs, value-added products, food safety and quality and the way the animal was raised.\n\nWe also maintain brand-specific websites and social media channels where consumers can learn more about our products and brands. Many of our consumers are active on social media and engage with us through these forums, as well as through our websites\u2019 \u201cContact Us\u201d forms to learn more about the brand and gain a better understanding of the production practices utilized.\n\nWe target our social media posts to geographically align with our current distribution, so that consumers can easily learn more about the products they have access to. Through these channels, we provide recipes, basic cooking instructions and nutritional information. On our websites, consumers have the ability to search for recipes by cut or cook method. We also provide product allergen information and recommended food safety handling practices for our food products.\n\nTo facilitate ease of use, we organize customer and consumer resources into protein-specific, customer-focused and consumer-focused websites and communication channels.\n\n**Nutrition Information**\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3 | 417-1\n\n100% of JBS USA products adhere to Federal labeling requirements. Except where specifically exempt, all of our product labels and/or packaging include product name, handling statement, legend, establishment number, net weight, ingredients statement, signature line and (when required) a nutritional facts panel. In addition, validated cooking instructions are included on applicable products.\n\n**Consumer Hotlines**\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3 | 417-1\n\nIn addition to our websites and social media platforms, consumer-specific phone lines and email accounts offer another venue for transparency and customer service. Through these communication channels, our teams monitor direct product feedback, interact with consumers to address questions or concerns, maintain a database to track trends and provide performance reports to team members. In 2020, the trending topics our teams addressed included animal handling, product quality, labeling claims, cooking instructions and where to purchase our products.\n\nGRI 102-43, 102-44\nFor the past decade, JBS USA has produced safe, nutritious, healthy, high-quality food products that are enjoyed by consumers around the globe. Our commitment to excellence begins with exceptional quality control standards that are embedded throughout our operations. JBS USA\u2019s primary distribution channels are through retailers, foodservice distributors and restaurants, as well as exports to customers around the globe.\n\nWe are proud to provide our customers and consumers with choices that meet their nutritional needs and ethical expectations.\n\nFueled by consumer insights and market research, we continue to invest in the innovation and diversity of our product offerings. Our product portfolio is closely aligned with consumer trends and needs, and we continue to explore new products and packaging solutions, while maintaining the high-quality standards that our consumers have come to expect and enjoy.\n\nOur Commitment\n\nFood safety is the heart of our business. We continually review every aspect of our daily operations to make sure we provide safe, high-quality, nutritious products for our customers and consumers.\nIn each country where we operate, local government officials provide oversight related to food safety and quality. All JBS USA team members recognize that producing safe, healthy, wholesome products is our responsibility, and our more than 2,800 global FSQA team members help us accomplish this mission.\n\nIn the U.S., the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) inspect every JBS USA production facility daily to ensure that our food products meet federal food safety standards.\n\nIn Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) regularly inspects and actively monitors our facility to ensure compliance with federal food safety standards.\n\nIn Australia, the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR) representatives are permanently located at our export facilities and perform inspections of our facilities daily to ensure that we are meeting all federal food safety and overseas markets requirements.\n\nIn Europe, our production facilities are inspected and third-party audited according to the European Union Food Hygiene regulations and any additional customer quality requirements to verify compliance.\n\nIn Mexico, we follow the best practice guidelines for chicken production as defined by the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) and the National Service for Agro-Alimentary Public Health, Safety and Quality (SENASICA). Additionally, most of Pilgrim\u2019s facilities in Mexico have a Federally Inspected Type (TIF) certification.\n\nThe JBS USA management structure for Food Safety and Quality Assurance (FSQA) is designed to ensure industry-leading performance and corporate oversight at the highest level. The team is led by the Global Head of Food Safety and Quality Assurance, who oversees the company\u2019s global food safety efforts.\n\nThe Heads of FSQA (also referred to in some business units as the Heads of Technical Services and Quality Assurance) oversee the food safety and quality assurance programs as well as regulatory compliance for each business unit. They report directly to the President of their respective business units and work collaboratively with the Global Head of Food Safety and Quality Assurance. Each JBS USA facility has a FSQA Manager and FSQA team who, in our Fed and Regional Beef business units, report to the Head of FSQA; in the Pilgrim\u2019s U.S., Australia and Primo business units, report to the FSQA Director for their line of the business; and in all other business units, report to the production facility manager. This streamlined reporting structure demonstrates the high priority we place on food safety and quality assurance, allowing JBS USA to quickly and efficiently implement action-oriented decisions on a daily basis, if necessary.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, the Food Safety and Quality Advisory Committee is responsible for providing oversight and guidance to our food safety and quality assurance programs as well as regulatory compliance. The committee is comprised of senior JBS USA and Pilgrim\u2019s team members, as well as academicians who specialize in the areas of animal science, meat science, epidemiology, food microbiology and veterinary medicine. The committee includes the Heads of FSQA in each JBS USA and Pilgrim\u2019s business unit, along with nine industry experts, including Drs. Gary Smith and Keith Belk from Colorado State University, Drs. H. Russell Cross, Kerri Gehring and Jeff Savell from Texas A&M University, Dr. Guy Loneragan from Texas Tech University, Dr. Mike Apley from Kansas State University, Dr. Chuck Hofacre from University of Georgia and Dr. Lynn McMullen from the University of Alberta, Canada.\nFood safety starts with the health and well-being of the live animal. No matter the production system deployed, the health and welfare of our animals remains our priority, and we are committed to providing proper nutrition and full-service veterinary care to our livestock and poultry. Please see our Animal Care chapter for additional information on this topic.\n\nThe robust food safety and quality program that each JBS USA production facility operates under consists of Standard Operating Procedures, Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) procedures and validated technology interventions that are designed to eliminate or reduce foodborne pathogens.\n\nEach of these processes are monitored by team members trained in food safety and quality assurance, as well as government officials, in each production facility. Additionally, inspection and process verification by government officials occur before the mark of inspection can be placed on products entering into commerce.\n\nFurther to this, our production facilities implement these additional programs:\n\n- A written Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) program\n- A recall/market withdrawal procedure, which provides for trace-back and trace-forward capabilities to ensure that the proper products and dates can be identified, if necessary\n- A livestock certification program that requires all cattle producers to certify compliance with federal regulations (in our beef processing facilities)\n- A documented Pest Control Program\n- A documented Food Security Program\n- Annual certification to the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standards; to date this is done for 100% of our fresh processing facilities in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia and 71% of our Mexico facilities\n- Insured and bonded carriers are required to transport meat and poultry products\u2014where all loads are sealed at the originating establishment and maintained under seal by the carrier in the event of a multi-stop load\n\nWe also make key investments in technology and innovation which continues to strengthen our ability to ensure our products meet the highest quality standards.\nAll new team members receive training on quality assurance (QA) and food safety management systems when they are hired and additional job-specific training as necessary. In addition, QA team members are provided with specific HACCP, as well as additional food safety and quality assurance training every year.\n\nEach year, we conduct numerous food safety and quality system audits using accredited, independent auditing firms. One-hundred percent of our fresh production facilities in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia and 71% of our Mexico operations have been audited and certified by audit schemes recognized by the GFSI, one of the most stringent food safety-related audits available to the food industry. Internal audits and inspections are also conducted by our FSQA team members.\n\nAdditionally, in North America, all of our suppliers who provide products or services that have direct contact with food must pass the ISNetworld and GFSI audits and provide a letter of guarantee.\n\nEven though we have comprehensive systems in place to provide our consumers with safe, high-quality foods, instances can and have occurred where a product recall is necessary to protect public health. When a recall is warranted, JBS USA voluntarily initiates the recall, collaborating with federal regulatory partners to make sure that all affected product is promptly tracked and removed from distribution channels. To inform our customers and consumers of a recall, we issue a notice that follows government guidelines for communication. In the U.S., recall information is also posted on the USDA FSIS or FDA websites. In Australia, recall information is communicated on the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) website.\n\nRecalls are rare, and we work diligently to understand how they were caused and how to prevent future incidents. We perform comprehensive root-cause analyses and share our learnings across JBS USA. As an independent third-party auditor, the GFSI verifies the effectiveness of our corrective actions.\n2020 Progress\nGRI 416-1\n\nJBS USA\u2019s objective is to have a world-class food safety quality systems platform that provides confidence to our customers and consumers and ensures the integrity of all of our products.\n\nPERCENT OF FRESH PROCESSING FACILITIES CERTIFIED BY INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY AUDITS ACCORDING TO GFSI STANDARDS\n\n| Country                                      | Percentage |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|\n| U.S. (Beef, Pork, Pilgrim\u2019s and Retail Ready) | 100%       |\n| Australia                                    | 100%       |\n| Canada                                       | 100%       |\n| Mexico                                       | 71%        |\n| Europe                                       | 100%       |\n\n2020 KEY FACTS AND FIGURES\n\n100% of our U.S., Canadian, European and Australian fresh processing facilities are Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certified\n\n100% of our food products adhere to federal labeling requirements\n\n>100 countries on six continents are served by JBS USA\n\n>2,800 global Food Safety and Quality Assurance (FSQA) team members\nA passion for innovation sits at the core of JBS USA \u2013 it\u2019s the key to unlocking greater value from our products and adding flavor to consumers\u2019 lives.

Direct responsibility for decision making on the economic, social and environmental sustainability topics reside with the Head of Corporate Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), who reports directly to the CEO. Our Independent Advisory Board discusses and advises the JBS USA executive team on policies, procedures, impacts, risks and opportunities in addressing economic, environmental and social topics. The Independent Advisory Board reviews, at least annually, our policies, activities, and reporting regarding sustainability, and discusses our management of risks in those areas. The Corporate Sustainability Department in each region reports to the president of the business unit or directly to the CSO. These corporate sustainability teams partner with subject matter experts on our corporate environmental, team member health and safety, animal welfare and food safety, and quality assurance teams who support facility level leaders and work in partnership to improve our sustainability performance on the ground.\n\nGRI 102-22\n\nOUR SUSTAINABILITY TEAM LEADERS\n\nCameron Bruett\nHead of Corporate Affairs and CSO, JBS USA\n\nMadison Boyd\nDirector of ESG, JBS USA\n\nJessica Langley\nDirector of Sustainability, JBS USA & Pilgrim\u2019s US\n\nMark Ritsema\nHead of Environmental Sustainability, JBS USA\n\nLeon Felipe Moya Daumas\nInstitutional Affairs Manager, Pilgrim\u2019s Mexico\n\nDeclan Cunningham\nHead of Sustainability and Risk Management, Pilgrim\u2019s Park\n\nMatt Dight\nHead of Sustainability, Pilgrim\u2019s UK\n\nSam Churchill\nGroup Manager Sustainability, JBS Australia\n\nRob Meijer\nHead of Business Development, Marketing and Sustainability, JBS Canada\nThe nature of our business demands we work with a diverse set of suppliers that range from small family farm and ranch partners who supply us with livestock and poultry to large, multinational companies that manufacture and provide materials and services for our production facilities. We work in partnership with over 77,000 suppliers to ensure the highest-quality inputs.\n\nOur vendors are part of JBS USA\u2019s supply chain and contribute to our overall sustainability. Impacts related to the environmental and social pillars of sustainability differ for each of our unique suppliers based on the material they manufacture, the species of livestock or poultry they raise, and the service they provide. Our ability to directly affect these impacts is often outside of our immediate control; however, we strive to partner with suppliers who share our values and mission to achieve a more sustainable food supply.\n\nAs part of our efforts to minimize impacts in the supply chain, we developed a Supplier Code of Conduct. It ensures that suppliers meet or exceed our high standards when conducting business with JBS USA. The code covers human rights, forced labor, freedom of association and collective bargaining, minimum age for employment, equal employment opportunity, employment practices, health and safety, environmental issues and business integrity, which includes anticorruption and bribery. We have reminded all of our contracted suppliers of our code of conduct and reiterated the importance of compliance.

We understand that our responsibility spans beyond production under our direct control and that we must collaborate with our supplier partners to improve the overall sustainability of our supply chain.\n\n**Our Management Approach**\n\nGRI 103-2, 103-3 | 204-1, 414\n\nProcurement for JBS USA, excluding livestock, is centralized through our corporate offices. The Head of Procurement leads several teams that are each responsible for certain products or services related to Packaging, Ingredients, Employee and Corporate Services, Energy, Facilities Services, Capital Expenditure and Equipment, and Maintenance, Repair and Operations. This structure allows us to maximize our supplier partnerships across the business and ensure consistency and uniformity.\n\nOur approach to managing impacts within our supply chain includes consistent collaboration with our suppliers. All suppliers are contractually obligated to follow state laws and regulations. We also establish long-term relationships built on trust and shared values that contribute to continued progress both in our sourcing programs and sustainability goals.\nAll suppliers providing products or services that have direct contact with food are required to pass the ISNetworld and either Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) or British Retail Consortium (BRC) audits, or an equivalent certification and provide a letter of guarantee, or be assessed and approved by our Supplier Quality Team. Supplier Quality Team approval requirements for our raw material and food contact materials suppliers are based on a risk assessment that may include certification to a GFSI recognized scheme and / or an audit performed by a quality food safety auditor, and / or a completed JBS supplier questionnaire that confirms product safety, traceability and good manufacturing practices are in place. We defer to organizations like GFSI and BRC to evaluate the effectiveness of audits, collect feedback and make related adjustments. The letter of guarantee certifies that the food products are safely produced and are of consistent quality. We also require these suppliers to undergo an additional audit to confirm they\u2019ve met these requirements.\n\nWe evaluate all potential suppliers based on several criteria, including compliance, commercial offering, supply flexibility and responsiveness, service, risk management, quality, price, reliability, financial capability, reputation and experience. We recognize that sourcing products, ingredients and services from within our communities helps further support local economies.\n\n2020 Progress\n\nWe are proud to partner with suppliers to ensure the quality, consistency and safety of our products. In the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada, we have approximately 8,070 service providers and vendors with the average partnership spanning nine years. In Mexico, we work with over 2,000 service providers and vendors and our average partnership length is approximately seven years. In Europe, we partnered with more than 5,300 service providers and vendors for an average of more than seven years. In Australia, we have approximately 6,050 service providers and vendors.\n\nIn 2020, our U.S., Puerto Rican and Canadian teams purchased products and services worth more than US$ 299 million from minority-owned businesses.\n\nPERCENT PURCHASING VOLUME SPENT ON CONTRACTS WITH MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESSES*\n\n*Includes all U.S., Puerto Rican and Canadian facilities.\nIn 2020, JBS USA Beef (including JBS US Beef and JBS Canada) purchased more than seven million head of cattle from approximately 31,000 family farm and ranch partners, paying them US$ 11.2 billion to supply our 10 beef production facilities. JBS Australia purchased approximately 3.9 million head of livestock, including cattle, lambs, sheep, goats and veal calves, to supply its 12 production facilities, paying their 41,000 producer partners more than US$ 2.2 billion. In 2020, approximately 6% of the cattle JBS Australia purchased was sourced from one of our six JBS Australia feedlots. Pilgrim\u2019s UK purchased more than 300,000 lambs from 420 family farm partners for more than US$ 13 million.\n\n**JBS USA Beef***\n\n- **>7.6MM** head of cattle purchased\n- **>30,800** family farm and ranch partners\n- **>US$ 11.2B** paid to our family farm and ranch partners\n\n*Includes beef facilities in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n**JBS Australia**\n\n- **>3.9MM** head of livestock purchased\n- **>41,000** family farm partners\n- **>US$ 2.2B** paid to our family farm partners\n\n---\n\n**GRI 204-1, FP9**\n\n**SUSTAINABILITY REPORT - JBS 2020**\n\n**BEEF AND LAMB SUPPLIERS**\n\n---\n\n---\nOur JBS US Fed Beef, Regional Beef, JBS Canada, Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park, Pilgrim\u2019s UK and JBS Australia North and South business units each have unique requirements for selecting family farm and ranch partners to supply our beef and lamb. Open dialogue and strong relationships with our family farm and ranch partners are conduits for success across our supply chain. We define a \u201cfamily farm or ranch\u201d as any farm or ranch organized as a sole proprietorship, partnership or family corporation where the majority of the business is owned and controlled by a person and his or her relatives.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, all cattle suppliers are required to sign an affidavit indicating their compliance with governmental regulations, certification of Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) or an equivalent animal-welfare certification program.\n\nIn the U.S., we encourage our feedyard partners to enter the precompetitive National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association (NCBA) Feedyard Assessment Database. Enrollment is voluntary and demonstrates a producer\u2019s commitment to environmental stewardship, animal care and quality. Approximately 62% of our feedyard partners participate to date. We also third-party verify 35% of our fed cattle supply according to the BQA Feedyard Assessment.\n\nIn Australia, all livestock that are consigned for sale are required to have a National Vendor Declaration (NVD), a document verifying Australian meat and livestock food-safety, as well as the product\u2019s origin. In signing the NVD, the producer declares compliance with the Livestock Producer Assurance (LPA), an independently audited on-farm food-safety certification program. The NVD contains information relevant to the husbandry of livestock consigned for harvest. In addition, before livestock leave their farm of birth, they must be tagged with an approved National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) device. This allows animal movements to be recorded in a national database and provides the assurance of livestock trace-back to the property of birth and trace-forward from the property of birth.\n\nOur Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park Orl\u00e9ans business purchases beef for further processing. They only source beef from approved suppliers that are audited annually for food safety and animal welfare. They also developed contracting initiatives with French beef farmers associations to ensure available supply. In a declining French cattle market, this provides farmers an alternative to an otherwise volatile and uncertain market. This program has the following attributes:\n\n- Ensures Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park Beef Orl\u00e9ans supplies of available animals\n- Provides a set price, independent of market fluctuations, to improve economic efficiency and income security for all, including engaged farmers\n- Requires farmers have a market and a medium to long-term production plan\n- Enhances production of cattle from farms that meet the Charter of Good Breeding Practices\nAt JBS USA, we serve a broad customer base that requires diverse types of beef and lamb products.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s Moy Park Beef Orl\u00e9ans also encourages its suppliers to purchase cattle from farms involved in Charte des Bonnes Pratiques d\u2019\u00e9levage (Good Farming Practices) agreement. The Good Farming Practices, established by the National Livestock Confederation (CNE), is the approved industry standard. Meat from the Netherlands and Ireland also meet requirements set out by the Good Farming Practices. This contributes to making sure 100% of our 1,600 contracted farm partners are audited for animal welfare and environmental performance.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s UK provides the only fully dedicated lamb supply chain in the U.K., partnering with our network of 450 dedicated sheep farmers \u2014 some of these partners have been with us for over 25 years. Our farmer partners are located in Wales and West Country of England. These regions are renowned for their grass conditions, making them an ideal location for extensive lamb production. All Pilgrim\u2019s Tulip lamb producers are Farm Assured and raise lambs according to our higher-than-industry standards. Our standards are independently audited by Farm Assurance Assessors. Our lamb producer partners also complete a Responsible Efficient Production Assessment biannually. This assessment evaluates the farm\u2019s production, health, welfare and environmental standards.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s UK sources two specific breeds of lamb, Dorset and Abervale. Dorset is preferred as they naturally breed lamb all year, enabling us to organically raise enough lamb to meet customer demand, year-round. Whereas Abervale is classified as Guaranteed Tender rams and is selected based on muscle density.\n\nAt JBS USA, we serve a broad customer base that requires diverse types of beef and lamb products. To fulfill these requests, we have multiple branded beef and lamb programs that have varying requirements and certifications to meet our compliance standards.\nBRANDED BEEF AND LAMB PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Cattle have been fed a high-energy cereal-based vegetarian diet for a minimum of 100 days\n- Cattle have been raised according to Global GAP standards\n- Cattle will be AusMeat YG cipher (30 months of age) or less at slaughter\n- Cattle have been raised without the use of hormones\n- Cattle treated with any antibiotics will serve the minimum prescribed Export Slaughter Interval (ESI) prior to slaughter\n\n- Cattle are sourced from properties and comply with the USDA NOP Organic Certification standard\n- Cattle have never received growth promotants of any kind\n- Cattle have never been administered antibiotics\n- Cattle have never been fed genetically modified ingredients\n- Cattle will be AusMeat S cipher (42 months of age) or younger at the time of slaughter\n\n- Cattle have never received growth promotants of any kind\n- Cattle have never been administered antibiotics\n- Cattle have a minimum of 50% Red or Black Angus genetics with no Dairy or Brahman influence\n- Cattle were born and raised in the U.S. and verified through cattle origin or brand ID on affidavit\n- Cattle were raised in compliance with the Certified HumaneTM Farm Animal Care Standards for beef cattle\n- Cattle have been fed a 100% vegetarian diet and have never been fed animal byproducts\n- Cattle will be less than 30 months of age at slaughter\n- A minimum of 10% of suppliers are inspected annually for compliance with a JBS USA representative or a third party\n\n- Cattle have been fed a high-energy cereal-based vegetarian diet for a minimum of 100 days\n- Cattle will be AusMeat PR cipher (42 months of age) or less at slaughter\n- Cattle treated with any antibiotics will serve the minimum prescribed Export Slaughter Interval (ESI) prior to slaughter\n\n- Cattle have been fed a 100% vegetarian diet\n- Cattle have never been given added hormones and have not been administered antibiotics within 300 days of harvest\n- Cattle are purebred and U.S. born and raised\nWe have multiple branded beef and lamb programs that have varying requirements and certifications to meet our compliance standards.\n\n- Cattle are 100% grass fed and grass finished\n- Cattle have never been fed grain, have had continuous access to pasture during the growing season and are fed stored forages during the winter months\n- Cattle have never been fed animal byproducts\n- Producers must provide cattle affidavit upon arrival at harvest to prove cattle were raised in compliance with our strict program protocols\n- A third-party company, Where Food Comes From, verifies producers remain compliant\n\n- Cattle and lambs have been raised in accordance with JBS Farms Assurance Program\n- Cattle and lambs have been fed a 100% grass diet\n- Cattle and sheep have been raised without the use of hormones, antibiotics or GMOs\n- Cattle will be AusMeat YP cipher (36 months of age) or less at slaughter\n- Cattle will not contain any Bos Indicus or dairy breed content\n\n- Cattle and lambs have been raised in accordance with JBS Farms Assurance Program\n- Cattle have been fed a 100% grass diet\n- Cattle have been raised without the use of hormones, antibiotics or GMOs\n- Cattle will be AusMeat YP cipher (36 months of age) or less at slaughter\n- Cattle will not contain any Bos Indicus or dairy breed content\n\n- Cattle and lambs have been raised in accordance with JBS Farms Assurance Program\n- Cattle have been fed a 100% grass diet\n- Cattle have been raised without the use of hormones, antibiotics or GMOs\n- Cattle will be AusMeat YP cipher (36 months of age) or less at slaughter\n- Cattle will not contain any Bos Indicus or dairy breed content\n\n- Cattle have been raised without the use added hormones\n- Cattle are of Angus heritage\n- Cattle are less than 30 months at harvest\n- Cattle are grass fed, grain finished\n- Cattle are Canadian born and raised\n\n- Cattle have been raised without the use of antibiotics or added hormones\n- Cattle have been feed 100% vegetarian diet and have never been feed animal byproducts\n\n- Cattle will be AusMeat YG cipher (30 months of age) or less at slaughter\n- Cattle will be fed a minimum of 70 days on a grain ration\n- Cattle treated with any antibiotics will serve the minimum prescribed Export Slaughter Interval (ESI) prior to slaughter\n\n- Certified Organic by Quality Assurance International\n- Cattle have been raised without the use of antibiotics or added hormones\n- Cattle have been fed a GMO-free diet\nIn 2019, we became the first U.S. beef company to achieve recognition across our supply chain in the cow-calf, feedyard/finisher and processing segments from the U.S. Beef Industry Sustainability Framework. The Framework is widely adopted throughout the industry and outlines the key areas of sustainability and improvement across the U.S. beef value chain. It is comprised of high-priority indicators, sector specific metrics and sustainability assessment guidelines.\nPORK SUPPLIERS\n\nJBS USA Pork\n\n>24.7MM hogs purchased\n\n>630 family farm partners\n\nUS$ 3.3B paid to family farm partners\n\nPilgrim\u2019s UK\n\n>2.3MM hogs purchased\n\n850 family farm partners\n\nUS$ 432MM paid to family farm partners\n\nJBS Australia\n\n>36K hogs purchased\n\n18 producer partners\n\n>US$ 7.4MM paid to family farm partners\nIn 2020, our U.S. based business purchased more than 24.7 million hogs from approximately 630 family farmers for US$ 3.3 billion to supply our five U.S. pork production facilities. Approximately 14% of our total hog supply in the U.S. is sourced from our own live pork business unit. Pilgrim\u2019s UK sourced more than 2.3 million hogs from 850 family farm partners and paid them more than US$ 432 million. Approximately 65% of our hogs are sourced from our integrated supply chain. In Australia, we purchased 36,000 hogs from 18 independent farmers for US$ 7.4 million.\n\nIn the U.S., we require all family farm partners supplying hogs to our facilities to be certified in accordance with the Pork Quality Assurance Plus (PQA+) Program. We conduct third party audits of select partners according to the PAACO-certified Common Swine Industry Audit. We also conduct internal animal welfare audits on a specific subset of our suppliers.\n\nHogs for sale in Australia are branded with a unique farm identification number. The PigPass national tracking system provides real time information on the movements of all pigs in Australia including which farm they came from. A PigPass National Vendor Declaration (PigPass NVD) form must be completed when pigs are moved between properties. The Australian Pork Industry Quality Assurance Program (APIQ) audits and accredits farms and maintains the data base for PigPass.\n\nThis allows animal movements to be recorded in a national database and provides the assurance of livestock trace-back to the property of birth and trace-forward from the property of birth. All hogs are sourced from Australia Pork Industry Quality Assurance Program (APIQ) accredited farms, maintaining industry best-practice animal welfare standards.\n\nOur Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park Business purchases pork for further processing from approved suppliers who are audited annually for compliance with our food safety and animal welfare standards.\n\nOur Pilgrim\u2019s UK hogs are raised in accordance with the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the Red Tractor or the Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) standards. Certification and third-party audits according to these standards are required to sell hogs to Pilgrim\u2019s UK production facilities. In a privately commissioned, standalone assessment Pilgrim\u2019s UK was awarded the highest rating, Tier 1, for its animal welfare standards within the Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare (BBFAW) category. In addition, Pilgrim\u2019s UK is a signatory to the Cerrado Manifesto, and a member of the UK Roundtable for Sustainable Soy. Finally, soya sourced to feed Pilgrim\u2019s UK-owned, high welfare pigs is certified by the Roundtable for Responsible Soy.\n\nJBS USA Pork serves a broad customer base that requires diverse types of pork products. To fulfill these requests, we have branded pork programs that have varying requirements and certifications to meet our compliance standards.\n\nBRANDED PORK PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS\n\n- No antibiotics ever\n- No growth stimulants\n- 100% vegetarian diet\n- Natural \"no artificial ingredients, minimally processed\"\n- Product of USA\n\n- RSCPA Assured\n- Outdoor bred\n- High welfare\n- Hogs born and raised in the UK\n- Hogs have never received growth promotants of any kind\n- Ranked Tier 1 in an independent assessment by BBFAW\n- Hogs diets formulated to reduce Soya\nIn 2020, Pilgrim\u2019s partnered with more than 4,900 U.S., Puerto Rican, Mexican and European family farm partners and paid them more than US$ 1.5 billion to raise our chickens. In the U.S., we work in partnership with family farmers to raise our chickens; we also provide poultry and feed, as well as technical and veterinary services. In Europe and Mexico, we own poultry facilities, in addition to working with family farmers. Our family farm partners maintain Pilgrim\u2019s standards of excellence.\n\nIn 2020, our family farm partners raised more than 2.2 billion chickens, according to our Animal Welfare Program.\n\nIn the U.S., we audit a subset of our U.S. family farm partners according to the Animal Welfare Program requirements, conducted by internal Professional Animal Auditor Certification Organizations (PAACO) certified team members and external, third-party auditors.\nIn Mexico, every farm is audited in compliance with Mexican government standards, including Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (SADER), Mexico-United States Commission for the Prevention of Diseases and Other Exotic Animal Diseases (CPA), Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA), Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) and State Civil Protection.\n\nIn Europe, all poultry farms are Red Tractor approved, and our farms meet or exceed the Red Tractor or equivalent welfare standards. Farms are audited by independent, approved certification bodies.\n\nIn addition, for purchased meats, Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park operates under a Policy for Supply Chain Assurance, ensuring that meat products come from approved suppliers who at a minimum meet the Red Tractor or another equivalent standard.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s Moy Park has also established a Responsible Sourcing Soy Policy for the soy feed given to our chickens. While deforestation and responsible sourcing of soy continues to be an evolving issue, Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park believes that maintaining a policy is an important and valuable tool that helps drive progress toward our broader sustainability objectives. Additionally, this initiative is crucial as we build trust among our customers, team members, investors and other stakeholders. Ultimately this strengthens our credibility as a responsible organization committed to developing our business in a sustainable and ethical way. We also continue to enhance and develop our Responsible Sourcing agenda and work diligently with our supply chain partners to increase transparency in sourcing practices. This is especially important around the use of deforestation-free soy in the supply chain of the feed for our chickens and in our products.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s serves a broad customer base that requires diverse types of chicken products. To fulfill these requests, we have branded poultry products that have varying requirements and certifications to meet our compliance standards.\n\n**BRANDED CHICKEN PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS**\n\n- Farm has passed the American Humane Certified\u2122 Farm Program assessment based on a list of more than 200 standards unique to chickens\n- Chickens have been fed 100% vegetable- and grain-based diet\n- Chickens have never been given antibiotics\n- Certified USDA Organic\n- Chickens have been fed 100% vegetable- and grain-based diet\n- Chickens have never been given antibiotics\n- Chickens have never been given antibiotics\n- Chickens have never been given antibiotics\nJBS\u2019s practices and initiatives to play a leading role in the movement to promote a more inclusive society\nThe success of our company starts with the success of our people.

All management policies and programs are annually reviewed by management teams, and specific team member issues are reviewed weekly or as frequently as necessary to address issues.\n\nTo ensure that our policies and programs are functioning correctly, JBS USA measures and evaluates health and safety, turnover, absenteeism and overtime indicators each week. This allows us to make immediate adjustments if necessary and ensure team member health, safety and working conditions are upheld according to JBS standards across all facilities.\n\nWe operate all our facilities in compliance with labor and human rights laws. We also adhere to strict internal policies and programs that provide additional guidance to best serve our team members. The company has a zero-tolerance policy on child or forced labor. Our background check policy does support re-entry into the workforce of persons with a criminal record dependent on several factors including the assessment of potential risks and liabilities, the \u201cnature and gravity\u201d of the individual\u2019s criminal offense or conduct and the nature of the duties and essential function of the position sought. JBS USA does not permit degrading conditions in the workplace that could put our team members\u2019 health or lives at risk. We uphold all applicable wage and hour laws, such as minimum wage and overtime compensation, and all legally mandated benefits. For our hourly team members, we do a competitive wage analysis two times per year, and for salaried team members, we do a competitive wage analysis one time per year to ensure we are paying competitively for where they work and live. Salaries are adjusted as necessary based on these competitive wage analyses. We also respect our team members\u2019 rights of association, of joining labor unions and of collective bargaining. In 2020, 57% of our team members working in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, 90% in Canada, 86% in Mexico and 46% in Europe were covered by collective bargaining agreements, and 77% of team members in Australia and New Zealand were covered by collective bargaining agreements or Modern Federal Awards.\n\nJBS USA measures and evaluates health and safety, turnover, absenteeism and overtime indicators each week.\n\nTo maintain a culture of trust and respect, we offer opportunities for our team members to provide and receive feedback during roundtable or town hall meetings. Team members from every department are invited to meet with management and ask questions, express concerns and present solutions. Team members are reminded of our Open Door Policy at all meetings. Minutes are taken during each meeting and follow-up plans are made for any identified action items. We address all action items within a reasonable time frame and provide feedback to any team members who raised concerns.\nBUILDING A DIVERSE AND DEDICATED WORKFORCE\n\nGRI 102-43, 103-2, 103-3 | 201-1, 401-2, 403-6, 405-1, 406-1\n\nOur Commitment\n\nAt JBS USA, diversity is one of our greatest strengths, and we know that the success of our company depends on the collective skills, backgrounds and experiences of our team members. By treating our team members with dignity and respect, and by promoting diversity and inclusion, we strive to create a trusting and productive workplace.\n\nOur Management Approach\n\nDue to the various locations of our facilities and our large, diverse workforce composed of team members of different ethnicities and national origins, JBS USA faces unique communication challenges. As many as 60 different languages are spoken at any one facility. To ensure that all team members can express themselves and understand key messages, we provide company materials in various languages and dialects. This includes team member information such as benefits, safety instructions and new hire and continuous training materials. In addition, each facility offers unlimited access to Language Lines, which provides more than 200 languages and creates immediate access to clear communication across our facilities. JBS works diligently to accommodate the cultural needs of all of our team members. We encourage all facilities to evaluate the effectiveness of their accommodations and to identify the best approaches to address their unique situations.\n\nWe empower all facilities to work within their communities to recruit and retain diverse team members. Our local teams aim to hire and employ a workforce that represents the communities where they live and work. As a contractor to the U.S. federal government, we maintain affirmative action programs to implement our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and work to identify opportunities for improvement, such as partnering with universities to recruit talent.\n\nJBS USA also actively partners with the U.S. federal government to guarantee a lawful and legal workforce. Since 2012, JBS USA has participated in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Mutual Agreement between Government and Employers (IMAGE) program. The IMAGE program promotes voluntary compliance with employment authorization provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and assists in the prevention of the hiring or continued employment of people who are not authorized to work in the U.S. As a committed employer of a legal workforce, JBS USA is assisted by the program in its efforts to develop a more secure and stable workforce, and enhance fraudulent document awareness through education and training.\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY\n\nAs part of our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, we reaffirm our commitment to recruit, hire, promote and train all team members regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or age. JBS USA is dedicated to providing equal opportunities to all people, including military veterans and qualified individuals with disabilities.\n\nCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\n\nJBS USA provides competitive pay to our team members and rewards top performers. Our compensation philosophy is meritocratic, and we strive to reward all team members for their specific contributions. All team members receive paid time off with specifics being dependent on state regulations and union contracts as applicable. The minimum time of paid sick leave (personal days) for all salaried team members is 40 hours. The minimum time of paid time off for all team members is 40 hours, availability timing of which is dependent on eligibility criteria and/or union contracts at each specific facility location. Additionally, team members are not required to provide proof of medical diagnosis before utilizing sick leave. All team members and their families are offered benefits including medical, dental and vision insurance. Dependent on qualifications, some team members may receive six weeks of paid short-term disability for the birth of a child.

We do not tolerate unsafe working conditions and are committed to providing safe work environments for our team members across all JBS Foods facilities.\n\nTeam member health and safety is an integral component of our 2020 sustainability strategy. We developed aggressive goals in the U.S. to improve team member health and safety year over year.\n\n* Goal set for our U.S. and Canadian facilities.\nOur safety policies, governance structure and management approach are designed to promote a safe work culture for our more than 100,000 team members. The JBS USA Occupational Health and Safety Management System focuses on training and educating our team members and eliminating work hazards. The system meets relevant government requirements in each country. We defer to governing bodies like those listed below to evaluate the effectiveness of external safety audit processes, collect feedback and make necessary adjustments. GRI 403-1\n\nOur U.S. and Puerto Rican facilities operate in alignment with U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards. In Europe, our programs meet the Health Safety Executive RIDDOR (Reporting of Incidents Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences) Regulations.\n\nIn Australia, each jurisdiction enforces their own Work Health and Safety Act and regulations, and our facilities comply with them in each region. Our overarching safety management system framework in Australia aligns with the National Audit Tool (NAT) for self-insurers, which is based on the Australian Standard 4804 Occupational Health and Safety Management and Australian Standard 4801 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems.\n\nIn Mexico, our team tracks data according to the government Secretaria del Trabajo and the Safety and Health regulations, which comply with OSHA standards.\n\nIn Canada, our Health and Safety Management System is aligned with the Alberta Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) law. In addition, our facility is a holder of a Certificate of Recognition (COR) through a certified auditor, Alberta Food Processing Association (AFPA).\n\nEach JBS USA facility has a Safety Manager who reports to the General Manager. In total, we have more than 800 team members whose roles and responsibilities are dedicated to the health and safety of team members in our facilities. In addition, every facility also has a safety committee, which is chaired by the facility Safety Manager and consists of hourly team members, union representatives (where applicable) and key senior management. Approximately 3-15% of all team members are engaged in these committees, providing representation for 100% of the workforce. The facility safety managers and safety teams analyze work environment and physical hazards and propose innovative strategies, aligned with the hierarchy of controls, to keep our workplace safe.\n\nEach JBS USA business unit has a Head of Safety who reports to the Head of Human Resources or Head of Operations, who report to the Head of Operations or the President of that business unit. There is also a corporate safety and human resources team that supports all JBS USA business units by further analyzing data and tracking programs across the company. The Heads of Safety at JBS USA sit on a corporate Safety Leadership Committee. This committee meets regularly to discuss safety standards and best practices.\n\nEvery Head of Safety also participates in the Executive Safety Council. This Council consists of executives from across the company, inclusive of business unit Presidents, Vice Presidents, Heads of Operations, Heads of Engineering, Heads of Human Resources and the Heads of Safety. The council meets regularly to discuss outcomes and progress and review recommended changes from the Safety Leadership Committee. Finally, safety performance is a material driver of executive-level bonuses.\n\nTo ensure successful implementation of our health and safety policies, safety data is integrated across a shared digital platform, allowing us to better share best practices and identify enterprise wide trends. This enables us to develop data-driven corrective actions to our processes, including team member observations, safety inspections and audits. We also update our safety programs regularly by detailing new challenges,\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE) for team members is standard across JBS USA. Our Facility Safety Managers conduct workplace hazard assessments regularly to assess PPE needs and provide training and technical assistance to team members to ensure effective PPE usage.\n\nIf a team member notices an unsafe act or unsafe condition, we empower them to speak up and make sure unsafe acts are stopped and unsafe conditions are made safe. Everyone is empowered to report and correct unsafe acts and conditions without fear of retribution. Each team member is also empowered to remove themselves from any situation they deem to be unsafe.\n\nTo continuously improve, we set companywide and facility-specific safety goals each year and track leading safety indicators weekly. These leading indicators include monitoring observations for unsafe behaviors, working surfaces, machine guarding, safety gaps, electrical safety, drive cam coaching effectiveness, preventable vehicle accident rates and corrective actions. Performance is reported daily, weekly and monthly to management teams so that decisions that impact health and safety can be made swiftly and have the utmost priority. All of our operations supervisors are required to conduct multiple safety observations each week. The intent of these safety observations is to identify unsafe behaviors and intervene with helpful coaching prior to the occurrence of an unsafe act, condition or injury.\n\nWe also track traditional lagging indicators, such as Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), Days Away, Restrictions and Transfers (DART) rate and Lost Time rate. We consistently outperform industry averages in TRIR and DART rate and continue to work to improve the performance of our health and safety programs.\n\nWe also track a Safety Index for each facility which measures the frequency of severe incidents per hour of operation. A severe incident is defined as an amputation, hospitalization, vision loss, fracture or second or third degree burns resulting in greater than five days lost time, any injury resulting in greater than five days lost time or a fatality.\n\nWe recognize and respond to the occupational health concerns and needs of all team members, and we are in compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations governing occupational healthcare delivery. JBS USA has a Director of Occupational Health, who provides continual improvements to our health protocols and ongoing training to our Occupational Health Staff to further share and implement best practices across all of our facilities. GRI 403-6\n\nOur Ergonomic Improvement Program is designed to reduce the effects of repetition, contact stress and static postures. The program is tailored for each facility to control or eliminate potential conditions or work activities that pose ergonomic risks at each particular site. Our managers take ergonomic improvements seriously and conduct annual training and assessments to continually improve the program.\n\nWe are in compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations governing occupational healthcare delivery.\nWe center our Occupational Health and Safety Management System on training and education, as well as controlling or eliminating job-related hazards, to reduce the number of work-related injuries and illnesses throughout our facilities. Our in-depth safety training consists of new team member orientation, job- and task-specific training, departmental safety meetings and refresher training for team members every month. All newly hired team members must complete both classroom and department-specific training. We use the Alchemy Training system, which makes safety training available in multiple languages. We have written job-safety analyses for all of our positions. GRI 403-5\n\n**HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM**\n\nWe use the Alchemy Training system, which makes safety training available in multiple languages\n\n**INCREASING OUR FOCUS ON PREVENTION**\n\nIn the U.S., we have prioritized a comprehensive safety audit project to identify and reduce potential hazards. We have shifted our enterprise wide focus to early detection, including an in-depth review of policies and programs related to walking surfaces, protection from and prevention of falls or slips, electrical safety, machine guarding and ergonomics. GRI 403-2\n\nBased on the results of these audits, each year, we identify three high-priority initiatives\u2014one that is companywide, one that is business unit-wide and two that are prioritized by each facility. In 2021, our company-wide initiative is machine guarding with a focus on conveyor belt guarding. Additionally, each facility undergoes an ergonomics audit annually, where ergonomic issues are identified, logged, and remediated within a reasonable period of time.\n\nWe continue to increase our focus on prevention by improving our observation process to enhance our measurement and ultimately our performance of leading safety indicators. For example, our Safety Observation Process makes sure that our supervisors are observing and identifying unsafe acts and workplace conditions, as well as coaching team members to proactively change and challenge unsafe behaviors. This allows us to use data collection, analysis and coaching to prevent potential injuries from occurring. Our reporting includes a leading indicator dashboard that is tracked weekly according to targets and includes monitoring observations for unsafe behaviors, working surfaces, machine guarding, safety gaps, electrical safety, drive cam coaching effectiveness, preventable vehicle accident rates and corrective actions. In addition, we have incorporated more team members, including hourly, salaried and management, into our Safety Observation Process to create a culture of ownership with regard to team member health and safety. We track our performance and improvements through safety-gap scorecards and corrective action logs. GRI 403-7\nWhile we focus on education, training, process improvements and cultural accountability, accidents do occur, and we must acknowledge, report and learn from safety-related incidents. We have a formal Incident Investigation Procedure to investigate and reduce, mitigate or eliminate injuries, illnesses and fatalities. The incident investigation process assists operations in preventing the recurrence of similar incidents and in identifying injury and illness trends, potential weaknesses or failures in our safety management and proximate and root causes of incidents. This process allows us to develop effective corrective action plans. In addition, within each business unit, locations regularly share incident investigation information to facilitate learning and prevention.\n\n**AUDITS**\n\nEach year, every location undergoes a comprehensive safety management system audit, a fleet safety audit and an occupational health audit. In addition, since 2015, JBS USA has conducted comprehensive safety analysis audits to identify and reduce potential hazards.\n\n**CORRECTIVE ACTIONS**\n\n**INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS**\n\nAlthough our contracted workforce is a small portion of our total workforce, we take our responsibility for their health and safety seriously. We partner with a third party to ensure that our contractors meet our health and safety standards. In the U.S. and Canada, contractors are required to have an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d grade to work at our facilities. Those contractors with \u201cC\u201d and \u201cF\u201d grades must have a variance form on file granted by the site Safety and Health Manager and the General Manager. Contractor grades are derived from Contract Safety Information, which includes safety, injury and illness statistics; aggregate insurance requirements, OSHA inspection history, workers\u2019 compensation experience modifier (EMR), OSHA forms 300 and 300A, written health, safety and environmental programs, safety-training documentation; and JBS Foods\u2019 safety briefing online training.\n\nIn Australia, all independent contractors are required to meet the Australian Standard 4804 Occupational Health and Safety Management and the Australian Standard 4801 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems.\n\nIn Mexico and Europe, all independent contractors are required to meet our health and safety standards.\n\n**INNOVATION TO IMPROVE SAFETY**\n\nWe continue to find new ways to leverage cutting edge technologies to enhance team member safety and implement virtual reality technology to train team members on food and team member safety protocol.\n\nIn parallel with our increased focus on preventing injuries, our partnership with Scott Technology, a leading global developer of automation and robotic solutions, has allowed us to decrease the potential for injuries and identify solutions to safety and automation challenges by establishing cross-functional teams to identify ways to utilize their technology. For example, we have a goal to transition to BladeStop Bandsaws, which are designed to reduce serious injuries by mechanically stopping the blade when the unit senses the operator has come in contact with the blade. In addition to BladeStop technology, Pilgrim\u2019s has partnered with Scott to develop an automated whole bird trussing machine, and in Australia, two of our lamb production facilities have implemented automated lamb deboning technology from Scott. In addition, various business units have piloted wearable technology and many facilities are using machines to validate knife sharpness and perform calibrated knife sharpening to ensure team members are performing their duties in the most ergonomically optimal manner possible. As a result of this innovative technology, the number of injuries has been further reduced.\nIn 2020, we reduced our DART rate by 12%, decreased our TRIR by 13%, and improved our Safety Index score by 56%. In 2019, JBS Foods\u2019s DART rate was 11% below the industry average.

Our facility management teams have been working with local leaders and organizations to determine how the funds can best help meet immediate and longer-term community needs.\n\nProjects include donating books and computers to underserved children, constructing warehouses for food pantries, funding high school agriculture programs, as well as developing land for playgrounds, community gardens and team member housing.\n\nTo date, Hometown Strong has invested in over 150 projects across the following categories, with more projects to come:\n\n- **US$ 1.6MM** in social services\n- **US$ 1.4MM** in healthcare\n- **US$ 18MM** in community infrastructure\n- **US$ 6.7MM** in housing\n- **US$ 4.4MM** in education\n- **US$ 565K** in public services\n\nThroughout the global pandemic, our team members and our communities have looked to us for reassurance that we can \u2013 and will \u2013 get through this pandemic. Toward that end, JBS USA and Pilgrim\u2019s are excited to provide meaningful investments in projects that will have positive impacts for generations to come.\n\n\u201cHometown Strong is our way of showing our ongoing commitment and support to the communities where our team members live and work,\u201d said Andre Nogueira, JBS USA CEO\n\nClick here to read more about our Hometown Strong initiative\nBetter Futures\n\nAs part of our Hometown Strong initiative, JBS USA and Pilgrim\u2019s U.S. are building the largest free college tuition program in rural America \u2013 Better Futures. Our team members and their child dependents have the opportunity to pursue their higher education dreams for associate degrees and trade certificates at community and technical colleges \u2013 tuition free.\n\nWe recognize and believe in the transformative power of higher education and the opportunities that come from education, coursework and technical skill training.\n\nBetter Futures removes a major financial barrier to college attendance and stands to become the largest free college tuition program in rural America. JBS USA and Pilgrim\u2019s advisors will also help team members \u2013 many from first-generation American families \u2013 navigate the application process, which can be a deterrence to people applying to college for the first time.\n\nThe Better Futures program provides meaningful investments in the futures of our team members, their families and our communities.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Better Futures initiative\n\nJBS Australia\n\nIn light of the recent bushfires that burned across Australia, JBS Australia donated US$ 1 million to the Australian Volunteer Trust, established by the Business Council of Australia in partnership with Equity Trustees. The Trust will be a permanent and ongoing fund to support the children of volunteers who have died in fighting the fires and any future major disasters. The Trust represents a vehicle to support these families and especially the children of these volunteers through their education.\n\nThe impact of the fires has been significant, and devastated communities across mainland eastern states. We have a direct contact and long-term relationships with many livestock producers and communities in these affected areas and our support for them will continue.\n\nJBS Australia CEO Brent Eastwood said, \u201cAs the CEO of a business employing over 12,000 people across five Australian states, we understand the importance of a safe working environment and making sure our people go home to their families in the same way they arrived to work. Unfortunately, we have seen with these fires and other recent natural disasters such as floods, there are times when volunteer lives are lost in the line of duty and families are forever impacted. The Trust represents a vehicle to support these families and especially the children of these volunteers through their education.\u201d\n\nAlong with this donation, JBS Australia will continue to work with and support affected communities and our livestock producers through regular business and food donations.\n\nJBS Australia is a member of the Business Council of Australia.\nPilgrim\u2019s Tomorrow Fund\n\nIn 2019, Pilgrim\u2019s U.S. launched the Tomorrow Fund, a scholarship program to support the collegiate pursuits of our team members and their direct dependents. Our vision is to become the best and most respected company in our industry, creating the opportunity of a better future for our team members. In line with this pursuit, we established the Tomorrow Fund to help our team members achieve their dreams and create a better future for themselves and their families through education. Every year, an eligible student from each of our 30 processing facilities across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, plus our corporate office, will be awarded a full-ride scholarship to an eligible university of their choice. Our goal is to invest US$ 2 million in the Pilgrim\u2019s Tomorrow Fund scholarship recipients by 2025.\n\nThe Tomorrow Fund supports team members and direct dependents pursuing an initial bachelor\u2019s degree, an accredited vocational-technical certification or an associate degree. Award recipients participate in a Pilgrim\u2019s mentorship program and are extended internship offers for the summer at Pilgrim\u2019s locations across the country.\n\nAt Pilgrim\u2019s, we believe our people are our greatest strength. The Tomorrow Fund invests in the future, supports our local communities and improves the lives of our team members and their families through empowerment, education and personal growth. We awarded our inaugural class of Tomorrow Fund leaders with a full-ride scholarship in Fall 2020 and will announce the second class of 30 awardees in 2021.\n\nClick here to read more about the Tomorrow Fund.\nPilgrim\u2019s Mexico\n\nOur 2020 focus continued to be supporting our team members and the communities where we live and work. Some of our philanthropic work included:\n\n- Continuing our Chicken Donations Program, which focuses on contributing to the communities surrounding our complexes and areas hit hardest by the pandemic. Donations were made possible through DIF (National System for the Development of the Family) and municipal governments.\n\n- Donating cleaning and disinfection equipment, as well as storage barrels, which were modified and used to transfer patients with COVID-19.\n\n- During 2020 and two years prior, we obtained the ESR Distinctive (Corporate Social Responsibility Distinctive), which is granted by CEMEFI Mexican Center for Philanthropy. This is the highest recognition awarded in Mexico to companies committed to socially responsible and sustainable management.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s Moy Park\n\nMoy Park established a \u00a31 million Community Support Fund aimed at supporting and enriching the lives of those in need across its local communities. This new initiative builds on Moy Park\u2019s range of existing and long-established community measures, including charity and educational programs.\n\nMoy Park\u2019s HR and Performance Director, Kirsty Wilkins said, \u201cThe food industry plays a vital role, keeping our supermarket shelves stocked and we are thankful to our local towns, villages and team members who are part of this important effort. Moy Park is a people focused organization, and we invest heavily in development opportunities for our colleagues in the workplace. This new community initiative is a natural extension of this approach and we look forward to receiving applications from local groups.\u201d\n\nPilgrim\u2019s UK\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, Pilgrim\u2019s UK has donated more than \u00a365,000 to Mind, which provides mental health support services that have become even more important throughout the pandemic.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s UK staff have taken part in a host of activities to raise funds for Mind, including a sponsored staff head shave, which raised more than \u00a3600; climbing Mount Kilimanjaro to raise funds; and participating in a 100km challenge, which raised more than \u00a32,000.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s UK also regularly donates to Mind through its staff lottery, which has raised nearly \u00a330,000 throughout the past four years.\n\nProduct Donation\n\nIn addition to numerous community investment projects, JBS USA donated more than 22.4 million (4 oz.) servings of food in 2020. We partner with local food banks and community kitchens to provide fresh meat and poultry produced in nearby facilities.\nSince early 2020, we have been singularly focused on protecting our team members from COVID-19. We changed the way we do business, resulting in more than US$ 600 million in costs and safety investments, to keep our team members safe.\n\nWe\u2019ve implemented hundreds of safety measures and policies to protect our team members, including a unique set of measures that exceed any provided state or federal guidance, such as:\n\n- Voluntarily removing vulnerable populations from all of our facilities, offering full pay and benefits\n- Securing masks for our entire workforce before they were recommended by health officials or the government, and offering unlimited PPE\n- Covering 100% of COVID-19 health expenses for team members and their dependents enrolled in the company\u2019s health plan\n- Providing immediate and free testing to all symptomatic team members and close contacts\n- Conducting random, routine surveillance testing of asymptomatic team members\n- Installing hospital-grade ventilation systems and UV lighting in all of our facilities\n- Offering a US$ 100 incentive bonus for any U.S. team member willing to get vaccinated\n\nDuring the pandemic, we spent more than US$ 160 million in increased wages and bonuses, in addition to more than US$ 200 million in health and safety measures. And, we are proud that more than 70% of our workforce has been vaccinated.\n\nIn addition to these measures, in 2020, we announced the Hometown Strong initiative, a US$ 50 million investment in the communities where our team members live and work in the United States and Canada. Throughout the global pandemic, our team members and our communities have looked to us for reassurance that we can \u2013 and will \u2013 get through this crisis. That\u2019s why JBS USA has provided meaningful investments in projects that will have a lasting impact in our communities for generations to come.\n\nFrom education and recreation to healthcare and social services, we have invested in community projects that are under way across the country.

We promote a model of continuous improvement and recognize that environmental protection and resource conservation provide value and security to current and future generations. Our management approach is focused on improving operational efficiency, encouraging innovation and being compliant with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.\n\nOur internally audited Environmental Management System (EMS) is based on the specifications of ISO 14001, yet tailored to enable our businesses to most effectively achieve our goals of protecting the environment. Pilgrim\u2019s UK is working toward ISO 14001 certification. Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park operate an Integrated Safety and Environmental Management System (IMS) and Energy Management System (EnMS) which will be externally certified to, or will be in alignment with, ISO 14001, 45001 and 50001 standards.\n\nOur environmental management structures encourage accountability and promote ownership within our environmental and operations teams. Almost every JBS USA facility has a full-time environmental manager or officer who oversees the environmental requirements and performance of the facility. This manager or officer then reports to the facility-specific general manager. In addition, corporate environmental teams oversee the environmental performance of multiple facilities and provide individual facility support by sharing best management practices and offering assistance to address specific issues, should they arise.\n\nCorporate environmental teams generally report to the head of engineering for each business unit, who reports to the head of operations, who reports directly to the president of the business unit. This differs for JBS USA Live Pork business unit as its corporate environmental managers report to the vice president of environment, who reports to the president of the business unit. For Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park, the corporate environmental teams report to the head of sustainability and risk management, who reports to the president of the business unit. In Australia, the group environmental manager reports to the head of corporate and regulatory.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT POLICY\n\nAll team members share in the commitment to the JBS USA Environmental Policy. The policy is supported and reinforced by JBS USA executive management, overseen and governed by our environmental teams and implemented across the organization through direct support of in-plant personnel.\n\nRead Our Environmental Policies\nWater use and water quality are priorities at JBS USA and critical pillars in our sustainability program. We recognize that water scarcity is a major global issue and is critical to securing a consistent, high-quality global food supply. We embrace our responsibility to reduce water use and strive to improve our water-stewardship by monitoring its use at each JBS USA facility and prioritizing usage reductions, while preserving our high standards for food safety and sanitary conditions. We are also aware that some JBS USA facilities are located in water-stressed areas and require more strategic focus to ensure proper management. Water quality is an important priority for us as well, and we continuously work to ensure that all wastewater we discharge meets or exceeds all regulatory and internal standards.\n\nAt JBS USA, water stewardship is crucial to our long-term viability. Companywide, our approach to water stewardship is defined at the corporate level, but goals and targets are set by each facility to ensure ownership and accountability. We work closely and collaboratively with federal, state and local municipalities to address complex issues and jointly develop solutions. Finally, every facility invests capital annually to make sure it stays in alignment with and committed to our Environmental Policy while appropriately addressing local challenges.\n\nWater plays an important role in producing safe food. This necessitates its everyday use so we are meeting the highest food safety standards. To ensure that our water conservation efforts do not interfere with food safety, we work cross-functionally with our environmental, engineering, operations and food quality and safety teams when designing and implementing these strategies.\n\nEach of our production and further processing facilities has a tailored wastewater treatment program that meets its individual discharge permit requirements. These site-specific initiatives have helped reduce our total discharged water volume and addressed noncompliance issues. All of our feedlots and live hog operations are run in accordance with federally mandated, nutrient-management plans or an equivalent program. Manure from our feedlots and live hog operations plays an important role in conservation as a soil amendment and fertilizer. It is composted and used by local farmers to enhance soil quality and as a sustainable alternative to synthetic fertilizers.\n2020 Progress\n\nGRI 306-2\n\nWe track both total water use and water intensity (water use per pound of finished product, including by-products) to consistently identify opportunities for improvements, irrespective of changes in production. In 2020, we used approximately 24 billion gallons of water in our JBS USA facilities, drawing 70% of this water from public municipalities, 26% from groundwater sources and 4% from surface water, including streams. We will work to continually optimize water use and identify opportunities to reduce water use intensity without compromising food safety, animal welfare or environmental compliance.\n\nAs a global company, our water use intensity unfortunately increased by 1% from 2019 to 2020 due to increased focus on sanitation during the COVID-19 global pandemic. For our participating business units in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, water use intensity decreased 10% since 2015, meeting our 2020 reduction goal.\n\nThroughout 2020, all of our facilities discharged wastewater according to applicable wastewater treatment permits. We maintain and, where needed, improve facilities and wastewater programs to be in compliance with permits, laws and regulations. Discharged water is measured for its overall quality at each facility to ensure that it meets permitting requirements. The majority, 59%, of discharged water is sent to city-owned treatment centers, while 29% is discharged to non-municipalities, and 12% is used as land irrigation.\n\nGRI 303-1\n\nWe reduced our water use intensity by 10%, meeting our goal\n\n* Goals set based on 2013, 2014, 2015 average baselines for our U.S. and Canadian facilities.\nWATER PERFORMANCE\u00b3 GRI 303-2, 303-3\n\n| Total Water Use (Gallons) | 2018                | 2019                | 2020                |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| JBS USA\u00b9                 | 9,209,939,735       | 9,314,472,084       | 8,924,117,163       |\n| JBS Australia            | 1,691,557,285       | 1,809,818,362       | 1,614,536,332       |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s USA\u00b2           | 11,149,670,730      | 11,405,328,895      | 11,132,706,853      |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s Mexico         | 1,035,152,170       | 1,035,893,437       | 1,022,534,795       |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s Europe         | 1,138,926,299       | 1,379,559,414       | 1,319,962,608       |\n\n| Water Use Intensity (Gallons Per lb. of Finished Product) | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| JBS USA\u00b9                                                 | 0.58 | 0.58 | 0.59 |\n| JBS Australia                                            | 0.74 | 0.73 | 0.94 |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s USA\u00b2                                           | 1.13 | 1.12 | 1.08 |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s Mexico                                         | 0.52 | 0.52 | 0.51 |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s Europe                                         | 0.84 | 0.68 | 0.70 |\n\n\u00b9 Includes U.S. and Canadian facilities, excluding poultry facilities.\n\u00b2 Includes U.S. and Puerto Rican facilities.\n\u00b3 We make every effort to report accurate data. We provide updated data from previous years in cases where improved information is available. JBS USA/Pilgrim\u2019s revisited data collection processes and as a result, this report includes some improved metrics from past years.\n\nJBS USA Facilities by Water Risk Category\n\nWater Risk Assessment\n\nJBS USA has conducted a comprehensive water risk assessment at each facility, inclusive of quantity (baseline water stress, inter-annual variability, seasonal variability, flood occurrence, drought severity, upstream storage and groundwater storage), quality (return flow ratio and upstream protected land) and regulatory and reputational risk (media coverage, access to water and threatened amphibians). The assessment identifies areas with higher exposure to aforementioned water-related risks. As indicated in the graphic below, the majority of our facilities are low-to-medium or medium-to-high risk as defined by the World Resources Institute Aqueduct, 2014.\n\nThe water risk assessment is a critical element of our water stewardship strategy and allows us to identify and prioritize water resource projects that are locally relevant to each watershed and reduce the company\u2019s overall water impact.\nOur environmental teams work to implement best practices for energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our operations. We continuously invest in energy efficient technologies including LED lighting, real-time measurement devices, predictive maintenance, more efficient equipment, electrification of heating systems and transportation and more efficient refrigeration systems.\n\nTo date, 12 of our facilities use biogas as a renewable energy source, and seven have implemented solar systems. These solar systems are located in the U.S., one in Australia and three in Europe. The share of indirect energy from renewable sources across our JBS USA facilities, globally, is approximately 4%. Pilgrim\u2019s UK sources 100% renewable energy.\n\nWe track direct greenhouse gas emissions from stationary and mobile sources (scope 1) (excluding enteric and manure emissions from our live animal operations) and indirect energy emissions (scope 2). From 2019 to 2020, we reduced our global greenhouse gas emission intensity by 5%. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, greenhouse gas emission intensity decreased 20% since 2015, meeting our 2020 reduction goal.\n\nOur JBS USA Carriers business unit is focused on improving fuel efficiency as the primary means to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, they improved fuel efficiency across the fleet by 0.15 miles per gallon and decreased GHG emissions by 3%.\n\n2020 Progress\nGRI 302-4, 302-5, 305-2, 305-4\nAs a global company, we decreased our fuel use intensity by 0.5% and increased our electricity use intensity by 4% from 2019 to 2020. For our business units in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico that participated in our 2020 goal-setting process, natural gas use intensity decreased by 16% and electricity use intensity decreased by 14% since 2015, successfully achieving our electricity reduction goal.\n\nAir quality and greenhouse gases are a top concern for our team and the communities where we operate \u2013 as such we are constantly looking for opportunities to improve our energy efficiency and reduce air emissions.\n## ENERGY PERFORMANCE\n\n|                      | 2018          | 2019          | 2020          |\n|----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Total Fuel Use**   |               |               |               |\n| (MMBTU)              |               |               |               |\n| JBS USA\u00b9             | 9,770,521     | 10,553,938    | 10,401,777    |\n| JBS Australia        | 1,720,692     | 1,917,911     | 1,459,695     |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s USA\u00b2       | 6,562,572     | 6,699,359     | 6,261,448     |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s Mexico     | 667,097       | 693,184       | 691,465       |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s Europe\u00b3    | 954,605       | 1,504,938     | 1,598,199     |\n| **Total Electricity Use** |           |               |               |\n| (kWh)                |               |               |               |\n| JBS USA\u00b9             | 1,162,674,506 | 1,152,460,188 | 1,176,366,001 |\n| JBS Australia        | 308,172,972   | 303,203,572   | 289,148,703   |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s USA\u00b2       | 1,120,342,927 | 1,132,394,299 | 1,111,499,948 |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s Mexico     | 136,779,309   | 139,446,183   | 166,094,234   |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s Europe\u00b3    | 234,775,857   | 355,017,648   | 331,767,528   |\n| **Electricity Use Intensity** |         |               |               |\n| (kWh Per 100 lbs. of Finished Product) |           |               |               |\n| JBS USA\u00b9             | 7.36          | 7.16          | 7.78          |\n| JBS Australia        | 13.42         | 13.13         | 14.54         |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s USA\u00b2       | 11.31         | 11.08         | 10.82         |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s Mexico     | 6.83          | 6.98          | 8.25          |\n| Pilgrim\u2019s Europe\u00b3    | 17.34         | 17.55         | 17.67         |\n\n\u00b9 Includes U.S. and Canadian facilities, excluding poultry facilities.\n\u00b2 Includes U.S. and Puerto Rican facilities.\n\u00b3 Pilgrim\u2019s acquired Tulip Limited in October of 2019 whose name was then changed to Pilgrim\u2019s UK, and that data is reported in 2019 within Pilgrim\u2019s Europe.\n\u2074 We make every effort to report accurate data.

Each facility works to recycle material and reduce waste by optimizing facility logistics and team member training.\n\nWaste and Recycling Practices\n\nIn each of our production facilities, we have goals to decrease the amount of packaging used in our finished products and decrease waste sent to landfills. Our Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park team maintained its commitment of zero waste to landfill in all of their facilities, and Pilgrim\u2019s UK maintained their commitment of zero waste to landfill in the majority of their facilities.\n\nIn Europe, Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park was the first poultry company to undertake a commitment to reduce packaging and food waste in its supply chain. The initiative is part of an ambitious campaign to combat the use of plastics and packaging in its business and in the industry. The company plans to lower its global use of packaging by 5% each year, while simultaneously raising the percentage of recyclable packages by 5%. Among actions planned, Moy Park will collaborate with researchers and supply chain partners to develop sustainable packaging for its entire product portfolio and will eliminate single use plastic from its office and restaurants by 2020. Moy Park and Pilgrim\u2019s UK have adopted the strategy of \u201cRemove, Reduce, Recycle and Research\u201d and will begin using 100% recyclable rigid packaging by 2022. All other packaging will be widely recyclable by 2025.\n\nAs a company, we continue to explore alternative materials that offer recyclability and technologies that allow us to reduce the amount of packaging needed, while still maintaining strict product safety requirements. In our day-to-day operations, we work to improve recycling opportunities at each facility and reduce overall waste generated.\n\nProduct packaging provides a unique challenge for our industry. To prevent contamination at recycling facilities, packaging materials used at production facilities that come into contact with blood, meat or fat cannot be recycled, per the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) standards. Due to the nature of our products, this reduces our ability to recycle packaging material used at our production facilities.\nReducing and Recycling Waste\n\n80% of clean cardboard material, which is sent to recycling centers or paper mills to be reused\n\n95% of our pallets, which are returned to our suppliers for reuse\n\n95% of all metal, which is sent to a salvage yard\n\n95% of clean, non-contaminated plastic, which is collected in bins and then sent to either a recycling center or melted down and repurposed to make new products\n\n95% of our plastic high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tote bags, which are sold to our original manufacturer and then reused in our next order, creating a closed loop system\n\nThe meat processing industry is incredibly efficient from a food waste prevention standpoint. We process byproducts, such as blood, meat and bones, to create saleable materials and reduce waste. Nearly 100% of inedible byproducts are rendered to produce tallow and blood and bone meal, which we then sell to other companies to be used in consumer goods, such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals or in livestock or poultry feed. Pilgrim\u2019s UK has commitments to both the Sustainable Development goal 12.3 and to Courtauld Commitment which are both working towards halving food waste by 2030. Currently only 0.1% of Pilgrim\u2019s UK\u2019s production is classified as food waste. Actions currently employed to reduce this number even further include using the Waste Hierarchy to derive as much value as possible from all product and donating approximately 90,000 meal equivalents in 2020 to food redistribution charities to prevent food waste.\nWe have continued to focus on improving data quality related to waste and packaging, as a result we are tracking more indicators and are able to better understand and monitor our waste streams. Improved data quality also leads to more complete measurements which are higher than partially complete past data. As a global company, from 2019 to 2020, our total waste generated decreased by 21% and decreased waste sent to landfills by 7% and decreased waste to landfill per ton of finished product by 3%.\n\nOur Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park team maintained its commitment of zero waste to landfill in all of their facilities, and Pilgrim\u2019s UK maintained their commitment of zero waste to landfill in the majority of their facilities.\n\nIn the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada, our percent of biodegradable and recyclable packaging material used increased by 12%; and, our total packaging material per ton of finished product decreased by 23%. We continue to stay focused on increasing our recyclable packaging. We expect packaging material per ton to increase due to customer and consumer demand for smaller pack sizes.\n\nThe data below represents our best efforts at tracking waste and recycling at our facilities. In some cases, the local municipality collects all waste and recycling, which makes tracking the data impossible. We are currently working to develop collaborative partnerships in these locations, so that we can share data to better track our performance.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, our total waste generated decreased by 21% and decreased waste sent to landfills by 7% and decreased waste to landfill per ton of finished product by 3%.\n## WASTE PERFORMANCE\u2074 (TONS) GRI 306-2\n\n|                      | JBS USA\u00b9 | Pilgrim\u2019s USA\u00b2 | Pilgrim\u2019s Europe\u00b3 | Pilgrim\u2019s Mexico | JBS Australia |\n|----------------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|\n|                      | 2018     | 2019           | 2020              | 2018             | 2019          | 2020          | 2018             | 2019             | 2020             | 2018             | 2019             | 2020             |\n| Total Waste Generated| 447,94   | 432,4          | 350,24            | 79,156           | 61,111         | 41,355        | 179,12          | 210,86           | 135,36           | 113,03          | 87,436          | 74,622          | 88,029          | 88,113          | 93,361          |\n| Total Waste To Landfill| 73,149   | 74,773         | 82,218            | 70,117           | 54,36          | 34,302        | 0               | 721              | 516              | 14,709          | 21,433          | 19,93           | 4,513           | 14,02           | 17,097          |\n| Waste to Landfill Intensity (Per Ton of Finished Product) | 0.0093 | 0.0537 | 0.0463 | 0.0142 | 0.0106 | 0.0067 | 0.0000 | 0.0007 | 0.0005 | 0.0147 | 0.0875 | 0.0741 | 0.0038 | 0.0309 | 0.0939 |\n| Total Waste Recycled | 99,968   | 85,877         | 7,432             | 4,904            | 6,751          | 7,053         | 56,443          | 69,012           | 16,699           | 27,59           | 5,384           | 2,659           | 4,439           | 5,451           | 6,691           |\n| Total Waste Composted | 84,476   | 82,247         | 92,719            | 0                | 0              | 0             | 1,602           | 0                | 0                | 70,714          | 60,614          | 52,03           | 64,349          | 68,641          | 57,709          |\n| Total Waste Incinerated | 8       | 1              | 69                | 0                | 0              | 0             | 12,33           | 14,246           | 26,578           | 14              | 5              | 4              | 0              | 0              | 0              |\n| Total Waste For Energy Reuse | 0 | 0 | 17,65 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 105,71 | 109,63 | 47,878 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 7,817 |\n| Total Waste Cogenerated/ Coprocessed | 0 | 0 | 643 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3,031 | 17,252 | 14,436 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Total Waste For Fertigation/ Land Application | 190,34 | 189,5 | 149,5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 29,257 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 13,189 | 0 | 4,047 |\n\n\u00b9 Includes U.S. and Canadian facilities, excluding poultry facilities.  \n\u00b2 Includes U.S. and Puerto Rican facilities.  \n\u00b3 Pilgrim\u2019s acquired Tulip Limited in October of 2019 and that data is reported in 2019 within Pilgrim\u2019s Europe.  \n\u2074 We make every effort to report accurate data.

We continually strive to improve our welfare efforts through new technologies and the implementation of standards that meet and often exceed regulatory requirements and industry guidelines.\n\nWe have established and implemented animal welfare policies and programs in all our business units to further promote the humane treatment of animals. Our animal welfare programs lay out the appropriate practices, controls, training and documentation, and are motivated by the Five Freedoms:\n\n- Freedom to express natural behavior\n- Freedom from injury and disease\n- Freedom from discomfort\n- Freedom from thirst and hunger\n- Freedom from fear and distress\n\nTo continually improve the well-being of our animals, we have set 2020 animal welfare goals according to the JBS USA Animal Health and Welfare Scorecard as part of our Sustainable Management System in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe scorecard was developed by our JBS USA animal welfare team and uses a combined 19 indicators selected for their importance to the health and welfare of our animals. The indicators are weighed on a 100-point scale across eight main areas of importance, including regulatory compliance, audits (internal and third-party), losses, priority indicators, investment, transportation, management and health.\n\nAchieve a 90% or better on our JBS USA Animal Health and Welfare Scorecard. We\u2019re refocusing on this topic in our 2030 sustainability strategy*\n\n* 2020 goal was set for our U.S. and Canadian facilities.\nAt JBS USA, animal welfare responsibilities in our production facilities are reported through the Food Safety and Quality Assurance Team. Each business unit also has a Corporate Animal Welfare Manager who reports to the Head of Food Safety and Quality Assurance (FSQA; also referred to in some businesses as the Heads of Technical Services and Quality Assurance) or the Vice President of Operations, who reports directly to the president of the business unit. The Corporate Animal Welfare Manager oversees the animal welfare performance of multiple facilities and provides individual facility support by sharing best management practices and helping address specific issues, should they arise.\n\nNearly every JBS USA production facility has a full-time Quality Assurance Manager, Animal Welfare Manager or Animal Welfare Officer (AWO) who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of our animal welfare program, which includes facility assessment, training programs and ongoing monitoring. In most facilities, the Quality Assurance Manager reports to the Head of FSQA and receives support from the Corporate Animal Welfare Manager. In our pork facilities in the U.S., the Quality Assurance Manager reports to the Facility Manager and receives support from the Corporate Animal Welfare Manager.\n\nFor our beef and pork production facilities in the U.S. and Canada, the Animal Welfare Manager is a Professional Animal Auditor Certification Organization (PAACO)-trained humane handling specialist. In Australia, they are trained according to industry AWO skills and are Australia Livestock Processing Industry Animal Welfare Certification System (AAWCS) approved auditors. In Europe at our Moy Park facilities, our AWOs at our poultry facilities are certified through Animal Welfare Training Ltd. In addition, all personnel handling chickens must have a certificate of competency (COC), which is an assessed qualification issued by the regional regulatory authorities: Food Standards Agency (FSA) in Great Britain or the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in Northern Ireland. At our Pilgrim\u2019s UK pork facilities our AWOs are accredited according to Bristol University or Livestockwise.\n\nEach production facility has team members from livestock and poultry handling, processing, quality assurance, operations, procurement and human resources. These team members ensure that the policies and procedures required by the animal welfare program, including annual training of all team members, are being correctly implemented and followed.\n\nAdditionally, the welfare of livestock and poultry in our production facilities is regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Food Safety and Inspection Services (FSIS), Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Meat Inspection, Buenas Pr\u00e1cticas Pecuarias en Producci\u00f3n de Pollo de Engorda de SADER y SENASICA, Council Regulation N\u02da1099/2009, Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines and Australian Standard for the Hygienic Production and Transportation of Meat and Meat Products for Human Consumption, dependent on region and protein.\nAt our beef and pork facilities, a veterinarian has authority over animal handling and inspects animals that are delivered to the processing facilities. In the unusual event that a standard operating procedure, guideline or regulation is violated, corrective action is taken immediately.\n\nFor our U.S. based live pork business, the Director of Animal Welfare provides animal welfare program oversight and program implementation support to all company-owned and contract farms. The Director of Animal Welfare reports to the president of the business unit. In addition, five licensed and accredited veterinarians and two swine nutritionists maintain the health and well-being of our pigs.\n\nFor JBS Australia, every feedlot\u2019s animal health and welfare program is the direct responsibility of the Feedlot Manager, who is trained to be a competent AWO. The Feedlot Manager receives support from independent nutritionists and veterinarians.\n\nAt Pilgrim\u2019s, the Chief Animal Welfare Officer, who is also the Head Veterinarian, is responsible for the welfare of our chickens. The Head of Live Operations supervises the Chief Animal Welfare Officer, with ultimate oversight from the president of the business unit. Animal welfare within Pilgrim\u2019s UK\u2019s higher welfare supply chain is overseen by the Pig Production Director who reports to the Agriculture Director. The Executive Vice President of the business unit supervises the Agriculture Director. The animal welfare of the hogs procured by Pilgrim\u2019s UK from independent farmers is overseen by the Pig Supply Chain Director who also reports to the Agriculture Director.\n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for abuse of any kind, and all team members are required to report any violations, either anonymously through our ethics line or directly to management. Team members or family farm and ranch partners who violate our Animal Welfare Policy and associated procedures are subject to disciplinary action including termination of employment, termination of contract and/or reporting to the government authority responsible for overseeing animal welfare.\n\nIn addition, our animal welfare programs are often reviewed by animal handling and welfare experts from universities across the globe. These lasting academic partnerships have assisted JBS USA in identifying and investing in additional upgrades to both our facilities and team member training programs to further enhance the welfare of our animals.\n\n**TRAINING**\n\nAll new JBS USA team members receive department-specific animal welfare training during orientation, and all team members who handle livestock or poultry must attend annual refresher trainings. Our Quality Assurance and Human Resources Managers make sure that all training requirements are completed as scheduled, documented and available for review.\nAll of our production facilities are audited regularly to guarantee compliance with our animal welfare programs. Quality assurance personnel conduct daily audits to verify adherence to each country\u2019s respective compliance program, depending on the protein. These programs include USDA, NAMI (North American Meat Institute) Animal Handling Guidelines, National Chicken Council (NCC) Guidelines, CFIA Meat Inspection Regulations, Buenas Pr\u00e1cticas Pecuarias en Producci\u00f3n de Pollo de Engorda de SADER y SENASICA, Council Regulation N\u02da1099/2009 standards on animal welfare and Australian Meat Industry Council (AMIC) Industry Animal Welfare Standards for Livestock and Processing Establishments. Government inspectors also monitor animal welfare practices daily to guarantee compliance with regulations.\n\nEvery production facility also undergoes annual third-party animal handling audits. If a deficiency is identified, immediate corrective action is taken, and internal follow-up audits are scheduled until the issue is resolved. We share corrective action strategies across the company so that all facilities can benefit from new knowledge and perspectives to drive continuous improvement in our approach to animal welfare.\n\nIn addition, we have implemented a video auditing system in all of our beef, lamb and pork production facilities and are piloting a system in select poultry facilities. This allows us to conduct real-time internal auditing from a viewing room and provide team members with immediate feedback for improvement. Our video footage is audited remotely by our animal welfare team and/or an independent third party. These independent reviews are designed to verify our ongoing commitment to best practices in animal handling and include alerts and daily summaries to facilities for process improvement.\n\nLivestock transporters are audited daily to verify adherence to JBS USA humane handling standards, NAMI Transportation Guidelines, CFIA Health of Animal Regulations Livestock Transport Requirements and Australian Standard for the Hygienic Production and Transportation of Meat and Meat Products for Human Consumption, depending on the region.\n\nWe also prioritize animal welfare standards within our supply chain.\n\nIn the U.S., we require all our partners who raise the cattle and hogs that we purchase to be Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) or Pork Quality Assurance Plus (PQA+) certified and verify compliance by conducting third-party audits according to the BQA Feedyard Assessment and the Common Swine Industry Audit (CSIA). Our sow and finishing farms are regularly assessed by field managers, veterinarians and the Director of Animal Welfare. When necessary, corrective actions are outlined with caretakers and additional training is administered as needed. The Director of Animal Welfare and Animal Welfare Manager conduct second-party site assessments as part of the National Pork Board\u2019s Pork Quality Assurance Plus (PQA+) program to verify that caretakers are providing care in accordance to industry standards. In addition to internal audits, JBS USA Live Pork participates in third-party animal welfare audits using the PAACO certified CSIA tool.\n\nIn Australia, our feedlots are subject to annual third-party audits as part of the National Feedlot Accreditation Scheme (NFAS), which includes mandatory biannual internal animal welfare audits according to Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines for Cattle. All hogs are sourced from Australia Pork Industry Quality Assurance Program (APIQ) accredited farms with industry best-practice animal welfare standards.\n\nAt Pilgrim\u2019s, farms are visited and assessed weekly according to our Animal Welfare Program. In the U.S., a subset of farms are audited by PAACO-certified auditor according to NCC guidelines. A majority of our Mexico complexes are compliant with the Federally Inspected Type (TIF), a voluntary food-quality certification of the Mexican government. In Europe, poultry farms are Red Tractor approved and meet or exceed Red Tractor or equivalent welfare standards. Annually, an external auditor audits each farm to Red Tractor standards, which results in Assured Chicken Production (ACP) Certification. Our Pilgrim\u2019s UK higher welfare hogs are raised according to Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) higher welfare standards and all the hogs supplied to Pilgrim\u2019s UK are either Red Tractor, Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) or Red Tractor/QMS and RSPCA Farm Assured.\nOur animal welfare programs include specific requirements and procedures to protect the health and welfare of our livestock and poultry during transportation, unloading, handling and processing, as well as the safety of our team members.\n\nIn the U.S., our beef and pork production facilities implement animal welfare programs that align with the NAMI guidelines and are compliant with USDA FSIS Directives 6,100.1, 6,900.2 and 9 CFR Part 313. All of our facilities have voluntarily implemented the USDA\u2019s recommended program for animal handling: A Systematic Approach to Humane Handling and Slaughter. This program has four elements:\n\n- Initial assessment of where and under what circumstances livestock may experience excitement, discomfort or accidental injury while being handled in connection with transportation, holding or slaughter\n- Facility design and implementation of training and practices, addressed through standard operating procedures that will minimize the risk of undue excitement, discomfort or accidental injury\n- Periodic auditing of facility design and practices used to ensure that livestock are handled humanely\n- Continuous improvement of our process using internal and third-party audit results, incorporation of regulatory changes, performance trends and improvement opportunities that arise during discussion in our weekly Animal Welfare Team meetings\n\nIn Canada, our beef production facility implements animal welfare programs that align with NAMI guidelines.\nguidelines and comply with the CFIA Meat Inspection Regulations.\n\nAs part of the animal welfare programs in our North American beef and pork production facilities, we also use an internal Animal Welfare Index with key performance indicators based on stunning efficiency, prodding and insensibility. Our Animal Welfare Index Goals are calculated based on a 100-point score. For production facilities that score below their targeted goal, immediate corrective actions are required and implemented.\n\nAll of our U.S. pork production facilities use controlled atmospheric stunning technology, and as such, use a modified internal Animal Welfare Index that includes metrics for humanely filling the gondolas, where hogs are gathered for atmospheric stunning, rather than stunning efficiency.\n\nFor our U.S. live pork operations, team members and contract partners understand that using low-stress handling techniques is one of the true arts of successful, humane pork production. Specific handling guidelines and standards to improve low-stress handling on our farms are outlined in our producer manuals.\n\nIn Australia, our production facilities implement animal welfare programs that comply with the AMIC Industry Animal Welfare Standard \u2013 Livestock Processing Establishments and The Australian Standard for Hygienic Production and Transportation of Meat and Meat Products for Human Consumption AS4696. Compliance with our programs is verified through daily and third-party audits. The industry program sets six standards:\n\n- Management procedures and planning\n- Design and maintenance of facilities and equipment\n- Staff competency\n- Management and humane destruction of weak, ill or injured livestock\n- Management of livestock to minimize stress and injuries\n- Humane slaughter procedures\n\nWe use an internal Animal Welfare Index with key performance indicators based on stunning efficiency, prodding and insensibility.\nFor our JBS Australia feedlots, all team members who handle cattle are trained in animal husbandry, proper positioning and flight zone techniques, low-stress handling techniques and proper protocols for when an animal is uncooperative, aggressive or uneasy. In addition to properly training team members, facility design and maintenance are critical to low-stress handling in our feedlots. Facilities are designed to ensure smooth cattle flow, and team members are trained to identify potential problems that may impede the flow of cattle through our facilities. In addition, our animal welfare commitments and program include working animals, such as horses used in our feedlots. All hogs are sourced from Australia Pork Industry Quality Assurance Program (APIQ) accredited farms with industry best-practice animal welfare standards.\n\nFor Pilgrim\u2019s, our U.S. animal welfare programs meet or exceed PAACO-certified NCC Guidelines for our breeders, hatcheries, broilers and at slaughter. Our Mexico complexes are compliant with the Federally Inspected Type (FIT), a voluntary food-quality certification of the Mexican government. Our facilities in Europe are compliant with Council Regulation N\u00b01099/2009 standards on animal welfare. Across all Pilgrim\u2019s facilities, handling of animals for any reason, including vaccinations, treatment and movement to new facilities or processing is done using approved methods to avoid injury. At processing facilities, chickens are handled in a humane manner and lighting is adjusted to keep the chickens calm.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s UK higher welfare supply chain raises hogs according to the RSPCA higher welfare standards as a minimum and has been awarded the highest ranking, Tier 1, by the Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare (BBFAW) for its animal welfare performance, through an independently commissioned private review. Pilgrim\u2019s UK approved facilities also process lambs. Handling of hogs and lambs is done using low-stress techniques and facilities are maintained to ensure appropriate animal flow. Controlled atmospheric stunning is utilized for all hogs. Animal welfare practices at production facilities are in compliance with Council Regulation N\u00b01099/2009 standards which are monitored daily by Food Standards Agency (FSA) inspectors.\n\nOur animal welfare programs include specific requirements and procedures to protect the health and welfare of our livestock and poultry.\n\n### ANIMAL WELFARE INDEX\n\n**JBS USA and Canada beef production facilities**\n\n| Audit Categories       | Unacceptable | Bottom Performer | Goal | Top Performer |\n|------------------------|--------------|------------------|------|---------------|\n|                        | Performance (%) | Points Earned | Performance (%) | Points Earned | Performance (%) | Points Earned | Performance (%) | Points Earned |\n| Stunning Efficiency    | 97.0          | 0.0              | 98.5 | 27.0          | 99.0          | 28.5          | 100.0          | 30.0          |\n| Prodding               | 15.0          | 0.0              | 8.0  | 27.0          | 5.0           | 28.5          | 0.0            | 30.0          |\n| Insensibility          | 99.2          | 0.0              | 99.7 | 36.0          | 99.8          | 38.0          | 100.0          | 40.0          |\nFor our U.S. live pork operations, team members and contract partners understand that using low-stress handling techniques is one of the true arts of successful, humane pork production.

Improper handling of livestock results in immediate corrective actions and can result in the transporter being permanently banned from delivering livestock to JBS USA facilities in the future.\n\nIn Europe, our pork and approved lamb production facilities require that livestock are moved in their social groups, and hog trailers are equipped with lifting decks to make loading as stress free as possible. Trailers are bedded with straw and in the summer months extra drinking water is provided. We monitor transport time with an average journey time of four hours, and our position is that no animal should be in transit to a Pilgrim\u2019s UK production facility for longer than eight hours.\n\nOur JBS USA Carriers business is responsible for providing safe transportation to more than 1.5 million cattle each year. Delivering cattle in a manner that promotes humane handling during loading at the feed yard, a safe journey for both drivers and animals, and minimal stress on cattle during unloading at our facilities is our priority. JBS USA Carriers takes pride in the safe and efficient transport of animals to production facilities across the country, and our drivers have a passion for the industry and their important role.\n\nJBS USA Carriers, in conjunction with Five Rivers Cattle Feeding (JBS USA\u2019s largest producer partner) animal welfare teams, provides drivers with animal-handling and safety training. The training materials are based on the BQAT program, which is widely recognized as the industry standard for truck driver training.\n\nWhen Pilgrim\u2019s chickens are transported during cold weather, we add side and front panels to the transport cages to keep chickens warm. During the summer months, we reduce the number of chickens per cage and keep them cool and minimize heat stress with shade, fans and misters. We work to minimize the amount of time chickens spend in cages, consistent with regionally appropriate animal welfare practices. We also monitor handling and transportation animal welfare metrics of our chickens.\nHumane handling performance is shared weekly with all facilities and senior management to guarantee constant and consistent oversight, and sharing of best management practices and corrective actions.\n\n### U.S. BEEF PRODUCTION FACILITIES\n\n| Indicator          | Goal  | Performance |\n|--------------------|-------|-------------|\n| Stunning Efficiency| \u226599.0%| 99.9%       |\n| Prodding           | \u22645.0% | 1.6%        |\n| Insensibility      | \u226599.8%| 100.0%      |\n| Animal Welfare Index| \u226595.0%| 99.4%       |\n\n- Passed third-party external audits with scores ranging from 98% \u2013 100%.\n- Passed third-party transportation audits with scores ranging from 98.6% \u2013 100%.\n- All third-party audits passed on the first attempt.\n\n### JBS CANADA\n\n| Indicator          | Goal  | Performance |\n|--------------------|-------|-------------|\n| Stunning Efficiency| \u226599.0%| 99.4%       |\n| Prodding           | \u22645.0% | 4.7%        |\n| Insensibility      | \u226599.8%| 100.0%      |\n| Animal Welfare Index| \u226595.0%| 97.6%       |\n\n- Passed third-party external audits with scores ranging from 99.2% \u2013 100%.\n- Passed third-party transportation audits with scores of 100%.\n- All third-party audits passed on the first attempt.\n\n### JBS USA PORK PRODUCTION FACILITIES\n\n| Indicator          | Goal  | Performance |\n|--------------------|-------|-------------|\n| Animal Welfare Index| \u226597.0%| 99.6%       |\n\n- Passed third-party audits with scores ranging from 98.9% \u2013 100%.\n- Passed third-party transportation audits with scores of 100%.\n- All third-party audits passed on the first attempt.\n\n### JBS USA Live Pork\n\n- Passed external third-party audits with an average score of 99.4% and a range of scores from 99.3% -100%.\n\n### JBS AUSTRALIA\n\n| Indicator          | Goal  | Performance |\n|--------------------|-------|-------------|\n| Falls/Slipping     | \u22653.0% | 0.08%       |\n| Stunning Efficiency| \u226498.3%| 99.00%      |\n| Prodding           | \u226515.0%| 5.00%       |\n| Insensibility      | \u2265100.0%| 100.0%     |\n\n- Maintained all third-party and regulatory animal welfare audits and accreditations.\n\n### Pilgrim\u2019s U.S.\n\n- Passed internal audits with an average score of 95.6%.\n- Passed external audits with an average score of 99.5% and a range of scores from 97.7% \u2013 100%.\n- Passed 100% of external audits.\n\n### Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park\n\n- Passed all internal and external audits.\n\n### Pilgrim\u2019s Mexico\n\n- Passed all internal and external audits.\n\n### Pilgrim\u2019s UK\n\n- Passed all internal and external audits.\nOur Commitment\n\nJBS USA is committed to providing the livestock and poultry under our care with comfortable and safe housing that meets their needs. Housing is key to protecting and improving the health and well-being of our animals.\n\nOur facilities meet or exceed industry guidelines to make sure that our animals are comfortable and safeguarded from extreme weather events, predators and vermin.\nHousing for our Livestock and Poultry\n\nOur facilities meet or exceed industry guidelines to make sure that our animals are comfortable and safeguarded from extreme weather events, predators and vermin. In our production facilities, pen stocking rates are set according to NAMI Animal Handling Guidelines, CFIA Meat Inspection Regulations and AMIC Industry Animal Welfare Standards, and livestock have access to clean water at all times.\n\nCattle in our JBS Australia feedlots are housed in groups in open-pen, dirt lots. Pen stocking rates meet or exceed industry standards and are based on the animal\u2019s expected final weight. Cattle have access to an unlimited supply of clean water and are fed twice daily. The pens are sloped for proper drainage during winter months and wet periods to provide cattle a dry place to lie down and reduce mud in the pens. For feedlots that are located in regions with extreme weather, shade is provided to prevent heat stress, and bedding is supplied to provide a dry and warm place to lie down in winter months.\n\nThe hogs we raise in the U.S. are housed indoors where health and welfare are prioritized. Our sows are provided with unlimited access to clean water and are fed a nutritionally balanced diet based on life stage and individual body condition. Weaned and growing hogs in the nursery and finishing stages of production are provided with unlimited access to clean water and feed. Specific standard operating procedures for maintaining animal comfort and housing are further defined in the Live Pork Production Manuals. Climate-controlled ventilation systems are expected to be maintained to promote animal comfort, control humidity, deliver quality air and maintain desirable temperatures according to hog size and life stage. 100% of our U.S.-owned sows are housed in open pen systems based on the standard set in Colorado Senate Bill 08-201, which states, \u201cA Gestating Sow [shall/may] be kept in a manner that permits the sow to stand up, lie down and turn around without touching the sides of its enclosure until no earlier than 12 days prior to the expected date of farrowing. For purposes of this standard, a \u2018Gestating Sow\u2019 shall mean a confirmed pregnant member of the porcine species with such confirmation typically occurring between days 40 and 45 of gestation. Until confirmation of pregnancy, such animals may be individually housed.\u201d\nAssessing the daily needs and health status of the animals under our care is essential to ensuring their well-being. In our Australian cattle feedlots, this begins immediately when cattle arrive at our facilities, where they are assessed for their overall health and nutrition status. Upon arrival, cattle are provided an individual identification tag and are vaccinated. Cattle are checked daily for injury and illness by experienced pen riders. An animal that is identified as requiring additional care is moved to the hospital area, where it is provided treatment under the direction of our veterinarians and animal health technicians.\n\nOur U.S. live pork operation staff and contract sow and finishing partners monitor the health of hogs daily. Production field managers and veterinarians provide support to each contract partner, visiting the farm regularly and remaining on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to maintain the health of our hogs. Field managers inspect the health and nutrition status of the pigs to make sure that our nutrition and health programs are implemented appropriately and that animals are in optimal condition.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s family poultry farm partners are required to inspect the houses and chickens at least twice a day. They check for housing conditions such as ventilation, air quality, water, feed lines and bedding material quality, and closely observe eye health and lameness. Any chickens unable to thrive are humanely euthanized using an American Veterinary Medical Association or equivalent approved technique, such as cervical dislocation. Pilgrim\u2019s technicians also work with each farm family, visiting regularly and remaining on call for the farm 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to maintain the health of our flocks. Our technicians inspect both the farm and the chickens during their visit, monitoring health factors such as eye and leg health, mortality, house and farm conditions, rodent and/or pest issues, proper ventilation, ammonia level, litter condition, adequacy of feed intake and water supply. Pilgrim\u2019s technicians not only monitor the farm\u2019s health plan; they also share best practices on how to raise healthier chickens.\n\nAt Pilgrim\u2019s UK, within our higher welfare hog supply chain, we make sure that farm partners within our supply chain thoroughly understand our animal welfare requirements, and we regularly support them through farm visits and with training on animal husbandry, welfare and health by our own team of experienced field staff and vets. We also host quarterly update meetings with our family farm partners, inclusive of training initiatives.\nNutrition\n\nProviding the proper nutrition to maintain appropriate body condition and optimize growth is critical to the overall health and welfare of our animals. Our team of Ph. D. and expert nutritionists formulate diets specific to the animal\u2019s species and life stage and adjusts diets, daily if necessary, to optimize growth and prevent nutritional deficiencies and digestive disorders. We manufacture our own feed in company-owned and contracted feed mills, using a proprietary mixture that includes corn, ground hay (for cattle) and other grains.\n\nGrowth promoting hormones are not used in chicken or hog production in the U.S., U.K. or Australia.\n\nEach facility has a written health plan that is developed in consultation with our veterinarians\n\nVeterinary Care\n\nOur licensed veterinarians establish and monitor all health and vaccine protocols and follow all government regulations. Our veterinarians perform routine health checks and are available for consultation on any issue. Each facility has a written health plan that is developed in consultation with our veterinarians and includes specifications regarding animal management, vaccination schedules, animal-health monitoring and treatment, mortality and morbidity monitoring, and measures taken to prevent disease transmission.\n\nOur veterinarians work to mitigate or eliminate pain for our animals. In the U.S., the procedures we perform on our hogs prevent injuries later in life and improve meat quality. Procedures include tail docking and castration, and are consistent with our animal welfare program. At JBS Australia feedlots, we work diligently to purchase cattle that have been pre-conditioned, which means that cattle have been previously castrated and disbudded (if necessary) at a young age, vaccinated and weaned before arriving at our feedlots.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s does not perform physical alterations to any of our chickens. In the Pilgrim\u2019s supply chain, we only purchase roosters and breeders from breeding companies that have strict protocols in place to minimize stress related to these procedures.\n\nAt Pilgrim\u2019s UK, routine tail docking is not performed and is only permitted with veterinary approval, while castration is not permitted. Pilgrim\u2019s UK continues to lead the industry in research to advance animal welfare. Our current research includes a project examining pig behavior and its impact upon tail biting. The objective is to understand more about causal factors associated with tail biting and how tail docking can be reduced.\nAt JBS USA, all antibiotics are used under the supervision of licensed and accredited Doctors of Veterinary Medicine and only for the purposes of preventing, controlling or treating disease, rather than growth promotion or feed efficiency. Our antibiotic policy also requires written veterinary permission before the use of any antibiotics, diligent record-keeping and tracking of all antibiotic use and training programs for JBS USA team members. Training helps guarantee compliance with our comprehensive health and disease-prevention programs, including animal husbandry, hygiene, monitoring and vaccination. We focus on producing healthy animals through good hygiene and husbandry practices.\n\nJBS USA has always practiced the principles of judicious use regarding antibiotics; and given the increased concern regarding antimicrobial resistance, we have developed statements regarding antibiotic use for our cattle and pork supply chain partners in the U.S.\n\nAs a leading provider of high-quality protein that is enjoyed by millions of consumers worldwide, JBS USA has a dual obligation of meeting the varying demands of our diverse customers, while promoting and ensuring the health and welfare of the cattle and hogs we purchase.\n\nJBS USA supports the judicious use of antibiotics under a valid VCPR (Veterinary Client Patient Relationship) and in accordance with the Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) Judicious Use of Antimicrobials Guidelines for cattle and the Pork Quality Assurance Plus (PQA+) Antibiotic Principles for hogs. JBS USA endorses the prevention of disease in cattle and hogs to effectively minimize the use of antibiotics, as described in the BQA and PQA+ programs. Comprehensive individual and herd health programs should be in place, including routine vaccination, balanced nutrition, and optimal animal husbandry. When illness occurs, documented disease detection and prevention programs should be employed under the guidance of licensed veterinarians.\n\nUnder a VCPR and in accordance with the guidelines and principles listed in BQA and PQA+, we support the use of medically important antibiotics in our cattle and hog supply under the supervision of licensed veterinarians for therapeutic use only, defined as prevention, control, and treatment of disease, rather than growth promotion or feed efficiency.\n\nBiosecurity\n\nEach JBS USA livestock and poultry facility has a comprehensive biosecurity program that has been designed and implemented to prevent the introduction of infectious diseases to our livestock and poultry through human and animal vectors or contaminated equipment. Our biosecurity protocol addresses every aspect of our facilities: feed mill operations, feed delivery, transportation, vaccination and health management, visitors and auditors. All team members and contract partners are trained according to our biosecurity protocols, and all visitors and vendors must be prescreened and approved before arriving at any of our locations. Sign-in logs are also required and maintained at all locations.\nTo ensure the responsible use of antibiotics and the welfare of the cattle and hogs we purchase, we require the following:\n\n- Compliance with the BQA Guidelines for Judicious Use of Antimicrobials for cattle and the PQA+ Antibiotic Principles for hogs, which includes a VCPR\n- Antibiotics classified as critical to human medicine are only used at therapeutic levels as prescribed by licensed veterinarians\n- Sub-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics is not practiced\n- Full compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance 209 and 213 Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) rule. This guidance discontinues the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion and requires veterinary oversight of all medically important antibiotics. All antibiotics listed by the FDA as important for human medicine require a VFD issued by a licensed veterinarian before they can be used in cattle or pig feed.\n\nThe farm and ranch partners who supply cattle and hogs guarantee compliance to these requirements by completing an affidavit at the point of sale and are randomly third-party audited, ensuring compliance with BQA and PQA+. Our process-verified programs (natural, organic, grass-fed, antibiotic free, etc.) may require additional compliance depending upon specific program requirements.\n\nJBS USA is a founding member of the International Consortium for Antimicrobial Stewardship in Agriculture (ICASA) which is a public-private partnership advancing research in animal health and welfare as well as antimicrobial stewardship in agriculture.\n\nThis consortium was created by the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) to increase investment in research promoting the judicious use of antibiotics and improving animal health and wellness.\nAt Pilgrim\u2019s, all antibiotics are used under the supervision of licensed and accredited Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and only for the purposes of preventing, controlling or treating disease, rather than growth promotion or feed efficiency. Pilgrim\u2019s is focused on producing healthy animals through good hygiene and husbandry practices. Any use of antibiotics is strictly governed by national regulations and requires authorization by the overseeing Doctor of Veterinary Medicine or veterinary surgeon who care for the poultry. Any medication used is licensed by the FDA or U.K. Veterinary Medicines Directorate and undergoes intense scrutiny before being approved for use.\n\nIn the U.S., Pilgrims\u2019 has been antibiotic free in all company hatcheries since 2016 and is fully compliant with the FDA Guidance 209 and 213 VFD rule. Any antibiotic use is under the strict guidance of the company\u2019s licensed, USDA accredited and board-certified veterinarians and is strictly for disease prevention, control or treatment. The Pilgrim\u2019s antibiotic policy is reviewed annually.\n\nFor Pilgrim\u2019s Mexico, the use of antibiotics is supervised by veterinarians. For traceability and control purposes, farms keep a record of these products, dosage and application period, to meet the withdrawal times established by the governing body, The General Directorate of Animal Health, which is part of SENASICA. All antibiotics used are registered by The General Directorate of Animal Health.\n\nIn Europe, records of medications used on farms are inspected by the auditors of the Red Tractor Scheme and by the local authority Animal Health inspectors as legally required. In addition, Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park has an Antimicrobial Stewardship Forum focused on the education of poultry producers in antimicrobial resistance and best practices to reduce antimicrobial usage and collects comprehensive data to give the poultry industry and regulators a clear picture of poultry-usage trends. Pilgrim\u2019s Moy Park established a Food Safety Forum and Antibiotics Stewardship Forum, to ensure that our chickens are healthy and our products are safe. These forums include external experts who assist us with the latest scientific developments.\n\nPilgrim\u2019s UK has introduced an industry leading initiative in our own higher welfare supply chains to reduce the need for antibiotic use by improving pig management and health. We have voluntarily implemented stringent controls on the use of Critically Important Antibiotics (CIAs). Since implementing our antibiotic stewardship strategy in 2013, we have reduced use by more than 70%. Antibiotic usage within our own higher welfare supply chain has been consistently below the U.K. swine sector target for 2020. Pilgrim\u2019s UK\u2019s independent supply partners, as part of the U.K. swine industry, have achieved the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance (RUMA) target for the responsible use of antibiotics since its start in 2017.\n\nAs part of our long-standing commitment to safeguard the welfare of our animals, we do not withhold antibiotic treatment if a licensed veterinarian has determined it is the appropriate course of action. If antibiotic treatment is necessary, the animal is transitioned out of our antibiotic-free/NAE and organic programs and moved into our conventional programs while adhering to all appropriate antibiotic withdrawal times prior to processing. We will never allow a sick animal to suffer.\nWe are committed to reducing the use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry production, and have conducted extensive research to optimize livestock and poultry management to reduce the incidence of disease and identify other products that promote and strengthen animal health and disease prevention.\n\nWhile we continue to innovate, adopt new products and improve management to reduce the incidence of disease, it is important to remember that we cannot completely replace antibiotics and ionophores for the treatment and prevention of disease. JBS USA veterinary and nutrition teams will continue to work closely with companies that produce these alternative compounds, as well as universities and private researchers to make sure that we are on the leading edge of innovation as we continue to provide our customers with wholesome, healthy and nutritious meat and chicken products.\n\nAlternatives to Antibiotics\n\nWe only raise and source livestock and poultry that have not been cloned, genetically modified or engineered.\n\nCloning and Genetic Engineering\n\nWe only raise and source livestock and poultry that have not been cloned, genetically modified or engineered. However, we are also aware that scientific developments which may benefit the health and well-being of livestock and poultry are ongoing and we will continue to review these in partnership with our customers.\n\nFor more information on the animal welfare requirements for our suppliers, please visit Suppliers.\n\n2020 Key Facts and Figures\n\n- **98-100%** scores achieved on external animal welfare audits\n- **99.4%** U.S. beef production facilities\u2019 Animal Welfare Index Score, surpassing our goal\n- **99.6%** U.S. pork production facilities\u2019 Animal Welfare Index score, surpassing our goal\n- **100%** of team members who have contact with animals have been trained according to our animal welfare programs\nEthics and Compliance\n\nJBS monitors, evaluates and improves compliance actions throughout the operation to foster an environment of ethics and integrity.\nWe have an independent JBS USA Advisory Board to support the company\u2019s executive leadership on matters related to corporate governance, government and regulatory affairs, commodity risk management and marketing.

GRI 102-18\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Group (ECG) has a dual reporting structure to the Independent Advisory Board and the CEO for JBS USA and to the Board of Directors and the CFO for Pilgrim\u2019s. The ECG is responsible for managing the JBS USA and Pilgrim\u2019s \u201cEthics Line\u201d and for developing, administering and training on the policies and procedures ancillary to the Code of Conduct & Ethics, including anti-bribery/anticorruption, anti-trust/competition, international trade and sanctions, conflicts of interest and gifts. GRI 102-25\n\nJBS USA also has a Supplier Code of Conduct, which is administered by the ECG, and requires third-party vendors to adopt and demonstrate the same commitment by following acceptable standards of business conduct and integrity and complying with all applicable laws, regulations and rules.\n\nLearn more by visiting here\nJBS USA\u2019s Code of Conduct and Ethics includes behavioral guidelines and standards to ensure appropriate workplace conduct, efficient and safe operations and the well-being of our team members. All JBS USA team members receive annual in-person, online or video-based training on the Code of Conduct and Ethics. All JBS USA team members are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct and Ethics in their divisions.\n\nThe Code has policies for each of the company\u2019s major risk areas, including team member safety, food safety, environmental compliance, animal welfare, corporate ethics, workplace conduct and taxation and finance.\n\nIn addition to Code of Conduct and Ethics training, new team members also receive an ethics handbook during orientation and are expected to abide by our policies regardless of their position in the company. Corrective actions for violating the Code or company policies include coaching, written warnings, final written warnings and, if necessary, termination of employment. Serious violations such as theft can result in immediate termination.\n\nAdditionally, JBS USA provides all team members of all levels with harassment training annually. Harassment of team members by supervisors or co-workers is a violation of federal law and company policy. JBS USA has in place a policy concerning all forms of harassment, including but not limited to, sex-based harassment, harassment and retaliation against individuals who report any form of harassment in our workplace.\n\nEach JBS USA facility has anonymous and non-anonymous ways to report grievances. Team members can bring their concerns directly to management, without retaliation or fear of retaliation. With our Open Door Policy, full- and part-time team members are encouraged to bring issues that they feel are impacting their performance or environment to supervisors or the Human Resources department. Team members are also encouraged to talk with their supervisor about situations when they feel they have not been treated fairly.\n\nThe JBS USA Ethics Line is available to every team member in every country where the company operates, and is provided in 11 languages to accommodate our diverse workforce. Through the Ethics Line, all JBS USA team members have access to a toll-free phone number and an online platform to securely and confidentially report concerns, unethical behavior or policy violations. Reporting can be done anonymously. In 2020, 1,974 Ethics Line reports were filed, investigated and closed, with appropriate personnel or other administrative action taken when warranted.\n\nAll team members are introduced to the Open Door Policy and Ethics Line during new-hire orientation, and all new managers discuss the Policy and related procedures with senior management when they assume their roles. Using data from Open Door Policy discussions and Ethics Line reports, we monitor overall team member perceptions.\nAdjusted EBITDA net was US$ 3.8 billion in 2020, which corresponds to an increase of 8.6% in relation to 2019.\n\nOur financials are consolidated and reported with many of the business units described above.
