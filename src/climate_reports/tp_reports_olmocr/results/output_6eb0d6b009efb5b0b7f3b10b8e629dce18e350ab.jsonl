That is not true. A sustainable energy economy is clean and far more efficient\u2014requiring only half the primary energy of a fossil fuel economy.\nThe transition to sustainable energy will reduce global mining and extraction needs.\n\nCurrent Mining Extraction\n\n- All Other Materials Mined\n- Fossil Fuel Extraction\n- Sustainable Economy Materials\n\n= 1 Gigaton\n\nFully Sustainable Economy\n\nNote: These are the minerals that we focus our responsible battery sourcing efforts on\u2014particularly lithium, nickel and cobalt.\nThe investment required is manageable and achievable\n\nTotal land use, capital investment and resource requirements are achievable. Additionally, a sustainable energy economy actually requires less investment and less material extraction than continuing today\u2019s unsustainable path.\n\n- **240 TWh** Storage\n- **0.2%** Land area required\n- **$10T** Manufacturing investment\n- **30 TW** Renewable power\n- **1/2** The energy required\n- **10%** 2022 world GDP\n- **Zero** Insurmountable resource challenges\nBeyond Tesla\n\nWhile we are uniquely focused on accelerating the world\u2019s transition to sustainability, a full transition will require efforts far beyond Tesla. In Master Plan Part 3, we highlight five key areas that we believe can most dramatically advance the shift to sustainability.\n\nA five-step plan to shift to sustainable energy\nIncluding transportation, heat generation and industrial manufacturing\n\n- **36%** Renewably Power the Existing Grid\n- **22%** Switch to Electric Vehicles\n- **23%** Switch to Heat Pumps\n- **13%** High Temp Heat Delivery & Hydrogen\n- **6%** Sustainably Fuel Planes & Boats\nThe path to 100% sustainability by 2050\n\nTo accomplish this five-step plan, the world\u2019s annual deployment of solar and wind and annual production of batteries will need to continue to grow. We believe these growth rates are achievable.\n\n**Solar & Wind Deployment (TW/yr)**\n\n- **2022 Deployment**: 0.36\n- **Required Deployment Per Year**: 1.0\n- **3x increase**\n\n**Vehicle, Stationary & Thermal Battery Production (TWh/yr)**\n\n- **2022 Deployment**: 0.54\n- **Required Deployment Per Year**: 16\n- **29x increase**\n\n**Electric Vehicle Production (Millions/yr)**\n\n- **2022 Deployment**: 8\n- **Required Deployment Per Year**: 85\n- **11x increase**\nTotal solar, wind and battery installed base and investment needed\n\n| Solar & Wind Farms | Vehicle & Stationary Batteries | Manufacturing Capex |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|\n| **30.4 TW**        | **240 TWh**                    | **$10 T**           |\n| Renewable Energy Grid | 10.6                           | Renewable Energy Grid | 0.8 |\n| Switch to EVs      | 4.8                            | Switch to EVs       | 7.0 |\n| Heat Pumps         | 4.8                            | Heat Pumps          | 0.3 |\n| High Temp Thermal  | 6.5                            | High Temp Thermal   | 0.8 |\n| Planes & Ships     | 3.7                            | Planes & Ships      | 1.0 |\n| **Total**          | **30.4 TW**                    | **Total**           | **$10 T** |\n|                    |                                |                     |       |\n\nImpact Report 2022  Master Plan Part 3\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nTHE FUTURE IS ELECTRIC\n13.4 Mmt of CO\u2082e emissions avoided\n\n100% renewable Supercharger network\n\n-30% Greenhouse gas emissions per vehicle\n\n-15% H\u2082O per vehicle\n\n90% of manufacturing waste recycled\nWe make products that displace fossil fuel alternatives.\nAir pollution from burning fossil fuels leads to premature deaths\n\nPollution from burning fossil fuels leads to eight million premature deaths globally each year. That accounts for one-in-five premature deaths worldwide.\n\nThis is a major advantage of zero-emission products that is often forgotten. Our products are not just about the future of our planet, but also about addressing preventable deaths today.\n\nNote: According to recently published research in Environmental Research by Harvard University, in collaboration with the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London, air pollution causes over eight million premature deaths annually.\nTesla produced and delivered over 1.3 million EVs globally in 2022\n\nAlthough we are focused on our own deliveries, electric vehicle (EV) sales by all carmakers need to increase. We hope that every vehicle manufacturer will strive to produce hundreds of thousands of EVs per year, as significant reductions in emissions will only be achieved with an industry-wide shift.\n\nEmissions credit revenue is used for EV capacity expansion, which in turn displaces internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. In 2022, we generated almost $1.8 billion in revenue selling zero-emission regulatory credits to other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\n\nWhile it is common practice today for ICE vehicle OEMs to purchase regulatory credits from other companies (such as Tesla) to offset their emissions, it is not a sustainable strategy. In order to meet increasingly strict regulatory requirements across the world, OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive EVs.\nA single Tesla vehicle avoids 55 tons of CO$_2$e over its life\n\nAfter approximately two years of driving, an EV\u2019s lifetime emissions are lower than an ICE vehicle\u2019s.\n\nWhile EVs today still emit more greenhouse gases (GHGs) during the manufacturing phase, including emissions from the supply chain, it takes less than two years\u2019 worth of driving before the total emissions from an EV fall below that of a comparable ICE vehicle.\n\nAfter 17 years of driving\u2014the average life of a vehicle in the U.S.\u2014a single Tesla vehicle will avoid almost 55 tons of CO$_2$e.\n\nThis number is conservative for two reasons: it assumes no improvement in grid emissions over time and that an ICE vehicle maintains its fuel efficiency throughout its life.\nIn 2022, our customers avoided releasing about 13.4 million metric tons of CO$_2$e into our atmosphere.\n## Average Lifecycle Emissions\n\n### United States\n\n| Model 3/Y | Personal Use | Solar Charged | 68 |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------|----|\n|           | Personal Use | Grid Charged  | 134|\n|           | Average      | Premium ICE   | 467|\n\n### New York\n\n| Shift to Greener Grid | Personal Use | Solar Charged | 68 |\n|-----------------------|--------------|---------------|----|\n|                       | Personal Use | Grid Charged  | 113|\n|                       | Average      | Premium ICE   | 467|\n\n*Manufacturing Phase and Supply Chain\n\n*Use Phase\n\n*CO\u2082e/mi* = grams of CO\u2082-equivalent emissions per mile driven\nThe carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year of use\n\nThe grid keeps getting cleaner, while ICE vehicle emissions do not.\n\nBased on publicly available sales and fleet data, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is scrapped after 17 years and slightly less than 200,000 miles of driving. As an ICE vehicle ages, its fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly.\n\nMeanwhile, electricity generation to charge EVs has become \u201cgreener\u201d over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid. EV drivers can increase their renewable energy mix by installing solar energy generation or storage systems on their homes.\n\nCharging EVs becomes greener over time\n\nU.S. Electricity Grid Generation Mix\n(Conservative Estimate)\n\nSource: IEA\n2022-2040 Tesla estimate based on recent grid mix shifts. Conservatively assumes no change in federal policy or acceleration of move to renewables in the U.S. for electricity generation.\nGreater efficiency than a Prius, performance of a Porsche\n\nModel Y is the most efficient electric SUV\n\nTesla vehicles are among the most efficient EVs built to date. Model Y All-Wheel Drive (AWD) achieves 4.0 EPA miles/kWh, which makes it the most efficient electric SUV ever made. While achieving the best-in-class energy efficiency, our AWD models also provide impressive acceleration and speed.\n\n| Model     | 0-60 mph | Top Speed |\n|-----------|----------|-----------|\n| Model Y   | 4.3 s    | 135 mph   |\n| Long Range AWD |          |           |\n| Model 3   | 3.9 s    | 145 mph   |\n| Long Range AWD |          |           |\nEven after 200,000 miles, our batteries degrade just 12%\n\nWe often get asked: Will I need to replace my battery at some point in the future?\n\nThe answer is no. Since we\u2019ve been selling EVs for over a decade, we have a reliable data set that shows us battery degradation over time.\n\nWe estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after approximately 200,000 miles of usage in the U.S. and roughly 150,000 miles in Europe.\n\nEven after 200,000 miles of usage, our batteries lose just 12% of their capacity on average.\n\nNote: Mileage is only one factor in battery capacity retention; battery age is also a major factor. Retention figures at lower mileages above likely reflect the impact of age while higher mileage values, which come from high-utilization vehicles, likely reflect less influence from battery age. Performance of newer chemistries (not yet shown here) can vary and we plan to expand disclosure once we have sufficient data.\nReducing our manufacturing footprint\n\nBuilding more sustainable factories from the ground up\n\nCovering roof space with solar panels\n\nLeveraging AI to make our energy use more efficient\nProducing an EV requires less water than producing an ICE vehicle\n\nEach automaker may draw their boundaries slightly differently, depending on how vertically integrated they are. According to the latest publicly available figures, Tesla withdrew less water at facilities dedicated to vehicle manufacturing per vehicle produced than the majority of established automakers.\n\n15% YoY reduction in water used per vehicle\n\nPlease see metrics on page 208 in the appendix for more information.\n\nWater Withdrawal Intensity in Global Vehicle Manufacturing (m\u00b3/vehicle)\n\n|                      | Vehicle Manufacturing | Cell Manufacturing |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Gigafactory Berlin (est.)* | 1.80                  | 0.48               |\n| BMW                  | 1.90                  | 0.00               |\n| Tesla (2022)         | 2.57                  | 0.00               |\n| Gigafactory Texas (est.)* | 2.78                  | 0.84               |\n| Mercedes-Benz        | 2.91                  | 0.00               |\n| Industry Avg.        | 3.68                  | 0.00               |\n| VW Group             | 3.75                  | 0.00               |\n| Ford                 | 3.80                  | 0.00               |\n| Toyota               | 4.12                  | 0.00               |\n| GM                   | 4.54                  | 0.00               |\n| Stellantis           | 4.77                  | 0.00               |\n\n*Latest estimate for water consumption based on factory design.

This is mostly due to the emissions associated with an EV\u2019s battery; however, this upfront \u201cinvestment\u201d of CO$_2$e gets paid back after approximately two years of driving the vehicle.\n\nAfter that, an EV\u2019s lifetime CO$_2$e is less than a comparable ICE vehicle, ultimately resulting in ~55 tons of CO$_2$e savings over the lifetime of the EV. This savings will only get better over time as the EV supply chain and the grid used to charge EVs get cleaner through technological innovation, renewable energy deployment and increases in recycled battery materials.\n\n55 tons of CO$_2$e avoided\nReporting Tesla\u2019s 2022 Scope 3 Emissions (Category 1, 4)*\n\n*Categories are: (1) purchased goods and services, (4) upstream logistics\n\nFor specific efforts on how to calculate and reduce GHG emissions in the battery supply chain, see pages 156\u2013159.\nOur batteries rely on critical minerals\n\nBatteries drive Tesla\u2019s sustainability mission. Our cathodes and anodes contain critical minerals like lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper, graphite, manganese, iron and phosphorus.\n\nLithium, nickel and cobalt play an essential function in improving vehicle range and safety performance. While the relative amount of minerals needed for each cathode chemistry varies, Tesla\u2019s cell production growth rate will increase our demand for primary mined minerals\u2014these are essential for the transition to sustainable energy.\n\nSignificant part of battery cell costs = lithium, nickel and cobalt\nDirect sourcing from mining and refining companies allows us to engage in environmental and social issues in local contexts\u2014instead of having to rely on companies that typically sit between EV manufacturers and mining. This enables more transparent and traceable supply chain data.\n\nAll contracts include binding environmental and social requirements. Nickel and cobalt saw year-over-year increases.\nHotspot analyses help prioritize Tesla's GHG efforts\n\n**NCA Cell\u2014Global Warming Potential Contribution Analysis**\n\n| Component                        | Contribution to CO\u2082 Impact per kg |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Nickel                           | 36%                               |\n| Cobalt                           | 1%                                |\n| Lithium                          | 15%                               |\n| Aluminium                        | 4%                                |\n| Graphite                         | 21%                               |\n| Cathode Manufacturing            | 6%                                |\n| Electricity (Cell Assembly)      | 9%                                |\n| Other                            | 7%                                |\n| **Total**                        | **100%**                          |\n\n**LFP Cell\u2014Global Warming Potential Contribution Analysis**\n\n| Component                        | Contribution to CO\u2082 Impact per kg |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Lithium                          | 2%                                |\n| Graphite                         | 34%                               |\n| Iron                             | 1%                                |\n| Phosphorus                       | 3%                                |\n| Cathode Manufacturing            | 15%                               |\n| Electricity (Cell Assembly)      | 28%                               |\n| Other                            | 18%                               |\n| **Total**                        | **100%**                          |\n\n**Contribution to CO\u2082 Impact per kg**\n\n- **Lithium**\n  - Chemical Processing: 69%\n  - Primary Extraction: 17%\n  - Upgrading: 10%\n  - Transportation: 5%\n\n- **Nickel**\n  - Chemical Processing: 69%\n  - Primary Extraction: 18%\n  - Upgrading: 10%\n  - Transportation: 3%\n\n- **Cobalt**\n  - Chemical Processing: 77%\n  - Primary Extraction: 6%\n  - Upgrading: 13%\n  - Transportation: 4%", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/tesla_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 61, "total-input-tokens": 78628, "total-output-tokens": 10519, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 732, 2], [732, 770, 3], [770, 1133, 4], [1133, 1451, 5], [1451, 1818, 6], [1818, 2317, 7], [2317, 2922, 8], [2922, 3563, 9], [3563, 4506, 10], [4506, 4551, 11], [4551, 4725, 12], [4725, 4782, 13], [4782, 5466, 14], [5466, 6426, 15], [6426, 7159, 16], [7159, 7263, 17], [7263, 7891, 18], [7891, 8853, 19], [8853, 9484, 20], [9484, 10415, 21], [10415, 10600, 22], [10600, 12373, 23], [12373, 12537, 24], [12537, 12573, 25], [12573, 12807, 26], [12807, 12846, 27], [12846, 13667, 28], [13667, 14665, 29], [14665, 15265, 30], [15265, 15318, 31], [15318, 15636, 32], [15636, 15978, 33], [15978, 16852, 34], [16852, 17678, 35], [17678, 19374, 36], [19374, 19809, 37], [19809, 19847, 38], [19847, 19880, 39], [19880, 20598, 40], [20598, 21776, 41], [21776, 22430, 42], [22430, 23137, 43], [23137, 23208, 44], [23208, 23372, 45], [23372, 23945, 46], [23945, 25057, 47], [25057, 26661, 48], [26661, 26711, 49], [26711, 27763, 50], [27763, 28382, 51], [28382, 28991, 52], [28991, 29085, 53], [29085, 29318, 54], [29318, 29912, 55], [29912, 30883, 56], [30883, 31668, 57], [31668, 31916, 58], [31916, 32540, 59], [32540, 32940, 60], [32940, 35027, 61]]}}
