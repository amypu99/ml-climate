While that will always be an imperative, the world needs more from P&G now. It is not just top- and bottom-line growth that must be delivered and balanced. We must also endeavor to deliver against the needs of an increasing number of constituents\u2014consumers, retail customers, employees, society and our shareowners. The needs of each of these constituents must be met.\n\nThis is especially true of our Citizenship efforts in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) areas, where expectations among all stakeholders are growing.\n\nPeople increasingly rely on us to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable. Our world requires that we do our part in this regard. This challenge is also an opportunity to extend our margin of superiority, further grow categories, and create more value. We are working across climate, waste, water and nature to improve our own environmental impact, enable consumers to reduce their footprint, and help society solve some of the most pressing global challenges.\n\nWe are committed to an equal, diverse and inclusive organization and culture; one which brings forth the best ideas and innovations needed to win with consumers and customers and for each other. We do this best when we have a pipeline of outstanding and diverse talent at every level and an environment that supports each of us in being our full and authentic selves. Externally, we support equality and inclusion efforts with our business partners and in our communities because it is not only the right thing to do, but because it also can improve income and wealth equity for more people, creating more purchasing power, which drives market growth.\nCitizenship is how we refer to our efforts in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) areas, and we\u2019ve built Citizenship into how we do business every day.\n\nThe work we do in communities around the world to support people in difficult times is one of the most tangible ways we have immediate positive impact as a company. By providing clean water and donations of P&G products, time and financial resources to those in need, we help to improve lives. These actions, as well the rest of our Citizenship efforts, are also part of what employees are proud of and value in P&G, helping us attract and retain the best talent.\n\nFor 185 years, our foundation has been our Purpose, Values and Principles. They set a high standard for each P&G person and require that we hold ourselves and each other accountable for results and, equally important, for how we achieve those results. Last year, we added an ESG factor to our annual incentive compensation program for our senior executives as a demonstration of our commitment to near-term progress toward our long-term ESG goals. You can stay updated on our latest ESG data and reports via our portal at pginvestor.com.\n\nIn the ever more complex world we live in, it\u2019s not just top- and bottom-line that must be balanced. We must endeavor to balance the needs of consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners. Serving and balancing these needs will not be easy, but it is necessary\u2014and those that do it best, as I expect we will, should thrive.\n\nJon R. Moeller\nChairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer\nINSPIRED, VALUED AND GROWING\n\nOur citizenship efforts reflect the contributions of employees across the Company.

The United Way has been part of our corporate culture for over 80 years. Today, P&G is consistently one of the largest contributors to the non-profit\u2019s annual fundraising campaign in Greater Cincinnati and many more communities where P&G people live and work across the Americas. We\u2019ve stepped up to help our hometown community by donating more than $10 million to the United Way of Greater Cincinnati campaign.\n\nBuilding Home and Hope\n\nHabitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope. This year, P&G proudly partnered on programs to advance health and hygiene and gender equality, including:\n\n- Improving water and sanitation conditions for families in Argentina\n- Supporting older women and victims of domestic abuse by refurbishing a women\u2019s refuge in the United Kingdom\n- Providing access to hygiene and sanitation facilities for school children to reduce absenteeism in Kenya\nDISASTER RELIEF\n\nFor generations, P&G and our brands have united to support consumers and communities through unexpected challenges, emergencies and in times of need.

In addition to donating products, the Pampers plant remained operational and made space to accommodate rescue workers, fire brigade and Red Cross volunteers. The plant gave access to shelter, bathrooms, electricity and internet to the public, and employees worked together to provide support.\u201d\n\nMadhav\nP&G Germany\n\n\u201cWhen we got a once-in-a-century storm in British Columbia, Canada, it devastated access to basic resources like electricity and clean water. P&G partnered with GlobalMedic, a local disaster relief organization, to provide free laundry services through the Tide Loads of Hope program. I am proud that our Company and employees are always willing to step up and support communities in need.\u201d\n\nJoyce\nP&G Canada\n\nDuring times of disasters, we\u2019re continuing to provide ongoing support across the globe, guided by three core principles:\n\n- Protecting the health and well-being of P&G people\n- Serving consumers around the world who count on our brands and the benefits they provide\n- Supporting communities in need through our longstanding partnerships with local and global relief agencies\nSupporting Ukrainian Families\n\nMillions of people have been affected by the war in Ukraine, a majority of them women and children. Since the beginning, P&G has mobilized resources around the world to support employees, families and relief organizations in a variety of ways:\n\n- Provided millions of everyday essentials, including diapers, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and other cleaning, health and hygiene products to people displaced from their homes\n- Established a matching fund drive which was supported by thousands of P&G employees in more than 40 countries\n- Provided financial support to relief partners in their efforts to provide access to clean water, food, shelter, and health and care services in Ukraine and neighboring countries. Some of our partners include GlobalMedic, IFRC, International Medical Corps, Matthew 25: Ministries, Save the Children and Water Mission.\n\nSince March 2022, 7,000,000+ P&G products have been donated\n\n\u201cOur P&G colleagues in Central Europe have stepped up in so many ways since the earliest days of this crisis\u2014providing transportation from the border, opening their homes to provide safe places to sleep and caring about the personal needs of those displaced. I\u2019m so proud how we immediately helped, while simultaneously working to safely resume our operations and continue serving people across the region who depend on our products every day.\u201d\n\nGabe\nP&G Central Europe\nResponding to a Global Pandemic\n\nWe have offered diverse tools and flexible policies to our employees to help manage the challenges of working and living during a pandemic, including a focus on mental wellness. Our efforts to step up as a force for good for consumers have continued:\n\nWe provided donations of Safeguard, Crest, Whisper, Head & Shoulders and Pampers products to support the epidemic prevention and control work in Shanghai and Guangxi.\n\nWe sponsored the Por Um Sorriso (For a Smile) program in Brazil, bringing oral care services to vulnerable communities when access to the dentist became difficult during the extended challenges of the pandemic.\n\nRead more about our Community Impact efforts.\nWe aspire to create a company and a world where equality and inclusion are achievable for all, creating value and driving growth for our employees, through our brands, with our partners and in communities.\nEQUALITY & INCLUSION\n\n\u201cWe are committed to honoring the individuality and unique contributions of our people and ensuring that every single employee shows up to work as their whole, authentic self and feels safe in doing so.\n\nWe believe this makes P&G not only a great place to work but also a stronger company because it is through diversity of thinking that we become more in touch with the consumers we serve. To holistically serve consumers in ways that matter and resonate with them, we need to create the kind of diverse and inclusive culture that has been proven, time and again, to give life to the best thoughts and ideas.\u201d\n\nMeet P&G employees from around the world and learn how they\u2019re unleashing their full potential to make an impact on equality and inclusion.

P&G Beauty realized these consumers weren\u2019t fully enjoying the products and content that we offered and decided to act on it.\n\nWe started by making our communication accessible by adapting our commercials and influencing digital media platforms to adopt accessibility features such as enabling audio description on YouTube videos. Two of our brands\u2014Head & Shoulders and Olay\u2014were recognized as the most accessible brands in beauty for website accessibility.1 We also made our brands more accessible to in-store shopping, providing people with sight and cognitive impairments access to product information via partnerships with NaviLens\u2014a QR code technology for the visually impaired\u2014and The Royal National Institute for the Blind. Through these actions, we are making progress on our journey to make our brands, products and content accessible to all.\n\n1 Online Shopping Accessibility Index, 03/15/2022, Affise Academy: Online Shopping Accessibility Index \u2014 Affise\nWe've pledged to spend $5 BILLION annually with diverse-owned and women-led businesses by 2030.\n\nEmpowering Women-Owned and Women-Led Businesses\n\nAs a global company with a broad portfolio of trusted brands, we have the potential to provide diverse businesses with meaningful growth opportunities and accelerate economic inclusion and equity. Just as we know a diverse organization leads to better problem-solving and innovation, so does a diverse supply chain. We are committed to increasing our global spend with diverse- and women-owned and led businesses to $5 billion annually by 2030. In September 2021, we shared that we had surpassed $3 billion! One of the ways we are hard at work is increasing our investment with women-owned and led businesses throughout the world. We have many great partners to enable this, including WEConnect International.\n\nThrough P&G\u2019s Supplier Diversity efforts, in partnership with WEConnect International, over the past 5 years, we\u2019ve trained more than 1,000 women entrepreneurs in 10 countries across Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa. Several participants have become P&G\u2019s external business partners or suppliers and accelerated their own business growth thanks to their newly acquired skills. This also has had a ripple effect throughout the region.\n\nInspired by P&G\u2019s aspiration, many of our suppliers, agencies, and partners have employed more women in key positions within their organizations, including roles in manufacturing, logistics support, and media production, where gender bias has limited opportunities for women in the past.\nBelonging Starts with a Name\n\nAs we use our voice to bring visibility to the uniqueness of the consumers we serve, we continue to respectfully portray communities through accurate and authentic representation in our advertising. To help address rising levels of bias against the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, P&G released a new film \u201cThe Name,\u201d as part of an integrated campaign to inspire conversation and encourage people to learn how to say AAPI names, because feeling a sense of belonging in society starts with one\u2019s name.\n\nAccompanied by educational resources and tools at pg.com/names, the film elevated the importance of a name, and how meaningful gestures\u2014like pronunciation and understanding its meaning\u2014can create a greater sense of belonging for us all.\n\nPampers also joined the movement by expanding their existing popular baby name content on Pampers.com to engage even more consumers and recognize AAPI names. A new Snapchat filter let parents announce and celebrate their new baby\u2019s name, while the Pampers Snapchat AR Storybook program now includes books about the significance of AAPI names, allowing parents to celebrate these names with their little ones as they grow and read together.\nCan't Cancel Pride 2022\n\nP&G continued its long-term support of the LGBTQ+ community with our third annual Can't Cancel Pride benefit \u2014 \u201cProud AND Together.\u201d\n\nShowcasing the issues that continue to impact the LGBTQ+ community and highlighting intersectional messages of spirit and strength, the nationally broadcasted program brought together some of the biggest names in entertainment, including Elton John, Katy Perry, JoJo Siwa and Lizzo.\n\nP&G brands like Charmin, Dawn, and Tide proudly joined in with more than 16 million people watching this year. Can\u2019t Cancel Pride continues to raise support and create visibility for critical LGBTQ+ organizations, including CenterLink, GLAAD, National Black Justice Coalition, OutRight Action International, SAGE and The Trevor Project. The benefit has raised more than $11 million since its inception.\n\nRead more about our Equality & Inclusion efforts.\nEnvironmental sustainability is embedded in how we do business.

P&G\u2019s Climate Transition Action Plan covers the entire lifecycle emissions of our products and packaging, across supply chain, operations, consumer use of our products, and product end of life. Our comprehensive approach to accelerating climate action also includes navigating the key challenges ahead.\nCLIMATE GOALS AND PROGRESS\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nWe continue to drive progress towards our emission reductions in operations exceeding our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions target and accelerating our purchase of renewable electricity. To further reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG, we are developing solutions at pilot manufacturing sites that we can scale globally toward our Net Zero 2040 ambition.\n\n| GOALS | PROGRESS through June 30, 2022 |\n|-------|--------------------------------|\n| Reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 vs. 2010 baseline | 57% reduction \u2014 Achieved |\n| Purchase 100% renewable electricity globally by 2030 | 99% renewable electricity globally |\n\nINCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN OUR OPERATIONS\n\nReduction in Energy Consumption per Unit of Production\n\nPercent reduction vs. FY09/10\n\n| FY21/22 | FY20/21 | FY19/20 |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| -21%    | -21%    | -20%    |\n\nReducing Total GHG (Scope 1 & Scope 2)\n\nPercent reduction vs. FY09/10\n\n| FY21/22 | FY20/21 | FY19/20 |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| -57%    | -56%    | -52%    |\n\nEnergy and GHG\n\n| Total (absolute units x 1,000) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Energy Consumption (GJ)       | 62,340 | 63,077 | 62,816 |\n| Total GHG Emissions (metric tons) | 2,316 | 2,398 | 2,613 |\n| Scope 1 \u2014 Direct GHG Emissions (metric tons) | 2,160 | 2,238 | 2,221 |\n| Scope 2 \u2014 Indirect GHG Emissions (metric tons) | 156 | 160 | 392 |\n\nFor more detailed information on emissions, including Scope 3, please visit our ESG portal.\n\n1.

Note: Location-based Scope 2 emissions in 2022 were 2,323,446 metric tons.\n\nAll data references fiscal years.\nCLIMATE GOALS AND PROGRESS\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nWhile 2022 transportation results showed a slight increase to emissions intensity, our efforts to increase intermodal transportation and optimize container fill rates yielded improvements in finished product freight emissions intensity. These advancements did not overcome industry-wide ocean freight supply chain disruptions. We are optimistic that our further acceleration in key regions and a normalizing global landscape will drive reductions over the coming year.\n\n| GOALS | PROGRESS through June 30, 2022 |\n|-------|--------------------------------|\n| Reduce Global Upstream Finished Product Freight emissions intensity by 50% by 2030 (vs. 2020 baseline) | 2.9% increase |\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN\n\nIn 2021, we expanded our supply chain target to be inclusive of all P&G categories, in line with our Science Based Target Initiative approved goals. By taking a closer look at our Scope 3 emissions, we now know that ~10% of our ingredients (which equates to ~500 individual ingredients) account for ~90% of our supply chain emissions, which allows us to focus where we can drive the most change and advance better solutions. Further quantitative progress will be reported in 2023.\n\n| GOALS | PROGRESS through June 30, 2022 |\n|-------|--------------------------------|\n| Reduce supply chain emissions by 40% per unit of production by 2030 (vs. 2020 baseline) | New Goal\u2014progress to be reported end of 2023 |\n\nCARBON NEUTRAL OPERATIONS FOR 2020\u20132030\n\nP&G is committed to be carbon neutral for the decade (2020\u20132030) for our own operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions).\n\nWe are prioritizing cutting our operational emission as much as possible. For residual emissions that cannot be eliminated, we will use natural climate solutions that remove and store carbon.\n\nYou can read more about progress toward this goal in our nature pillar.\nThe Tide Infinity prototype and Tide to Go Pens and Wipes have been sent to the International Space Station for testing.\n\nTide in Space\n\nNASA needs a low-resource laundry solution to help enable deep space exploration. P&G\u2019s Tide brand is eager to learn how to clean effectively with less water to help protect our home planet. In 2020, Tide formally signed the multi-year Space Act Agreement with NASA. The first prototype, Tide Infinity, was sent to the International Space Station (ISS) for testing in December 2021 in collaboration with NASA and the ISS National Laboratory. Tide to Go Pens and Wipes have also completed testing aboard the ISS to understand the cleaning power of the brand\u2019s ingredients in microgravity. We can\u2019t wait to continue exploring how to apply the results of these tests for laundry solutions on Earth and beyond.\nPlastic waste in our environment is a serious problem, especially when it ends up in our rivers and oceans. It\u2019s a complex global challenge that requires a comprehensive, collaborative approach across the entire plastics lifecycle. Addressing this challenge and driving greater circularity for plastics will require collaboration across multiple stakeholders, including industry, governments, civil society and academics. While plastic can provide packaging material reductions, product protection, and lower greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, we must use and reuse it responsibly.\n\nAt P&G, we are working to design all our consumer packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2030. We are inventing and scaling new recycling solutions, using alternative materials, and partnering externally to help catalyze waste management infrastructure to improve access to collection\u2014keeping plastic in use and out of nature.\nWASTE GOALS AND PROGRESS\n\nOur brands, suppliers and partners continue to collaborate on a range of sustainable solutions and on driving circularity so that plastic is collected, recycled and reused. To track progress toward our goals, P&G considers packaging to be recyclable if there is at-scale collection, sorting, processing, and end markets for the material and format in at least one geography. We do not consider waste to energy and conversion to fuels as suitable end markets.\n\n| GOALS                                                                 | PROGRESS through June 30, 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 100% of our consumer packaging will be designed to be recyclable or reusable by 2030 | ~79% of our consumer packaging is designed to be recyclable or reusable |\n| Reduce our use of virgin petroleum plastic in our consumer packaging by 50% by 2030 vs. 2017 baseline | ~8% reduction of virgin petroleum plastic in packaging |\n| Zero manufacturing waste to landfill                                  | Achieved and maintained since 2020 |\n\nProgress to 100% Recyclable or Reusable Packaging\n\n- 79% FY21/22\n- 73% FY20/21\n- 55% FY19/20\n\nTypes of Resin Used in Packaging\n\n- PE (48.3%)\n- PET (23.2%)\n- PP (22.4%)\n- Other (6.2%)\n\nData and Metrics: Plastics Packaging\n\n- Tons of plastic packaging: 776,220 metric tons\n- Tons of recycled plastic resin: 96,469 metric tons\n- Percent of total resin used that was recycled: 12.4% recycled resin\n\nWe nearly doubled our use of recycled plastic over the past two years.\n\nIn 2021/2022, we diverted nearly 675,000 metric tons of manufacturing waste from the landfill which is heavier than 66 EIFFEL TOWERS.\nReducing Plastic Packaging\n\nGillette and Venus undertook a sustainable packaging upgrade to transition premium refillable razor packs to a plastic-free, recyclable cardboard box made with at least 50% recycled materials and Forest Stewardship Council\u2122 (FSC) certified paper. This more sustainable box is now available in every P&G region globally. It delights consumers with its ease of opening, appearance at shelf and full recyclability. We estimate this exterior packaging change saves the plastic equivalent of more than 85 million water bottles per year (based on 2020 sales volumes for North America and select Europe markets).\n\nBreakthrough Innovation and Partnership Toward Circular Plastic\n\nP&G aims to incorporate more recycled plastic in our packaging to reduce our reliance on virgin plastic and ensure that existing materials are better utilized. However, the quality of post-recycled resin does not always meet our high material standards for quality and product protection. Our corporate R&D teams developed a process to drastically improve the quality of recycled polypropylene (PP) plastic. This plastic resin accounts for roughly 20% of the plastic used in our packaging and has the potential to significantly increase our use of recycled content. This P&G process, VersoVita\u2122, takes nearly all the imperfections out of the resin and returns it to near-virgin quality. Rather than keeping this capability internally, P&G is making VersoVita\u2122 Circular Polymer Purification available for license to plastic manufacturers globally so they can produce high quality recycled resin to better meet industry demand and reduce plastic waste.\n\nP&G is also a proud supporter of The Recycling Partnership\u2019s Polypropylene Recycling Coalition. This industry collaboration recently led to the upgrading of polypropylene rigid containers as \u201cWidely Recyclable\u201d by the How2Recycle program (effective July 2022). This designation is the result of enrolling the full plastics recycling value chain to work together and increase the rate of recycling on this resin which is widely used in packaging and finished goods. Our efforts to advance the state of recycling through innovation paired with external collaborations via licensing and supporting industry-wide efforts are truly advancing the circularity and reuse of plastic resins.\n\n1 https://how2recycle.info/news/2022/how2recycle-upgrades-recyclability-of-certain-rigid-polypropylene-pp-formats\nAt P&G, we want to help build a water positive future that can sustain people and nature, now and for generations to come. Our comprehensive strategy includes reducing water in our operations, restoring water in water-stressed areas, and responding to water challenges through innovation and partnerships.\n\nIn 2022, we set goals for 2030 to restore more water than is consumed\\(^1\\) at P&G manufacturing sites in 18 water-stressed areas around the world; and to restore more water than is consumed\\(^2\\) when using P&G products in high water-stressed metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and Mexico City, recognized as a first-of-its-kind commitment. We will achieve these goals through partnerships and restoration projects that improve, manage and protect water resources.

Each area contains a P&G facility and is located within a top P&G market where more than 20% of the population is living in a high water-stress basin.\n\nRESTORING WATER: IMPROVING, MANAGING OR PROTECTING WATER\n\nTo address unique water challenges in the prioritized 18 water-stressed areas, we are working with on-the-ground partners who have a deep knowledge of local challenges, solutions, communities and landscapes to support long-term projects. To us, restoring water means improving, managing or protecting water.\n\nWatch the video.\nBuilding a Water Positive Future Together with Cascade\n\nCascade is helping to reduce daily water use in households across the U.S. by encouraging people to skip pre-rinsing dishes and run the dishwasher every night. Contrary to popular belief, the dishwasher uses four gallons of water per cycle, while the sink can use the same amount in just two minutes. With an innovative formula containing enzymes that latch on to and break down food particles, Cascade Platinum provides a superior clean without the pre-wash. By skipping the sink and choosing the dishwasher, households can save up to 100 gallons of water per week.\n\nIn addition to its work to help consumers save water at home, Cascade joined the Change the Course initiative to support water restoration projects in the U.S. The brand is currently working on a portfolio of projects that are expected to restore more than 2 billion gallons of freshwater in water-stressed regions for people and nature.\n\n1 50% more cleaning ingredients vs. Cascade Complete ActionPacs\u2122.\n2 With Energy Star certified dishwasher vs. washing dishes at a running sink for 11 minutes per day.\nAt P&G, we are committed to the long-term health of natural ecosystems that are essential to people, biodiversity and our business. Our efforts start with ensuring responsible sourcing of key commodities like wood pulp, palm oil and paper packaging that reflects our commitment to responsible sourcing and respecting human, labor and land tenure rights in our supply chains. We also go beyond our direct supply chain to protect, improve and restore ecosystems in more places, where it matters most. We are partnering and investing in nature-based solutions to positively impact more than 1.5 million acres of land, balance any remaining carbon emissions from our manufacturing operations this decade, and enable positive outcomes for people and biodiversity.\nNATURE GOALS AND PROGRESS\n\nWe are committed to responsible sourcing in our palm, wood pulp and paper packaging supply chains.\n\n| GOALS | PROGRESS through June 30, 2022 |\n|-------|--------------------------------|\n| **Palm** | 100% of palm oils\u00b9 used in P&G brands is RSPO certified | Continued to maintain 100% RSPO certified Palm Oils in our brands |\n| **Wood Pulp** | 100% of the wood pulp we source is certified by a globally recognized certification system | Continued to maintain 100% third-party certified wood pulp. Out of these efforts Family Care also achieved 75% FSC\u2122 certified wood pulp, our preferred certification |\n| **Paper Packaging\u00b2** | 100% of our paper packaging to be either recycled or third-party certified virgin content | >99% recycled or third-party certified |\n| | 50% of our virgin paper packaging is FSC\u2122 certified by 2025 | Achieved \u2014 68% FSC\u2122 certified |\n\n1 Palm Oil, Palm Oil Derivatives, Palm Kernel Oil, Palm Kernel Oil Derivatives.\n2 Data self-reported by suppliers. Responses received by publication of this report represent ~95% of total supply. We do not expect remaining 5% to materially impact reported results.\n\nP&G is committed to playing a positive role within the communities and environments in which we live, work and source our materials.\n\n\u201cENABLING SMALLHOLDER TRANSFORMATION\u201d\nA 5-YEAR SUSTAINABLE PALM PROGRAM\n\nSmallholder farmers grow close to 40% of all palm fresh fruit bunches globally. P&G is committed to working with these farmers to enable them to transform their livelihoods through more efficient and sustainable farming practices. Through partnerships in Malaysia, we established a training program, the Centre for Sustainable Smallholders, with the aim of enrolling 8,000 smallholder farmers within five years.

While we continue to reduce our GHG emissions as much as possible, we are also advancing natural climate solutions to balance our Scope 1 and 2 emissions we cannot eliminate this decade. These nature-based projects will help protect and restore forests, and other ecosystems, essential to the people and wildlife that rely on them and call them home.\n\n1 Natural climate solutions: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1710465114\nNATURE GOALS AND PROGRESS\n\nMANTALINGAHAN LANDSCAPE PROTECTION AND RESTORATION PROJECT IN THE PHILIPPINES\n\nIn partnership with Conservation International, we are advancing a natural climate solution project focused on the protection and restoration of the Mantalingahan Landscape (ML), located on the island of Palawan in the Philippines. The ML is comprised of tropical forest and mangrove areas, including the largest terrestrial area protected on the Palawan Island. The ML is a vital habitat for more than 1,000 plant and animal species. Protection and restoration of ML forests and mangroves will ensure these ecosystems can continue to support local communities, biodiversity, and contribute to global carbon emissions reductions and removal goals. This project would not be possible without the full partnership of the Indigenous peoples, local communities, and land tenure holders.

Here are some highlights of our actions, including work with leading environmental and forestry groups, over the last year.\n\n**Holding Suppliers to Higher Standards.** We hold our suppliers to high standards. In the sourcing of our paper products, for every tree used, at least two are regrown.\n\nTo ensure suppliers adhere to our Policy, we take the following actions:\n- Independent and P&G Audits\n- Satellite Monitoring\n- Public Grievance Process & Reporting\n\n**Reaching FSC\u2122 Certification Goal.** All P&G wood pulp is third party certified, ensuring the protection of both environmental and social values of forests. We prefer Forestry Stewardship Council\u2122 (FSC) certification, which is seen as the most robust system. Supplies of FSC\u2122 wood fiber are limited, yet our paper businesses set a bold goal to achieve over 75% FSC\u2122 certification by 2025, with a 2030 ambition of 100% FSC\u2122.\n\nP&G\u2019s paper businesses achieved their 75% FSC\u2122 2025 commitment in 2022, three years ahead of schedule.\n\nAnd we are going beyond partnering with FSC\u2122 and our suppliers to increase FSC\u2122-certified lands. P&G is also working alongside suppliers, certification bodies, NGOs, governments and other stakeholders to advocate for permanent protection of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs) and caribou habitat.
