And with each new chapter, we move forward on our journey to meet the changing needs of our customers and the broader healthcare community.\n\nAs an impact-driven organization, this report demonstrates our unwavering commitment to advance our strategy and drive meaningful outcomes to help build a healthier tomorrow for future generations. Over the past several years, led by our Global Impact Organization, I\u2019m particularly pleased with how we\u2019ve made a difference for our employees and partners, as well as for our communities and planet.\n\nReinforcing our commitment to current and potential employees and defining what makes our company a best place to work, we launched our first-ever Employee Value Proposition.\n\nStrengthening our culture of belonging, we grew employee resource group membership by more than 70% since FY21. Helping to support the communities where we live and work, we expanded clinical research, accelerated drug development and increased availability and access to clinical trials. And minimizing our environmental impact, we received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for our near-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, and we continued to make our buildings more efficient and decreased the amount of waste our facilities generate.\n\nI could not be more proud of our team, our outstanding progress and our purpose, advancing health outcomes for all, which fuels everything we do. Looking to the future, with the appointment of Nimesh Jhaveri, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Impact Officer, I know we\u2019ll continue to utilize our strengths to drive lasting change and best reflect our values as a leader in healthcare.\n\nBrian Tyler\nChief Executive Officer, McKesson Corporation\n\nI believe that relationships and trust are at the heart of healthcare.\n\nHaving started my career as a community pharmacist, I quickly learned to appreciate the value of the relationships I developed with patients. I have been fortunate to help patients receive the appropriate medication therapy, to help our more vulnerable in underserved neighborhoods and to help patients navigate their cancer journey into remission\u2014all through a team-based approach, working in collaboration with nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals.\n\nAs I assume my new Chief Impact Officer role, I am excited by the opportunity to build on the incredible progress our company has made since the launch of our Global Impact Organization. While my daily responsibilities have changed, the calling to make a lasting, positive difference in the lives of others has not. I\u2019m proud to work for an organization that shares in these values and is improving healthcare in every setting\u2014one product, one partner, one patient at a time.\n\nAs we move forward, I have ambitious hopes for our company. I believe the impact McKesson can make in the years ahead for our society and our planet is significant, and in many ways, we\u2019re just getting started on our journey to lead as an impact-driven organization.\n\nIt\u2019s an extremely exciting time to work in healthcare, and especially to be a part of McKesson. I can\u2019t wait to see what we accomplish together next.\n\nNimesh Jhaveri, R.Ph.\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Impact Officer\nIntroduction\n\nWe are pleased to release our Impact Report for fiscal years 2022 (FY22) and 2023 (FY23), showcasing McKesson\u2019s ongoing commitment to Advancing Health Outcomes for All\u2122. This report represents our continued efforts to track, measure and communicate our progress in achieving our corporate purpose, with a focus on how we are making an impact with our people, partners, community and planet.\n\nThroughout this report, you will see how we are working to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for patients everywhere.\n\nMcKesson at a glance\n\nOur business\nMcKesson is a diversified healthcare services leader dedicated to advancing health outcomes for all. We partner with biopharma companies, care providers, pharmacies, manufacturers, governments and others to deliver insights, products and services to help make quality care more accessible and affordable. Our company\u2019s foundational focus is addressing the changing needs of our customers, their patients and the broader healthcare platform.\n\nOur business segments\nWe carry out our purpose through our four business segments \u2014 U.S. Pharmaceutical, Prescription Technology Solutions, Medical-Surgical Solutions and International.\n\nOur business priorities\nThe four priorities of our enterprise strategy are to focus on people and culture, expand oncology and biopharma platforms, drive sustainable core growth and evolve and grow the portfolio. Not only does this guide our daily efforts, but it also serves as a common framework to track our success. We rely on the ability of our employees to live our I\u00b2CARE and ILEAD values and model behaviors that truly advance our company and our lives.\n\nMcKesson FY23 fast facts\n- ~51,000 employees worldwide\n- $277B FY23 revenues\n- Supported ~7,800 owned and banner (franchisee) pharmacies in the U.S. and Canada\n- Through a network of contracted last mile delivery services, 42K customer deliveries were made each day with 99.9% order accuracy through our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Canada Pharmaceutical businesses\n- Supported the treatment of 1.2M+ patients annually by The U.S. Oncology Network practices\n- Established joint venture with HCA Healthcare in October 2022 to combine U.S. Oncology Research with Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) with over 4,500 registered patients participating in clinical trials yearly since 2019 across the combined research sites\n- Assisted more than 200 real-world evidence publications through our oncology insights business, Ontario\n- 26,000+ oncology providers utilized the Prescription Technology Solutions (RxTS) electronic platform for support services\n- Offered more than 285K national brand medical-surgical products and McKesson\u2019s own brand of high-quality products\nWe believe that the best way to make an impact is by tapping into our company\u2019s strengths, areas of expertise, and corporate strategy and sustainability goals.\n\nThat\u2019s why we have aligned our impact efforts and initiatives around our company purpose: Advancing Health Outcomes for All. To deliver on our company purpose and the positive outcomes we seek to create, we have developed four impact pillars or levers which guide and drive how we live our purpose everyday: Our People, Our Partners, Our Community and Our Planet.\n\nAs indicated through the themes of each pillar, this report will highlight some of McKesson\u2019s programs and initiatives that demonstrate our impact on our community and planet, with the collaboration and support of our people and partners.\n\nOur **People**\nProviding equitable and dynamic opportunities for people to thrive\n\nOur **Partners**\nCollaborating to improve health outcomes for patients\n\nOur **Community**\nEnhancing the health of those in our communities\n\nOur **Planet**\nDelivering environmental action for health\nWe believe good governance is critical to delivering long-term value to our shareholders and other key stakeholders.\n\nGuided by our purpose, we work to foster a robust approach to governance that includes:\n\n+ Ensuring we attract and retain the best talent at all levels of our workforce\n+ Implementing thoughtful and strategic business priorities and risk management initiatives\n+ Continuously monitoring the impacts we have on our people, partners, community and planet\n\nThe integrity of our Board-level oversight structures and management initiatives are designed to enable us to accomplish our governance and sustainability goals.\n\n**Board of Directors and management governance structure**\n\nThe Board of Directors (Board) and our management continually seek to build sustained value for our shareholders and strengthen the vitality of our organization for employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders that depend on McKesson. To help achieve this objective, our Board and its committees, including in particular the Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Compensation and Talent Committee, monitor our overall performance with respect to long-term value creation and sustainability initiatives as well as certain environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.\n\n**Supporting Board diversity**\n\nBuilding a culture that values belonging and inclusion must start at the top. We believe diverse representation on our Board helps foster the robust, comprehensive and balanced deliberation and decision-making process that is essential to the effective functioning of the Board and success of McKesson. The Board\u2019s Governance and Sustainability Committee takes a broad view of diversity to include diversity of backgrounds, cultures, education, experience, skills, thought, perspectives, personal qualities and attributes, and geographic profiles, as well as race, ethnicity, gender, national origin and other categories. Currently, 36% of our Board members are women and 36% have self-identified as people of color. Women chair three of our five Board committees.\nA Sustainability Steering Committee composed of our Chief Impact Officer (as committee chair), Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer, helps coordinate and focus sustainability efforts across the enterprise.\n\nOur management, with oversight from the Board, also engages in an annual process to assess and address risk areas that could potentially impact business priorities and growth strategies. This risk management initiative ensures continuous monitoring of our business environment, performance and opportunities and facilitates setting our priorities on sustainability and long-term success.\n\nShareholder and other stakeholder engagement\n\nOur shareholder engagement program is a robust process featuring meetings held throughout the year, during which we encourage ongoing, meaningful dialogue about the issues our shareholders find most important. In FY22, we proactively reached out to shareholders representing almost 62% of our outstanding common stock and engaged with shareholders representing almost 40% of our outstanding common stock. In FY23, we proactively reached out to shareholders representing 54% of our outstanding common stock and engaged with shareholders representing 33% of our outstanding common stock. In FY22 and FY23, topics discussed with our shareholders included, among others, Board oversight, Board composition and refreshment, sustainability and human capital management.\n\nWe also regularly receive feedback from other stakeholders such as our employees and business partners, including governments, which we discuss more in this report under Our People and Our Partners. Staying closely connected with our stakeholders helps us evaluate our impact strategy and informs how we communicate the many initiatives McKesson undertakes.\n\nEnterprise quality focus\n\nIn FY23, we advanced our focus on product quality and patient safety with an Enterprise Quality Management function to provide enhanced oversight for our quality management activities across our company, facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices, and drive a culture of quality. The Enterprise Quality Management team coordinates our Enterprise Quality Operating Committee, consisting of quality leaders from across the various businesses. Together, the Quality Committee and the Enterprise Quality Management team assist businesses across the company in setting priorities and continuously improving the quality of our operations and services.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nAt McKesson, the way we do business is just as important as the business itself. Our Code of Conduct embodies our core I\u00b2CARE values in action and applies to anyone who conducts business for us. McKesson recently launched an updated Code of Conduct highlighting an ethical decision-making guide designed as a user-friendly framework to help employees make ethical decisions and underscore the criticality of regulatory excellence. Code of Conduct training is required for all our employees and the independent Directors on our Board.\nAt McKesson, our people create and maintain a vibrant and inclusive culture where everyone can bring their authentic self to work. In FY22 and FY23, we were recognized by several organizations for our commitment to fostering a culture of belonging.\n\n**Awards and recognition**\n\n2023 one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity\u201d and one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Greatest Workplaces for Women\u201d by Newsweek\n\n2023 Age Friendly Certification by the Age Friendly Institution\n\n2022 Military Friendly Employer by GI Jobs\n\n2023 Forbes \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Large Employers\u201d and \u201cBest Employer for Diversity\u201d\n\n2022 Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion by Disability Equality Index\n\n2022 Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation\nAbout this report\n\nMcKesson has an established commitment to transparency and reporting on progress towards our company purpose of Advancing Health Outcomes for All.\n\nSince our FY21 report was published, we decided to align this report publication with our annual report and proxy to best coordinate the time periods covered by all reports. As a result, this report spans a two-year period, FY22 and FY23. Going forward, we anticipate a report will be published each fiscal year.\n\nSince our last report, we also reevaluated our levers of greatest impact, resulting in a new reporting format focused on four impact pillars: Our People, Our Partners, Our Community and Our Planet. This Impact Report showcases the progress made in each pillar, highlighting the difference our work has made.\n\nThis report includes real-world stories to illustrate the personal impact of our work, as well as data-driven insights and performance metrics in a section called ESG Markers. We have included indices reporting various metrics from several ESG standards and frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). This alignment ensures that our reporting is in line with global best practices for sustainability and ESG reporting.\nOur People\nOur People\n\nAs an industry leader in shaping the future of health, we are committed to investing in our people, so that they, in turn, can make important contributions to transforming healthcare. Our team members help us to deliver solutions that make a meaningful difference for patients and communities.\n\nOur employee value proposition\n\nWe believe our employees thrive when they see their work has value, when they have a sense of purpose and when they feel their own experiences and perspectives are heard and appreciated.\n\nThat\u2019s why at McKesson, we try to make sure employees recognize that their work is positively impacting the healthcare landscape, and that they can each, in their own unique way, contribute to and share in our company\u2019s purpose to advance health outcomes for all. We believe that the future of health starts with our employees.\n\nTo help ensure our employees flourish and grow in their important work at our company, we emphasize our three-pillar employee value proposition: Care, Meaning and Belonging.\n\nCare\n\nFocusing on the health, happiness, and wellbeing of our employees and those we serve.\n\nMeaning\n\nFostering a culture of purpose in which our employees recognize they are doing work that matters, and feel empowered to contribute new ideas.\n\nBelonging\n\nEnsuring our employees have a voice, and know their varied experiences and perspectives are a valuable part of what enables us to thrive together.\nResearch shows that when companies prioritize employee wellbeing, their businesses thrive. Not only does an emphasis on employee wellbeing improve productivity and performance, but employees take fewer sick days and report lower rates of burnout. We aim to nurture a culture of wellbeing that empowers our employees to be at their best.\n\nSocial determinants of health pilot projects\nAs part of our focus on employee wellbeing, McKesson evaluated certain social determinants of health and other health equity factors among our employees. Research shows that many social determinants\u2014education, language skills, community, access to nutritious food, employment and debt, among others\u2014can have a significant impact on health. Two social determinants\u2014health literacy and financial stability\u2014stood out as opportunities for us to provide additional care to our employees.\n\nIn June 2022, we launched pilot programs that included training in health literacy and financial stability at six of our distribution centers in California, Tennessee and Florida.\n\nHealth literacy pilot\nTo develop our health literacy curriculum, we consulted with experts in social determinants and brought them together with McKesson thought leaders, employee resource group leaders and key stakeholders throughout the human resources and benefits functions. The goal was to design a program that would resonate with employees by focusing on practical approaches to help them better understand their health and navigate the complexities of our healthcare system.\n\nThe resulting curriculum comprised 30-minute educational sessions covering these topics:\n+ Healthy nutrition\n+ Managing and controlling chronic illnesses\n+ Benefits of proper sleep and exercise\n+ Talking to your doctor\n+ Understanding and taking advantage of your health benefits\n\nThe sessions were tailored to be relevant to the local communities and employees, including providing culturally-relevant speakers. Employees who attended also received additional McKesson educational resources.\n\nOur internal research indicated two other ways we can improve employee wellbeing in conjunction with the health literacy pilot: aiding those who face food insecurity and encouraging those not currently participating in preventative cancer screenings to take part.\n\nAs a result, we began providing free fresh fruits and vegetables at our health literacy pilot sites, now a popular feature of the program. In addition, we started offering preventative cancer screenings to employees onsite through a multi-cancer early detection test. To encourage participation in the onsite testing, we educated employees on the impact that early detection can have on the likelihood of surviving cancer.\n\n98% of attendees of our health literacy sessions reported finding them helpful, 91% said they learned things to change in their lives and 91% said they will change how they take care of their family.\nFinancial stability pilot\n\nFinancial stability\u2014linked to the social determinants of employment and debt\u2014can impact health. A lack of financial stability can cause stress, which is a health condition that can also aggravate other health conditions. Financial instability can also impede access to healthcare.\n\nTo address these issues among our employees, we developed a pilot program focused on equipping our employees with the knowledge, tools and resources to achieve and maintain greater financial stability. This pilot, offered in partnership with Brightside Financial, provides employees in-person educational sessions, one-on-one financial counseling and a variety of resources and materials, including:\n\n+ Access to a no-fee checking account\n+ Access to no-credit-check loans, to help avoid reliance on payday and title loans\n+ Education on the benefits of a reserve budget and on how to establish one\n+ Instruction in the steps to improve credit ratings\n\nThe McKesson Cause Network\n\nBeing diagnosed with cancer can be unexpected, frightening and confusing. It may be hard to know where to begin the journey and how to find helpful resources. We established the McKesson Cause Network to provide support to employees and their family members who face these challenges.\n\nThe McKesson Cause Network spans the company to connect, enhance and promote the cancer-related tools and resources available for McKesson team members and their families. Employees champion cancer care by promoting cancer education and awareness; sharing knowledge and use of relevant employee benefits and resources; and providing a platform for cancer survivors and caretakers to find and connect to others with similar experiences.\n\nAmong the specific types of help that the McKesson Cause Network provides:\n\n+ **Getting started:** Guidance in learning about treatment options, validating in-network doctors, resolving claim issues and arranging for a chronic care advocate\n+ **Getting a second opinion:** Resources to help find a second medical opinion and additional treatment options, so employees can make the best choices for themselves\n+ **Clinical trials:** Ways to access resources and non-biased opinions that can identify relevant clinical trials that may offer new treatment and care options\n+ **Health insurance and leave benefits:** Information on short- and long-term leave options, how a leave may impact pay and medical benefits employees can access while on leave\n+ **Financial assistance:** Guidance on applying for a financial-assistance grant and on engaging medical advocates\n+ **Other support resources:** Education about cancer research treatments, nursing, social support, finding medications, and locating other advocacy and comprehensive support resources\nIn addition to caring for our employees\u2019 health and wellbeing, we\u2019re committed to providing meaningful engagement to promote employee satisfaction and nurture a sense of purpose.\n\n**ILEAD**\n\nOur vision for a healthier world begins with our employees, who bring our purpose to life every day. To support employee growth and satisfaction, we use a 360-degree feedback model and provide all employees with training on our principles. We strive to create and maintain an inclusive environment where everyone can bring their authentic self to work and know they are appreciated, with their perspectives heard and considered. We help our employees understand enterprise priorities, recognize that their work matters, and support their development and advancement through education and other resources.\n\nOur approach to supporting employee satisfaction and purpose is embodied in our Inspire, Leverage, Execute, Advance and Develop (ILEAD) leadership principles. These principles guide us in our commitment to bring out the best in ourselves and to position McKesson to drive better health outcomes \u2014 for our company, our customers and the patients whose lives we touch every day.\n\n**Promoting shared behaviors through ILEAD**\n\n**Inspire:** With an inspiring vision, McKesson employees come together to engage their creativity in order to build innovative solutions that drive the long-term success of both McKesson and our customers.\n\n**Leverage:** Our employees are at the center of our success, and their contributions are amplified through collaboration across boundaries and through transparent communication, leading to the best possible outcomes for the company and for those we serve.\n\n**Execute:** We empower our employees to engage the right people in constructive debate, and to make and commit to the right decisions, so that our people, resources and systems can all be aligned toward achieving our goals.\n\n**Advance:** We encourage employees to take risks and face challenges head on, helping them to summon the resilience they need to move forward in uncertain or difficult situations.\n\n**Develop:** We actively invest in our employees\u2019 professional goals, by supporting their development and inclusively building the talent, capabilities and culture we need for the future.\n\n**Feedback: Employee Opinion Surveys and Manager Quality Surveys**\n\nWe seek employee feedback through annual and mid-year employee opinion surveys, which assess our employees\u2019 levels of engagement, commitment and overall satisfaction using industry benchmarks. We then design action plans to improve upon those survey results. We also seek feedback on our people leaders through our annual manager quality survey, which is an opportunity for employees to help their managers grow professionally and build valuable leadership skills that create a positive, productive and inclusive workplace at McKesson.\nBelonging: The power of inclusion\n\nThe final component of our employee value proposition, belonging, is the foundational belief that we best thrive together when our culture is diverse, equitable and inclusive. To that end, we actively maintain several programs supporting these important elements of our employee experience.\n\nEnhancing I\u00b2CARE with inclusion and awareness\n\nOur I\u00b2CARE values are foundational to everything we do, and who we are as a company. In 2022, we added Inclusion to our company\u2019s ICARE set of core values, transforming it to I\u00b2CARE: Integrity, Inclusion, Customer-First, Accountability, Respect and Excellence. The change reflected our commitment to ensuring each employee across the globe understands the value of embracing and respecting each other as we are. We expect our employees to exemplify these shared values in the actions they take and decisions they make every day on behalf of McKesson.\n\nOur I\u00b2CARE values unify us and enhance how we treat each other and support our customers, partners, community and planet. We introduced new inclusion training to much of our workforce in 2022. Our inclusion learning objective is to build awareness, competence and confidence for all employees.\n\nSupporting belonging through ERGs\n\nMcKesson employee resource groups (ERGs) are voluntary, employee-led, company-sponsored networks that aim to make a positive impact on our employees\u2019 lives. Our ERGs focus on helping employees make connections, share and affirm their identities and perspectives, showcase leadership skills and find ways to nurture and support belonging and empowerment. Today, McKesson has eleven ERGs across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nWe believe that an inclusive culture is one that reflects the diversity of voices, experiences and backgrounds of our employees. We continue to implement our internal, voluntary self-identification campaign to better understand who our employees are, so that we can better support and engage with them. Over the past two years, our ERGs have gone through a period of transformation, with the inclusion of new identities and the addition of three new ERGs: Arc (an open cultural resource for all); MENA (Middle Eastern and North African); and UNITY (Uniting Native and Indigenous Tribes with You).\n\nAs ERGs thrive and grow at McKesson, so too does a culture of belonging\u2014all to the benefit of our people, our company and those we serve.\nOur ERGs\n\nIn 2022, we hosted our first virtual ERG Summit, open to all employees. This four-day event hosted by the Global Impact Organization included multiple fireside chats, speakers and various ERG Summit Awards.\n\nArc\nAn open cultural resource for all\n\nMENA\nMiddle Eastern and North African\n\nUNITY\nUniting Native and Indigenous Tribes with You\n\nAbility\nDisability Community\n\nBE\nBlack Excellence \u2014 be empowered\n\nEP\nEmerging Professionals\n\nPALMa\nProfessional Association of Latinos at McKesson\n\nPAVE\nPan-Asian Voices for Excellence\n\nPride\nStrengthening McKesson by advancing LGBTQIA+ inclusion\n\nMMRG\nMcKesson Military Resource Group\n\nWE\nWomen Empowered\n\nSpotlight: Bringing the values of military service to McKesson\n\nMcKesson is committed to helping veterans find purpose in their careers, and to ensuring they have the support needed to not just grow professionally, but to thrive.\n\nLike the many veterans to whom McKesson is proud to provide opportunities, Renee Saxton brought with her the core values of military service, including integrity, respect, excellence, duty and trust in teammates\u2014values also prized by McKesson.\n\nIn 1985, Saxton became one of the first two women to serve on the front lines in the Marine Corps. But later, she faced a new challenge: applying her skills and dedication to a civilian career. After talking to a McKesson recruiter, she decided to tackle that challenge through an entry-level position at McKesson as a customer service representative.\n\nThanks to Saxton\u2019s strong capabilities and work ethic, that first position was just the start of what has become an impressive career. Steadily rising through the ranks, she serves today as a senior analyst of Strategic Sourcing. Saxton still credits much of her success at the company to that early milestone she achieved with the Corps. \u201cIt\u2019s one that continues to fuel me as I\u2019ve built my career outside of the Marines,\u201d she says.\nOur Partners\nAs the U.S. government\u2019s centralized distributor for frozen and refrigerated COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits, McKesson has been fully committed to supporting vaccination efforts from the early days of the pandemic through our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments.\n\nNow that the World Health Organization has declared an end to COVID-19 as a global health emergency, more than a thousand days after it first classified COVID-19 as a pandemic, we\u2019re able to look back at what we achieved.\n\nHarnessing our experience and expertise\n\nThe rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines raised unprecedented and unique challenges every step of the way. But as one of the nation\u2019s oldest and largest healthcare services companies, we have a long history of managing medical and pharmaceutical supply chains and working with the federal government. We acted as a centralized distributor during the H1N1 crisis and are the largest U.S. seasonal flu vaccine distributor for the general public.\n\nIn a flexible and agile response to these challenges, we launched new purpose-built vaccine distribution centers in just five months. To maintain vaccine integrity, these facilities operated at extremely cold temperatures, and we trained additional personnel to work in freezers to pick and pack COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWe worked with state and local governments to distribute needed vaccines and ancillary supply kits to sites of care in the most efficient and timely manner. We also worked with our Health Mart pharmacy partners to provide vaccine access in underserved communities. At the onset of the pandemic, approximately 700 Health Mart stores participated in the vaccination roll out program as members of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Partnership. Health Mart is a McKesson pharmacy franchise.\n\nOur Partners\n\nAt McKesson, we know that advancing health outcomes for all is, and will remain, a team effort. That\u2019s why our businesses proactively engage with our partners\u2014biopharma companies, care providers, pharmacies, manufacturers, governments and others\u2014to deliver insights, products and services that positively impact health.\n\nWe are strategically investing in our growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services while strengthening our core distribution businesses. Working together, we navigate today\u2019s evolving healthcare landscape and drive business performance.\n\nHelping pharmacists make a meaningful difference\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic reinforced just how important pharmacists are to healthcare in North America. As of March 2023, pharmacists in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination have administered more than 301 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, performed over 42 million COVID-19 tests, and provided over 50 million influenza and other vaccinations since the start of the pandemic. In Canada, our Rexall Pharmacy Group and our retail banner pharmacies together administered over 3.2M doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nPharmacists have played a vital role during COVID-19. We believe pharmacist care should be strengthened and expanded. That\u2019s why we have helped form the Future of Pharmacy Care Coalition, a group advocating for federal policy solutions that acknowledge and advance the healthcare services that pharmacists provide to people, especially those in rural and underserved communities.\nHealth equity advances\n\nWe believe that every person should have an equal opportunity to live a healthy life. But too often, the most vulnerable patients can be faced with structural and systemic barriers to the quality healthcare they need.\n\nWe are partnering with our customers, government agencies and non-profit organizations to help in addressing the disparities and inequities that can stand in the way of patient access, quality of care and better outcomes. From increasing diversity in clinical trials to helping pharmacies in underserved communities, we are committed to our efforts to expand equitable access to healthcare.\n\nImproving patient outcomes through clinical trials\n\nClinical trials can provide additional hope for people living with cancer. Today, McKesson is expanding access to potentially lifesaving oncology medication and clinical trial opportunities at the community level through our joint venture with HCA Healthcare, which has combined U.S. Oncology Research with Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) under the SCRI brand.\n\nEvery day, more than 5,000 people in the U.S. have their lives upended by a cancer diagnosis. And every year, almost 2 million people in the U.S. find themselves embarking on a battle with cancer. At McKesson, we are committed to investing in oncology to advance early detection, make lifesaving treatments more accessible to everyone, and improve comfort and compassion for everyone living with this disease.\n\nIncreasing diversity in clinical trials\n\nStatistics show that racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented in cancer clinical trials. We\u2019re using our subject matter expertise and technology to better understand and mitigate some of the hurdles that patients can face in enrollment and ongoing participation of clinical oncology trials. To help reduce health disparities and enhance trial representation, we\u2019re advancing economic opportunities to foster participation for individuals from all backgrounds.\n\nClinical trial impact through SCRI joint venture\n\n- 4,500+ registered patients have participated yearly since 2019 in clinical trials across the combined research sites\n- 1,300+ physicians providing access to clinical trials\n- 600+ first-in-human studies conducted since its inception\n- 1,000+ active trials currently supported\n- 1 in 5 U.S. patients go through a clinic associated with SCRI for their clinical trial\nWorking with Health Mart pharmacies to care for underserved communities\n\nPharmacies are one of the most accessible healthcare providers for the majority of Americans. In fact, patients in the U.S. visit their community pharmacist twice as often as they visit primary care physicians. Health Mart, a McKesson pharmacy franchise, operates approximately 4,700 independently owned community pharmacies in the U.S. Sixty percent of Health Mart pharmacies are in high social vulnerability areas, as measured by the CDC\u2019s Social Vulnerability Index score. Pharmacies can be integral in advancing disease screening, testing, vaccine administration and other care in medically underserved communities.\n\nInvesting in startups to advance patient outcomes\n\nResearchers are pioneering therapies today that will hopefully cure diseases tomorrow. At McKesson, we are providing capital backing to accelerate the breakthroughs that will help people lead longer and healthier lives. Our venture capital arm, McKesson Ventures, provides financial support for startups that align with our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. By channeling investments into areas like new technologies, digital pharmacy and medical devices, we are actively advancing healthcare and patient outcomes.

These factors, however, along with other social determinants of health, can impact a patient\u2019s treatment and likelihood of survival. Our oncology data science and technology business, Ontada, launched a new program called Health Outcomes Powered by Evidence (HOPE)\u2122 in FY22 to scientifically delve into the root of these discrepancies. HOPE\u2019s overarching goal is to partner with oncologists in The U.S. Oncology Network to undertake and publish new studies to better understand clinical practice and advance cancer research.\n\nIn keeping with its mission and vision to transform the fight against cancer at the intersection of technology and data analytics, Ontada plans to gather data-based insights and conduct retrospective research to reduce inequity in cancer care.\n\nIn addition, Ontada recently joined the Gravity Project, a multi-stakeholder group of payers, providers, vendors and community-based organizations, to help develop national standards for representing social determinants of health in electronic health records.\nAccess, affordability and adherence challenges\n\nWith more cutting-edge therapies reaching the market each year, patients living with complex and chronic conditions have an increasing number of treatment options available to them. Many of these therapies can come at a high price and require strict compliance rules, creating a barrier to access for patients. When the burden is put on patients to coordinate with doctors, pharmacies and insurance companies to obtain the medications they need, it can leave patients feeling tired, frustrated and potentially without the necessary therapy or drug.\n\nMaking a meaningful impact through our Prescription Technology Solutions segment\n\nBy removing access barriers to healthcare, providing patients with support to take their medication properly and facilitating access to more affordable alternatives, CoverMyMeds\u2122 services in our Prescription Technology Solutions segment (RxTS) are opening the door for people to live healthier lives. This leading industry network seeks to reduce barriers to treatment by addressing certain access, affordability and adherence challenges.\n\nLeveraging our legacy of innovation in oncology and our patient-first approach, CoverMyMeds platforms help people access and afford cancer therapies quickly. An additional benefit is its technology-enabled workflow, which streamlines time to therapy, advancing patients\u2019 access to lifesaving medications by 2.5 times on average.\n\nCoverMyMeds platform\n\n- 900,000+ providers with 75% of Electronic Health Records integrated\n- 50,000+ pharmacies\n- Payers Representing 94% of Prescription Volume\n- 650+ Brands 95% of Therapeutic Areas\n\nAccess\nHelped patients access their medicine more than 78M times\n\nAffordability\nSaved patients over $8B on brand and specialty medications\n\nAdherence\nPrevented estimated 9.9M prescriptions from being abandoned\nExpanding access through oncology infusion certification and social innovation in Canada\n\nIn March 2023, McKesson Canada\u2019s INVIVA network set new standards of excellence for oncology in community infusion clinics. After meeting the requirements of accreditation through Canada\u2019s Qmentum Accreditation program, it has become the first and only accredited national private infusion clinic network in oncology in Canada. With a robust network throughout Canada of over 300 registered nurses across 76 clinics, INVIVA has extensive experience in administering specialty and biologic drugs with specialized training. This certification is the next step in making oncology services more accessible outside hospitals and closer to patients in Canada.\n\nSpotlight: INVIVA Social Innovation Program\n\nINVIVA is also working to remove barriers to care, such as food access and transportation, for patients who receive cancer treatment. Patients will be screened for social determinants of health needs as part of the intake process. Patients who would be good candidates for food and transportation support can also receive those services up to the equivalent of $5,000 for up to 12 months per patient.\n\nOnce enrolled, the patient will receive weekly home-delivered fresh produce that are nutrient-dense and medically tailored, along with recipes to prepare food. Patients may also be eligible for transportation services to get to their appointments. This program should not only improve clinical outcomes and allow patients to stay on treatment for longer; we also expect it will have a social impact by providing visible support for the underserved.\nSupplier diversity\n\nAs a company serving a diverse customer base, we seek to source high-quality products and services from a wide range of suppliers and contractors.\n\nSupplier diversity is a set of strategies, processes and systems McKesson leverages to promote equitable consideration for businesses from portions of our population that are from historically economically-disadvantaged groups. It is a business practice designed to create impact, manage supply chain and brand risks, and create economic opportunity. McKesson is a federal prime vendor contractor and our supplier diversity policy complies with federal contract-established requirements related to the use of small and diverse businesses.\n\nWe strategically consider all stakeholders in the market dynamic in which we operate, including patients, our partners and the communities. An approach that considers all stakeholders helps us gain access to new markets to support more patients, mitigate our supply chain risks, and enable the expeditious flow of care.\nOur Community\nSupporting the fight against cancer\n\nOncology is a growth priority of our business and the focus of many of our community support efforts. While we look forward to a world without cancer, we\u2019re also making a difference for the millions of people who are living with it today.\n\nPartnership with American Cancer Society\n\nFor 40 years, we have partnered with the American Cancer Society (ACS) through grants, donations and volunteer activities to support ACS programs and initiatives involving health equity, cancer research, cancer screenings, and prevention and cancer care.\n\nOur financial contributions include funds provided directly to Hope Lodges. Hope Lodges provide a community of support and a free place to stay for people facing cancer and their caregivers when their treatment is far away.\n\nMcKesson also continues to join the ACS Cancer Action Network in the annual Lights of Hope Across America national campaign to honor and remember loved ones impacted by cancer.\n\nPartnership with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\n\nMcKesson partners with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) to support the cure of leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin\u2019s disease and myeloma, and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. LLS works to advance cancer cures by:\n\n- Funding research to advance lifesaving treatments\n- Driving advocacy for policies that protect patient access to lifesaving treatment\n- Providing patients and families with hope, guidance, education and support\n\nOur Community\n\nMcKesson works to create healthier communities through giving and providing opportunities that encourage and support our employees who want to do the same. We recognize our responsibility to serve people and worthy causes in support of our purpose. With various philanthropic partnerships, and with the generosity and volunteerism of our employees, we have found numerous ways to improve care for the people and communities who need it most.\nEmployee community engagement\n\nThrough the generosity and volunteerism of our employees, and related partnerships, we have found numerous ways to demonstrate support for our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all in the communities that need it most.\n\nCommunity Impact Days\nCommunity Impact Days have been McKesson\u2019s largest annual company-wide employee volunteer event for the past 24 years. As an impact-driven organization, we are committed to meeting the ever-changing needs in our communities by supporting causes that align with our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. In 2022, we partnered with the McKesson Foundation, Feeding America and the food banks across North America to address food insecurity and help provide nutritious foods that have been proven to help reduce the risk of getting cancer. Community Impact Days include in-person and virtual volunteer opportunities for those who want to give back.\n\nLegal support with our Pro Bono & Volunteer Program\nOur General Counsel Organization has established a Pro Bono & Volunteer Program to provide legal services in support of our local communities. Since its launch, the team has volunteered over 525 hours, completing projects in five locations across the U.S. This work includes free legal assistance at volunteer clinics, assistance to immigrants participating in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and serving as a court-appointed guardian for a child.\nMcKesson Care Ambassadors\n\nMcKesson Care Ambassadors are employees who collaborate with our business units and 160 regional volunteer chairs to identify impactful volunteer opportunities at both the local and national level in support of our purpose. Care Ambassadors work closely on Community Impact Days and support initiatives such as Black Excellence on MLK Day, the Fit2BeCancerFree campaign with the American Cancer Society and Earth Month, among others.\n\nMcKesson recognizes and honors some employees as Corporate Impact Champions each year for bringing our I2CARE and ILEAD values to life in the workplace or our communities. North American employees are encouraged to nominate individual or groups of employees for these awards, highlighting how these employees volunteered in ways that made a difference.\n\nSpotlight: Training our delivery professionals to help fight human trafficking\n\nTruck stops are one of the many venues used to perpetrate human trafficking. This means truck drivers can be positioned to help be the eyes and ears on the road and look for red flags to assist in mitigating this crime. McKesson takes this opportunity seriously and ensures that our delivery professionals undergo training through Truckers Against Trafficking to identify indications of human trafficking on the road. Drivers are encouraged to observe their surroundings when parked at rest stops, clinics or hospitals during their delivery runs to look for and report these signs.\nThe McKesson Foundation\n\nFounded in 1943, the McKesson Foundation (the Foundation) is a 501(c)(3) corporate foundation dedicated to our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s mission is to remove barriers to quality healthcare across North America, especially for vulnerable and underserved communities.\n\nIn 2023, the Foundation renewed its 80-year-long commitment to championing health equity by expanding its portfolio of nonprofit partners, with a particular focus on reducing the burdens of cancer, diversifying the healthcare talent pipeline, and accelerating emergency preparedness and disaster relief.\n\nReducing the burdens of cancer\n\nThe Foundation has been increasing its financial contributions to organizations focused on cancer prevention, screening and treatment, and aiding cancer patients with transportation and financial assistance. Studies show that race, ethnicity, health insurance status and income, among other factors, can affect how early a patient\u2019s cancer is diagnosed, how it is treated and the patient\u2019s survival time and financial burden. Working with our partners, the Foundation aims to reduce the risks of getting cancer and to address socioeconomic barriers to early diagnosis and appropriate care.\n\nSpotlight: Parkland Health\n\nIn FY22, the Foundation awarded a $500,000 grant to Parkland Health to support the new RedBird Health Center which opened in October 2021. The highlights of Redbird Health Center\u2019s activities from October 2021 to June 2022 include the completion of over 24,000 patient visits and the hiring of a local Community Health Worker to do outreach, education and screenings. Most patients of Redbird Health Center reside in highly underserved zip codes within Dallas, Texas and 90% are either Hispanic or Black.\nDiversifying the healthcare talent pipeline\n\nThe Foundation supports efforts to close the gap between diverse representation among the general population and among healthcare practitioners to improve health equity and patient outcomes. Patients report they feel they are listened to more, and are more compliant with medical guidance, when they share a similar racial or ethnic identity with their healthcare practitioner. Nearly a third of the U.S. population is Black or Hispanic, but less than 9% of oncologist trainees are Black or Hispanic.\n\nSpotlight: Helping pharmacists help the underserved\n\nStudents from diverse backgrounds have historically been underrepresented among those entering the pharmacy profession. To bring more of those students into the field, and enhance the cultural competency of all pharmacy students, the McKesson Foundation announced in FY23 that it is awarding over $4 million in grants over the next five years to pharmacy schools at five U.S. universities.\n\nSome of the partner pharmacy schools will work directly with undergraduate schools to build their pipeline. One of the grantees, the University of Michigan, is collaborating with tribal colleges, for example, while another, the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, is partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The grants will also support outreach to underserved communities. For example, the University of New Mexico, another grantee, is arranging for students to do clinical pharmacy rotations in rural areas of the state. The grants are another way the Foundation is helping to drive better care and health to the people who most need it.\nAccelerating emergency preparedness and disaster relief\n\nAccelerating emergency preparedness and disaster relief is a key focus of the Foundation\u2019s philanthropic priorities. The McKesson Foundation partners with nonprofit organizations that put systems and resources in place to help individuals and communities when emergencies strike; provide meals, accommodations and relief items after natural disasters and crises; and supply medicines and food to individuals and families during times of crisis.\n\nWith the increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters, more people across North America need temporary or extended shelter, as well as food and medications, during and after crises. And with 10% of the population in Canada and the U.S. living in food-insecure households, programs to provide regular, nutritious meals to children, families and seniors can help reduce chronic disease and improve long-term health.\n\nIn FY22, the Foundation invested in central food banks in four North American cities, providing for the purchase or maintenance of vehicles in each food bank\u2019s fleet. These investments aim to help in securing and distributing more food to the community and the extension of services to hard-to-reach children and families.\n\nThe Foundation also supports communities across the U.S. as a member of the American Red Cross Disaster Responder Program, which provides proactive funding to deploy critical systems and supplies to communities impacted by disaster. In FY22, the Disaster Responder Program helped the American Red Cross to provide more than 109,400 nights of emergency lodging, more than 2.9 million meals and snacks and 1.1 million relief items across the U.S. The Foundation also partners with the Canadian Red Cross and Team Rubicon. These partnerships align with our holistic approach to disaster relief, and reflect its commitment to helping with disaster preparation, mitigation, recovery and rebuilding.\n\nSpotlight: Supporting disaster relief in Canada\n\nMcKesson Canada is a proud Disaster Response Alliance partner of the Canadian Red Cross. Additionally, we help to bolster community resiliency by donating overstocked pandemic masks, sanitizers and other hygiene supplies to help Canadian organizations in times of crisis.\nMcKesson Foundation partnerships\n\nThe McKesson Foundation has built an expanding slate of partnerships to advance health outcomes and address social determinants of health. The Foundation supports a range of partners, programs and projects in their efforts to advance health and wellness, support communities and help those in need.\n\nMcKesson Foundation partners include:\n\n- American Red Cross\n- Food Banks Canada\n- Angels for Change\n- Parkland Health Foundation\n- CANADIAN RED CROSS\n- UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n- CANCERCARE\n- UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA\n- CONQUER CANCER\n- ESCHELMAN SCHOOL OF PHARMACY\n- Family Reach\n- COLLEGE OF PHARMACY\nSupporting our employees through philanthropic grants\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s matching gifts program\nThrough its matching gifts program, the Foundation matches dollar-for-dollar\u2014and in some cases doubles\u2014any contribution of $10 or more an employee donates to an eligible non-profit organization, up to $2,500 per employee per fiscal year.\n\nTaking Care of Our Own Fund\nThe McKesson Foundation\u2019s Taking Care of Our Own Fund, administered by the Emergency Assistance Foundation and funded by the Foundation, supports McKesson employees facing hardships due to unexpected events, such as natural disasters or family emergencies.\n\nFY23 highlights include:\n- 2,100 employees participated\n- $1.7M in matching gifts donated to over 2,000 charities\n\nFor every 10 hours a McKesson employee volunteers, the Foundation awards a $100 grant to a charity of the employee\u2019s choice, up to $1,000 per fiscal year.\n\nMcKesson Foundation Scholarship Program\nThe Foundation\u2019s scholarship program administered by Scholarship America assists employees\u2019 children who plan to continue education in college or vocational school programs. Renewable scholarships are offered each year for full-time study at an accredited institution of the student\u2019s choice.\n\nFY23 Scholarships\n- 92 scholarships awarded\n  (30 new, 62 renewals)\n- $228,750 awarded\nFoundation for Opioid Response Efforts (FORE)\n\nThe opioid epidemic is a complicated, multi-faceted public health crisis that calls for comprehensive and collaborative solutions. We are committed to engaging with all who share our dedication to and urgency in addressing this national issue.\n\nIn 2018, McKesson contributed the seed money\u2014$100 million\u2014to establish the independent grantmaking Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts (FORE), a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated solely to finding and fostering innovative, evidence-based solutions addressing this public health challenge.\n\nFORE\u2019s measurable impact\n\nSince its first major grant program launched in 2020, FORE has awarded over $35 million in grants to 89 organizations serving populations across the country that focused on:\n\n- Expanding access to lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), helping nearly 6,000 people gain access\n- Addressing COVID-19 pandemic needs to ensure access to counselors, peers and other supports for people in recovery from OUD\n- Providing training to over 4,600 primary care doctors, emergency medicine providers and others to identify people with OUD and provide evidence-based treatment\n- Engaging 400 people with lived experience of OUD to help others find treatment and recovery supports\n- Developing innovative ways to tackle the opioid crisis, including addressing the stigma issues, and using data to predict overdoses and target resources\n- Preventing OUD by strengthening families, including with access to evidence-based prevention programs\nOur Planet\nAt McKesson, we are committed to taking affirmative action to respond to climate change. In December 2022, our near-term climate change targets received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\n**Greenhouse gas emissions reduction**\n\nWe recognize that we have a pivotal role to play in reducing GHG emissions across our value chain. That\u2019s why we have committed to work with our suppliers in connection with our SBTi targets. We are also engaged with the National Academies of Medicine and the Association for Health Care Resource & Materials Management of the American Hospital Association on reducing GHG emissions.\n\n**Spotlight: Developing science-based targets**\n\nWith SBTi approval, we have finalized our commitment to science-based targets to:\n\n- Reduce our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% by FY32 from a FY20 base year\n- Ensure 70% of McKesson suppliers, by spend covering purchased goods and services, have their own SBTi-approved GHG emissions reduction targets by FY27\n\nSBTi, a collaboration between CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature, drives climate action in the private sector by encouraging companies to set targets to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. McKesson joins more than 2,000 other companies in making rigorous commitments toward this goal. We are taking steps designed to reduce both our direct (Scope 1 and 2) GHG emissions and those produced in our upstream and downstream value chain (Scope 3).\n\n**McKesson\u2019s GHG emissions in metric tons CO\u2082e**\n\n| Category                                      | FY20   | FY22   | FY23   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions                | 88,219 | 74,025 | 79,292 |\n| Indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions \u2013 Location-Based | 190,289 | 169,478 | 144,820 |\n| Indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions \u2013 Market-Based | 189,365 | 183,349 | 141,303 |\n| Gross Scope 1 + Scope 2 \u2013 Location-Based      | 278,508 | 243,503 | 224,112 |\n| Gross Scope 1 + Scope 2 \u2013 Market-Based        | 277,584 | 257,374 | 220,595 |\n| Gross Scope 3 Emissions                       | 25,426,174 | 26,875,944 | 32,034,413 |\n\n1 See Overview in ESG Markers section of this report for more fiscal year reported data and more details about our assurance process and Scope 3 category-specific information.\n2 See our Basis of Reporting\u2014Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions in ESG Markers section for more details about our GHG inventory and associated methodology.\n3 Actual numbers will fluctuate as we re-baseline, adjusting for divestitures and acquisitions, per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\nGreening our Toronto Campus with RECs\n\nIn 2022, McKesson Canada began choosing green energy at our Greater Toronto Area Campus with renewable energy credits (RECs) from Bullfrog Power. In the first year of these credits, we expect to avoid generation of 465 tons of CO\u2082e. That\u2019s the equivalent of taking 133 cars off the road for a year, switching 23,498 lightbulbs to LEDs or growing 301 hectares of forest for a year.\n\nRenewable energy sourcing\n\nOur approach to reducing our GHG emissions includes increasing our procurement of renewable energy, enhancing our energy efficiency and making our fleet more efficient.\n\nWe expect that one important element in achieving our science-based targets will be to procure more energy from renewable sources.\n\nFor example, we\u2019ve signed a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA) with a renewable energy project developer. This provides that as part of a consortium, we will agree to purchase 15 MW of renewable energy associated with a solar project in Liberty County, Texas that is expected to be operational in 2024. The VPPA will provide the developer with a fixed price for its energy. In return, McKesson will receive renewable energy credits (RECs) for each megawatt hour of green energy the project generates and sells.\n\nWe have also initially focused on entering into renewable energy contracts for those sites in Texas where we or The U.S. Oncology Network are responsible for electricity invoices. Since 2022, a majority of these sites have run on 100% renewable energy, primarily sourced from the Sweetwater and Foard City wind farms.\n\nHarnessing the power of the sun\n\nWe are also powering some of our operations with solar energy generated at our own buildings. For example, we have installed solar panels at our distribution centers in West Sacramento and Robbinsville. The West Sacramento distribution center features a 1,092 kW rooftop array, which has met approximately 63% of its electricity needs since the panels went online in 2019. Our Robbinsville distribution center has also added 2,730.6 kW of rooftop and ground-mounted arrays that went live in April 2022. These panels generate a majority of the electricity utilized at this site and can use annual net metering to gain credit for excess solar power.\nAt McKesson, we look to be impactful by optimizing how much energy we use. We are exploring ways to use less energy for lighting and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at our premises.\n\nOne way that we do this is by connecting our buildings to fault detection and analytics solutions to predict failures, optimize performance and reduce our energy use. Operating on a remote, secure platform, the Connected Buildings program has already integrated more than 1 million square feet of McKesson real estate and is being incorporated into new and existing buildings.\n\nEmbracing LEED and WELL building standards\n\nIn support of our purpose, we aim to follow the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and the WELL Building Standards at our locations. We expect to consider these standards in the future when building and designing new offices and distribution centers.\n\nSpotlight: Switching to LED lighting for a brighter future\n\nAs we find ways to reduce how much energy we use, decrease our carbon footprint and create a better environment for our employees, we are upgrading to LED lighting in many of our buildings. To date, we have completed 27 retrofits, including 20 distribution centers, 6 U.S. Oncology Network clinics and 1 office. Six cancer centers participated in this lighting upgrade program via a pay-from-savings model, while two also added HVAC control kits.\nAs a distributor of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare supplies and equipment, we know the importance of a robust, reliable and efficient transportation network.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are taking a multifaceted approach to minimize our fuel consumption and reduce carbon emissions from our fleet. For example, we are using new software designed to optimize our routing, improving our loading rates, reducing empty miles wherever possible and investigating more efficient and alternative fuel vehicles, including electric vehicles.\n\nWe know our use of route optimization software can result in less fuel being needed, lowering GHG emissions, and can improve the customer experience. Optimization techniques we use include strategically assessing the best type of vehicle for the intended route, route distances, and delivery order. Optimizing truck capacity enables our delivery professionals to deliver more volume while reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Decking can help maximize space as load bars and vertical logistic posts inside the trailer create multiple layers for pallets. Some of our distribution center efforts include automated laser systems and our advanced packaging program to help us reduce dunnage, which is the protective material inside a box. Our advanced packaging technology helps us better size the boxes we ship based on the products, and uses approximately 16% less corrugated materials in generating a shipping container relative to the same size traditional box.\n\nLeveraging the power of technology, we are also deploying a more dynamic routing system that draws on real-time information. A software solution also helps delivery professionals maximize fuel efficiency by avoiding accelerating or decelerating too quickly.\n\n**Greening our fleet**\n\nWe are researching potential ways to electrify our fleet. In a recent pilot project, we tested the use of electric vehicles and installed pilot charging stations at distribution centers in Auburn and Houston.\n\n---\n\n**Optimizing our routes and load rates**\n\n| Route Optimization Statistics FY23 vs FY22 |\n|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Consumed** | 263K less gallons of fuel | (-9.2%) |\n|              | ~1.5 gallons less per route |\n| **Delivered** | 1.1M more packages | (+4.4%) |\n|              | ~6 more packages per route |\n| **Planned**  | 455K less travel miles | (-2.1%) |\n|              | ~2.5 gallons less per route |\n| **Delivered** | $427M more in sales | (+11.8%) |\nSustainable packaging and waste reduction\n\nOur operations are actively working to reduce the amount of waste generated by our offices, warehouses and distribution centers and deploy more reusable and recycled packaging and products. Our efforts to advance sustainability span our entire value chain, from sourcing products to responsible end-of-life solutions for furniture and other items.\n\nReusable shipping containers\n\nMany of our businesses send medications to customers\u2014including pharmacies and hospitals\u2014in reusable containers. This effort is estimated to eliminate nearly 60 million cardboard boxes annually, equivalent to saving 400,000 trees.\n\nMcKesson Plasma and Biologics services introduced a reusable cold-chain shipping container for refrigerated drug shipments in April 2022. Replacing one-way shippers, these coolers improve performance, keeping products cooler for longer, and reduce landfill. Customers can easily return the container for future use via identified carriers, with return freight costs covered by McKesson. Their use extends the shipping lifespan from 36 to 72 hours, contingent on seasonal temperatures, and helps avoid disruptions to patient care in the case of shipping delays.\n\nPaperless invoicing pilot project\n\nOur U.S. Pharmaceutical segment has conducted a pilot project for switching to paperless invoicing. This pilot reduced waste and printing by 51,000 sheets of paper each day and emissions by 64.7 tons of CO\u2082 per year.\n\nInvoice Reduction (FY23)\n\nElimination for more than 13,500 customer accounts of multiple invoice copies (2.5M sheets daily costing $20.5M annually)\n+ 116 tons of paper eliminated\n+ 112 tons of CO\u2082 reduced\n+ 2,784 trees saved\nCalculated with data from U.S. EPA Waste Reduction Model\n\nWave Release Optimization (FY23)\n\nU.S. Pharmaceutical segment customer order management to consolidate tote generation and eliminate excess transportation.\n+ 416K totes reduced\n+ 28,794 travel miles eliminated\n+ 98.7 tons of CO\u2082 reduced\n\nMcKesson to Masters No Credit Vendor Program (FY22)\n\nIdentification and reallocation of no credit short dated and overstocked inventory to McKesson subsidiary company Masters for discounted resale and partial cost recovery.\n+ 40K bottles reallocated\n+ 1.1 tons of CO\u2082 reduced\n## Overview\n\n| Metric | McKesson Overall | McKesson Leadership |\n|--------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Women  | 62%              | 42%                 |\n| People of Color | 47% | 26% |\n| People with Disabilities | 7% | 6% |\n| Veterans | 4% | 4% |\n| LGBTQ+ Community | 3% | 1% |\n\n### Description\n\n| Metric | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| # of Part-Time Employees | ~6,000 |\n| # of Employees in the U.S. | ~35,000 |\n| # of Employees Worldwide | ~51,000 |\n\n### Board Members\n\n- Women: 36%\n- People of Color: 36%\n\n### McKesson Policies\n\n- Conflict Minerals Policy\n- Code of Conduct\n\n---\n\n* The data for our Metrics is derived from our employee voluntary self-identification process as of March 31, 2023 and represents our best estimate of representation at this time.\n\n* Represents our leadership at the vice president level and above.\n\n* Represents U.S. employees only because the data for Canada and Europe is not available.\n\n* People of Color includes the following self-identification categories: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or Two or More Races.\n\n---\n\nOur most recent Communication on Progress in response to the UN Global Compact can be found [here](#).\n| GRI Disclosure | GRI Requested Information | McKesson FY22\u2013FY23 Responses |\n|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| GRI 2: General Disclosures | | |\n| 2-1 Organizational details | a.

The assessment included in-depth interviews and surveys with 95 stakeholders from Canada, Europe and the U.S. They included employees, customers, suppliers, industry associations, government agencies, NGOs and joint venture partners. We involved senior leaders from multiple business units and corporate functions and carefully considered the views of our shareholders. We also brought in peer benchmarking, impact mapping, synthesis and analysis of our results. The work resulted in a materiality matrix, validated with internal leaders, and a list of prioritized topics and opportunities raised through the materiality process.\n\n**3-2 List of material topics**\n\nSee Shareholder and other stakeholder engagement\n\n### GRI 201: Economic Performance\n\n**201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed**\n\nSee McKesson FY23 fast facts.

Each of our U.S. businesses receives an overall Safety Performance Index score quarterly, which takes into account factors such as completion of Safety Committee meetings and inspections; percent of completed employee safety orientations, certifications and other trainings; and injury rates. In FY22, our U.S. Safety Performance Index score improved 2% over FY21 and remained constant in FY23. We routinely assess facilities to monitor adherence to established security and safety standards. We completed over 140 onsite and virtual safety visits in FY22 and over 180 in FY23 to provide support, coaching, and oversight for implementation of accident prevention and regulatory environmental health and safety programs. We also completed over 40,000 safety observations in FY22 during the height of our COVID-19 vaccine roll out program and over 30,000 in FY23, aimed at reinforcing safe work practices for employees.\n\nMcKesson Canada has a robust health and safety program which includes a continuous training program offered to all employees, monthly topics shared to distribution center teams, and ergonomic assessment to improve best work practices. The program also includes a health and safety executive summary dashboard that is shared quarterly with McKesson Canada\u2019s leadership. US Safety Performance Index Score YoY Improvement:\n\n- FY22: 97 (+2% from prior year), FY23: 97 (remained constant)\n- Onsite and Virtual Safety Visit Completed:\n  - FY22: 141, FY23: 181\n  - Safety Observations Completed:\n    - FY22: 40,944, FY23: 30,306\n\nIf a serious vulnerability is identified, it is documented, and the facility prepares an action plan. Across distribution facilities, we prepare a monthly leading safety indicator dashboard to measure performance to our standards. In FY22 and FY23, our distribution centers in the U.S. had a 100% execution rate in cone injury prevention programs, including joint health and safety committees, periodic self-inspections, and employee training. We also maintain an internal database of all major incidents at our facilities, which allows us to investigate the circumstances surrounding the injury or event. This helps us learn how we can prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nSafety Committees are comprised of management and non-management employees with representation from a cross-section of the facility\u2019s departments and functions. Each committee has a chairperson who is elected by the safety committee members. Members serve a minimum of one year with appointments staggered to assure that no more than one third of the committee is new at any time. All committee meetings are open to any employee who wishes to attend.\n\nSafety Committee Responsibilities:\n\n- Create and maintain each employee\u2019s active and positive interest in safety.\n- Provide open communication among management, its representatives, and employees.\n- Provide an open forum where accident causes and means of prevention can be discussed.\n- Establish provisions to complete regular periodic inspections, review results and recommend and track the status of indicated changes through resolution.\n- Identify unsafe work practices or conditions and suggest appropriate remedies.\n- Encourage feedback from all levels of employees in all areas of the company in regard to problems, ideas and solutions.\n- Keep everyone in the facility informed about new safety policies, training programs and other safety related ideas.\n- Develop a positive safety culture that will support and promote an effective safety system.\n\nMeeting Frequency:\nSafety committee meetings are held in accordance with the following schedule:\n\n- All distribution centers, Central Fills and manufacturing facilities will conduct monthly meetings.\n- Non-distribution centers with more than 10 employees will conduct quarterly meetings.\n- Facilities with fewer than 10 employees will conduct meetings as needed.\n| GRI Disclosure | GRI Requested Information | McKesson FY22\u2013FY23 Responses |\n|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 403-5 Worker training on occupational health and safety | We aim to foster a \u201csafety matters because you matter\u201d culture. Our safety training programs are for employees at all levels. Throughout their time at McKesson, employees learn to identify and control hazards they may encounter at work. All employees, upon hiring and annually thereafter, receive health and safety training through our internal learning portal. Employees also receive specialized training related to their role, environment, and the equipment used in their work environment, for example proper use of personal protective equipment, safe lifting techniques and safe operation of powered industrial trucks. Just as we continually update our processes, we refresh our training modules and programs. In FY23, we launched two new ergonomic training modules within the distribution network focused on safety techniques, warm-ups and stretching. In FY23, employees completed more than 86,000 safety training courses. | |\n| 403-6 Promotion of worker health | See Our People | |\n| 403-7 Prevention and mitigation of occupational health and safety impacts directly linked by business relationships | Actions taken to prevent and mitigate occupational health and safety impacts to our employees included the following: Successfully executed the Focus DC EH&S Service Plan, with an emphasis on review/control of primary risks; Implemented updated PIT Safe Operating Rules and integrated them into Operator (Re)certification Programs; Developed Safety Accountability Guidelines to ensure appropriate, fair and consistent progressive disciplinary actions; Refreshed Pre-Shift Warm-up and Stretching Program, including new learning aids; Produced Ergonomics training module for People Leaders; Updated New Employee Safety Orientation training modules and protocol; Created hands-on employee on-boarding procedures for Operation Hyperdrive employees; Updated Monthly and Annual Safety Inspections & Self-Assessment Programs; Reengineered the Employee Safety Observations Program which emphasizes PIT and manual material handling risks, and integrated them into new employee orientation. | |\n| 403-9 Work-related injuries | In the U.S., injury rates (number of recordable injuries per 100 employees) were calculated for both distribution centers and office locations during calendar year 2022 and 2023.

The long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread. The impacts may include physical risks (such as rising sea levels or increased frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and wellbeing), compliance costs and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) and other adverse effects. The effects could impair, for example, the availability and cost of certain products, commodities, and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact the ability to procure goods or services required for business operations. |\n\n### Risk 1\n\n**Acute physical** \u2014 Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods  \n**Time horizon** long term\n\n### Risk 2\n\n**Chronic physical** \u2014 Rising mean temperatures  \n**Time horizon** long term\n\n### Opportunity 1\n\n**Resource efficiency** \u2014 move to more efficient buildings  \n**Time horizon** long term\n\n### Opportunity 2\n\n**Energy source** \u2014 Use of lower-emission sources of energy  \n**Time horizon** long term\n\nSee Our Planet for more details.

McKesson has partnered with ERM Certification and Verification Services (ERM CVS) to ensure that the methods, calculations, and emissions factors used to calculate our GHG emissions inventory are correct. ERM CVS has issued a letter of assurance for our FY20, FY21, and FY22 GHG emissions inventory to demonstrate our adherence to The GHG Protocol and GHG accounting practices.\n\n2. The boundary for our GHG reporting is for all operations within North America and Norway. The one notable exclusion is the Rexall pharmacy locations throughout Canada.\n\n3. Emissions for the fifteen different scope 3 categories were calculated only for the categories that are relevant to our business. The scope 3 categories that are excluded from our calculations are categories 8\u201315.\n\n4. Our reporting boundary is activity in North America and Norway. Our emissions estimations for scope 3 categories 1 and 2 only include spend data from within our boundary.\n\n5. Our emissions from energy related activities include estimations from transmissions & distribution line losses for electricity and well-to-tank estimations for fuels.\n\n6. Our business travel data is based on invoice date, which has potential issues related to if the purchased travel was completed within the reporting fiscal year. Our estimated emissions from business travel only includes activity from air travel and personal vehicle use.\n\n7. Emissions from employee commuting does not include estimated emissions from employees working from home.\n\n8. For fiscal years FY20\u2013FY22, the energy content of fuel used for transportation is not included in our total energy use calculation. Our energy use calculation for these years includes the energy content of all electricity and fuels used for space conditioning as well as the energy content of fuels used specifically for energy generation, such as diesel fuel used in our generators.\nIndependent Limited Assurance Statement to McKesson Corporation\n\nERM Certification & Verification Services Incorporated (\u201cERM CVS\u201d) was engaged by McKesson Corporation (\u201cMcKesson\u201d) to provide limited assurance in relation to the selected information set out below and presented in McKesson\u2019s Impact Report 2022 (the \u201cReport\u201d).\n\n### Engagement summary\n\n| Scope of our assurance engagement | Whether the fiscal year 2020, 2021 and 2022 data for the following selected disclosures are fairly presented in the Report, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria. |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions** | \u2022 Gross Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG Emissions (location-based) [metric tons CO2e]  \n\u2022 Gross Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG Emissions (market-based) [metric tons CO2e]  \n\u2022 Scope 1 GHG Emissions [metric tons CO2e]  \n\u2022 Scope 2 GHG Emissions (location-based) [metric tons CO2e]  \n\u2022 Scope 2 GHG Emissions (market-based) [metric tons CO2e]  \n\u2022 Gross Scope 3 GHG emissions [metric tonnes CO2e] \u2013 the sum of the following categories: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; as well as the individual total for the following category:  \n  \u2022 Category 6 - Business travel |\n| **Energy Use** | \u2022 Total Energy Consumption [mWh] |\n\nOur assurance engagement does not extend to information in respect of other periods or to any other information included in the Report.\n\n### Reporting periods\n\n- April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2020 (FY20)\n- April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021 (FY21)\n- April 1, 2021 - March 31, 2022 (FY22)\n\n### Reporting criteria\n\n- WBCSD/WRI GHG Protocol (2004, as updated January 2015) for the Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions\n- McKesson\u2019s internal reporting criteria and definitions\n\nWe performed a limited assurance engagement, in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) \u2018Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u2019 issued by the International Auditing and Standards Board.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nMcKesson is responsible for preparing the Report and for the collection and presentation of the information within it, and for the designing, implementing and maintaining of internal controls relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Report.\n\nERM CVS\u2019 responsibility is to provide conclusions to McKesson on the agreed scope based on our engagement terms with McKesson, the assurance activities performed and exercising our professional judgement. We accept no responsibility, and deny any liability, to any party other than McKesson for the conclusions we have reached.\nOur conclusion\nBased on our activities, as described below, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the fiscal year 2020, 2021, and 2022 data and information for the disclosures listed under \u2018Scope\u2019 above are not fairly presented in the Report, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria.\n\nOur assurance activities\nConsidering the level of assurance and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the selected information and data a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed a range of procedures that included, but was not restricted to, the following:\n\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the reporting criteria for the selected information\n- Interviews with management representatives responsible for managing the selected issues.\n- Interviews with relevant staff to understand and evaluate the relevant management systems and processes (including internal review and control processes) used for collecting and reporting the selected disclosures.\n- A review at corporate level of a sample of qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting the reported information.\n- An analytical review of the year-end data submitted by all locations included in the consolidated fiscal year 2020, 2021, and 2022 group data for the selected disclosures which included testing the completeness and mathematical accuracy of conversions and calculations, and consolidation in line with the stated reporting boundary.\n- Virtual visits to select McKesson operations in the United States (California, Colorado, Iowa, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas) and Canada (Ontario) to review source data and local reporting systems and controls.\n- Confirming conversion and emission factors and assumptions used.\n- Reviewing the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work in the Report to ensure consistency with our findings.\n\nThe limitations of our engagement\nThe reliability of the assured information is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for determining, calculating or estimating the underlying information. It is important to understand our assurance conclusions in this context.\n\nOur independence, integrity and quality control\nERM CVS is an independent certification and verification body accredited by UKAS to ISO 17021:2015.

We utilize the operational control methodology for our GHG emissions calculations. One notable exclusion within our boundary is the Rexall pharmacy locations throughout Canada. We define operational control as assets where McKesson has full authority to make changes to the operational characteristics of that asset.\n\n| Item | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Reporting Period** | McKesson\u2019s fiscal year is April 1st \u2013 March 31st |\n| **Units** | All reported emissions are in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, CO2e. |\n| **Total energy use** | McKesson\u2019s reported energy consumption is based on the energy content of sources that power our building operations. It does not include the energy content of the fuel used for fleet transportation. |\n| **Reported greenhouse gases** | Individual GHG emissions from carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are incorporated into our CO2 equivalent (CO2e) values by utilizing the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP) recommended by the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). |\n| **Scope 1 emissions** | All material sources of scope 1 emissions are included in our inventory. These include:  \n  - Natural gas and propane for building conditioning,  \n  - Fuel consumption from fleets for product transportation,  \n  - Fuel consumption from on-site generator usage,  \n  - Refrigerants that escape into the atmosphere from HVAC/R equipment leaks |\n| **Scope 2 emissions** | We practice dual-reporting, where location-based and market-based scope 2 emissions are calculated and disclosed. All material sources of scope 2 emissions are included in our inventory. These include:  \n  - Purchased electricity from utility providers  \n  - Any purchased district heating or cooling |\n| **Scope 3 emissions** | The below Scope 3 categories are considered material and relevant to McKesson\u2019s organizational boundary. Underlined categories indicate where the Quantis estimation tool is used to estimate GHG emissions.  \n  - Category 1 \u2014 Purchased goods and services  \n  - Category 3 \u2014 Fuel and energy-related activities  \n  - Category 4 \u2014 Upstream transportation and distribution  \n  - Category 5 \u2014 Waste generated in operations  \n  - Category 6 \u2014 Business travel  \n  - Category 7 \u2014 Employee commuting  \n  - Category 8 \u2014 Upstream leased assets |\n## Emissions Factors Sources\n\nAll emissions factor sources are applied based on the most recent version available at the time of each fiscal year\u2019s GHG inventory completion.\n\n| Emissions Source | Emissions Factor Source |\n|------------------|-------------------------|\n| Fuels: natural gas, diesel, biomass, biogas | Department of Environment Food & Rural affairs (DEFRA) |\n| Refrigerants | EcoAct and ASHRAE depending on refrigerant type |\n| Scope 2 location-based factor | Global: International Energy Agency (IEA) US: EPA eGRID factors |\n| Scope 2 market-based factors | Global: AIB Residual mix factors US: Green-e Residual mix factors |\n| Transmissions and distribution for electricity (T&D) | International Energy Agency (IEA) annual emissions factors |\n| Category 1 \u2014 Purchased goods and services | Global: WIOD US: USEEIO EPA Supply Chain GHG emissions factors |\n| Category 2 \u2014 Capital goods | |\n| Category 3 \u2014 Fuel and energy-related activities | International Energy Agency (IEA) annual emissions factors |\n| Category 4 \u2014 Upstream transportation and distribution | Spend-based calculations: WIOD Vendor-specific factors where vendors provide GHG reports |\n| Category 5 \u2014 Waste generated in operations | |\n| Category 6 \u2014 Business travel | DEFRA |\n| Category 8 \u2014 Upstream Leased assets | |\n| Category 7 \u2014 Employee Commuting | Quantis GHG estimation tool |\n## Calculation Methodology\n\nMcKesson\u2019s GHG calculation methodology follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s guidance for Scopes 1, 2, 3 emissions calculations.\n\n### Scope 1\n\nWhere primary evidence is available, scope 1 emissions are calculated by multiplying the fuel consumption within the fiscal year by the appropriate emissions factor based on the fuel type.\n\nWhere primary evidence is not available, fuel consumption is estimated based on a number of factors. Natural gas consumption is based on energy splits based on building type and location based on the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) Global database for decarbonization pathways. The total estimated energy use for a building is calculated by multiplying the floor area by the appropriate CRREM factor based on building type and location. The energy split is also used to break out the buildings total estimated energy use by natural gas and electricity, and the same emissions factors are applied here as they are for where primary evidence exists.\n\nWe also apply a spend-based estimation approach for categories of spend for assets that we have operational control, but no primary evidence. Specifically, we operate a few transportation and distribution fleets and we utilize the spend-based approach to estimate the emissions related to these assets where primary evidence isn\u2019t available.\n\n### Scope 2\n\nWhere primary evidence is available, scope 2 emissions are calculated by multiplying the energy consumption within the fiscal year by the appropriate emissions factor based on the geographic location of the energy use. McKesson practices dual-reporting by calculating Location- and Market-based Scope 2 emissions. The different emissions factors are used for location and market-based reporting based on the emissions factor source table above.\n\nWhere primary evidence is not available, energy consumption is estimated based on a number of factors. Electric consumption is based on energy splits based on building type and location based on the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) Global database for decarbonization pathways. The total estimated energy use for a building is calculated by multiplying the floor area by the appropriate CRREM factor based on building type and location. The energy split is also used to break out the buildings total estimated energy use by natural gas and electricity, and the same emissions factors are applied here as they are for where primary evidence exists.\n\n### Scope 3 \u2014 Category 1 \u2014 Purchased goods and services\n\nSpend data is sourced from multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tools that are utilized across the organization. The spend data is consolidated into a single file and analyzed and appropriate emissions factors are applied based on the vendor spend-type categorization. Where spend categorization is not available in the data sources, all vendor spend that is greater than $250M is manually assigned an emissions factor based on the vendor type. WIOD emissions factors are applied for all global spend and non-pharmaceutical related spend. The USE/ED EPA Supply Chain emissions factors are used for pharmaceutical-categorized spend in the US from the Medical Surgical and Pharmaceutical Solutions business units. We utilize the calculated CO\u2082e factor from the detail commodity factors for pharmaceutical products commodities within the EPA dataset.\n\n### Scope 3 \u2014 Category 2 \u2014 Capital goods\n\nCapital spend data is sourced from multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tools that are utilized across the organization. The spend data is consolidated into a single file for analysis and appropriate WIOD emissions factors are applied based on the spend-type categorization. Based on certain limitations with working with multiple ERP systems, capital expenses are included in the Category 1 spend value. In order to report on these two categories separately, we calculate the emissions from Capital goods, and then subtract this value from the total Category 1 spend.\n\n### Scope 3 \u2014 Category 3 \u2014 Fuel and energy-related activities\n\nEmissions from fuel and energy-related activities are estimated for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions sources. DEFRA\u2019s well-to-tank (WTT) and transmission and distribution losses (T&D) emissions factors are used for calculating category 3 emissions based on consumption. Fuels where WTT emissions are calculated apply to natural gas, diesel fuel and propane consumption. T&D losses are calculated for all electric energy consumption.\n\n### Scope 3 \u2014 Category 4 \u2014 Upstream transportation and distribution\n\nEmissions from upstream transportation and distribution are estimated based on the vendor. For the major distribution providers, we leverage their annual GHG emissions estimations based on McKesson\u2019s specific activity with those providers. Emissions from all other transportation and distribution related activities are estimated based on vendor spend categorization, or prior year data, and using the WIOD emissions factors.\n\n### Scope 3 \u2014 Category 5 \u2014 Waste generated in operations\n\nEmissions from waste are estimated based on waste tonnage multiplied by the waste-type specific DEFRA factors.\n\n### Scope 3 \u2014 Category 6 \u2014 Business travel\n\nEmissions from business travel is estimated based on multiple data sources. Our corporate business travel partner provides an annual emissions file that is based on air travel at the segment level. Our other primary source of business travel emissions is based on reimbursements made to employees for personal vehicle use for business purposes.\n\n### Scope 3 \u2014 Category 7 \u2014 Employee commuting\n\nUsing our full-time employee headcount at the time of reporting, McKesson utilizes the Quantis tool to estimate emissions related to employee commuting.\n\n### Scope 3 \u2014 Category 8 \u2014 Upstream Leased assets\n\nMcKesson takes the operational control approach for our inventory process. Furthermore, we apply all emissions related to our upstream leased assets as sources of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.\nData Quality and Reporting\n\nMcKesson\u2019s GHG inventory is assured by an outside third party on an annual basis at a limited level of assurance. The below metrics are currently assured.\n\n- Gross Scope 1 GHG emissions [metric tons CO\u2082e]\n- Gross Scope 2 emissions (location- and market-based) [metric tons CO\u2082e]\n- Gross GHG emissions (Scope 1 + Scope 2) [metric tons CO\u2082e]\n- Total Energy Consumption [megawatt hours]\n- Scope 3 GHG emissions [metric tons CO\u2082e]\n  - Category 1 \u2014 Purchased goods and services\n  - Category 2 \u2014 Capital goods\n  - Category 3 \u2014 Fuel- and energy-related activities\n  - Category 4 \u2014 Upstream transportation and distribution\n  - Category 5 \u2014 Waste generated in operations\n  - Category 6 \u2014 Business travel\n  - Category 7 \u2014 Employee commuting\n  - Category 8 \u2014 Upstream leased assets\n\nBefore our inventory is assured, there is a gap analysis that is completed on the underlying datasets to observe potential issues with the source data. Data owners and subject matter experts are involved in the analysis process to rectify any potential issues related to the data analysis.\n\nWe rely on the data owners to incorporate issues discovered through the data analysis process to ensure that they can be addressed for future reporting year.\nCautionary Statements\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
