It also mentions notable targets set in 2022.\n\nThis report outlines how we\u2019re driving positive environmental impact throughout our business in five key ways: designing efficient data centers, advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building better devices and services, and empowering users with technology.\n\nFor more information about our sustainability strategy, see Google\u2019s Sustainability website and sustainability reports page. For more information about our overall corporate responsibility initiatives, see Google\u2019s commitments, as well as sustainability and related information. For more information about our business, see the About Google and Alphabet Investor Relations websites.\nOur approach\n\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do.\n\nWe\u2019ve been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Google\u2019s founding over 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements over the past two decades:\n\n2007: We became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.\n\n2017: We became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable energy, which we\u2019ve achieved for five consecutive years.\n\n2020: We issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds\u2014the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history at the time.\n\n2021: We matched 66% of our data center electricity use with regional carbon-free sources, on an hourly basis.\n\nOur sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1\nSUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY OVERVIEW\n\nWe strive to build sustainability into everything we do\n\nAccelerate carbon-free and circular\nDecouple business growth from the growth of carbon intensity and material use\n\nEmpower with technology\nTackle major sustainability problems and drive net-positive impact using Google technologies, platforms, products, and services\n\nBenefit people and places\nShare benefits with the communities of our facilities, users, partners, and suppliers\nAccelerating carbon-free and circular\n\nTo accelerate the transition to a carbon-free and circular economy, in 2020, we launched our third decade of climate action, and we\u2019re now working toward a new set of ambitious goals. By 2030, we aim to:\n\nAchieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, including our consumer hardware products\n\nBecome the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year\n\nEnable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions\n\nHelp more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually\n\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same.\n\nAs part of our goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030, we aim to reduce the majority of our emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030 and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We know this will be a challenging journey and we expect our progress toward this goal to be nonlinear. While our total GHG emissions increased from 2020 to 2021, we\u2019re committed to achieving GHG reductions throughout our operations and value chain.\nEmpowering everyone with technology\nTo empower everyone with technology, we\u2019ve committed to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by the end of 2022 through our core products. We introduced eco-friendly routing in Google Maps, new features to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower carbon footprints, and Nest Renew, a program to support clean energy from home. And when people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we show information from authoritative sources like the United Nations.\n\nBenefiting people and places\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we\u2019ve set goals to replenish more water than we consume by 2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate. We\u2019re focused on three areas: enhancing our stewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers; replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress.\n\nAt Google, we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, and we\u2019ll continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our planet. We\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve achieved so far, and we\u2019re energized to help move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.\nPerformance highlights\n\nThe following section provides a snapshot of our performance as of the end of 2021\u2014demonstrating how we\u2019re strengthening our business by reducing the environmental impact of our operations and working to empower people everywhere to live more sustainably.\n\nFor a more complete overview of our performance over time, see the environmental data table.\n\n### DESIGNING EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS\n\n| Energy | GHG emissions |\n|--------|---------------|\n| 2x as energy efficient | 5x as much computing power |\n| On average, a Google data center is twice as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center.\u00b9 | Compared with five years ago, we now deliver around five times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power. |\n| 1.10 average annual PUE | 0 operational GHG emissions after compensations |\n| In 2021, the average annual PUE\u00b2 for our global fleet of data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.57\u00b3\u2014meaning that Google data centers use about six times less overhead energy. | Whether someone is using Google at home or as part of an organization running Google Cloud or Google Workspace, all products in our Cloud are carbon neutral\u2014meaning that the operational GHG emissions associated with running workloads on our infrastructure have been reduced through procurement of renewable energy and any residual emissions have been compensated for with high-quality carbon credits.\u2074 |\n\n### Waste\n\n| 78% of waste diverted | 27% of components refurbished | 4.9 million components resold |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| In 2021, we diverted 78% of waste from our global data center operations away from landfills. | In 2021, 27% of components used for server upgrades were refurbished inventory. | In 2021, we resold more than 4.9 million components into the secondary market for reuse by other organizations. |\nADVANCING CARBON-FREE ENERGY\n\n| Energy | Investment |\n|--------|------------|\n| 7 GW of renewable energy | $3.3 billion in investment commitments |\n| From 2010 to 2021, we signed more than 60 agreements totaling more than 7 GW of renewable energy. Over that period, we\u2019ve committed approximately $6 billion to purchase clean energy from wind and solar projects globally through 2040. | From 2010 to 2021, we made commitments to invest nearly $3.3 billion in renewable energy projects with an expected combined capacity of approximately 8.7 GW. These targeted investments go beyond our purchases of renewable energy for our own operational footprint. |\n| 100% renewable energy | 73 million MWh of renewable energy |\n| In 2021, we matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with renewable energy purchases for the fifth consecutive year. | Over the past decade, Google purchased more renewable energy than any other company. From 2010 to 2021, we purchased a total of more than 73 million MWh of renewable energy through PPAs, via on-site generation, and from the electric grids where our facilities are located. |\n\nGHG emissions\n\n| 65% cumulative GHG emissions reduction | 81% decrease in carbon intensity | 15 years of carbon neutrality |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| From 2011 to 2021, our renewable energy purchasing resulted in a cumulative 65% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as compared with a business-as-usual scenario in which we didn\u2019t procure renewable energy via PPAs. | From 2011 to 2021, our carbon intensity per unit of revenue decreased by 81%. | Google has been carbon neutral for our operations since 2007. Because of our purchases of renewable energy and procurement of high-quality carbon credits, we have compensated for all our operational GHG emissions. |\n\nCREATING SUSTAINABLE WORKPLACES\n\n| Certifications | Waste | Ecology |\n|----------------|-------|---------|\n| 18 million ft\u00b2 LEED-certified | 26% LEED Platinum | 64% landfill diversion |\n| From 2009 to 2021, over 1.7 million m\u00b2 (18 million ft\u00b2) of Google office facilities achieved LEED certification. | 26% of our LEED-certified square footage has achieved a Platinum rating and 60% a Gold rating. | In 2021, we reached a 64% landfill diversion rate for waste from our offices globally. |\n| 15 acres of native habitat on our Bay Area campuses | From 2014 to 2021, we restored and created 15 acres of native habitat on our Bay Area campuses to support wildlife and our communities. |\n\nCommuting\n\n| 4,000 EV charging ports at our offices |\n|----------------------------------------|\n| We have nearly 4,000 EV charging ports at our offices in the United States and Canada. |\nBUILDING BETTER DEVICES AND SERVICES\n\n| GHG emissions | Energy |\n|---------------|--------|\n| **100%** of shipments are carbon neutral | **86 billion kWh** of energy savings |\n| All shipments of Google consumer hardware products to and from direct customers are carbon neutral and have been since 2019.\u2078 | From 2011 to 2021, Nest thermostats helped customers cumulatively save more than 86 billion kWh of energy\u2014enough to power all of San Francisco\u2019s electricity consumption for over 17 years. |\n| **21 billion kWh** of energy savings | **10%\u201315%** energy savings |\n| In 2021 alone, Nest thermostats helped customers save more than 21 billion kWh of energy\u2014more energy than Google used in 2021. | On average, Nest thermostats have proven energy savings of 10%\u201312% for heating and 15% for cooling,\u2079 which means they can pay for themselves in under two years.\u00b9\u2070 |\n\nMaterials\n\n| Waste |\n|-------|\n| **100%** of Nest and Pixel devices contain recycled materials | **100%** recycled aluminum in the housing of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro |\n| All Nest and Pixel devices launched since 2020 include recycled materials.\u00b9\u00b9 | Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are designed with recycled aluminum to reduce their carbon footprint. The aluminum in the housing is 100% recycled content.\u00b9\u00b2 |\n| **100%** of countries with take-back programs | |\n| In 2021, we offered our take-back program in all countries where we ship Google consumer hardware products, allowing customers to responsibly recycle old and unused devices for free\u2014whether made by Google or not. | |\n\nEMPOWERING USERS WITH TECHNOLOGY\n\n| Products | Tools |\n|----------|-------|\n| **1 billion km** of transit results on Google Maps | **200,000** EV charging locations on Google Maps |\n| Google Maps provides, on average, more than 1 billion kilometers\u2019 (621 million miles\u2019) worth of transit results per day, helping to limit carbon emissions by giving people access to mass transit options, bike routes, and traffic information. | By the end of 2021, Google Maps contained nearly 200,000 EV charging locations globally. |\n| **42,000** cities and regions on Environmental Insights Explorer | **52 petabytes** of freely available geospatial data |\n| By the end of 2021, nearly 42,000 cities and regions worldwide were covered by the Environmental Insights Explorer, a tool that empowers city planners and policymakers with actionable data to help reduce global emissions. | Earth Engine has enabled tens of thousands of active users around the world to easily analyze over 52 petabytes\u00b9\u00b3 of freely available geospatial information, resulting in a deeper understanding of the planet. |\n\nPrograms\n\n| Programs |\n|----------|\n| **\u20ac10 million** Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate |\n| In 2021, 11 organizations across Europe were selected to receive Google.org funding via the Impact Challenge on Climate, which provided \u20ac10 million to fund bold ideas that use technology to accelerate Europe\u2019s progress toward a greener, more resilient future. |\nProgress against targets\n\nAs a data-driven company, we believe it is critical to regularly track progress toward our commitments and share updates with our stakeholders.

According to Google\u2019s own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages.\n\n2. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of non-computing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to power IT equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means nearly all the energy is used for computing.\n\n3. According to the Uptime Institute\u2019s 2021 Data Center Survey, the global average PUE of respondents\u2019 largest data centers was around 1.57.\n\n4. Carbon credits are reductions in GHG emissions made to compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere. For each metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, one carbon credit is created. \u201cCarbon offsets\u201d (as mentioned in prior reports) were updated to \u201ccarbon credits\u201d starting in Google\u2019s 2021 Environmental Report. For more information on our approach to purchasing carbon credits, see our 2021 white paper, Google\u2019s Carbon Offsets: Collaboration and Due Diligence.\n\n5. This estimated spend commitment is for clean energy purchased for our operations. It may fluctuate over time based on the number of contracts signed and energy market prices.\n\n6. Based on our cumulative renewable electricity purchased in megawatt-hours (MWh) from 2012 to 2021.\n\n7. The first year Google signed a renewable energy contract was 2010.\n\n8. We procure high-quality carbon credits to compensate for the carbon emissions from all Google-owned shipments of consumer hardware, including to and from retail partners, distributors, and Google Store customers. Because shipping devices to customers falls outside the scope of Google\u2019s operations, these efforts go beyond Google\u2019s long-standing commitment to operational carbon neutrality.\n\n9. Energy Savings from the Nest Learning Thermostat: Energy Bill Analysis Results, Nest Labs, February 2015.\n\n10. Independent studies showed that Nest saved people an average of 10% to 12% on heating and 15% on cooling. Using typical energy costs, we\u2019ve estimated average savings of $31 to $45 per month, which means that the Nest Learning Thermostat can pay for itself in under two years. Individual savings are not guaranteed.\n\n11. Nest and Pixel devices are designed with 9%\u201368% recycled content across their respective plastic parts in 2020 and 2021. This does not include plastics in printed circuit boards, labels, cables, connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge components, films, coatings, and adhesives. The aluminum in the enclosure of Pixel 5 is 100% recycled content. (Back housing only. Recycled aluminum is approximately 58% of the Pixel 5 enclosure based on weight.) The aluminum in the housing of Pixel 6 is 100% recycled content. (Recycled aluminum (in the housing and other recycled aluminum components) is approximately 14% of product based on weight.)\n\n12. Carbon footprint reduction claim based on third-party verified life cycle assessment. Recycled aluminum (in the housing and other recycled aluminum components) is approximately 14% of product based on weight.\n\n13. One petabyte is 10^15 bytes, or 1 million gigabytes, of digital information. It\u2019s equal to approximately 2.5 months of uninterrupted, uncompressed, high-definition (1920 x 1080 pixels) video data.\n\n14. Google was the largest organization, in terms of electricity consumption, to achieve a 100% renewable energy match.\n\n15. For more details, see our 2021 white paper, Carbon-Free Energy Performance at Google Data Centers.\n\n16. We reach operational carbon neutrality via three steps. First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energy efficiency initiatives. Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy. Third, we buy high-quality carbon credits for any remaining operational emissions we haven\u2019t yet eliminated.\n\n17. In this report, \u201cBay Area headquarters\u201d refers to our operations in both Mountain View and Sunnyvale.\n\n18. Fitbit wearable devices were not included in the scope of these targets in 2021.\n\n19. Flagship consumer hardware products are products that can provide their main functionality without connection to another product. For example, this does not include accessories, such as earbuds or cases.\n\n20. Minimum percentage of recycled or renewable plastic content calculated as a percentage of total plastic (by weight) in all products manufactured in 2025. The following may be excluded from the calculation of percentage: printed circuit boards, labels, cables, connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge components, electromagnetic interference components, films, coatings, and adhesives. Renewable content consists of plastic made from bio-based material.\n\n21. This does not include plastics in printed circuit boards, labels, cables, connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge components, electromagnetic interference components, films, coatings, and adhesives.\n\n22. See note 11 above.\n\n23. Ernst & Young LLP reviewed select quantitative performance indicators for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. See the related Independent Accountants\u2019 Review Report. Prior to fiscal year 2019, another third party verified the following emissions: Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 2 (location-based), Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting), and biogenic. For more information, see our prior annual Environmental Reports.\n\n24. Alphabet\u2019s fiscal year is from January 1 to December 31.\n\n25. GHG emissions are calculated according to Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards and guidance, developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), including A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), Scope 2 Guidance, and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. For more information on our methodology, including a breakdown of Scope 3 categories, see Alphabet\u2019s CDP Climate Change Responses on Google\u2019s sustainability reports page.\n\n26. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources we own or over which we have operational control, such as company vehicles or generators at Google\u2019s offices and data centers. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the production of electricity we purchase to run our operations and the production of space heating for our offices. The location-based category reflects the average carbon intensity of the electric grids where our operations are located and thus where our energy consumption occurs. The market-based category incorporates our procurement choices, i.e., our renewable energy purchases via contractual mechanisms like PPAs. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our value chain, such as business travel or supplier.\n\n27. CO\u2082e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability of a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP. Carbon dioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.\n\n28. Since 2010, we\u2019ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall emissions. Until 2015, there was no guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity produced from electricity consumed (in megawatt-hours) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol released updated Scope 2 guidance for the accounting of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data.\n\n29. Google currently buys enough renewable energy to match our annual global electricity consumption. To achieve our 100% renewable energy match goal, we first consider both our on-site renewable energy generation and the renewable energy that is already in the electric grids where our facilities are located, then procure renewable energy through PPA contracts. We have a few facilities located in geographies where we\u2019re not currently able to source large volumes of renewable energy, so we currently make up for this by buying surplus renewable energy in regions where it\u2019s abundant. For example, by buying larger amounts of wind energy in places like Europe, we compensate for our lack of renewable energy purchases in Asia. This approach results in Google\u2019s Scope 2 market-based emissions being greater than zero per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, despite us achieving our 100% renewable energy match globally. To work toward eliminating GHG emissions associated with our electricity use (Scope 2 market-based emissions), we set the ambitious goal of achieving 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030. To attain this, we\u2019re evolving from matching our annual energy consumption with renewable energy to sourcing carbon-free energy every hour of every day, everywhere.\n\n30. See note 25 above.\n31. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food served in our offices, hardware manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google\u2019s hardware includes data center servers, networking equipment, and consumer hardware products. These extended categories have been reported annually from 2018 onward.\n\n32. In 2020, due to the global pandemic, we began to estimate and report on our emissions associated with teleworking (i.e., employees working remotely). We applied the estimation methodology outlined in EcoAct\u2019s Homeworking Emissions Whitepaper to our annual average workforce to estimate the GHG emissions generated by employees working remotely from their homes. Teleworking emissions are reported as part of our Scope 3 emissions for employee commuting, per Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0). For a breakdown of our operational Scope 3 emissions by category, see our 2021 Independent Accountants\u2019 Review Report.\n\n33. In 2020, we began reporting teleworking emissions as part of our Scope 3 employee commuting emissions. Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting) emissions reported prior to 2020 do not include teleworking emissions.\n\n34. See note 31 above.\n\n35. We calculate two metrics for operational emissions, one using market-based Scope 2 and one using location-based Scope 2. The Scope 2 market-based and location-based amounts have been third-party assured by Ernst & Young LLP, as shown in the Schedule of Select Environmental Indicators attached to the 2021 Independent Accountants\u2019 Review Report. In the 2021 Independent Accountants\u2019 Review Report, the Schedule of Operational GHG emissions After Compensation Adjustments only includes the market-based metric.\n\n36. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. For more information, see our 2017 white paper, 10 Years of Carbon Neutrality. In 2020, we extended our operational emissions boundary to include teleworking emissions. The operational emissions included in our carbon neutrality commitment now include Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting, including teleworking).\n\n37. Emissions reduced by renewable energy PPAs are calculated by subtracting Scope 2 market-based method (MBM) GHG emissions from Scope 2 location-based method GHG emissions, thereby representing emissions reductions from renewable energy PPAs and MBM emission factors.\n\n38. See note 36 above.\n\n39. Carbon intensity metrics are based on gross global combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions. For more information on year-over-year changes to market-based Scope 2 emissions, see note 29 above.\n\n40. Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable sources.\n\n41. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) with the total volume of electricity consumed by our operations. This metric includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. Prior to 2016, we were not accounting for the renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity.\n\n42. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s Scope 2 Guidance requires energy attribute certificates to be sourced from and applied to the same market in which the reporting entity\u2019s electricity-consuming operations are located. This guidance does not recognize existing renewable energy on the electric grids where an entity\u2019s operations are located.\n\n43. Our carbon-free energy (CFE) percentage measures the degree to which our electricity consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis. This is calculated using both CFE under contract by Google as well as CFE coming from the overall grid mix. CFE coming from the overall grid mix is based on data obtained from a third-party, electricityMap, and has not been assured. For more information, see our 2021 white paper, 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy: Methodologies and Metrics.\n\n44. Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery.\n\n45. In 2020, pre-consumer food waste prevented in our caf\u00e9s was tracked only from January to March due to limited caf\u00e9 operations during the global pandemic.\n\n46. In 2021, we continued to experience limited caf\u00e9 operations due to the global pandemic. As a result, we were unable to update our cumulative total for pre-consumer food waste prevented in our caf\u00e9s.\n\n47. In 2021, there was less inventory to be resold due to market shortages and the continued impact of the global pandemic.\n\n48. In 2019, we aligned our water reporting with industry standards to disclose three water indicators: total water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge. Data for total water consumption and total water discharge is not available for prior years.\n\n49. Our reported water withdrawal, water consumption, and water discharge metrics do not include seawater.\n\n50. 2018 is the first year that reflects a refinement in Green Business Certification Inc.\u2019s methodology for determining LEED-certified office space.\n\n51. This figure indicates the number of ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada, which represent the majority of our EV charging ports in those countries.\n\n52. Emissions avoided are estimated using data from the reported ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada only. While Google\u2019s total number of installed EV charging ports in the United States and Canada increased in 2020, the ports experienced limited use from March to December due to the global pandemic, resulting in a decrease in emissions avoided due to employee EV commuting that year. In 2021, EV charging ports continued to experience limited use due to office closures and related decreases in employee EV commuting.\n\n53. Due to the global pandemic, our Google shuttle buses in the Bay Area were in operation only from January to March in 2020 and from July to December in 2021.\n\n54. See note 53 above.\n\n55. See note 53 above.\n\n56. All ecology projects that were scheduled for completion in 2020 were delayed due to the global pandemic.\n\n57. See note 56 above.\n\n58. In addition to our renewable energy contracts, Google also invests in renewable energy projects around the world that are not used to directly mitigate our emissions. This indicator represents the expected combined capacity of contracted renewable energy projects in which we have an equity investment, even if we\u2019re a minority owner.\n\n59.
