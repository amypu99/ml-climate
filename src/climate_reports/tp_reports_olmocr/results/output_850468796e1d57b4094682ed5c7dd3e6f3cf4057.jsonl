The framework is designed to unlock greater value for our associates, customers, communities and company as we work together to address some of the most significant challenges of our time.\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees Kroger\u2019s management approach to ESG topics. In addition, a dedicated Public Responsibilities Committee of the board\u2014established in 1977\u2014provides deep oversight of the company\u2019s ESG strategy and goals related to environmental sustainability and social impact.\n\nKroger\u2019s executive leadership team is accountable for operationalizing and driving performance against our ESG goals, which are established and managed in partnership with a centralized ESG team led by Kroger\u2019s group vice president of Corporate Affairs, who serves as chief sustainability officer.\n\nDetails on our management approach to ESG topics can be found throughout this report. Additional details on key topics are also available at www.thekrogerco.com. Supplemental reporting resources are also available online for select ESG topics, as well as information about how we align impact philanthropy and investing to our ESG strategy through corporate giving, The Kroger Co. Foundation and The Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation.\n\nReport Scope\n\nThis report covers Kroger\u2019s 2021 fiscal year from February 2, 2021, to January 29, 2022. Unless otherwise noted, data included in the report reflects this period. This ESG Report incorporates most of our operations, except for certain datasets where we are still integrating banners from more recent mergers into our tracking systems. Where appropriate, we note the scope of specific performance tracking in the relevant report section.\n\nReporting Frameworks\n\nThe content in this report has been prepared with reference to select portions of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. We leveraged the same principles for defining report content as in earlier years\u2014such as stakeholder inclusiveness and materiality\u2014as well as discussion of our management approach and several relevant topic-specific disclosures.\n\nKroger served as a member of the Standards Advisory Group (Food & Beverage Sector) for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards until recently, and has now transitioned onto the International Sustainability Standards Board\u2019s Technical Reference Group. Volunteer industry experts are appointed to advise on issues that should be considered in the standards-development process. To review our disclosures against the Food Retailers & Distributors Standard, refer to our SASB Index at the end of this report. We strive to increase Kroger\u2019s SASB-aligned disclosures over time.\n\nIn addition, Kroger is highlighting how our management approach aligns with the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD) framework.\n\n2022 Kroger ESG Report\n\nContents\n\n3 Introduction\n8 Our Approach\n17 People\n18 Food Access, Health & Safety\n28 Just & Inclusive Economy\n35 Planet\n36 Climate Impact\n40 Resource Conservation\n49 Systems\n50 Business Integration\n54 Responsible & Resilient Systems\n63 Appendix\n63 Material Topics Summary Table\n65 TCFD Index\n66 SASB Index\n68 2021 Data Tables\nKroger looks very different today than it did when we opened our first store in 1883. But the core principles that made that store successful\u2014service, selection, value and our commitment to our customers\u2014remain the bedrock of our business.\n\nThrough it all, Our Purpose remains the same: To Feed the Human Spirit\u2122 and be America\u2019s leading provider of fresh food. Our journey to operationalize and integrate ESG within our business strategy will help achieve lasting positive changes for people and our planet.\n\nWhat are Kroger\u2019s key learnings from 2021?\nWhile navigating the ongoing pandemic in 2021, like many businesses across the world, we faced new challenges within our supply chain. These disruptions\u2014and those related to the conflict in Ukraine\u2014remind us of the complexity of our interconnected global food and consumer goods supply chains. These challenges reflect the critical nature of our ESG work to help ensure our business operations are as resilient as possible, so we can continue to serve our Associates, Customers and Communities well into the future.\n\nHow is Kroger approaching our ESG strategy and where does the ownership lie?\nIntroduced in 2021, Kroger\u2019s ESG strategy, Thriving Together, is our roadmap for driving positive changes for people, our planet and natural systems by 2030 and beyond. Leaders are focused on integrating this strategy across our business to accelerate progress toward long-term commitments. For example, retail leaders continue to operationalize Zero Hunger | Zero Waste performance objectives into company-, division- and store-level plans and training.\n\nHow is Kroger supporting communities?\nAs a grocery retailer, our core business provides convenient access to affordable food, medication, health services, essential supplies and more for our Associates, Customers and Communities. In 2021, Kroger also directed $343 million in charitable giving\u2014including food and funds\u2014to local and national non-profit organizations; of this, $200 million focused on improving food security in communities where we operate, reflecting our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste mission.\n\nHow is Kroger addressing climate change?\nWe recognize our dual responsibilities when managing climate impact: reducing the adverse impacts of our operations on a changing climate and mitigating the potential impacts of a changing climate on our business. Kroger\u2019s current target is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% by 2030, from a 2018 baseline. In 2022, we committed to strengthen our Scope 1 and 2 target and set a new Scope 3 target for supply chain emissions reduction with the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nWhat progress has been made on Kroger\u2019s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan?\nKroger introduced our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan in 2017 to help create communities free of hunger and waste. In the past five years, we directed 2.3 billion meals to improve food access in our communities\u2014reflecting surplus food donations and $1 billion in giving\u2014toward our goal of 3 billion meals by 2025. We also accelerated our zero-waste vision with progress on food waste reduction, waste diversion, sustainable packaging and more.\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve by 2030?\nWe see incredible opportunity to reach more customers through our seamless ecosystem and expanding Delivery platform. Our shared-value strategy will bring affordable fresh, planet-forward options to even more homes, giving customers easy ways to live a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle\u2014no matter where they live.\n\nAs we reflect on the last year, I am incredibly optimistic about the future of Kroger and our ability to deliver for all stakeholders.\nAbout Kroger\n\nSince our humble beginnings on the banks of the Ohio River in Cincinnati, Kroger has prioritized offering convenience and value to our customers.\n\nNearly 140 years later, our purpose-driven strategy aims to increase access to high-quality, affordable fresh food for everyone.

While our approach to engagement varies by stakeholder group, we prioritize topics based on our strengths, our ESG strategy, materiality and risk-based analyses.\n\n| Key Stakeholders | Primary Engagement Methods | Engagement Outcomes 2021 |\n|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Shareholders     | Kroger\u2019s leaders, our Investor Relations team and other subject matter experts engage with shareholders throughout the year. Key channels include direct investor engagement, investor conferences, our annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, quarterly earnings calls, financial reports, investor questionnaires about ESG topics, www.thekrogerco.com, press releases and webcasts. | In 2021, we met with shareholders representing 47% of outstanding shares. Kroger also met with stewardship teams representing 34% of our outstanding shares to discuss ESG topics. Discussions with socially conscious investors helped inform our ESG strategy and long-term commitments. |\n| Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) | We engage many NGOs to share the vision for Kroger\u2019s ESG strategy and Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan. We welcome dialogue with NGOs on diverse sustainability topics to help advance common goals for people and the planet. | NGO engagement shaped our management approach to material topics. We updated several ESG policies to reflect NGO feedback, including our human rights policy, animal welfare policy and seafood sustainability goals. We also committed to develop a new sustainable agriculture policy for our fresh produce supply chain. |\n| Associates & Labor Unions | We strive to engage with all Kroger associates in all locations. We use associate training, one-on-one discussions and coaching, the company\u2019s intranet, email, leadership meetings and town halls, affinity and inclusion groups, internal and external social media and an annual associate engagement survey. We also communicate with local and international unions through scheduled meetings, telephone calls and ongoing collective bargaining agreement negotiations. | Input from associates and others informed our evolving pandemic response plan, including measures to help protect health and safety; invest in wages, rewards and paid sick leave for frontline grocery workers; and offer access to testing, vaccinations and telehealth services. |\n| Customers | We offer customers many ways to engage with us, including in-store service counters, surveys, focus groups, websites and social media, as well as Kroger Customer Connect, our live call center. | Continual feedback from customers guides improvements to our in-store and digital shopping experiences. Our 84.51\u00b0 customer insights team monitors shopping behavior to identify trends and opportunities, creating 1 trillion personalized offers to drive engagement last year. |\n| Communities | We foster close relationships with the neighborhoods in which we operate. Key channels include direct engagement, local giving and fundraising, service and volunteerism, weekly food donations, hunger relief, ongoing special events, store openings, media relations and more. | We provided direct support and services for individuals and communities affected by natural disasters and unexpected tragic events in 2021. These include compassion funds for victims\u2019 assistance in Boulder, CO; Oconomowoc, WI; and Collierville, TN. |\n| Suppliers & Manufacturers | Kroger\u2019s engagement with our suppliers is a critical element of our commitment to responsible sourcing and supply chain accountability. We focus our engagement during the onboarding process and continue it through ongoing meetings, site visits, surveys and audits. | We engaged suppliers throughout 2021 to navigate pandemic-related disruptions and extended out-of-stocks in supply chains; onboard new suppliers to help fill gaps on our shelves; and discuss progress on responsible sourcing targets. |\nHelp Billions\nLive Healthier &\nMore Sustainable\nLifestyles\n\nWe want our associates, customers and communities to thrive. That\u2019s why we\u2019re helping build a more just and inclusive world where everyone has access to nutritious, affordable foods every day.\n\nIn This Section\n18 Food Access, Health & Safety\n28 Just & Inclusive Economy\nFood Access, Health & Safety\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continued through 2021, complex issues surrounding access to affordable, nutritious food and health and safety remained our top priorities. The continued disruptions in everyday life and our global supply chain validated the importance of our ESG strategy and Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan\u2014work that is central to our brand promise, Fresh for Everyone\u2122.\n\nMaterial Topics:\n- Food & Product Safety\n- Food Access\n- Health & Nutrition\n- Customer Experience\n- Associate Health & Safety\n- Community Engagement\n\n2021 Highlights\n\n546M meals for our communities\n\n$343M in total charitable giving, including $210M to hunger relief\n\n94M pounds of surplus food rescued for donation\n\n98% associates trained in personal safety\n\n$46M in Kroger Community Rewards for local non-profits chosen by our customers\n\nFood & Product Safety\n\nProviding safe, quality food and other products for our customers and their families is Kroger\u2019s highest priority. Food safety, quality assurance and regulatory compliance are key facets of our Corporate Food Technology (CFT) practice, and, for our suppliers and partners, they are conditions of doing business with us. We strive to meet and exceed our stakeholders\u2019 high expectations for food safety and quality.\n\nKroger\u2019s vice president of CFT and Regulatory Compliance leads a team of more than 30 scientists and technologists who oversee food and product safety for our retail stores, food processing facilities, distribution centers and fulfillment centers. This team also advises business leaders and facility managers on best practices and process controls, and provides regular updates to the executive leadership team and Public Responsibilities Committee of the board.\n\nKroger has a comprehensive risk-based management approach to food and product safety, informed by decades of experience and industry leadership. The CFT team tests products we manufacture for safety, audits all Kroger facilities, reviews third-party audits of suppliers\u2019 facilities for compliance, works with regulatory agencies and suppliers to manage recalls affecting Our Brands and national brand products, and advises the Corporate Affairs team on recall communications, policymaking and advocacy.\n\nIn 2021, the Kroger operations and food safety teams continued to follow pandemic-related protocols and master sanitation and cleaning schedules at all facilities, with guidance from Ecolab. Some of these new cleaning protocols are now standard procedures.\n\nSupermarkets\n\nAcross our stores, food safety managers help ensure compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations through our risk prevention strategy. In 2021, Kroger trained over 93% of new retail store Fresh department associates, totaling more than 21,300 associates who completed the Fresh department training program. We also completed nearly 14,400 in-store food safety audits in 2021.\n\nFood safety managers also participate in food safety organizations and industry groups to stay informed of new developments and share best practices. In our retail operations, Kroger\u2019s risk prevention strategy focuses on:\n\n- Associate training\n- Food safety process controls\n- Store sanitation\n- Audits and food safety reviews\nManufacturing Facilities\nAll of our manufacturing facilities are certified to Safe Quality Food Institute standards, and every plant has an assigned Quality Assurance Manager and a Safe Quality Food Practitioner. We manufacture 45% of Our Brands food items at 33 Kroger-operated food processing plants across the country, offering customers thousands of quality Our Brands and banner brand products like Kroger brand, Private Selection\u00ae, Simple Truth\u00ae and many more.\n\nOur CFT and Regulatory Compliance teams monitor food integrity and purity, product size and specifications, and regulatory compliance to ensure we provide safe, high-quality food products to our customers. In our food processing plants, we use quality control plans (QCPs) to verify quality from the ingredient level all the way to the finished product. We adjust QCPs and develop new QCPs based on various inputs, such as customer comments.\n\nOur manufacturing food safety risk mitigation strategy includes:\n- Leadership and training\n- Hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls\n- Sanitation control\n- Food allergen control\n- Environmental monitoring programs\n- Audits and food safety reviews\n- Recall management\n\nDistribution Centers\nMaintaining excellent food safety practices is also critical across our Kroger-operated national distribution centers. Established food safety and sanitation standards outline management responsibilities, and associates implement formal documented programs, including Food Safety Plans. Kroger\u2019s distribution centers follow established cold chain management standards to help ensure temperature-sensitive products are managed properly in transit and storage. This is of particular importance during inbound and outbound transportation. Our standards outline these requirements in detail for our associates. Based on best practices and regulatory requirements, key elements of the standards include:\n- Food safety responsibility and documented practices\n- Proper receipt and storage of materials\n- Cleaning practices\n- Maintenance for food safety\n- Pest prevention to avoid food adulteration\n\nFulfillment Centers\nWe implement the same warehouse food safety standards at our new dedicated fulfillment centers with some additional process controls that reflect the unique Kroger Delivery model and fleet of refrigerated vehicles. These fulfillment centers are carefully designed to manage ambient, chilled and frozen product in designated areas for maximum product quality and freshness.\n\nProduct Safety & Quality\nOur Brands non-food products adhere to a multi-faceted program to help ensure quality. We work with carefully selected suppliers that have been vetted and that adhere to compliance requirements as outlined in our centralized Supplier Hub, including third-party Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certifications. All products undergo evaluation and standard-setting during the development process. Product quality is designed into the process from the start through preliminary analytical testing, technical document review, product specifications agreed upon by Kroger and the supplier, and a first production review prior to release. After introducing the product to market, we continue to monitor and maintain quality. New products are tested by a third-party laboratory after six months in market, and we use a risk-based approach to conduct third-party testing for mature products.\n\nKroger monitors and documents all customer feedback, which is also reviewed and addressed by our technical team and the supplier for continual improvement. Kroger\u2019s CFT and Regulatory Compliance team also monitors regulatory activity over time related to product safety and ingredients to help ensure continued product safety and compliance.\n\nFood Safety Leadership\nKroger has been an active member in The Consumer Goods Forum for many years, including its Coalition of Action on food safety, the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI).\n\nIn 2021, Howard Popoola, Kroger\u2019s vice president of CFT and Regulatory Compliance, was appointed Retail Steering Committee Co-Chair for the GFSI.\n\nThe GFSI brings together 37 retailers and manufacturers from around the world and an extended food safety community to oversee food safety standards for businesses and help provide access to safe food for people everywhere. The group implements the Race to the Top Framework, which is designed to enhance oversight of the GFSI ecosystem with the aim of improving trust, transparency and confidence in GFSI-recognized certification and audit outcomes.\n\nThis year, the GFSI called for greater collaboration between the public and private sectors to raise the bar on food safety globally.\n\nLearn more about the GFSI.\nRecall Management\n\nProducts are removed from sale for many reasons, including incorrect package labels, undeclared allergens and, on rare occasions, the risk of illness or injury. Because our customers\u2019 safety is our highest priority, Kroger is a leader in recall management and communications.\n\nWe consistently meet and exceed industry and government standards for recalls and product withdrawals. We have an experienced team of experts who coordinate recalls with suppliers, regulatory agencies and our own network of food safety specialists and recall managers. This 24-hour, 7-day-a-week process focuses on identifying items to be recalled or withdrawn from our distribution network and retail stores and working with appropriate teams to ensure the recalled items are quickly removed from sale.\n\nKroger was one of the first retailers to implement a personalized customer notification system for certain types of recalls. Using our customer loyalty database, we can identify shoppers who may have purchased a specific recalled item. If a recall involves a possible health risk\u2014such as an undeclared allergen or potential foodborne illness\u2014we immediately activate our notification systems to alert customers quickly through register receipt messages and automated phone calls.\n\nWhen issues occur, we work quickly to recall or destroy affected products. We also investigate the issue, take corrective action, and modify or create programs to minimize or eliminate the problem in the future. In every situation, we put our customers\u2019 interests first. If food safety is compromised for any reason, we go the extra mile to take action and alert customers quickly to the potential problem out of an abundance of caution.\n\nKroger also offers a toll-free Customer Service Center and information line staffed with professionals who can answer questions about food safety and items that may have been recalled.\n\nIn 2021, the Kroger team managed a total of 86 recall events. Of these, 41 were Class I product recalls, including 37 related to food products. Ten of these Class I recalls involved Our Brands products; however, none were for items produced in a Kroger-operated manufacturing facility. As in previous years, recalls for undeclared allergens continue to be a primary cause of Class I recalls.\n\nNumber of Class I recall events involving Kroger-manufactured Our Brands items\n\n| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|------|\n|      | 0    | 1    | 0    |\n\n9. Situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\nFood Access\n\nWith access to healthy, affordable food more important than ever today, we continue to advance our Purpose and brand promise: Fresh for Everyone\u2122.\n\nKroger serves millions of customers every day with low prices, special promotions and personalized offers to help stretch budgets and make cooking at home more affordable. We also work with suppliers, non-profit organizations, social enterprises and others to improve food access for vulnerable individuals and communities across the country.\n\nWith food and grocery as Kroger\u2019s core business, all lines of business and corporate functions play a role in food access. Retail Operations and Corporate Affairs teams share primary ownership for policies, facility-level programs and progress, reporting to the executive leadership team. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the board provides additional oversight.\n\nZero Hunger | Zero Waste\n\nKroger\u2019s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan demonstrates our ongoing commitment to help create communities free from hunger and food waste. This purpose-driven plan addresses a fundamental absurdity in our food system: 35% of food is thrown away, yet 1 in 8 Americans struggle with hunger. To tackle this, we aim to improve food access by expanding our seamless ecosystem; optimizing store-level execution of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste programs; enabling technology to recover and redistribute surplus food; and aligning charitable giving.\n\nIn 2021, we directed 546 million meals to our communities across the country.\n\nManaging Surplus Food\n\nAs items in our Fresh departments approach their use-by dates, we activate an established markdown program to make them even more affordable and to reduce surplus food. Remaining items may be eligible for donation through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Food Rescue program, through which our associates recover and redistribute surplus fresh food to local non-profit organizations.\n\nTotal food rescue declined slightly in 2021 due to continued pandemic-related impacts, including reduced agency pickup schedules. Despite this, Kroger associates continued to rescue surplus food for donation wherever food banks were able to collect it, rescuing 94 million pounds of food from our facilities company-wide.\n\nMore information about Kroger\u2019s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan is available on our website.\n\nData-Driven Solutions\n\nKroger is leveraging data and insights to better understand the flow of food through our operations and maximize surplus food recovery. Together, Kroger and Google Food are imagining a new way to identify available surplus food at the local level and offer it for pickup to organizations able to collect and transport it safely and efficiently.\n\nIn 2021, we conducted a four-week pilot in two Cincinnati-area Kroger retail stores, working with local non-profit agencies, to identify ways to improve our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Food Rescue program. Next steps include internal work to improve data quality and store-level program execution while we continue to help build a more inclusive charitable food system for the future.\nHealth & Nutrition\n\nKroger believes in the power of food to nourish families and improve health. We also believe promoting long-term health and nutrition has the potential to improve community health and increase sales, customer loyalty and alternative revenue streams. Our Food as Medicine platform aims to deliver a personalized approach to eating and enjoying food to help people live healthier lives and prevent illness before it starts.\n\nKroger Health leads the company\u2019s health and nutrition strategy, services and programs. It includes retail, mail order, central fill and specialty pharmacy operations; retail health clinics; nutrition and dietitian services; and health advocacy. A team of 22,000 healthcare practitioners, including pharmacists, nurse practitioners, dietitians and technicians, serves over 14 million customers annually.\n\nThe company\u2019s executive leadership team and Public Responsibilities Committee oversees progress and pharmacy safety measures. The COVID-19 pandemic brought needed attention to issues that have been affecting communities for years, including the urgent need to address social determinants of health and health equity for vulnerable populations and communities of color.\n\nIn 2021, our health services included continued COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, treatment and nutrition support as the delta and omicron variants extended the pandemic\u2019s impacts. As one of the most accessible healthcare partners in the United States, Kroger Health has played a critical role in helping distribute and administer the COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with the federal government and local health departments. Using the Social Vulnerability Index as a guide to determine the placement of many off-site vaccine clinics, Kroger Health was able to provide vaccine access to our most vulnerable populations.\n\nTo help overcome some barriers to access, we also provided patients with discounted Lyft rides to and from COVID-19 vaccine appointments.\n\nThe Kroger Health team is defining more specific indicators of success for its Food as Medicine platform, including defining specific health and nutrition attributes for thousands of fresh, better-for-you options available across our retail stores and digital channels.\n\nKroger Health received the 2022 American Pharmacists Association Immunization Champion Award, which recognizes organizations improving vaccination rates within their communities.\n\n11.4M COVID-19 vaccines administered through July 2022\n3.15M COVID-19 tests facilitated (including over-the-counter tests)\n~1.1M dietitian-approved meals delivered to vulnerable populations\n6K+ Telenutrition visits, plus services offered across the country\n50+ health-related articles written and shared by our expert registered dietitians\nEarlier this year, Kroger Health, the University of Cincinnati (UC), UC Health and Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center announced the results of a first-of-its-kind independent clinical trial showing the impact of retail-based dietary interventions. This research focused on how retailers can serve as important healthcare destinations, leveraging food and nutrition education to support shoppers and help them make healthful food purchases.\n\nThe study, Supermarket and Web-based Intervention targeting Nutrition (SuperWIN), was a groundbreaking randomized controlled trial aimed at increasing diet quality and decreasing cardiovascular risk by promoting a heart-healthy diet through nutrition counseling provided by a registered dietitian. The SuperWIN trial is the latest evidence supporting Kroger\u2019s Food as Medicine platform.\n\nIn 2021, this box evolved into a business-to-business offering to help stock patients\u2019 pantries, share recipes and inspire new ways to enjoy familiar items. These three box assortments provided more than 100,000 boxes of nourishing foods, with ingredients for over 1 million meals for vulnerable individuals, in partnership with health systems and others focused on improving health outcomes.\n\nInnovative Solutions\nKroger continues to develop and test creative solutions with the potential to improve access to food and personalized nutrition. Last year, we introduced and expanded our body of knowledge and programs aimed at serving our customers and patients during challenging times.\n\nTelenutrition: Our national Telenutrition program provides two-way video chat appointments with Kroger Health\u2019s registered dietitians to expand convenient access to care and address barriers to in-person healthcare visits, such as limited access to transportation. In 2021, we conducted thousands of free consultations to help patients navigate their food budgets, nourish critical and chronic health conditions and learn to shop online and cook at home. The service remains available to the public today at affordable prices.\n\nKroger Health Food Boxes: Kroger Health first introduced dietitian-curated boxes of nourishing, shelf-stable food shipped nationwide in 2020. We offered three boxed assortments focused on stocking the pantry; monthly topic-focused nutrition education; and disaster relief, each paired with nourishing foods. The pantry staples box initially served insurance-funded patients, who received boxes to support healthy food choices during stay-at-home orders. In 2021, this box evolved into a business-to-business offering to help stock patients\u2019 pantries, share recipes and inspire new ways to enjoy familiar items. These three box assortments provided more than 100,000 boxes of nourishing foods, with ingredients for over 1 million meals for vulnerable individuals, in partnership with health systems and others focused on improving health outcomes.\n\nNutrition Education: Nutrition can be confusing. Our registered dietitians drive thought leadership and inspire behavior change through easy-to-understand expert content, including blogs on nutrition-related topics and dietitian-approved product recommendations. By sharing their knowledge around eating and enjoying food, our dietitians help increase access to expert nutrition education and support customers and patients to live healthier lives. Dietitian content can be found on Kroger.com, the Kroger mobile app and Vitacost.com.\n\nOptUP Nutrition Rating System: We introduced the OptUP nutrition rating system in 2018, helping customers explore the health profile of their shopping and consider more nutritious alternatives. In 2021, we integrated OptUP into our digital shopping experience through Kroger.com and the Kroger mobile app. Now customers can check nutrition ratings while they shop, making it easier to quickly compare similar products and add better-for-you items to their basket. Driven by Kroger\u2019s team of expert registered dietitians, OptUP ratings are calculated by leveraging data science, evidence-based nutritional information and machine learning to rate foods on a scale from 1 to 100. The more nutritious the food, the higher the nutrition rating.\n\nDiabetes Prevention: Kroger Health also offers Welsana, a Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) designed to help people lead a healthier life. Participating in a DPP can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by more than half. Welsana focuses on healthy eating habits, meaningful movement, improving sleep and reducing stress. With support from an expert personal coach, the program helps build new, healthy habits through practice over time.\nCustomer Experience\n\nKroger operates conveniently located retail supermarkets and a digital ecosystem serving over 60 million households in our communities every year. Our customer experience management approach is led by a team of Marketing, Merchandising and Retail Operations leaders who strive to offer fresh, friendly and full shopping experiences every day, no matter how customers choose to shop with us. We measure our performance through various sales, operations and customer satisfaction metrics.\n\nKroger currently offers more than 2,200 pickup locations, over 2,500 delivery locations and home delivery through new fulfillment centers and with Instacart. From a digital perspective, 98% of our customers have access to delivery through our seamless Pickup and Delivery ecosystem, including nearly 2.5 million people who engaged with us online in 2021.\n\nThe pandemic changed how our customers enjoy food and family meals at home and away. In the \u201cfood at home\u201d market, Kroger maintained our position as a top food retailer in most markets we serve. We believe many cooking-at-home habits formed in the last two years will endure, positioning Kroger for additional growth. In 2021, our Home Chef brand prepared meals solution surpassed $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nWe also made meaningful progress in the \u201cfood away from home\u201d market. We launched sushi delivery in partnership with DoorDash, and introduced \u201cghost kitchen\u201d concepts with Kitchen United MIX and ClusterTruck in several markets.\n\nKroger focuses on four areas to improve our customers\u2019 experience:\n\n- **Fresh:** We continue to bring our brand promise\u2014Fresh for Everyone\u2122\u2014to life across the company. Today, 92% of customers buy fresh products from Kroger, demonstrating just how critical this area of the business is for our customers. Kroger has a leadership position in Fresh, with 15.6% sales growth in perishable departments\u2014Bakery, Dairy, Deli, Meat & Seafood and Produce\u2014since 2019.\n\n  Going forward, we\u2019ll:\n  - Use data-driven insights to ensure products are at peak flavor and quality.\n  - Reduce transit time from distribution centers.\n  - Ensure optimum assortment, price and promotion.\n  - Simplify store operations, tasks and training.\n  - More effectively market the freshness of our products to Kroger customers.\n\n- **Our Brands:** The Our Brands portfolio has four unique $1 billion+ brands: Kroger brand, Private Selection\u00ae, Simple Truth\u00ae and Home Chef. Our Brands\u2019 sales totaled a record of nearly $28 billion last year, and Simple Truth\u00ae exceeded $3 billion in sales for the second year in a row. Our Brands has become not only a customer favorite but also a core competitive differentiator, launching over 660 new items during 2021.\n\n- **Personalization:** Our data and personalization strengths enable meaningful customer moments across channels to address specific needs and enhance our customers\u2019 relationships with Kroger. In 2021, we expanded our loyalty and personalization platform, generating over 1 trillion relevant recommendations. Data shows that 50% of items were added to baskets because of personalized search. We also launched Boost, Kroger\u2019s paid membership, in several markets to help drive strong repeat and frequency rates\u2014with over 50% of members being new to Delivery.\n\n- **Seamless:** As our digital footprint expands, Kroger is bringing fresh food direct to our customers\u2019 homes. This strategic relationship combines artificial intelligence, advanced robotics and automation to serve customers in existing and new geographies.\n\n  In 2021, Kroger opened our first fulfillment centers, powering Kroger Delivery in Monroe, OH; Groveland, FL (Orlando); and Forest Park, GA (Atlanta). Since then, Kroger also opened fulfillment centers in Pleasant Prairie, WI; Dallas, TX; and Romulus, MI (Detroit). Additional fulfillment centers are slated for California, Frederick, MD; Phoenix, AZ; Cleveland, OH; Charlotte, NC; Aurora, CO (Denver); as well as South Florida and the Northeast. Kroger Delivery is a vertically integrated network, enabling coverage of up to 90 miles from the hub location. Additional spoke facilities in key markets serve as last-mile cross-dock locations that expand Kroger Delivery\u2019s ability to serve more customers.\n\n  As customers\u2019 orders near their delivery times, the automated system retrieves products to be sorted for delivery in an algorithm-governed process that ensures items are intelligently sorted. For example, fragile items are placed on top, bags are evenly weighted and each order is optimized to fit into the fewest bags, reducing plastic use.\n\n  Once completed, orders are loaded into temperature-controlled Kroger Delivery vans, which can store up to 20 orders. Powerful machine learning algorithms optimize delivery routes, considering factors like road conditions and optimal fuel efficiency.\nLoyalty Strategy\nKroger introduced its popular Kroger Plus loyalty program in 1997, and more than 60 million households are enrolled today. Membership unlocks special pricing, fuel discounts, digital offers and more, including the chance to direct a portion of the company\u2019s charitable giving to local non-profits through Kroger Community Rewards.\n\nCustomer feedback shows the strength of our loyalty program: 82% of members are satisfied with the program, and 79% agree it helps them save money. Kroger\u2019s loyalty program was ranked #1 in the Grocery & Drug sector in The Loyalty Report\u2122 2022 by Bond Brand Loyalty.\n\nCustomer Insights\nKroger\u2019s Net Promoter Scores\u00ae\u2014measures of customer and stakeholder approval\u2014continue to improve for both in-store shopping and Pickup services, reflecting ongoing improvements in wait times, items in stock and customer service. Social listening capabilities help us monitor how customers talk about Kroger on social media across a range of topics. Satisfaction surveys and purchasing insights\u2014using proprietary 84.51\u00b0 data science and tools\u2014also inform improvements in service, product quality and item assortment. We apply customer equity capabilities to understand how Kroger is perceived relative to our competitors, and we continue to see improvement in areas like digital, fresh items and personalization.\n\nBoost by Kroger\nIn 2022, we announced the national launch of Boost by Kroger, the latest expansion of our industry-leading loyalty program. For either $59 or $99 per year, Boost provides customers with benefits like unlimited free delivery on orders of $35 or more and two Fuel Points for every $1 spent on groceries and general merchandise purchases through Delivery, Pickup and in stores. Kroger estimates the membership can save customers more than $1,000 per year on grocery delivery and fuel.\n\nThe national launch follows several months of Boost pilots in four retail divisions. The tests resulted in a growing number of new members and a significant increase in delivery sales compared to non-Boost divisions.\n\nThrough Boost, we are uniquely positioned to make grocery delivery accessible to more customers through the industry\u2019s most affordable grocery delivery membership program.\n\nKitchen United MIX\nDuring the past year, Kroger extended our reach into the food-away-from-home market with the introduction of Kitchen United MIX. These kitchens are virtual food courts located inside the grocery store, giving customers even more options for fresh, on-demand meals. Ordering is available via on-site digital kiosks, online at KitchenUnited.com or through the Kitchen United MIX app for Kroger customers in multiple markets, including Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles.\nAssociate Health & Safety\n\nKeeping stores open and stocked through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic while protecting our associates\u2019 and customers\u2019 health and safety continues to be our top priority. We believe managing personal health and safety is critical to our associates\u2019 safety and our company\u2019s success.\n\nKroger\u2019s operating unit leaders and executive leadership team are responsible for our management approach to associate health and safety, with additional oversight from the Public Responsibilities Committee of the board. Each business unit\u2014Retail Operations, Supply Chain and corporate administration\u2014follows an established approach to help protect associates\u2019 health and safety.\n\nIn 2021, Kroger combined the Manufacturing and Logistics functions into one integrated Supply Chain team. Within this new function, a centralized team is leading work to clarify roles and refine standards, reporting metrics and audit procedures.\n\nOSHA Standards\n\nKroger follows established policies and standards to meet or exceed relevant Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements, including comprehensive hazard communications and lockout/tagout plans, as well as guidelines for emergency evacuation, personal safety and personal protective equipment.\n\nIn 2021, OSHA reportable incident and lost-day rates improved for both associates and contractors versus the prior year.\n\nWe actively monitored COVID-19 cases and case rates among our associates and offered priority access to, and encouraged widespread adoption of, COVID-19 vaccinations when available.\n\nWhere needed, we continued to deploy online training for OSHA safety requirements last year to enable associates to complete required training virtually where classroom-style learning was restricted.\n\nFind more details about our safety performance in the Appendix.\n\nRetail Stores\n\nIn the first half of 2022, we introduced a new safety program\u2014AllSafe!\u2014for associates in all retail stores, with plans to expand to other facilities in the second half of the year. The program is designed to increase associates\u2019 awareness and attention to personal safety and well-being.\n\nAllSafe! is grounded in four principles:\n\n- Nothing we do is worth risking injury.\n- Accidents can be prevented.\n- Safety will be managed.\n- Safe behavior is a condition of employment for all associates.\n\nKroger has detailed requirements and processes in place to prevent, review and address safety concerns in stores. Through clearly communicated expectations, routine monitoring and regular safety behavior training and reinforcement, we continue to reduce the number of injuries and accidents in our stores.\n\nDedicated on-site safety teams meet routinely to review recent injury root causes and safety audit results, and to resolve any issues. Associate health and safety policies and practices follow our established management approach:\n\n- AllSafe! teams\n- Department-specific safety requirements\n- Associate safety training and education\n- Safety 360\u00b0 injury analysis and corrective action through a centralized Enterprise Compliance Management System\n- Safety observations and peer feedback\n\nSupply Chain\n\nLeaders also focus on measures to improve associates\u2019 health and safety at Kroger-operated food processing facilities, distribution centers and dedicated fulfillment centers, and in transit between locations. Later this year, an existing program for manufacturing with Safety in Motion\u00ae, Inc. will be extended and customized to support Kroger\u2019s new integrated Supply Chain function, adding the former fleet and transportation teams.\n\nKroger also expects third-party contractors supporting supply chain operations to uphold the same worker health and safety standards. With the expansion of Kroger Delivery, we developed additional training resources to help keep associates safe in the dedicated fulfillment centers and while driving orders to and from our customers\u2019 homes.\n\nThe Ocado Group is responsible for training and promoting health and safety for workers maintaining their proprietary robotics system at these automated fulfillment centers.\n\nReinforcing Safety\n\nThe events of the past two years have placed safety in a whole new light for everyone, including Kroger. From the pandemic and civil unrest to senseless acts of violence, we are reminded that incidents putting personal safety at risk can happen at any time and anywhere.\n\nWe continued to provide emotional support and resources throughout the year, including 24/7 access to the Well-Being Assistant, powered by Magellan, which offers confidential services and up to six free counseling sessions.\n\nWe also required all associates to carefully review a Personal Safety training program first introduced company-wide several years ago. We achieved a 98% completion rate for Personal Safety awareness training in 2021.\nCommunity Engagement\n\nKroger\u2019s goal is to be a trusted and welcome partner in the communities we call home. Our business and Corporate Affairs leaders proactively engage public officials and other community stakeholders to understand priorities, listen to concerns and help address unique local needs. Leaders often serve as non-profit board members and volunteer time in ways that align with our mission. Please find additional details in our Community Engagement Policy.\n\nKroger\u2019s management approach to community engagement is led by a centralized Corporate Affairs function with oversight from the Public Responsibilities Committee of the board. Corporate Affairs leaders engage stakeholders at national and local levels, lead public policy advocacy and advance positive social impact in our communities.\n\nIn 2021, in-kind product donations for hunger relief and nutrition support were supplemented by corporate donations and grants from Kroger, The Kroger Co. Foundation, our private foundation; and The Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation, a registered public charity. We strategically focused giving to help organizations provide meals and nutrition as the pandemic continued throughout a second year.\n\nWe also engage customers in our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste mission. We offer our customers and other stakeholders easy ways to give back by rounding up their purchase to the nearest dollar to benefit The Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation when they shop, or by donating directly in-store or online.\n\nFor more details on our philanthropic grant-making, please see The Kroger Co. Foundation\u2019s 2022 Report and The Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation\u2019s 2022 Report.\n\nRacial Equity Fund\n\nThe Kroger Co. Foundation\u2019s Racial Equity Fund, established in 2020, aims to expand opportunities for underrepresented groups across the U.S. To date, the fund has directed a total of $5.1 million in grants to non-profit organizations advancing meaningful change at the national and local levels.\n\nIn 2021, the foundation awarded a total of $11 million in grants to community organizations in Ohio and Tennessee. These grants build on $3 million in previously awarded funding to Black Girl Ventures, Everytable, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and Thurgood Marshall College Fund. Earlier this year, the Racial Equity Fund also directed $1 million to The Asian American Foundation.\n\nFor more details, see The Kroger Co. Foundation\u2019s 2022 Report.\n\nSupporting the Military\n\nKroger has a long-standing relationship with the United Service Organizations (USO), which provides essential support and services for our nation\u2019s active-duty military service men and women and their families. The Kroger family of companies is the largest cumulative donor in the USO\u2019s history, with financial support totaling more than $35 million since 2010.\n\nIn early 2022, we introduced a mobile kitchen unit that will travel across the country to military training and mission locations, as well as rapid-response deployments, to help nourish military service members and communities experiencing natural disasters.\n\nThese units will also deliver pop-up programming with food, games and amenities and invite our customers to help keep our heroes in uniform strong. Two more mobile kitchen units will be on the road by the end of 2023.\nOverview\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\nSince 1883, we have taken pride in bringing diverse teams with a passion for food and people together with a common goal to fulfill Our Purpose\u2014To Feed the Human Spirit. With a long history of service and innovation, we work tirelessly to create memorable experiences for our customers, our communities and each other, with food at the heart of it all.\n\nKroger\u2019s Chief People Officer leads Human Resources & Labor Relations, which focuses on advancing our human capital management strategy to support personal and company success. This function\u2014with human resources professionals in place across our business and retail divisions\u2014advocates for a rewarding associate experience that reflects our long-standing Values. A Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) team also monitors and measures progress on human capital management metrics and identifies opportunities for improvement.\n\nA dedicated People Analytics team within the Human Resources & Labor Relations function is responsible for analyzing and reporting key information about our workforce, including demographics, hiring, training and advancement, engagement, and turnover. The board\u2019s Compensation & Talent Development Committee oversees progress on human capital management topics, including DEI.\n\nKroger has publicly disclosed our 2020 and 2021 EEO-1 reports. View our 2021 EEO-1 report.\n\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nKroger strives to attract, retain and develop leaders and associates who best reflect our communities. Because of our unique business model, we help unlock economic opportunity for nearly half a million people of various ages and aspirations, from those wanting an entry-level part-time job to graduate-degree specialists across corporate functions.\n\nWe also aim to develop diverse leaders to increasing levels of responsibility. For open leadership positions, we assemble a diverse slate of candidates for consideration. In 2022, every manager across the company is expected to actively mentor and develop an associate who has a different background than them. This, along with other goals and objectives, is used to assess the manager\u2019s performance and ultimately affects their compensation. Currently, over 80% of retail division executive leadership teams have at least one diverse leader.\n\nTo help ensure we are developing a diverse talent pipeline, we increased our strategic partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs). This includes partnerships with diversity networks, military organizations, neurodiverse groups, second-chance employment organizations and other groups.\nOur Framework for Action: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Promotes Positive Change in Our Workplace & Communities\n\nWe introduced Kroger\u2019s Framework for Action: DEI in 2020, and spent much of last year bringing it to life. In 2021, we extended the reach of Inclusive Leader and Unconscious Bias training as well as mentorship opportunities to build stronger relationships and accelerate associate development.\n\nCreate More Inclusive Culture\n- Created a DEI Advisory Council to advance our long-term commitments, reporting to senior leadership\n- Offered Unconscious Bias training to every leader in 2020 and DEI training for every associate in 2021\n\nDevelop Diverse Talent\n- 46% of executives, directors and above and 50% of division presidents are diverse by gender or race\n- Partnering with 44 HBCUs, HSIs and community colleges to expand diverse talent recruiting\n- Established two-way mentorship and advocacy program between high-potential diverse talent and senior leaders\n\nAdvance Diverse Partnerships\n- Set goal to increase spend with diverse suppliers from $3.4B to $10B by 2030; achieved $4B in 2021\n- Ensuring our media partners align with Our Values and that we reach diverse customers through our marketing spend, partners and strategy\n\nAdvance Equitable Communities\n- Deploying funds to support impactful approaches to advance racial equity with community partners\n- Encouraging associates to vote and providing voter registration/ballot applications in stores\n\nListen Deeply and Report Progress\n- Engaging external stakeholders to seek perspectives and co-create more just and equitable communities\n- Providing associates with platforms to continue sharing their stories and feedback with our leaders\n- Disclosing EEO-1 data\n\nA More Inclusive Culture\nKroger designed and launched several diversity-focused learning and development opportunities for associates to help advance DEI, including Inclusive Leader, Unconscious Bias, and Inclusion and Belonging training. In 2020, 96% of Kroger leaders completed Unconscious Bias training; in 2021, we expanded Inclusion and Belonging training to all associates, with over 494,000 associates completing one or more DEI courses.\n\nKroger has an internal DEI Advisory Council made up of cross-functional leaders who are committed to advancing progress. The Council works closely with senior officers and business leaders to identify opportunities and specific actions for improvement. An Associate Influencer Group comprising hourly associates helps facilitate input and feedback from all company levels.\n\nKroger also offers 13 Associate Resource Groups (ARGs), or affinity groups, for our people, with chapters across the company. These groups enable personal connections across the Kroger family of companies, influence business decisions, lift up shared experiences, encourage cross-ARG membership for awareness and promote personal and professional growth. Kroger leaders sponsor and personally engage with the ARGs, which include these communities:\n- African American\n- Asian\n- ITOPiA (embracing all personality types)\n- KePasa\n- Men for Equality\n- Our Abilities\n- Parents\n- Pride\n- Prime Timers\n- Veterans\n- Wellness\n- Women\u2019s EDGE\n- Young Professionals\nDeveloping Allies\n\nOur commitment includes creating a welcoming work environment for all associates. We created a series of Allyship Guides for our associates and customers to help advance inclusion for the LGBTQ+, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Hispanic Heritage and African American communities. These guides are intended to increase awareness and encourage associates to respect the differences among us.\n\nKroger earned a top score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index\u2014an annual assessment of LGBTQ+ workplace equality\u2014for the fourth year in a row. We provide same-sex partner benefits and transgender-inclusive healthcare for our associates. We also work with the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce to create and enhance relationships with LGBTQ+ suppliers as part of our Supplier Inclusion program.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, Kroger was named among the Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, earning a score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index.\n\nElaine Chao, former U.S. Secretary of Transportation and U.S. Secretary of Labor and current member of Kroger\u2019s Public Responsibilities Committee of the board, recently joined a meeting of the Asian ARG.\n2021 Workforce Overview\n\nDiversity in Our Workforce\n\n|                  | 2020  | 2021  |\n|------------------|-------|-------|\n| White Women      | 31.6% | 31.0% |\n| Women of Color   | 19.3% | 19.5% |\n| White Men        | 30.6% | 30.5% |\n| Men of Color     | 18.5% | 19.0% |\n\n|                  | Full time | Part time | Total  |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Women            | 88,542    | 125,188   | 213,730|\n| Men              | 94,177    | 115,740   | 209,917|\n| Total            | 182,719   | 240,928   | 423,647|\n\nReflecting Our Communities\n\nOur goal is to shift the demographic representation of women and people of color at the company and local levels to reflect our changing country, communities and local neighborhoods.\n\n|                          | United States Population | Kroger Operating Area Population | 2021 Total Kroger Associates |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| White or Caucasian       | 61.8%                    | 55.4%                           | 61.6%                        |\n| Hispanic or Latino       | 18.0%                    | 21.9%                           | 13.7%                        |\n| Black or African American| 11.9%                    | 12.6%                           | 15.0%                        |\n| Asian or Asian American  | 5.1%                     | 6.8%                            | 3.7%                         |\n| Other                    | 3.2%                     | 3.3%                            | 6.0%                         |\n\nSince 2018, our incremental wage investments total $1.2B\n\nAverage hourly compensation includes comprehensive benefits\n\n| Year | Average Hourly Compensation |\n|------|-----------------------------|\n| 2017 | $17.56                      |\n| 2018 | $18.36                      |\n| 2019 | $19.10                      |\n| 2020 | $19.67                      |\n| 2021 | $22.11                      |\n\n25.9% increase in average hourly compensation since 2017\n\nDiversity in Our Leadership Roles\n\n- White women\n- Women of color\n- White men\n- Men of color\n\n- 67% of all Department Leaders are women or people of color, +0.6 ppts vs. 2020\n- 57% of all Assistant Store Leaders are women or people of color, +0.5 ppts vs. 2020\n- 50% of all Store Leaders are women or people of color, +2.3 ppts vs. 2020\n\nppts = percentage points\n\n11. 2021 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates\n12. Kroger data as of fourth quarter of fiscal 2021\nTalent Attraction & Retention\n\nWe strive to connect meaningfully with our associates throughout their employment journey by providing valuable opportunities to learn, grow and advance. This begins with a consistent and effective onboarding experience and continues through ongoing connections with every associate to support performance and development.\n\nThe company\u2019s Human Resources & Labor Relations team manages recruiting and retention efforts, with oversight from the board\u2019s Compensation & Talent Development Committee.\n\nListening plays a critical role in our ability to retain and develop our associates. We gather feedback throughout the year in a variety of forms, including our annual Associate Insights survey. We typically have a high survey participation rate and share results widely. In 2021, the company-wide engagement score was 54, a six-point decrease from 2020.\n\nWe take this decline in scores seriously. Since receiving the results, we have developed and activated more than 12,000 site- and team-based plans to address the key areas identified by the survey, including enhancing associate well-being.\n\nEmployer of Choice\n\nWe aim to cultivate a work environment where all associates can thrive. This includes delivering exceptional experiences that support our associates\u2019 physical, mental and financial well-being.\n\nA key component of these efforts is the ongoing refinement of our highly competitive Total Rewards programs, which include compensation, healthcare benefits, retirement benefits and perks available to all associates, including those represented by collective bargaining agreements. We offer competitive benefits and pay in our stores, distribution centers, dedicated fulfillment centers, manufacturing plants, technology hubs and corporate offices.\n\nWe help associates progress by developing skills that support them in their current roles and prepare them to take the next step in their careers. Over the past year, we invested in our associates more than ever before by expanding our comprehensive benefits, including enhancements in continuing education benefits to make new associates eligible sooner.\n\nMental and emotional well-being are critical priorities as we strive to deliver an exceptional associate experience. In 2021, we accelerated efforts in this space, focusing first on our leaders of others to better enable them to support their associates and create a safe and supportive environment within their teams. We continue to assess our ways of working, policies and benefits to more effectively meet associate needs and help them prioritize their own well-being while also supporting each other.\n\nKroger continues to evolve who we are as an employer of choice and how we engage to attract top talent. As part of our Framework for Action, we are increasing partnerships with minority business accelerators and academic institutions, including HBCUs and HSIs, to enhance diversity and help ensure we reflect the communities we serve.\n\nWe also continue to expand our New Beginnings program, which offers second-chance employment opportunities for individuals with non-violent criminal backgrounds. The program currently operates in six manufacturing locations and one distribution center.\nAssociate Training & Education\n\nKroger offers a range of comprehensive training opportunities for all leaders and associates, from entry-level new hires to corporate and business leaders. In 2021, we brought training to our associates\u2019 fingertips with Fresh Start.\n\nFresh Start is a microlearning app, available on shared company-owned devices or associates\u2019 personal devices. It provides quick and effective training to frontline associates in an engaging format, helping them develop important skills over the course of a day.\n\nThis new tool, along with our traditional training modalities, allows us to deliver a wide variety of information and learning to our associates at all levels of the company, including role-based training and courses centered on DEI, associate well-being and safety.\n\nTuition Assistance\n\nOur industry-leading continuing education assistance benefit offers up to $3,500 annually (and up to $21,000 over the course of a career) to help associates continually develop their skills. All part-time and full-time associates are eligible after six months of service.\n\nSince inception, the program has directed over $27 million in tuition reimbursements to help nearly 6,000 associates. More than 3,000 associates, 90% of whom are hourly, participated in the program last year, with reimbursements totaling $12.1 million, a $5 million increase over 2020.\n\nTo learn more about our continued commitment to the growth and development of our associates, visit Life at Kroger.\n\nLabor Relations\n\nCollective bargaining agreements are a regular part of our business. Wages, healthcare and pensions are included in collective bargaining agreements that cover many of our associates. These contracts are regularly negotiated by Kroger\u2019s team of labor negotiators and advisers, who follow a process and take a measured approach to each.\n\nApproximately 64% of our associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions. There are 354 such agreements, usually with terms of three to five years.\n\nWages at Kroger grew before and during the pandemic. We committed to significant associate wage investments when we introduced our Restock Kroger plan in late 2017. Since then, Kroger has invested an incremental $1.2 billion in associate hourly wages and training over the last four years, including more than $450 million in 2021.\n\nIn addition, we invested more than $2 billion during the same time period to help address underfunding and better secure pensions for tens of thousands of associates. Kroger also provides affordable, high-quality healthcare benefits to eligible associates, investing $1.2 billion annually for their health and wellness benefits.\n\nThis investment in wages has boosted our average hourly wage to more than $17, up from $15.50 the prior year. With comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is more than $22 an hour.\n\nWe have been transparent with local unions that represent many of our associates to help ensure they understand the importance of growing our business.

We are focused on addressing our climate impacts and supporting resource conservation by eliminating food and operational waste, increasing efficiency across our company and boosting the sustainability and resilience of our supply chain.\n\nIn This Section\n\n36 Climate Impact\n40 Resource Conservation\nClimate change can affect our operations and supply chain, much like Kroger impacts a changing climate as a result of our GHG emissions. We are taking steps to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nClimate Impact\n\nClimate Governance\n\nThe Public Responsibilities Committee of the board reviews and guides the company\u2019s actions pertaining to responsible corporate citizenship, including climate impacts management.\n\nWithin the company, multiple teams implement our climate strategy, including Corporate Affairs, Retail Operations, Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Sourcing and Finance teams.\n\nClimate Strategy\n\nManaging climate impacts is a core tenet of our ESG strategy. Our climate strategy includes the goals we set, the actions we take to achieve our goals, and our assessment of climate risks and opportunities. We are implementing this strategy by increasing business integration of ESG topics; solidifying the business and financial planning needed to achieve our GHG-reduction goal; and continually assessing how a changing climate, evolving stakeholder expectations and other risks impact our business.\n\nClimate Risk Management\n\nIn 2021, we conducted our first quantitative climate risk assessment to determine the likelihood that different physical climate risks, including drought, extreme heat and extreme precipitation, would impact Kroger\u2019s operations at representative facilities in different geographies and, in turn, potentially increase operating costs for these facilities.\n\nWe used climate modeling in three scenarios, reflecting different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): median under 2\u00b0C (cool RCP 4.5 models), 2\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C (warm RCP 4.5 models) and over 4\u00b0C (RCP 8.5 models). These were taken from the 1/16th degree localized constructive analogs (LOCA) climate dataset for 2030 and 2050 time frames.\n\nFor each of the identified physical climate risks, we identified a financial metric to help contextualize the business impacts of the modeled physical climate risks, recognizing the limitations of such metrics to capture the entire financial impacts of climate risks over time. We considered whether these risks would have a substantive impact on our financial performance, and at this time, do not anticipate the modeled physical risks pose a substantive financial threat to our own operations.\n\nMoving forward, we will revisit this analysis periodically for our own operations and plan to expand it to include a climate risk assessment using scenario modeling for select parts of our supply chain.\n\nTo help prepare for and manage physical climate risks, including natural disasters and business disruptions to our supply chains, we maintain more than 200 business continuity plans. We have installed technologies and processes to ensure our stores, plants and distribution network can respond quickly and remain operational.\n\nWe monitor energy availability and costs to help anticipate how changing climate patterns like increasing temperatures could affect our energy-sourcing costs and activities.\n\nWe also assess the transitional climate risks due to refrigerant legislation. As a result of forthcoming state and federal requirements regarding the phase down of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants, we anticipate steadily replacing refrigerant infrastructure in the Kroger portfolio of stores to reach required levels, which could incur significant costs to grocery retailers like Kroger.\n\nOur stakeholder engagement and market research help us understand how consumers, investors and others may be thinking about a changing climate. For example, Kroger is launching multiple products with lower carbon impacts, like upcycled grains, carbon-neutral eggs and carbon-reduced chicken.\n\n2021 Highlights\n\n-9.1% change in GHG emissions since 2018 (goal baseline)\n\n52.3% cumulative electricity avoided in supermarkets (compared to 2010 baseline)\n\n-0.77% annual change in electricity consumed in Manufacturing\n\n-1.03% annual change in natural gas consumed in Manufacturing\n\n2,000 stores using infrared refrigerant leak-detection technology\nClimate Targets\n\nIn 2020, we set a goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions from our operations by 30% by 2030 against a 2018 baseline.\n\nThe goal was developed using climate science, supporting a well-below-2\u00b0C climate scenario according to the absolute contraction method.\n\nGiven the global consensus that more urgent climate action is needed, and increasing indications from stakeholders like investors that companies are expected to take meaningful action on climate change, we have committed to set a goal aligned with the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative. This includes resetting our current Scope 1 and 2 emissions goal to support the 1.5-degree scenario and setting a brand new Scope 3 emissions goal. We will focus on this priority in 2022 and 2023, and will include a progress update in our 2023 ESG Report.\n\nCurrently, Kroger\u2019s ESG, business unit and Finance teams are developing the tactical and financial roadmap for our GHG-reduction goal. We plan to publish our GHG Goal Roadmap by the end of 2022.\n\nAdditional targets and commitments that can help reduce Kroger\u2019s GHG emissions include our No-Deforestation Commitment, zero-waste goals, water-reduction target and sustainable packaging goals.\n\nEmissions Disclosure\n\nKroger\u2019s GHG emissions for 2021 are summarized below, with more details provided in the Appendix of this report and our latest CDP Climate response. Kroger uses the GHG Protocol methodology to calculate our GHG emissions.\n\nEmissions performance trends are as follows:\n\n- **Scope 1 emissions** increased by 11.2% compared to the previous year. Of this, mobile emissions increased most significantly, primarily as a result of an improved data collection process, which allows for more frequent and accurate data capture. Stationary combustion and refrigerant emissions both increased just slightly. Refrigerant emissions changes vary widely by type of refrigerant\u2014and in some cases, the increase is the result of transitioning away from ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), which are not reported in GHG inventories, to alternatives that are reported.\n\n- **Scope 2 emissions** decreased by 8% (market-based) and 9% (location-based) compared to the previous year. This was achieved through energy-efficiency and energy-reduction projects, increased procurement of renewable energy through utility providers, and changes in emissions factors.\n\n- **Scope 3 emissions** increased by 14.5% compared to the previous year. Increases in employee commuting and business travel were the largest contributor to this change, as Kroger associates continued to return to work in our offices and business travel resumed.\n\nOur normalized emissions (per 1,000 square feet) decreased from 23.41 to 22.94.13 From our 2018 GHG-reduction target baseline to 2021, Kroger\u2019s total Scope 1 and 2 emissions (market-based) decreased by 9.1%.\n\n| Total Carbon Emissions (Scope 1 and 2; market-based)\u2014MTCO2e | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| 5,774,060 (baseline)                                          | 5,967,865 | 5,275,845 | 5,251,448 |\n\nMTCO2e = metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\n\n13. This calculation has been adjusted for 2020 and 2021 to reflect market-based Scope 2 emissions (previously, it reflected location-based Scope 2 emissions)\nEmissions-Reduction Opportunities\n\nTo meet our emissions-reduction targets, our engineering teams identify, evaluate and implement projects, both short- and long-term, to reduce our energy consumption, to move to lower-carbon energy sources and to reduce excess emissions. Saving energy and reducing emissions can also help us decrease operating costs and offset upfront investment costs. Kroger teams often pilot new technologies to gauge their effectiveness in our retail, manufacturing and distribution network. Our forthcoming GHG Goal Roadmap will summarize our goal governance process and how we anticipate achieving our goal, including the types of emissions-reduction opportunities that will help chart the way.\n\nEnergy Management in Our Facilities\n\nWe track our electricity and natural gas consumption company-wide through the EnergyCAP platform. We use the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ENERGY STAR\u00ae platform for our stores to benchmark against the industry and identify new opportunities for energy savings. So far, 13 of our manufacturing plants have installed energy management systems to identify anomalies and energy-reduction opportunities.\n\nIn 2021, we continued placing glass doors on open refrigerated cases in our stores, saving on average 225,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity and 16,000 therms of natural gas per store annually. We anticipate completing this work in relevant stores in our fleet. In 2021, we replaced 120 trucks with new units.\n\nAs a long-time Partner of the U.S. EPA SmartWay program, we reduce truck miles and emissions through dynamic routing, limiting truck speed, automatic shutdown for truck idling and automatic transmissions to manage gear splits.\n\nReducing Emissions from Refrigerants\n\nA well-managed refrigerant inventory reduces waste and costs, and ensures responsible reclaim practices. During the last decade, we nearly completed the transition away from ODSs toward other refrigerants across our systems, primarily by switching to HFCs, hydrofluorocarbons and ammonia. In our stores, we use a four-pronged approach:\n\n- Proactive leak monitoring, mitigation and reduction\n- Replacing aging refrigeration systems to improve energy efficiency and reduce refrigerant charge/emissions\n- Proper management of refrigerant inventory, to reduce waste and ensure responsible reclaim practices\n- Transition to refrigerants with lower global warming potential (GWP)\n\nKroger is part of the EPA GreenChill program, through which we set annual targets to reduce refrigerant emissions in retail stores. For 2021, we set a goal to reduce our refrigerant leak rate by 10%. The achieved reduction was 1%, though we have reduced our refrigerant emissions in retail stores by 26% since joining GreenChill in 2014.\n\nKroger\u2019s Refrigerant Management Policy for our stores outlines the company\u2019s procedures and documentation for all refrigerant gas handling. Kroger has a zero-tolerance leak-rate policy to ensure refrigerant is not added to equipment until any leaks are fixed, regardless of the system or the size of the leak. All relevant associates and technicians must read, sign and adhere to the policy.\n\nWe are actively transitioning stores to use new infrared detectors that identify lower concentrations of leaked refrigerants, with the goal of transitioning all stores by 2023. To date, approximately 2,000 stores use this new technology.\n\nWe continue to transition to lower-GWP refrigerants as they become commercially available and economically viable, to meet our GHG-reduction target and to meet forthcoming state and federal requirements.\n\nStarting in California, we will ultimately achieve a portfolio GWP of under 1,400 by 2030, which translates to an approximately 15% reduction in baseline company-wide refrigerant emissions. We are developing our strategy for aligning with forthcoming federal HFC phase-down requirements under the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, which will occur across the business in our stores, distribution centers, manufacturing plants and fleet.\n\nWe already use ammonia refrigerant systems in about three-quarters of our manufacturing plants and 20 of our distribution centers. Between 2022 and 2024, we plan to build seven new retail stores using carbon dioxide (CO2) refrigerant technology. Transitioning to this ultra-low GWP refrigerant has the potential to reduce per-store emissions by more than 200 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) annually.\n\nFuel-Efficient Logistics\n\nIn our supply chain, we continue to refresh our truck fleet, replacing older vehicles with more fuel-efficient models. Trucks typically have a lifespan of eight years in our fleet. In 2021, we replaced 120 trucks with new units.\n\nTo meet our emissions-reduction targets, our engineering teams identify, evaluate and implement projects, both short- and long-term, to reduce our energy consumption, to move to lower-carbon energy sources and to reduce excess emissions.

Transitioning to this ultra-low GWP refrigerant has the potential to reduce per-store emissions by more than 200 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) annually.\nTransitioning to Renewables\n\nTo date, we have installed solar arrays at 15 facilities, which generated 12.8 million kWh of renewable power in 2021, of which 5.7 million kWh is claimed by Kroger as zero-carbon energy in our GHG emissions. We also operate two facilities equipped with anaerobic digestion (AD) technology, which processes food waste or food production by-products into biogas, which in turn can be used to produce renewable electricity to replace electricity consumed from the grid.\n\nIn 2021, Kroger purchased approximately 1 million megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable, zero-carbon power from our energy providers. This includes power purchased proactively by Kroger as well as power consumed in markets with state renewable energy portfolio standard compliance requirements. Currently, we are making renewable power purchases from solar projects in Texas and Virginia. We will activate additional renewable power purchases in Cincinnati, the broader Electric Reliability Council of Texas, and PJM Interconnection for Illinois, Ohio, Maryland and Washington, D.C. geographies in 2023 and 2024.\n\nOur expanding renewable energy purchases are aligned with the company\u2019s internal renewable energy sourcing policy, which was approved by Kroger\u2019s Energy Committee and Chief Financial Officer in 2021.\n\nElectrifying Vehicles in Our Network\n\nOver the past several years, all new refrigerated trucks in California serving our Ralphs division have been hybrid electric/diesel trailers, which can be plugged in when stationary and can run partially off electricity to reduce diesel emissions. We plan to begin testing electric, on-highway vehicles\u2014including tractors, yard tractors and Kroger Delivery vans\u2014in 2022 and 2023.\n\nKroger is also increasing the availability of electric vehicle (EV) chargers for customers across our retail store footprint. We are working with multiple national service providers to install EV infrastructure in a growing number of states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. We expect to expand into several additional Midwestern states in the coming years. Our infrastructure includes a growing percentage of new direct current (DC) super-fast chargers capable of generating 350kW\u2014several times more power than typical fast chargers\u2014in an effort to offer sustainable and convenient services to our customers.\nFood Waste\n\nAs part of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan, we are committed to diverting 95% or more of food waste from landfill company-wide by 2025. Our Corporate Affairs team has shaped our zero-waste strategy in partnership with leaders in Retail Operations, Manufacturing and Supply Chain who bring our strategy to life.\n\nTogether with Feeding America, Kroger introduced our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Food Rescue program over 10 years ago. Today, we coordinate with hunger-relief organizations across our communities to direct safe, healthy surplus food to those in need. In 2021, we donated 94 million pounds of surplus food to Feeding America\u2019s network of food banks and agency partners.\n\nCurrently, we have food waste recycling programs in 2,539 stores (up from 2,407 in 2020). This represents 92% of our store footprint, and we aim to launch a food-waste recycling program in 95% or more of stores.\n\nWe measure and track food waste annually. With support from World Wildlife Fund (WWF), we established our food-waste footprint several years ago using the World Resources Institute (WRI)\u2019s Food Loss & Waste Protocol.\n\nIn the last year, total food waste generated in Kroger-operated stores increased slightly by 0.42% to 269,382 tons (from 268,248 tons in 2020), while the percentage of food waste diverted from landfill improved by 0.5 percentage points, to 48.8% (from 48.3% in 2020).\n\nSince 2017, our baseline year, we have decreased total food waste generated in our stores by 18.9% and improved our food-waste diversion rate by 21.7 percentage points.\n\nThe GHG impacts of these improvements are also notable. As a result of diverting 131,400 tons of retail food waste from landfill in 2021, we are avoiding an estimated 825,427 metric tons of CO2e emissions.\n\nIn 2020, Kroger launched our cohort of suppliers as part of the WRI\u2019s 10x20x30 initiative. We continue to use this group of committed companies (as well as the Pacific Coast Food Waste Commitment on the West Coast) as pre-competitive forums to share best practices from members and industry experts in support of our collective goals.\n### Food Waste Management Data\n\n| Destination                  | Food (Short Tons) | Inedible Parts (Short Tons) | Total  |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|--------|\n| Animal feed                  | 48,188            | 10,727                     | 58,914 |\n| Anaerobic digestion          | 29,519            | -                          | 29,519 |\n| Composting                   | 20,976            | -                          | 20,976 |\n| Biodiesel production         | -                 | 21,991                     | 21,991 |\n| Landfill                     | 112,929           | 25,054                     | 137,983|\n| **Total**                    | **211,611**       | **57,771**                 | **269,382**|\n\n### Where Is Our Food Waste Going?\n\n| Year          | Landfill Diverted | Food Waste Generated |\n|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| 2017 Baseline | 72.9%             | 27.1%                |\n| 2018 Progress | 60.3%             | 39.7%                |\n| 2019 Progress | 55.3%             | 44.7%                |\n| 2020 Progress | 51.7%             | 48.3%                |\n| 2021 Progress | 51.2%             | 48.8%                |\n| 2025 Target   | 95%               | 5%                   |\n\nNotes:\n- Food loss diversion data reflects data collected from stores on their composting, animal feed, fat/bone and used cooking oil recycling programs.\n- The landfill metric shared here is estimated using data captured and synthesized from annual waste audits conducted in a subset of our stores.\n- Harris Teeter data is included in landfill and food diversion, but is not included in inedible parts diversion due to insufficient data.\n- The bar length for annual progress is proportional relative to the bar length of the 2017 baseline.\n- Data reflects calendar year.\n- 2021 performance reflects store-level data for animal feed, anaerobic digestion and composting programs.\n- Table may not sum due to rounding.\nOperational Waste\n\nWe remain committed to achieving zero waste and steadily improving how we manage the waste materials produced throughout our operations. This includes identifying opportunities for increased recycling and reuse. At the same time, we look for ways to use materials more efficiently to reduce waste production to begin with.\n\nOur zero-waste commitments are driven by business leaders and associates across our facilities. Implementation of zero-waste initiatives in our stores is overseen by store managers. Each retail division also has an Expense, Sanitation and Sustainability Manager, who supports in-store waste management. Similarly, our Supply Chain and Manufacturing teams have sustainability leads, who help guide waste-reduction and -recovery initiatives in these facilities.\n\nIn 2021, our company-wide waste-diversion rate was 79%, which represents a decrease of 2 percentage points from 2020. The total waste generated by our operations before accounting for reductions decreased by about 1%, and we saw increases in food donation and planning to pilot solutions that are more sustainable and also cost-conscious and convenient for our customers.\n\nWe remain focused on achieving our 90% diversion rate by 2025. In 2022, we are expanding our training resources and revising our back-of-store signage for food rescue and recycling programs to further enhance clarity on program mechanics and increase engagement in the program. We are also advancing automated solutions to track program impacts and communicate progress to our associates in real time.\n\nKroger responsibly manages hazardous waste where it is generated in our operations. Across our stores, we manage all damaged and unsalable products that have hazardous characteristics, store-use chemicals with hazardous characteristics and non-hazardous liquid wastes. Universal waste lamps, batteries and all pharmaceuticals are also part of our waste management programs.\n\nThe UL WERCSmart\u00ae system allows us to identify hazardous materials in our products to help ensure safe storage, transportation and disposal. Associates use WERCSmart information fed to them through Kroger\u2019s Hazardous Product Compliance System to identify proper handling procedures. Products are sorted and stored in totes, according to material. They\u2019re then properly collected and disposed of by vendors. Similarly, our plants and logistics facilities work with third-party providers for safe management of any hazardous materials in their operations.\n\nKroger remains committed to phasing out single-use plastic shopping bags from our retail network. We are the grocery sector lead for the Beyond the Bag Initiative of the Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag. Using learnings from this multi-stakeholder effort as well as our own insights, we are identifying, evaluating and planning to pilot solutions that are more sustainable and also cost-conscious and convenient for our customers.\n\n### Operational Waste\n\n| Method                  | 2019 Weight (Short Tons) | 2020 Weight (Short Tons) | 2021 Weight (Short Tons) | 2020 to 2021 Year-Over-Year Change (%) |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Waste reduction         | 123,000                  | 207,468                  | 134,500                  | -35.2%                                 |\n| Donation                | 55,084                   | 41,002                   | 47,249                   | +15.2%                                 |\n| Animal feed             | 108,036                  | 86,644                   | 81,712                   | -5.7%                                  |\n| Anaerobic digestion     | 76,210                   | 102,491                  | 81,600                   | -20.4%                                 |\n| Composting              | 15,870                   | 27,475                   | 41,004                   | +49.2%                                 |\n| Recycling               | 1,955,627                | 1,994,510                | 1,930,830                | -3.2%                                  |\n| Cardboard               | 803,210                  | 865,807                  | 887,604                  | +2.5%                                  |\n| Plastic                 | 26,864                   | 28,908                   | 33,187                   | +14.8%                                 |\n| Waste-to-energy         | 7,417                    | 12,540                   | 34,783                   | +177.4%                                |\n| Landfill                | 571,837                  | 548,611                  | 560,436                  | +2.2%                                  |\n\n**Total Waste Generated (excluding waste reduction)**\n\n| 2019 Weight (Short Tons) | 2020 Weight (Short Tons) | 2021 Weight (Short Tons) | 2020 to 2021 Year-Over-Year Change (%) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 2,790,080                | 2,813,273                | 2,777,614                | -1.3%                                  |\n\n**Total Waste Footprint (including waste reduction)**\n\n| 2019 Weight (Short Tons) | 2020 Weight (Short Tons) | 2021 Weight (Short Tons) | 2020 to 2021 Year-Over-Year Change (%) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 2,913,080                | 3,020,741                | 2,912,114                | -3.6%                                  |\n\n**Notes:**\n- Data reflects calendar year.\n- Disposed waste is managed by and reported to Kroger by our different waste and recycling haulers.\n- Waste data excludes office locations and salvage centers, which represent very small proportions of our waste footprint.\n- Donation data primarily reflects food donations, with a nominal amount of non-food donations.\n- Total waste generated excludes waste-reduction and waste-prevention data.\n- Construction project waste and recycling data captured in these totals excludes minor capital projects.\n- Table may not sum due to rounding.\n\n### Diversion-From-Landfill Rate in Kroger Retail Stores\n\n- **2019:** 80%\n- **2020:** 81%\n- **2021:** 79%\n\n- **Landfill**\n- **Diverted**\nPackaging\n\nOur Zero-Waste Approach\nSustainable packaging is a core tenet of our zero-waste vision. While packaging is important for preserving product quality, freshness and integrity, we also recognize its potential to impact our planet. This is why we are focused on reducing unnecessary packaging, reusing where we can and striving for greater recyclability and recycled content.\n\nOur Sustainable Packaging Goals will pave our way to 2030 by:\n\n\u2022 Completing a baseline product packaging footprint to fully understand current packaging impacts.\n\u2022 Seeking to achieve 100% recyclable, compostable and/or reusable packaging for Our Brands products.\n\u2022 Increasing recycled content in packaging so that the Kroger Our Brands product portfolio collectively contains at least 10% recycled content in packaging.\n\u2022 Increasing awareness among Kroger customers about how to properly manage Our Brands product packaging at end of life.\n\u2022 Reducing unnecessary packaging.\n\nPackaging Baseline\nKroger\u2019s first step toward achieving these goals was developing a packaging baseline to assess our current state and prioritize actions on our roadmap to 2030. Initially, we tracked the packaging impacts of the products that are manufactured and finished in Kroger-operated food-processing plants (which produce about 45% of Our Brands food products). In 2022, we expanded this tracking to include products produced by co-manufacturing suppliers.\n\nIn 2022, we focused on food products, both grocery and fresh, as well as health, beauty, household supplies and cleaning. The baseline currently excludes general merchandise products (apparel and home goods) because these represent a smaller volume of our product sales. We will build these into our data tracking in the future.\n\nWe used both actual and estimated data to produce our baseline. Approximately 52% of the packaging weight reported is from detailed internal or supplier-provided data (i.e., actual data) and the remaining 48% is estimated using proxy data from similar products, based on a hierarchical process. In total, the baseline covers 90% of 2021 sales (as measured by number of units sold); 10% of 2021 sales of in-scope products were excluded due to lower-quality proxy data.\n\nWe plan to improve data quality over time by engaging more Our Brands suppliers in data collection. The intention is to replace estimated data with actual data, to capture any changes to existing packages, and to capture more packaging details for new products as we launch them. We will also capture sustainable packaging attributes for Our Brands general merchandise products.\n\nTotal packaging baseline weight for 2021 is 404,537 metric tons. The two largest packaging material categories (by weight) are paper (35%) and plastic (33%), while the two most prominent packaging types by weight are cans (24%) and boxes (22%). When our packaging is classified by using the number of consumer Universal Product Codes (UPCs), the predominant packaging material is polypropylene plastic (39%) and the predominant packaging type is labels (33%).\n\nTop 5 Packaging Materials by Weight\n\n| Packaging Material | Total Packaging Weight (MT) | % of Total Baseline Weight |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Steel              | 74,587                      | 18%                       |\n| Cardboard          | 65,145                      | 16%                       |\n| Paperboard         | 47,142                      | 12%                       |\n| PET14 (#1) Plastic | 46,400                      | 12%                       |\n| HDPE15 (#2) Plastic| 36,087                      | 9%                        |\n\nTop 5 Packaging Types by Weight\n\n| Packaging Type | Total Packaging Weight (MT) | % of Total Baseline Weight |\n|----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Can            | 95,161                      | 24%                       |\n| Box            | 89,245                      | 22%                       |\n| Bottle         | 62,405                      | 15%                       |\n| Pot, Tub, Dome, Tray | 31,808                  | 8%                        |\n| Carton         | 27,076                      | 7%                        |\n\nTop 5 Packaging Materials by Unit\n\n| Packaging Material | Total Number of UPCs | % of Total UPCs in Baseline |\n|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| PP16 (#5) Plastic  | 3,344                | 39%                         |\n| PET (#1) Plastic   | 3,157                | 37%                         |\n| Other*             | 2,816                | 33%                         |\n| LDPE17 (#4) Plastic| 2,507                | 29%                         |\n| Paper              | 2,398                | 28%                         |\n\nTop 5 Packaging Types by Unit\n\n| Packaging Type | Total Number of UPCs | % of Total UPCs in Baseline |\n|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Label          | 2,848                | 33%                         |\n| Lid            | 1,900                | 22%                         |\n| Film           | 1,714                | 20%                         |\n| Bag            | 1,538                | 18%                         |\n| Bottle         | 1,416                | 16%                         |\n\n* Other includes materials like adhesive, wax, EVOH, sealant and ink.\n\n14.

Low density polyethylene\nImproving Packaging Recyclability\n\nKroger\u2019s framework for defining recyclability is a combination of best practice definitions and requirements of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the How2Recycle program. In this framework, shown to the right, we included the top two levels in our definition of recyclable for Our Brands packaging\u2014reflecting that we aim for packaging to be widely collected for recycling and optimally recycled in practice and at scale.\n\nOur 2021 packaging baseline findings show that 40% of Our Brands product packaging meets our definition of recyclable, when measured by weight of packaging material. For products without actual packaging data available, we assigned recyclability level based on the proxy product. For our percentage calculation, we only included products with a product-level proxy as compared to a product category-level proxy.\n\nImproving the recyclability of single-use packaging will depend on both product packaging redesigns and recycling infrastructure improvements.\n\nIn 2021, we transitioned all Our Brands egg cartons from expanded polystyrene foam to molded fiberboard, which contains 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) content and aligns with most curbside recycling programs. We also transitioned two fresh tomato products from plastic clamshells to paper-based cartons, which enables a significant part of the packaging to be more widely recyclable.\n\nThe Our Brands team continues to evaluate opportunities for similar packaging changes to reduce plastic use and improve recyclability.\n\n| Recyclability Level | Brief Description | Example Packaging Types | % of Kroger Packaging |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Recycled in practice and at scale | More than 95% of the entire pack weight is recyclable, and either remaining components are compatible with the recycling process or non-recyclable components can be separated. The packaging type must achieve a 30% post-consumer recycling rate in multiple regions. | Glass beverage containers; cardboard, paperboard; aluminum beverage cans, pans, trays | 31% |\n| Widely collected for recycling | A majority percentage of the population (at least 60%) has access to a recycling collection system that accepts the packaging in question (curbside or special take-back schemes). There are occasions when packaging is collected through a recycling system but not recycled. | Plastic bottles, jugs, jars (PET, HDPE, LDPE); ppX plastics; aluminum food cans; glass containers | 9% |\n| Sometimes collected for recycling | A significant percentage (20\u201359%) of the population has access to a curbside recycling collection system that accepts the packaging in question. There are occasions when packaging is collected through a recycling system but not recycled. | PET clamshells, tubs, trays; LDPE containers; aluminum trays, aerosol containers | 1% |\n| Recycle ready | Packaging is designed for collection, sorting and recycling using end-of-life processes, but collection, sorting and recycling infrastructure is not yet in place for the packaging to actually be recycled. | Monolayer plastic film | 1% |\n| Not recyclable | Packaging is significantly challenged in sorting, reprocessing or end markets. Technical recyclability considers whether it\u2019s technically possible to recycle a packaging item, but doesn\u2019t consider whether the collection, sorting and recycling happens in practice, at scale and with reasonable economics. | Multilayer plastic film | 58% |\nSupporting Infrastructure Improvements\n\nThe Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation is a Recycling Coalition Supporter of The Recycling Partnership. The foundation continues to support the multi-stakeholder Polypropylene Recycling Coalition, which aims to improve community-level infrastructure to enable curbside PP collection and recycling. Starting in 2022, the foundation is also supporting the newly launched PET Recycling Coalition, which will seek improved recycling outcomes for PET thermoform packaging.\n\nIncreasing Recycled Content\n\nAs part of our packaging baseline work, we also captured information about PCR content used in Our Brands product packaging. The packaging portfolio captured in our baseline includes 14% PCR content. This reflects the amount of PCR in products with primary data as a percentage of the packaging materials in our entire baseline portfolio. This is a more conservative approach that avoids inflating the amount of PCR through estimation. We expect this number to increase as we capture additional primary data from our suppliers. We will revisit our current goal in the future to determine whether it needs to be reset.\n\nReducing Unnecessary Packaging\n\nKroger-operated manufacturing plants continue to reduce plastic use and packaging weights for Our Brands items where feasible. In 2021, we:\n\n- Reduced the amount of plastic packaging used in a popular peanut butter product, saving approximately 100,000 pounds of plastic annually.\n- Transitioned to a new, thinner shrink wrap in our plants and distribution centers, enabling a 30% reduction in the amount of plastic used for pallet wrap.\n\nEnd-of-Life Solutions\n\nWhile the industry works on longer-term solutions to make flexible plastic packaging recycling more widely available to consumers through curbside collection, we are offering our customers means to divert this packaging from landfills. In 2021, we expanded the Kroger Our Brands Free Recycling Program with TerraCycle so our customers can mail any flexible plastic Our Brands product packaging, free of charge, to TerraCycle for recycling. These materials are upcycled to produce composite plastic material used in playground equipment, park benches and other products. Kroger is the first U.S. retailer to offer this type of recycling program across an entire private-label portfolio. Program engagement and recycling volume continues to grow. To date, customers have returned approximately 650,000 packaging units (more than 13,600 pounds of plastic) to TerraCycle for recycling.\n\nAs a complementary offering, our in-store plastic film collection and recycling program accepts a wide range of monolayer plastic films that are not currently accepted in curbside recycling programs. This primarily includes non-food items like plastic grocery bags, plastic overwrap on household tissues, diapers and bottled water; dry cleaning bags; retail produce bags; and packaging that is labeled as acceptable for in-store drop-off programs.\n\nCustomer Communication\n\nWe believe in offering our customers easy ways to live a more sustainable lifestyle. Promoting programs like the Our Brands recycling program with TerraCycle and our in-store recycling drop-off program helps accomplish this. We also communicate recycling information directly on-pack. In addition to including \u201cPlease Recycle\u201d on many items, Kroger also added the How2Recycle logo to several Our Brands items in 2021, including bread bags, Comforts diapers and training pants, feminine hygiene products and some of our household tissue products. Several of these items include How2Recycle\u2019s Store Drop-Off label, helping increase our customers\u2019 awareness of our front-of-store plastic film recycling program.\n\nKroger was the first U.S. retailer to introduce the innovative Loop reusable packaging platform in-store. In February 2022, Kroger launched a pilot for Loop at 25 Fred Meyer stores in the Portland, OR area. The in-store Loop assortment included 21 items representing popular brands, including Arbor Teas, Cascade, Clorox\u00ae, Gerber, Nature\u2019s Heart, Nature\u2019s Path, Pantene, Seventh Generation and Stubb\u2019s\u00ae, as well as Kroger\u2019s own Simple Truth\u2122 brand. Through the in-store model, customers purchase the Loop products, which are pre-filled in reusable packaging. After using the product, they return the empty package to a collection bin at the front of the store. Returned packages are returned to Loop for cleaning, refill and resale\u2014\u201cclosing the loop.\u201d\nWater\n\nWe know the importance of safe, high-quality water for the health of our associates, customers, communities and the planet. Our engineering teams collaborate to identify and evaluate opportunities to reduce water use, find reuse opportunities and manage water discharge quality \u2014 all to protect local water sources.\n\nWe periodically conduct water risk assessments across our portfolio of facilities to understand if there is substantive water risk present. Using multiple tools, we evaluate our facilities for location-based water risk across several impact areas, including physical quantity, physical quality, and regulatory and reputational risks. To date we have found that, while the analysis indicates Kroger does have facilities operating in regions with a defined level of water stress, these represent less than 10% of our total facilities.\n\nOur supermarkets have implemented a five-point water-reduction retrofit program, which includes retrofitting pre-rinse spray valves, bathroom faucet aerators, urinal flush valves, commodes and their flush valves, and Starbucks dipper wells used for cleaning utensils. Outside stores, we retrofitted irrigation sprinkler systems to reduce unnecessary water consumption.\n\nIn our Manufacturing operations, we are finding ways to repurpose water. In 2021, two additional facilities installed the capacity to use recirculated water to cool down air compressors, reducing the need for new water.\n\nOur plants must also manage the quality of water that we discharge to help ensure alignment with local requirements. In some cases, we have on-site wastewater treatment facilities, and at our K.B. Specialty Foods plant in Greensburg, IN, we use AD technology to convert the waste by-products to renewable biogas and ultimately electricity that is used at the facility.\n\nIn 2021, company-wide water consumption increased slightly from the prior year. Though total values increased, we did save water through efficiency projects, including 180 million gallons of water in Retail. Collectively, our stores account for about 80% of water consumption, though the per-store consumption is relatively low compared to our plants (due to activity) and distribution centers (due to size).\n\nBecause water consumption is not metered in all our stores, we use a detailed estimation process to fill in missing data points. This process is helpful for providing data points for all facilities when we do water risk assessment; however, it can also produce some variability in year-over-year comparisons.\n\nSupply Chain Sustainability\n\nKroger relies on supply chains from around the globe to produce, source and sell the products we carry in our stores. We recognize the importance of implementing practices in our supply chains that protect people and the planet, while also ensuring we have products available for our customers. From a resource conservation perspective, we are focused on protecting the oceans, forests, agricultural fields and other valuable landscapes that support our business.\n\nSeafood Sustainability\n\nWe have been working to boost the sustainability credentials of our seafood for over a decade, setting commitments\u2014which are articulated in our Seafood Sustainability Policy\u2014and participating in long-term partnerships and programs. In particular, WWF has long been a trusted adviser to Kroger with regards to identifying sustainable sources and contributing to industry efforts to improve fishery practices.\n\nIn 2021, we expanded our commitments. For wild-caught seafood, we aim for 95% of fresh and frozen seafood in our Seafood department to be from fisheries aligned with our policy by 2023\u2014in 2021, we reached 94%. For farm-raised seafood, we aim for 100% of fresh and frozen seafood to be from farms aligned with our policy by 2023. During 2021, we maintained 98% alignment, a comparable result to our 2020 achievement.\n\nKroger remains committed to sourcing all shelf-stable tuna from suppliers participating in the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF). In 2021, we built on this with a commitment to source 20% of shelf-stable Our Brands tuna from MSC-certified fisheries, reaching 2.7% by the end of the year.\n\nWith traceability key to ensuring products are sourced responsibly, we will continue to work with WWF and suppliers to improve transparency and traceability for seafood globally. In 2021, our assortment included seafood sourced from 48 comprehensive fishery improvement projects (FIPs), up from 33 in 2020. Comprehensive FIPs offer a stepwise approach for fisheries to reach MSC certification. They bring together various stakeholders to improve the environmental performance of a fishery and ensure FIP activities align with region-specific interests.\n\nIn 2021, Kroger expanded our seafood sustainability focus to align the seafood sold by our third-party sushi vendors in Kroger\u2019s deli departments with the requirements in our Seafood Sustainability Policy. As reported by our vendors, in 2021, 99% of the seafood in our sushi assortment was aligned with these requirements.\n\nTo learn more, please see the Kroger-WWF Seafood Sustainability Report.\nForests\nKroger produces and sells a wide range of items, including those with components that could potentially contribute to tropical deforestation. Our No-Deforestation Commitment for Our Brands aims to address deforestation impacts in supply chains where there is a potential risk:\n\n- **Palm:** We will source palm oil, palm kernel oil and palm oil derivatives from sources certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil or to an equivalent standard. During 2021, approximately 88% of palm-based ingredients used in Our Brands products came from certified sources. More than 82% of reported palm oil in products was certified to the Mass Balance supply chain standard. We will work with our suppliers to advance toward 100% alignment with this goal.\n\n- **Pulp/paper:** We will source paper packaging that is certified to a sustainable forestry standard (including FSC, SFI and PEFC) and/or includes recycled content. In 2021, 97% by weight of paper product packaging used in our manufacturing plants was from certified sources. The majority (more than 95% by weight) of Our Brands household paper goods like tissues, paper towel and toilet paper are also from certified sources. We are learning more about the alignment of paper packaging used by co-manufacturing suppliers (either meeting certification standards or containing PCR materials) through our packaging baseline work and will continue to build out this dataset moving forward.\n\n- **Soy:** We aim to source deforestation-free soy-based ingredients. In 2021, 100% of predominantly soy-based ingredients (e.g., soybean oil) procured for Kroger\u2019s manufacturing plants were from U.S. or Canadian sources, indicating low risk of tropical deforestation in this supply chain. In 2022, we are beginning to query relevant co-manufacturing suppliers of Our Brands products to identify deforestation risks for soy-based ingredients.\n\n- **Beef:** We strive to source deforestation-free fresh beef and beef-based ingredients. In 2021, the regular (non-spot market) procurement into our Meat department and manufacturing plants was predominantly\u2014over 99.9%\u2014harvested in the U.S., with the majority of the remainder coming from Canada or Mexico. Of this remaining beef, over 99.9% was born and raised in North America. Kroger also sources a small volume of specialty Simple Truth\u00ae beef products from Uruguay and Australia. Kroger continues to engage our suppliers to gain increased visibility into our beef supply chain.\n\nIn 2022, we are beginning to query relevant co-manufacturing suppliers of Our Brands products to identify deforestation risks for beef-based ingredients.\n\nNatural & Organic\nNatural and organic products are an important element of Kroger\u2019s overall product assortment. This reflects our customers\u2019 growing interest in purchasing products that are free from artificial ingredients, flavors and preservatives, with reduced environmental impact. Customers seeking to avoid genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can choose from many products certified to be non-GMO. The average Kroger store contains more than 4,000 natural and organic products, with all stores carrying some assortment.\n\nKroger\u2019s own Simple Truth\u00ae product line continues to expand\u2014reaching over 1,500 unique products and more than $3 billion in sales\u2014and remains the second largest brand in our retail stores, based on sales. We remain committed to increasing the affordability and availability of natural and organic items to improve health and sustainability. Currently, 18 Kroger-operated manufacturing plants are certified to produce organic Our Brands items.\n\nPlant-Based Alternatives\nKroger continues to increase our assortment of plant-based alternatives across multiple product categories in response to increasing consumer interest. We currently offer nearly 2,100 plant-based products across our stores. By 2021, Kroger\u2019s Simple Truth\u00ae brand included more than 200 plant-based items. In the past year, 33 new products launched, with notable expansion into the Deli and Bakery sections of the store with products such as plant-based macaroni and cheese, broccoli and cheddar soup (Deli), and mini cupcakes and cheesecake (Bakery). Currently, the Simple Truth\u00ae brand has plant-based products in 50 commodity categories. This represents about 29% of the commodity categories in which the Simple Truth\u00ae brand offers products.\n\nSales of all plant-based products continue to increase year-over-year. Across the store, plant-based product sales grew by 5% in 2021, while sales of Simple Truth\u00ae plant-based products grew 10%.\nSustainable Apparel\nIn addition to launching our Apparel Restricted Substances List (RSL) to limit chemicals in our dip\u00ae clothing line, Kroger has steadily increased the presence of materials with sustainable attributes in this assortment. We anticipate that by the end of 2022, more than 50% of dip items, across all categories, will have fabric with traits like organic cotton, recycled plastic content and certified renewable materials. During 2021, nearly 40% of procured items had fabric with a sustainability feature.\n\nChemical Management\nWe are committed to responsibly managing product quality and safety and we set high standards for all Our Brands products. Our regulatory compliance and quality assurance programs define product and supplier requirements such as quality specifications, testing protocols and reporting and labeling, to ensure safe, high-quality products. As reflected in our Safer Chemicals Statement, we proactively identify chemicals to remove from Our Brands products.\n\nExamples of recent progress:\n\u2022 100% of Our Brands canned food items remain free of bisphenol A (BPA) liners. Currently, about 50% of Our Brands canned beverage items (by volume) are no longer in BPA liners. We will continue to expand this reach as supply becomes available.\n\u2022 Apparel Restricted Substances Policy, which includes a robust RSL, establishes requirements about chemicals that are not permitted in Our Brands apparel products. In 2022, Kroger is leveraging the support of a third-party expert to expand our work in apparel to develop an RSL for Kroger\u2019s Our Brands formulated products.\n\nFair Trade Certified\u2122\nThrough our work with Fair Trade USA\u2122, Kroger helps support the people behind our Fair Trade Certified products to improve livelihoods and build more resilient supply chains. We source a variety of commodities, including sugar, coconut, tea, coffee, cocoa, shea, plantain, cassava and vanilla, from 19 countries, and we remain the largest purchaser of Fair Trade Certified coconut in the world. In 2021, Kroger sourced more than 16.9 million pounds of Fair Trade Certified ingredients for inclusion in Simple Truth\u00ae and Private Selection\u00ae products, an increase of 4%.\n\nFurthermore, Kroger\u2019s purchases of Fair Trade Certified ingredients contributed more than $1.03 million in Community Development Funds to help farmworkers improve their unique social, economic and environmental needs.\n\nKroger is a member of the Sustainable Coffee Challenge. Simple Truth\u00ae committed to use 100% Fair Trade Certified coffee in all products, and is currently at 94% progress on this goal as Kona coffee is becoming available for our relevant products now. In 2021, Kroger\u2019s Private Selection\u00ae brand committed to sourcing 100% Fair Trade Certified coffee from international growing regions by mid-2022. We met this commitment\u2014currently, more than 30 Private Selection\u00ae coffee products are Fair Trade Certified\u2014and will uphold it as we add new products to our coffee assortment.\n\nIn 2022, we launched our first Fair Trade Certified Our Brands produce items: Simple Truth Organic\u00ae tomatoes grown in Mexico and Arizona.\n\nFair Trade Certified Ingredients Used\n\n| Year | Pounds |\n|------|--------|\n| 2019 | 19.3M  |\n| 2020 | 16.2M  |\n| 2021 | 16.9M  |\n\n20 Restated as a result of refining our annual impact calculation.\nBuild More\n\nResponsible & Inclusive Global Systems\n\nKroger offers a variety of foods and other essentials to meet our customers\u2019 wide-ranging needs, preferences and budgets. Our strong ESG governance aims to ensure that Kroger operates responsibly in a global supply chain with far-reaching implications and trade-offs for people and our planet.\n\nIn This Section\n\n50 Business Integration\n54 Responsible & Resilient Systems\nESG Governance\n\nKroger is committed to strong corporate governance, including ESG oversight. We manage ESG topics in the context of our business and ESG strategies, balancing these considerations with the long-term interests of our various stakeholders.\n\nWe maintain an established ESG management approach, informed by a comprehensive, third party-led materiality assessment. We are updating this assessment and methodology in the second half of 2022 to reflect current best practices for engaging stakeholders and refining material topics. We will share our updated materiality assessment results in our 2023 ESG Report.\n\nIntegrating ESG Ownership\n\nWe integrate ESG priorities into our business and corporate governance practices. This includes updated oversight of enterprise risk and accountability among senior management and our board. During 2021, we refreshed membership and charters for several board committees to clarify and confirm oversight of specific ESG topics. Four board committees have direct oversight of ESG topics, as outlined in the table on the next page. Details of our directors\u2019 areas of ESG expertise, as well as committee composition, are available online in Kroger\u2019s 2022 Proxy Statement and 2021 Annual Report.\n\nSeveral Kroger departments support our management approach to ESG:\n\n- **Audit:** Oversees financial reporting and manages independent auditors\n- **Corporate Affairs:** Leads internal and external communications and media relations; manages federal and state government affairs and advocacy; leads sustainability and social impact\n- **Corporate Food Technology:** Oversees food safety and product quality assurance; manages recalls affecting Kroger-manufactured and -labeled products and national brands; leads animal welfare program\n- **Environmental Compliance:** Oversees Kroger\u2019s compliance with environmental regulations\n- **Ethics & Compliance:** Leads awareness and implementation of corporate policies, including Kroger\u2019s Policy on Business Ethics, Anti-Corruption Policy, Vendor Code of Conduct and Privacy Policy; oversees compliance with relevant laws and regulations\n- **Human Resources & Labor Relations:** Leads human capital management, including hiring, compensation and benefits; leads diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; engages with labor unions to negotiate collective bargaining agreements\n\nMaterial Topics:\n- ESG Governance\n- Ethics & Compliance\n- Data Privacy & Cybersecurity\n- Marketing Practices\n\nBusiness Integration\n\nKroger\u2019s operations reach billions of people in communities near and far. We engage leaders in our ESG strategy and commitments and hold teams accountable for results. Integrating ESG ownership into our lines of business is a journey; indeed, we believe our centralized structure, vertical integration and history of responsible supply chain operations enable our continued progress.\n\u2022 Merchandising: Determines category assortment and promotional strategies; leads supplier engagement together with Sourcing; leads customer engagement, loyalty and rewards\n\u2022 Retail Operations: Guides standards, policies and program implementation for retail stores; advances operational performance\n\u2022 Sourcing: Sources raw materials and finished products for Our Brands; purchases national brands for resale and goods not for resale; implements Kroger\u2019s Responsible Sourcing Framework; leads supplier engagement with Merchandising\n\u2022 Supply Chain: Manages our distribution network and transportation fleet\n\u2022 Technology & Digital: Focuses on governance, technology innovation and digital channels; leads cybersecurity management approach\n\nEthics & Compliance\n\nWe strive to uphold the highest ethical standards and to help our associates and partners do the same. We consistently review company policies and update them as needed to advance ethical and responsible practices.\n\nOur Ethics & Compliance team is responsible for driving internal implementation of Kroger\u2019s Policy on Business Ethics. The team also monitors our company helpline, through which associates can anonymously report concerns. Partnering with the Corporate Affairs and Sourcing teams, the Ethics & Compliance team follows legislative and regulatory changes and shares updates with relevant teams. It also collaborates on developing compliance programs and monitoring implementation and effectiveness.\n\nThroughout 2021, we continued to monitor U.S. federal and state guidelines related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to ensure we remained compliant amid a challenging and changing operating environment.\n\nOversight of ESG Topics\n\n| Board of Directors: Committee Oversight |\n|----------------------------------------|\n| **Audit Committee** | **Compensation & Talent Development Committee** | **Corporate Governance Committee** | **Public Responsibilities Committee** |\n| Oversees compliance with legal, financial and regulatory requirements; operational and third-party compliance; data privacy and cybersecurity; and financial integrity | Oversees human capital management; talent development; executive compensation; and diversity, equity and inclusion | Oversees board recruitment and diversity; board succession; shareholder engagement program; shareholder advisory notes and shareholder proposals; and independent director compensation | Oversees Kroger\u2019s ESG strategy and progress on public commitments related to safety; food safety and pharmacy safety; food access; health and nutrition; community engagement; climate impacts; packaging; waste and food waste; responsible sourcing; and supply chain accountability, including human rights and animal welfare |\n\nExecutive Leadership Team\n\n| Data Governance Committee | DEI Advisory Council | Enterprise Risk Management | ESG Team | Ethics & Compliance | Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee |\n\nCross-Functional Working Groups for Select ESG Topics\n\n| Animal Welfare Working Group | Climate Impact Working Group | Food Access Working Group | Human Rights Working Group | Packaging Working Group | Waste & Food Waste Working Group |\nData Privacy & Cybersecurity\n\nWe recognize the responsibility to protect our customers\u2019 information, our own data and our business systems. We prioritize data privacy and cybersecurity practices that protect company information and the personal data shared with us.\n\nThe Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer leads Kroger\u2019s Privacy Office, which reports to an Executive Steering Committee that includes our General Counsel, Group Vice President of Corporate Affairs, Chief Merchandising Officer and Chief Information Officer. The Chief Information Security Officer and Cyber Resilience team are responsible for cybersecurity, with board-level oversight from the Audit Committee.\n\nThree components form our approach to cybersecurity:\n\n- Using technology to automate and proactively identify issues\n- Augmenting our existing teams with additional, high-skilled talent\n- Concentrating on third-party risk management\n\nData Privacy\n\nIn the U.S. alone, more than 20 states introduced data privacy legislation during 2021. Five states have comprehensive privacy laws: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia. Kroger\u2019s Privacy Office, Law department and Corporate Affairs team monitor policy developments at federal and state levels to inform internal policies and processes that meet or exceed compliance standards.\n\nWe conduct an annual review of our Privacy Policy to make sure it accurately reflects our data practices on what privacy rights are available to individuals and how we collect, use and share data.\n\nKroger prioritizes incorporating privacy considerations in our product lifecycle, marketing practices and culture. In 2021, we increased the reach of governance processes and cross-team coordination to enhance consideration of potential privacy impacts when designing new processes or solutions. We also improved privacy operations by automating tasks, measuring practice maturity and implementing more efficient tools for enabling privacy rights fulfillment and privacy impact assessments.\n\nAll corporate and technology associates who handle personal information complete general privacy awareness training. Associates working in data solutions and architecture, media and marketing, and our Kroger Health business are required to complete additional privacy training.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nWe implement cybersecurity practices appropriate to the nature of the information we collect and use\u2014including technical, administrative and operational procedures\u2014to prevent loss, misuse or alteration. In 2021, Kroger\u2019s Cyber Resilience team incorporated new threat intelligence capabilities and conducted tabletop exercises to fine-tune playbooks and adopt more proactive security measures.\n\nWhen personal information is entrusted to a third-party service provider, we thoroughly review and supervise how the information is handled through appropriate contractual and security controls. In 2021, we engaged third-party auditors to review our cybersecurity due diligence process. Using these results, we are now enhancing third-party risk management with improved contract negotiation and onboarding, setup and tiering, and ongoing risk monitoring and management.\n\nIn 2021, Kroger was impacted by Accellion, Inc.\u2019s data security incident. The incident was isolated to Accellion services and did not affect Kroger\u2019s business systems or data. After learning of the incident\u2019s effects in January, Kroger discontinued use of Accellion\u2019s services, reported the incident to federal law enforcement and activated a forensic investigation process to review the potential scope and impact of the incident. We also contacted customers and associates who may have been affected and offered credit monitoring at no cost to them. We continue to apply key learnings from these incidents to future system security protections.\n\nAll associates with access to personal information are assigned cybersecurity training on management best practices. In 2021, we asked all corporate, technical and retail store associates to complete a data security awareness training course. In addition, corporate and store associates who work in areas regulated by the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are assigned applicable training courses such as HIPAA Security, a HIPAA Refresher course, and HIPAA Privacy Compliance for Non-Pharmacy Associates.\n\nIn 2021, Kroger significantly enhanced our training portfolio, partnering with industry-leading providers to include:\n\n- Over 300 security and privacy awareness and phishing testing courses\n- Over 8,000 security and technical training courses, labs, assessments and professional certification paths for security and technology associates\n- Over 700 in-depth security and technical modules, labs and tabletop exercises\nMarketing Practices\n\nKroger develops marketing communications and integrated campaigns to help customers make purchase decisions that are right for them. We follow applicable laws and regulations related to marketing practices, and we strive to work with partners who do the same. Our Brands, Marketing, Media Services, 84.51\u00b0 and Merchandising teams lead this work in partnership with the Kroger Technology & Digital team and the Ethics & Compliance team.\n\nOur customers tell us they value receiving personalized offers that deliver savings on items they purchase regularly. We use information about consumer shopping preferences and our customers\u2019 behaviors to develop billions of personalized offers every week\u2014totaling nearly 1 trillion offers in 2021. We follow and continually update best practices that govern this work, as highlighted in our customer-facing Privacy Policy, to clearly share why and how we may collect and use this information.\n\nTo fulfill our brand promise\u2014Fresh for Everyone\u2122\u2014we promote healthy options like fresh, natural and organic choices across all customer segments and geographies. We work with national, regional and local media and advertising partners to connect with customers through traditional and social media channels.\n\nA defined request for information (RFI) process governs how we select media partners. In the increasingly complex media landscape and digital ecosystem, we want to ensure we invest with partners in a responsible manner with transparency and as champions of diversity, equity and inclusion aligned with our Investment Guidelines. The RFI process includes specific questions to identify how vendors will create models and expand audiences without bias and with privacy best practices. We also ask vendors to share best practices in communicating organically with multicultural audiences.\n\nAcross our operations, we avoid targeted marketing to minors of products intended for adult purchase and consumption, including adult beverages and nicotine products. We are committed to representing product characteristics clearly and accurately, including health and nutritional benefits.\n\nWhere appropriate, based on new information, Kroger may choose to exit certain product categories to reflect our ongoing commitment to responsible marketing practices. For example, Kroger previously decided to discontinue the sale of electronic nicotine-delivery products, or electronic cigarettes.\n\nKroger Private Marketplace\n\nIn 2021, Kroger Precision Marketing (KPM), Kroger\u2019s retail media business, introduced a private programmatic advertising marketplace. The Kroger Private Marketplace allows agencies and brands to reach consumers by applying Kroger audience data to programmatic campaigns within their preferred ad-buying platform.\n\nPowered by 84.51\u00b0 data science and Kroger\u2019s popular loyalty card program, KPM connects customers to brands to inspire purchasing online or in-store. The new marketplace platform is designed with safeguards to further support KPM\u2019s commitment to protecting customers\u2019 data and privacy.\nResponsible & Resilient Systems\n\nKroger is part of\u2014and dependent on\u2014an interconnected global food system and consumer goods supply chain. We are committed to using our size and scale to respect the rights of workers around the world and help build more responsible, resilient systems for the future.\n\nMaterial Topics:\n- Responsible Sourcing\n- Human Rights\n- Supply Chain Accountability\n- Animal Welfare\n\n2021 Highlights\n\n$4B\nAnnual spend with diverse-owned suppliers\n\nCommitted to align human rights practices to UN Guiding Principles\n\n14K\npeople engaged in Worker Voice Survey at suppliers\u2019 global facilities\n\n45.9%\nEgg sales from cage-free or higher-welfare hen housing\n\nResponsible Sourcing\n\nKroger is committed to helping create a more sustainable, resilient and responsible global supply chain so we can offer a wide range of affordable product options for our customers. We lead with a systems approach to addressing the wide range of ESG topics affecting people and our planet. We manage sourcing topics and issues within the context of our business and ESG strategies, recognizing the need to contemplate potential tradeoffs and unintended consequences of specific single-topic policy changes.\n\nOur management approach is led by a cross-functional Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee comprising leaders in Sourcing, Ethics & Compliance, Corporate Affairs, and Merchandising. Additional oversight is provided by Kroger\u2019s executive leadership team and the board\u2019s Public Responsibilities Committee.\n\nA risk-based approach informs changes in our sourcing policies, practices and oversight, reflecting emerging issues that affect people and our planet. We rely on the expertise of our category sourcing leaders, product data and insights, third-party audit results and input from investors, industry groups, NGOs and other subject matter experts.\n\nSupplier Diversity & Inclusion\n\nKroger set a goal to spend over $10 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2030 as part of our Framework for Action: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. We actively pursue collaborations with minority- and women-owned business enterprises, including companies owned by individuals who are veterans, disabled or members of the LGBTQ+ community. We value these relationships because they contribute to the local economy and community, and their products and services are often unique and popular among customers.\n\nIn 2021, we assigned responsibility for supplier diversity and inclusion to our centralized Sourcing team to strategically apply principles of inclusion to the broader function. Total spend with diverse-owned suppliers is expected to be $4 billion in 2021, nearly flat versus the prior year.\n\nKroger values the products, services and perspectives of entrepreneurs with different backgrounds and lived experience. We welcomed 230 new diverse-owned suppliers in 2021, an increase of 115% versus the prior year. These new businesses reflect more than $500 million in incremental spend with diverse-owned suppliers.\n\nAnnual Spend with Diverse-Owned Suppliers\n\n| Year | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| 2019 | $3.4B  |\n| 2020 | $4.1B  |\n| 2021 | $4.0B  |\n\n21. This amount includes more than $630 million of business with diverse-owned suppliers expected to complete the certification process.\nAs a grocery retailer, we aim to continue providing a wide variety of fresh foods for our customers far into the future. We recognize the critical need to preserve natural habitats around the world, reduce unnecessary conversion of land for agriculture, and improve species and wildlife protections for future generations.\n\nThe Systems pillar of our ESG strategy contemplates the interconnected issues and impacts for people and our planet\u2014including a changing climate and global population growth\u2014and considers potential interventions and trade-offs.\n\nKroger engages thought leaders, subject matter experts and stakeholders in conservation practices and natural systems to inform our approach. Through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan and other public commitments, we strive to promote responsible land use and advocate for more sustainable agricultural production methods that protect habitats and wildlife.\n\nOur Zero Hunger | Zero Waste mission is particularly relevant to this dialogue. The world produces more than enough food to feed everyone today; however, significant food loss and waste throughout the food system prevents nourishing food from achieving its highest purpose: feeding people.\n\nIn 2022, we are working with the IPM Institute of North America to develop a comprehensive commitment to improve sustainability in our fresh produce supply chain. This body of work will also enable future reporting aligned with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and Science Based Targets for Nature.\nVendor Code of Conduct\n\nOur customers trust that the products we offer come from reputable suppliers. All suppliers, including those providing Our Brands ingredients and finished products, are expected to disclose their global production facilities and locations through our centralized Supplier Hub and to maintain safe, fair working environments in all facilities.\n\nAll suppliers are expected to comply with our Vendor Code of Conduct. The Ethics & Compliance team is leading work to update this document in 2022. For contractual reasons, the Code of Conduct will be clearer and more concise, and Kroger expects all suppliers to agree to it without revision. A complementary Vendor Guide to Kroger\u2019s Code of Conduct will provide detailed implementation guidelines and additional context on performance and reporting expectations for suppliers building their responsible sourcing practices.\n\nPlease see the Kroger Vendor Code of Conduct.\n\nHuman Rights\n\nAs a U.S. food processor and retailer with a global supply network, we recognize our role and responsibility to respect human rights throughout our operations and value chain, particularly among vulnerable populations. Respecting human rights is embedded in our corporate governance and culture, and is a key element of our responsible sourcing and supply chain accountability initiatives. We outline Kroger\u2019s commitment to\u2014and governance of\u2014human rights in our updated Human Rights Policy and Vendor Code of Conduct, as well as our Responsible Sourcing Framework and Social Compliance Program Requirements. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the board oversees progress on human rights.\n\nWe continually review our approach and processes to help advance positive changes for people throughout our operations and global supply chain. In 2021, Kroger committed to align our approach with the UN Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Business and Human Rights and initiated a two-year plan to assess and improve our human rights practice and reporting. This included a comprehensive gap analysis to review existing governance, policies and processes, and a risk assessment workshop with internal leaders to define the company\u2019s most salient human rights risks.\n\nEarlier this year, we published a new Human Rights Policy and a detailed Human Rights Progress Update to recap work completed so far.\n\nAssessing Human Rights Risks\n\nIn 2021, we engaged internal leaders and subject matter experts to review an updated supply chain risk assessment, discuss geographic areas of potential human rights risks and align on the company\u2019s most salient human rights risks. This prioritization process aligned with UNGP guidelines and shaped next steps, including the development of Kroger\u2019s human rights due diligence (HRDD) framework.\n\nInternal stakeholders engaged in this process represented lines of business and corporate functions, including Retail Operations; Merchandising; Sourcing; Ethics & Compliance; Logistics; Internal Audit; Human Resources & Labor Relations; Manufacturing; Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs.\n\nThis was a valuable opportunity to drive deeper engagement and business integration in our ESG strategy. As a first step, Kroger worked with ELEVATE to develop a shortlist of 10 human rights issues for deeper analysis, informed by:\n\n- Synthesizing our stakeholders\u2019 input and expectations, peer benchmarking insights, and internal and external stakeholder interview feedback.\n- A global risk landscape report to assess the potential human rights risks of the company\u2019s activities or business relationships. The report was informed by supply chain analytics, desk research, media scans and country scores on social and/or human rights indices.\n- An anonymous survey of more than 30 internal leaders and stakeholders to gather input on the most serious potential human rights impacts related to our own operations or the global supply chain, based on their role in the company.\nAwareness of Salient Risks\n\nAs a result of the steps described in 2021, we identified a list of most salient human rights risks. Salient issues are the human rights risks that pose the highest potential risk to people\u2019s human rights as a result of the company\u2019s activities or business relationships. These are defined in the table below.\n\n| Salient Human Rights Risk | Policies | Additional Resources |\n|---------------------------|----------|----------------------|\n| Child labor               | Human Rights Policy | Supplier Social Responsibility FAQs |\n| Forced labor and human trafficking, including migrant labor | Vendor Code of Conduct, Responsible Sourcing Framework | Social Compliance Audit Content, Human Rights Progress Update |\n| Discrimination            | Our Values | Framework for Action: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion |\n| Harassment & abuse        | The Kroger Co. Policy on Business Ethics, Vendor Code of Conduct | Kroger Allyship Guides, Kroger Helpline: EthicsPoint |\n| Working hours             | Compensable Time Policy (internal), Paid Time Off Policies | Life at Kroger |\n| Health & safety           | Internal policies and standards | Kroger\u2019s Blueprint for Businesses, Associate Well-Being & Safety, Kroger: A Fresh Welcome |\n\nRisk Prioritization Workshop\n\nKroger convened a workshop with internal leaders from various departments, including Ethics & Compliance, Sourcing, Retail Operations, Merchandising, Supply Chain, Human Resources & Labor Relations, Law and Corporate Affairs. The ELEVATE team facilitated this workshop following the UNGP guidelines for determining a \u201cStatement of Salient Issues.\u201d\n\nUsing the shortlist of 10 priority issues, we discussed internal and external feedback and risk landscape report findings to inform our list of most salient human rights risks. Participants prioritized these issues based on severity and likelihood in alignment with the UNGPs from their unique perspective and role.\n\nBased on this input, we developed an initial prioritized list of most salient human rights risks for further review. We shared the list of prioritized risks with workshop participants to discuss any feedback or questions. The table at right outlines the company\u2019s most salient human rights risks, impact areas, and relevant policies and resources.\n\nWe also agreed on next steps to define the implications of our updated policy commitments, including:\n\n- Formalizing a cross-functional Human Rights Working Group with specific roles and responsibilities to lead the next phases of work in 2022 and 2023.\n- Developing an action plan to further embed the policy across the company and with business partners.\n- Initiating a review of related policies such as the Vendor Code of Conduct and Responsible Sourcing Framework to ensure alignment with the commitments made in the Human Rights Policy and expectations outlined in the UNGPs.\nNext Steps\nKroger\u2019s Human Rights Working Group and ELEVATE continue to develop a comprehensive HRDD framework and three-year implementation roadmap. This work is more rigorous than originally anticipated; in fact, conversations about how to apply the RACI model\u2014defining which teams and leaders are Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed\u2014have been thoughtful and constructive. We are finding this to be a valuable tool for engaging cross-functional leaders to develop more detailed governance and clarify roles and responsibilities. We expect to spend the balance of the year refining this framework and roadmap.\n\nImpact Assessments\nKroger recently initiated our first human rights impact assessment (HRIA) to more deeply understand human rights risks in our supply chain. The first HRIA is focused on understanding the human rights risks for migrant farmworkers in the production of mixed greens in California. The ELEVATE team is supporting this HRIA by recommending the approach, conducting independent farm visits with key suppliers and interviewing rightsholders and other subject matter experts. We expect to publish a report in early 2023 with results, including recommendations and action steps to align remedy with any potential findings.\n\nThe company\u2019s decision to focus first on mixed greens in California reflects these factors:\n- Mixed greens represent a high-volume sourcing commodity for Kroger.\n- The company\u2019s social compliance program to date has focused on suppliers\u2019 international production facilities versus U.S. operations.\n- There are known potential risks to farmworkers and H-2A Temporary Agricultural Workers in the U.S.\n- Key Kroger suppliers for mixed greens agreed to support the HRIA and provide access to farms and workers.\n- The Responsible Sourcing team in the U.S. can more closely support and monitor any access to remedy provided to gauge effectiveness.\n\nWe are also finalizing the scope of a second HRIA, which will likely be conducted with another retail partner. At this time, the HRIA will focus on forced labor risks in shrimp produced in aquaculture operations in India. We selected this impact assessment based on these factors:\n- Shrimp is a high-volume sourcing commodity for Kroger and the other retailer.\n- There are known human rights risks in the global seafood supply chain.\n- India is a key sourcing region for farmed shrimp for both retailers.\n- Facilities and workers are more accessible in aquaculture than in wild-caught seafood operations.\n- Other existing research will complement the focus of this HRIA and may expedite access to remedy.\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nWe continue to engage stakeholder groups throughout this HRIA process. The UNGPs provide detailed guidance on this stage of impact assessments, including steps to engage rightsholders and subject matter experts. We selected HRIs that add to the global body of knowledge about human rights risks in specific countries and commodities, and that may prioritize access to remedy for vulnerable workers, particularly where existing research on known risks is more widely available.\n\nKroger has also agreed to apply a lens of gender equity to our HRDD framework and HRIs to consider and help address unique human rights risks to vulnerable women in global food production and other manufacturing.\nSupply Chain Accountability\n\nA risk-based management approach to improve supply chain integrity is central to our Responsible Sourcing Framework. We implement comprehensive programs that hold our suppliers accountable for meeting Kroger\u2019s high standards and support continual improvement in our global food and consumer goods systems.\n\nKroger\u2019s cross-functional Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee and Human Rights Working Group lead our approach to supply chain accountability, with oversight from senior management and the Public Responsibilities Committee of the board.\n\nWe engage suppliers through ongoing assessments of environmental and social practices, including human rights. We build strong supplier relationships during onboarding and maintain them through regular meetings, site visits, surveys and audits.\n\nSocial Compliance Audits\n\nKroger\u2019s Social Compliance Program verifies suppliers\u2019 alignment with our Vendor Code of Conduct, which all suppliers must agree to as a condition of doing business with Kroger. Among other expectations, the Code of Conduct informs vendors that the facilities they operate can be subject to third-party social compliance audits. Kroger\u2019s Social Compliance Program Requirements outline the legal requirements and high ethical standards to which we hold our suppliers, and our published Social Compliance Audit Content guides third-party audits.\n\nTo determine audit scope and frequency, we evaluate our supplier base against multiple criteria, including where facilities are located, what products they produce and inherent industry risks. At a minimum, we require social compliance audits for all Our Brands food and non-food products and unbranded products (such as bulk produce) processed at facilities outside the U.S. We also require audits for direct-import national-brand products where Kroger is the importer of record. The scope will likely expand to include some suppliers\u2019 U.S. facilities as part of our expanded Human Rights Policy.\n\nThroughout 2021, continued pandemic-related travel restrictions extended our use of virtual compliance audits where on-site visits were not possible. These virtual audits provided ongoing visibility and accountability for Kroger\u2019s Social Compliance Program. We also continued to use and expand the reach of the Worker Voice Survey during audits as a complementary mechanism for workers to raise concerns.\n\nWorker Voice\n\nOur social compliance program is designed to monitor and help improve working conditions for people in our global supply chain. In 2021, ELEVATE helped facilitate an expanded Worker Voice Survey to capture workers\u2019 direct feedback and insights about working in our suppliers\u2019 production facilities. The scope included:\n\n- 11 countries\n- 333 international production sites\n- 14K workers\n- 63% women (37% men)\n- 18\u201349 age range for survey respondents\n\nRisk-Based Approach\n\nKroger engages consultant ELEVATE to regularly assess Kroger\u2019s supply chain and apply segmentation based on social and environmental risk. Through the process, we classify primary product and commodity categories in our supply chain based on two dimensions:\n\n- Risk level (high, medium or low)\n- Kroger\u2019s ability to influence risk in the supply chain (high, medium or low leverage)\n\nThe assessment draws on various indices, compiling information on labor, health and safety, environmental, ethics, and management systems to assign risk and influence levels. This helps refine our approach to prioritizing social compliance audits in areas of higher concern. In 2021, we added a human rights policy gap analysis and risk assessment to inform an expanded commitment to respecting human rights in our global supply chain. These findings provide valuable insight into which populations are most vulnerable\u2014and where\u2014and how we can improve human rights governance.\n\nWe continually review incoming audits for violations of our Vendor Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and other key policies. Our Social Compliance team developed a Traveler\u2019s Checklist to raise internal awareness about indicators of supply chain human rights issues. We encourage associates to use this tool when visiting supplier facilities to identify potential concerns and notify our Responsible Sourcing team, which determines whether follow-up action is needed.\n\nWhere potential issues or allegations are identified, the Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee and/or Human Rights Working Group activates the relevant policy framework and our established issue management protocol to evaluate the situation and take appropriate action.\nCorrective Action Plans\nIn the spirit of continual improvement, when audits identify issues we expect suppliers to develop time-bound corrective action plans (CAPs) and report progress.\n\nLack of transparency during the audit process may be an indicator of more egregious issues, so we make our expectations of transparency clear to all suppliers. When suppliers have repeated non-transparency findings in their audits, we work with them directly to resolve the issue, or we terminate the supply agreement if the issue persists.\n\nZero-tolerance violations are a different matter. Findings that fall into this category include evidence of forced labor or child labor, or attempted bribery. Depending on the situation, we may suspend or terminate the supply contract, following our established issue management protocol.\n\nIn 2021, approximately 31% of completed audits resulted in approved facilities receiving CAPs for minor violations to be fixed within 12 months, while 59% resulted in conditional approval with a CAP required to be completed over either six or 12 months. Additionally, 10% of audits identified zero-tolerance violations and, if permitted, the suppliers corrected violations immediately. Our objective is to reduce the number of zero-tolerance findings in our supply chain over time.\n\nSocial Compliance Audit Findings\n2019\u20132021\n\n| Year | Approved Facilities | Approved with CAPs | Zero-Tolerance Findings |\n|------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| 2019 | 17%                 | 58%                | 25%                     |\n| 2020 | 32%                 | 53%                | 15%                     |\n| 2021 | 31%                 | 59%                | 10%                     |\n\nIncreased Accountability\nKroger carefully monitors known and emerging risks across product categories and global supplier networks. Our Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee meets at least monthly to discuss and manage critical topics. An extended team provides subject matter expertise on key areas of enhanced monitoring and engagement, including human rights, animal welfare, chemical safety and apparel production.\n\nOur centralized vendor management system\u2014Supplier Hub\u2014is designed to enable a thorough identification process for external suppliers. Through it, we gather information on supplier compliance with our goals, relevant company initiatives and U.S. food safety standards. Supplier Hub provides a mechanism for alerting our teams and preventing payment to suppliers not in compliance. Planned enhancements to the system will provide additional mechanisms to monitor items in production at suppliers\u2019 global facilities.\n\nRegulatory Compliance\nKroger is committed to product safety and quality. Our suppliers must comply with regulatory requirements pertaining to product safety, as well as meeting or exceeding Kroger\u2019s quality, safety and performance requirements. Our dedicated General Merchandise group maintains a General Merchandise Regulatory Compliance and Quality Assurance Program, which outlines product-testing requirements for Our Brands general merchandise.\n\nTo enhance responsible disposal of select products, our Environmental Compliance team has implemented simpler processes for store disposal of unsalable hazardous products and store-use chemicals that are beyond their useful life. Additionally, working with UL WERCSmart, we provide accurate disposal information directly to stores and distribution centers. We use licensed hazardous waste vendors to remove materials from our sites and properly manage disposal, reuse, recycling or destruction.\nAnimal Welfare\n\nThe welfare of animals in our protein supply chain has long been a priority for Kroger. The company\u2019s Corporate Food Technology (CFT) team leads our approach to animal welfare in the context of animal agriculture and sustainable protein production, with oversight from senior leaders and the Public Responsibilities Committee of the board.\n\nKroger is committed to advancing the welfare of animals that produce food while balancing other critical strategic ESG priorities that affect people and our planet. We work with suppliers, animal welfare experts and other stakeholders to advance standards that protect workers and animals, and that preserve access to affordable proteins for our customers.\n\nOur Approach\n\nKroger is not directly involved in raising or processing any animals in our protein supply chain. We require suppliers to adopt industry-accepted animal welfare standards and provide specific welfare audit results for verification annually.\n\nKroger\u2019s efforts are led by an internal Animal Welfare Working Group of leaders from CFT; Ethics & Compliance; Merchandising; Sourcing; and Corporate Affairs teams. We engage third-party experts on beef, dairy, pork and poultry through an external Animal Welfare Advisory Council, suppliers and other experts to define outcome-based welfare standards and third-party auditing plans in alignment with the Five Domains. Our primary focus remains advancing animal welfare for laying hens, pigs, broiler chickens, and beef and dairy cattle.\n\nWe expect our suppliers to follow animal welfare guidelines certified by the Professional Animal Auditor Certification Organization (PAACO).\n\nFor more details, please see our Animal Welfare Update.\n\nLaying Hens\n\nKroger continues to work with suppliers, animal welfare experts and other stakeholders to support the transition to higher-welfare laying hen housing systems. As we transition our reporting to align with Sustainability Accounting Standards Board disclosure guidelines for food retailers, we are restating our progress on hen housing. In 2021, cage-free eggs represented 45.9% of total egg revenue company-wide (2020: 41.9%; 2019: 39.4%). Progress on cage-free egg units is noted in the table on page 15.\n\nWe continue to encourage customer engagement by investing in prices and promotions, featuring cage-free eggs in weekly advertising circulars and dedicating preferred shelf space to cage-free or higher-welfare options. We also encourage suppliers to adopt cage-free or higher-welfare standards for egg production, based on demand and in ways that preserve affordability for our customers.\n\nAdvancing Progress\n\nWith a commitment to continual improvement, we evaluate and update our Animal Welfare Policy annually as needed, based on input from global experts. In 2023, we will transition the foundation of our policy from the Five Freedoms to the Five Domains of Animal Welfare, an internationally respected approach that emphasizes current animal science and outcome-based standards.\n\nDuring the next year, we will work with our Animal Welfare Advisory Council, suppliers and other experts to define outcome-based welfare standards and third-party auditing plans in alignment with the Five Domains. Our primary focus remains advancing animal welfare for laying hens, pigs, broiler chickens, and beef and dairy cattle.\n\nWe expect our suppliers to follow animal welfare guidelines certified by the Professional Animal Auditor Certification Organization (PAACO).\n\nFor more details, please see our Animal Welfare Update.\n\nThe Future of Egg Farming\n\nIn late 2021, Kroger and Kipster Farms, the innovative egg production system founded in the Netherlands, announced a strategic partnership to bring the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral, cage-free eggs to our customers in the U.S. These Simple Truth\u00ae and Kipster eggs will be produced in a closed-loop system that aligns with high health and animal welfare standards.\n\nThis new Kipster Farms production system goes beyond today\u2019s cage-free standard for hen housing to advance positive impacts for people, animals and our planet.\n\nMPS Egg Farms, a long-standing Kroger supplier based in North Manchester, IN, is building the first U.S. production facility using the proprietary Kipster Farms system. It\u2019s designed as a circular system, in which chickens help upcycle food waste into eggs, meat and fertile manure. Kipster is the only egg farmer in the world to farm with such a high level of circularity.\n\nThe new Simple Truth\u00ae and Kipster eggs will further expand the brand\u2019s line of more sustainable choices as part of the Our Brands product portfolio. Simple Truth\u00ae and Kipster eggs are expected to be available in select stores in early 2023.\n\nThe system:\n\n- Incorporates the highest standards of animal welfare, providing a cage-free, natural-like wooded environment with plenty of variety, daylight and outdoor foraging space.\n- Raises roosters for chicken meat.\n- Uses chicken feed made from a majority of surplus food from bakeries and other food producers, reducing climate impacts compared to standard feed.\n- Minimizes fine particle emissions, resulting in better air quality for farmers and animals.\n- Uses rooftop solar panels to produce clean energy.\nCustomer insights: Among the many learnings in our ESG journey, we recognize that a majority of our customers depend on eggs as an affordable, high-quality protein source. To inform our future egg offering within the context of our ESG strategy, we conducted a detailed customer insights and supply chain review earlier this year. Our updated roadmap for laying hen housing reflects the impact of continued price investments, advancing state legislation and the introduction of new cage-free, carbon-neutral Simple Truth\u00ae and Kipster eggs in early 2023.\n\nSupplier engagement: Going forward, we will continue to offer a variety of eggs to ensure that affordable, healthy protein options are accessible for all Kroger customers. We will work with our suppliers to help ensure the eggs we sell come from farms that advance animal welfare, promote a safe working environment for people, adopt more sustainable methods and provide quality eggs that meet the needs and preferences of all customers.\n\nWe continue to encourage suppliers to adopt higher-welfare systems aligned with our commitment to advance customer demand, accessibility and affordability. Regardless of the housing system used, we expect all egg suppliers to align with United Egg Producers animal care guidelines and audits.\n\nUpdated goal: Given the current rate of industry progress and consumers\u2019 desire for affordability, we do not expect to achieve our 2025 commitment. Kroger anticipates transitioning about 70% of eggs sold (by units) to cage-free or higher-welfare standards by 2030. We will strive for continued progress beyond 2030, expected in large part from our investment in bringing the innovative Kipster Farms system from the Netherlands to the U.S., depending on customer engagement.\n\nKroger anticipates investing about $45 million to support this roadmap to 2030, including investments in sourcing agreements, pricing, promotions and merchandising.\n\nPigs\nWhile there is no single, agreed-upon standard for sow housing, we encourage suppliers to use the minimum time necessary in individual stalls to enhance sow health and welfare, protect workers and preserve access to affordable fresh pork. Our goal is to achieve 100% of fresh pork and bacon from sows in group housing systems by 2025. We define group housing as housing systems where sows are moved to group pens for the middle phase of gestation as early as possible, no later than six weeks after breeding.\n\nCustomer insights: To inform our fresh pork offering within the context of our ESG strategy, we conducted a detailed customer insights and supply chain review earlier this year. Our roadmap to achieving the 2025 goal reflects input from suppliers, animal welfare experts and other stakeholders.\n\nSupplier engagement: Kroger\u2019s sourcing agreements expect suppliers to use group housing systems and provide third-party audits to verify progress going forward. Our sow housing requirements will include continued diligence with fresh pork suppliers to help ensure standards are in place for supplier-owned production facilities and other third-party-operated facilities that may be in our fresh pork supply chain. Future sow housing and pork welfare management will align to the Five Domains and outcome-based measures of welfare, to be outlined in the next year.\n\nProgress update: Given our suppliers\u2019 expected transition to group housing systems over time, we anticipate achieving these milestones toward our goal: 65% by 2023; 75% by 2024; and 100% by 2025. Kroger anticipates investments in 2023 to support suppliers\u2019 transition to group housing through sourcing agreements.\n\nBroiler Chickens\nWe strive to promote higher-welfare practices among suppliers raising chickens as an affordable fresh protein option. We aim to achieve the following welfare enhancements for at least 50% of our Simple Truth Organic\u00ae and Simple Truth Natural\u00ae fresh chicken:\n\n- Maximum stocking density of 6.0 pounds per square foot and prohibit broiler cages\n- Enriched environments, including litter and lighting\n- Processing in a manner that avoids pre-stun handling and uses a controlled atmosphere system (CAS) to induce an irreversible stun\n\nGoing forward, we expect suppliers to verify progress on these goals through third-party audits. We recognize that the industry\u2019s pace of transition to CAS may limit our ability to achieve that element of our goal.\n\nOther Welfare Updates\n\nDairy: Cooperatives supplying milk to Kroger\u2019s manufacturing plants and Our Brands grocery assortment must be in good standing with the National Dairy Farmers Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) Program, supporting our goal to sell 100% FARM-sourced milk. Kroger takes proactive steps to improve animal welfare oversight through sourcing contracts with milk cooperatives, using measures such as frequent welfare audits. We are also a signatory to the U.S. Dairy Stewardship Commitment, supporting efforts to measure and improve dairy production impacts on people and our planet.\n\nBeef: More than 99% of fresh beef in Kroger\u2019s supply chain is from suppliers\u2019 U.S.-based production facilities. We continue to work with suppliers to advance animal welfare for cattle in our beef supply chain.\n\nFish: We recognize the growing body of work related to advancing fish welfare in farm-raised and wild-caught operations and processing. Kroger is engaging animal welfare experts, industry groups and other stakeholders to frame a specific approach to fish welfare going forward.\n\nFor more details, please see our Animal Welfare Update.\nTo address the complex issues most relevant to our business, we continue to learn from internal and external stakeholders through the materiality assessment process and ongoing engagement.

Data Tables\n\n### Energy & Emissions\n\n| Energy Consumption | Amount | Unit | Amount | Unit | Change vs. 2020 |\n|--------------------|--------|------|--------|------|-----------------|\n| Total fuel consumed | 4,664,811 | MWh | 1,668,070 | GJ | 20.7% |\n| Stationary sources (natural gas, propane, fuel oils) | 3,405,894 | MWh | 1,238,070 | GJ | 11.0% |\n| Mobile sources (diesel, gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas, jet fuel) | 1,256,917 | MWh | 4,536,060 | GJ | 58.3% |\n| Renewable fuel | - | MWh | - | GJ | 0.0% |\n| Total electricity consumed | 7,063,702 | MWh | 2,546,070 | GJ | -2.0% |\n| Renewable electricity | 186,533 | MWh | 6,726,050 | GJ | 2.2% |\n| Total Energy Consumed | 11,728,513 | MWh | 4,228,070 | GJ | 5.9% |\n\n1. This data reflects the vast majority of Kroger\u2019s operations, with a few exceptions\n2. Using each fuel type\u2019s heat content value, we were able to convert each fuel source from total gallons to therms and then MWh\n3. This data reflects renewable electricity consumed as a result of renewable power generated at our facilities or purchased directly from our utility providers. It does not account for renewable power consumed passively as a result of the \u201cgreening of the grid\u201d\n\n### Carbon Emissions\n\n| Carbon Emissions | Amount | Unit | Change vs. 2020 |\n|------------------|--------|------|-----------------|\n| Direct (Scope 1) emissions | 2,303,388 | tCO2e | +11.2% |\n| Stationary | 601,481 | tCO2e | +8.1% |\n| Mobile | 319,266 | tCO2e | +58.2% |\n| Fugitive | 1,382,641 | tCO2e | +5.3% |\n| Indirect (Scope 2) emissions (location-based) | 2,747,205 | tCO2e | -9% |\n| Indirect (Scope 2) emissions (market-based) | 2,948,060 | tCO2e | -8% |\n| Total Corporate (Scope 1 and 2) emissions (location-based) | 5,050,593 | tCO2e | -0.8% |\n| Total Corporate (Scope 1 and 2) emissions (market-based) | 5,251,448 | tCO2e | -0.5% |\n| Indirect (Scope 3) emissions (partial) | 2,398,328 | tCO2e | +14.5% |\n\n1. We used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting Standard, the Operational Control approach and Global Warming Potentials from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 \u2013 100 year). The base year for our footprint is 2006, when we first started measuring it\n2. Scope 1 and 2 emissions reflect CO2, CH4, N2O and HFC gases. Details are disclosed in our CDP Climate response. Offsets were not used in our calculations\n3. Scope 3 emissions reflect the following categories: fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2); upstream transportation and distribution (partial); waste generated in operations; business travel and employee commuting\n\n### Energy Intensity\n\n| Energy Intensity | Amount | Unit | Amount | Unit | Change vs. 2020 |\n|------------------|--------|------|--------|------|-----------------|\n| Energy intensity per square foot | 51.23 | MWh/1,000 ft\u00b2 | 1.84E+02 | MWh/1,000 ft\u00b2 | 4.3% |\n| Normalizing factor: facility footprint | 228,945 | 1,000 ft\u00b2 | - | - | - |\n\n1. The energy intensity calculation reflects total energy consumed within the organization\n\n### Carbon Intensity\n\n| Carbon Intensity | Amount | Unit | Change vs. 2020 |\n|------------------|--------|------|-----------------|\n| Total corporate carbon emissions intensity per square foot | 22.94 | tCO2e/1,000 ft\u00b2 | -2.03% |\n| Normalizing factor: facility footprint | 228,945 | 1,000 ft\u00b2 | - |\n\n1. Our normalized emissions (per 1,000 square feet) decreased from 23.41 to 22.94. This calculation has been adjusted for 2020 and 2021 to reflect market-based Scope 2 emissions (previously, it reflected location-based Scope 2 emissions)\n\n### Health & Safety\n\n| Metric | Associates | Contractors |\n|--------|------------|-------------|\n| Injury Rate (OSHA Injuries/100 full-time employees (FTE)) | 3.16 | 3.05 |\n| Lost Day Rate (OSHA Lost Time Rate/100 FTE) | 2.53 | 2.44 |\n\n1. Injury rate includes injuries greater than minor injuries (first aid) per OSHA reporting requirements\n2. We classify lost days as calendar days.
