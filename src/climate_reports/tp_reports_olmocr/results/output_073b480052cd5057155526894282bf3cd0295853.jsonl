We do all of this while staying true to our purpose: to refresh the world and make a difference.\nChairman & CEO Message\n\nOur people worked with great dedication in 2021 to help our company emerge stronger from the pandemic and position ourselves for continued growth in 2022 and beyond. We made important decisions about streamlining our brand portfolio; changing the way we work as an organization; and tailoring our investments to target the most promising products and priorities. Through all of the challenges, initiatives and successes of 2021, our environmental, social and governance priorities continued to be embedded in our business and the way we work.\n\nAn Integrated Business\n\nOur environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities are integrated into our strategy. We\u2019re focused on areas where we can have a measurable, positive impact on the communities we serve around the world.\n\nOur ESG initiatives are interconnected, and so are the solutions we support. We seek an exponentially greater impact by fostering collective action: partnering across industry, government and society to address shared challenges.\n\nWater is a top business priority. It is the principal ingredient in the products we make and is critical for the agricultural products we use. Through the 2030 Water Security Strategy we announced in 2021, we\u2019re focused on achieving water security where the company operates and sources ingredients, concentrating on water-stressed areas\u2014while maintaining 100% replenishment globally.\n\nIn 2021, we returned 167% of the water used in our finished beverages to nature and communities. Since 2010, our water, sanitation and hygiene programs have reached more than 18.5 million people globally.\n\nWe also continue to make meaningful progress on our World Without Waste packaging initiative. We\u2019re continuing to invest in partnerships with innovators and NGOs like our PlantBottle\u2122 partners, World Wildlife Fund and The Ocean Cleanup. We\u2019ve also set new targets, including a virgin plastic reduction goal and an industry-leading goal to significantly boost our use of reusable packaging.\n\nBy 2030, the company aims to have at least 25% of volume globally across our portfolio of brands sold in refillable/returnable glass or plastic bottles, or in refillable containers through traditional fountain or Coca-Cola Freestyle dispensers. We believe that increasing the Coca-Cola system\u2019s usage of refillable/returnable containers creates value for customers and consumers, drives increased package collection and simultaneously reduces our carbon footprint.\n\nWater risks and packaging waste are closely linked to climate change. We\u2019re reducing our carbon footprint through an intertwined and holistic approach across our ESG priorities. Our vision is for packaging to be reused and recycled as part of a circular economy\u2014which means a world with dramatically lower carbon emissions and climate impacts.\n\nCombating the climate crisis requires a global effort, which is why we worked with experts to set science-based targets. In 2021, we announced that we made solid progress to decarbonize our system by achieving our \u201cdrink in your hand\u201d goal. We\u2019ve increased our ambitions through our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions target to reduce absolute emissions by 25%, and our long-term ambition is to be net zero carbon by 2050.\n\nIn 2021, we took action to create a better shared future through investments in economic empowerment; diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI); and giving through The Coca-Cola Foundation. We\u2019ve refreshed the company\u2019s global DEI strategy to reflect the need for greater global reach, broader impact and a focus on equity and economic empowerment.\n\nThroughout our company\u2019s rich, 136-year history, we\u2019ve seen many changes and overcome times of uncertainty. Our system\u2019s strength and resilience have helped us adapt while remaining true to our purpose: to refresh the world and make a difference.\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019re using our global presence to build a more sustainable future for our business and the planet while staying laser-focused on growth. In 2021, our networked way of working drove strong results, and I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve achieved.\u201d\n\nWe aspire for our workforce to mirror the markets we serve. In 2021, we set a 2030 aspiration to mirror U.S. census data for race and ethnicity at all job levels of our company in the United States. We also recommitted to our aspiration to be 50% led by women globally, with a target of 2030.\n\nIn 2021, The Coca-Cola Foundation continued to support communities\u2019 response to the pandemic with the creation of a $20 million fund to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Alongside our Project Last Mile partners, we have used our supply chain, distribution and marketing expertise to support vaccine rollout in a number of African markets, as well as leveraging our network of cold-chain partners.\n\nWe measure success by the value we create for shareowners while also creating a better shared future for people, communities and the planet. We\u2019re using data to measure and drive this success. Going forward, our ESG goals are a factor in our compensation program for top executives. You can read more details in our Governance & Management section.\n\nBuilding Brands and Creating Value\n\nWe are a total beverage company, and our focus is on creating a portfolio of great-tasting drinks and loved brands with the greatest potential to attract more consumers. During the pandemic, we evaluated our entire portfolio and tailored our investments. Today, we are focusing on approximately 200 master brands.\n\nWe\u2019ve increased our innovation efforts, including sparkling and plant-based beverages as well as new entries in flavored alcohol beverages. Our efforts are designed for long-term success\u2014we\u2019re balancing big bets with intelligent experimentation, learning from failures and scaling successes.\n\nOur 2021 successes include:\n\n\u2022 We expanded some of our strongest brands to more markets, such as Coke\u00ae with Coffee, fairlife\u00ae, AHA\u00ae and Topo Chico\u00ae Hard Seltzer. fairlife\u00ae is now a $1 billion brand with seven consecutive years of double-digit volume growth.\n\n\u2022 We rolled out a new and improved formulation of Coca-Cola\u00ae Zero Sugar, which helped the brand grow volume by double digits in 2021. The new formula has driven accelerated growth in 80% of the markets where it was launched.\n\n\u2022 We acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in BODYARMOR, giving us a line of sports performance and hydration beverages with significant potential for long-term growth.\n\nOur backbone is a global system of strong partnerships with approximately 225 bottlers supported by leading edge technology. In 2021, we worked together to build a networked global organization, combining the power of scale with the deep knowledge and cross-functional collaboration required to win locally. Together, we\u2019re focusing on what we do best\u2014building brands and products that people love and enjoy, and growing markets for those brands.\n\nA Better Shared Future\n\nOur purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference. Our company and system employees make this possible every day. Together, we\u2019re using our global presence to build a more sustainable future for our business and the planet while staying laser-focused on growth. In 2021, our networked way of working drove strong results, and I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve achieved. I\u2019m confident we will accomplish even more in 2022.\n\nJames Quincey\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nApril 26, 2022\nThe Coca-Cola Company is staying focused on what matters most: its people and purpose. Although 2021 brought continued change across the world, our Board of Directors is proud of how the company remained centered on its key priorities and navigated many challenges to emerge stronger. This strong performance heading into 2022 is indicative of the company\u2019s resilience, laying the groundwork for continued success and growth.\n\nMaria Elena Lagomasino\nLead Independent Director\n\nNote: Board composition and committee positions reflected as of the completion of the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareowners.\nExecutive Summary\n\nOur Priorities & Progress\n\nOur publicly reported sustainability goals drive us to continually improve, working in concert with The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s approximately 225 bottling partners in more than 200 countries and territories.\n\nWater Leadership\n\nOur 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing water security through a context-based approach to water replenishment, advocacy for smart water policies and responsible water use across our operations and supply chain. We\u2019re using the size and scale of our company to improve water security where water risks impact our business, supply chain and communities.\n\nOur strategy is underpinned by global goals and specific context-based targets that will enable us to measure our progress toward reaching our vision. Our global goals for 2030 fall under three pillars\u2014Our Operations, Our Communities and Our Watersheds\u2014with one additional cross-cutting goal: maintaining at least 100% global replenishment of the water used in our finished beverages.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, we analyzed water-related risks to identify priority operating facilities. We are mapping priority ingredient sourcing regions and watersheds according to highest exposure to water stress. We are also mapping priority communities based on local context to identify opportunities for action to strengthen communities\u2019 access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and their resilience to climate change.\n\nBy mapping and overlaying all three of these categories (operations, watersheds and communities), we will identify overlaps and interconnectivity across our action areas to develop a holistic, integrated and context-based approach.\n\n167% of the water used in our finished beverages returned to nature and communities in 2021.\n\n18.5M+ people provided access to safely drinking water, sanitation and hygiene since 2010.\n\nOur Total Beverage Portfolio\n\nOffering More Choices and Reducing Added Sugar\n\nFor more than a century, our company has been known for our refreshing beverages. Over the decades, we\u2019ve continued to evolve, and today we offer a lineup of beverages across five categories\u2014including drinks with less added sugar and beverages with enhanced nutrition benefits. We have streamlined our lineup, focusing on brands with the greatest potential to scale and grow.\n\nWe continue to prioritize added sugar reduction. We have adjusted recipes to reduce added sugar, promote low- and no-calorie beverage options and make packages smaller to enable portion control.\n\nInvestment in sweetener research and sugar alternatives is important, especially for those alternatives that can provide low- and no-calorie beverage options. We have invested more than $100 million in sweetener innovation and sugar reduction research since 2008, while the industry as a whole has invested over $1 billion during the same time period.\n\nIn 2021, average sugar per 100 ml declined while global volume grew. In 2020, both average sugar per 100 ml and volume declined, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n28% of our volume sold in 2021 was low- or no-calorie.\n\nCoca-Cola Zero Sugar grew by double digits in 108 countries and territories in 2021.\n\nOur Total Beverage Portfolio\n\nOffering More Choices and Reducing Added Sugar\n\nFor more than a century, our company has been known for our refreshing beverages.

Read more about our partnerships in World Without Waste.\n\nClimate\n\nWe have a responsibility to reduce the carbon footprint of our value chain, to improve business resilience by managing the short- and long-term risks and impacts of a changing climate, and to foster partnerships that drive positive change.\n\nOur approach to addressing climate change has accelerated in recent years in keeping with the scale and urgency of the issue. Even as we achieved our 2020 \u201cdrink in your hand\u201d goal to reduce our relative carbon emissions by 25% against a 2010 baseline, we increased our climate ambition.\n\nWe\u2019ve announced both our science-based target to reduce absolute emissions by 25% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline and an ambition to be net zero carbon by 2050. Several of our bottling partners have announced their own science-based targets and net zero pledges, which will help drive even more climate action across the Coca-Cola system.\n\nIn line with our net zero ambition, we conducted preliminary modeling in 2021 that will enable us to define the key actions and goals needed for a net zero transition to 2050.\n\nRead more Climate\n\n1 Only recyclable where infrastructure exists.\n2 Includes select primary consumer packaging materials.\n3 The collection rates represent average collection rates for select primary consumer packaging, which is the percentage of our packaging that was collected for recycling (or refill).\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company applies the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in this report and in a TCFD Index and provides comprehensive disclosures to CDP on Climate Change.\n\n4 We recently implemented a new data system for collecting sustainability metrics and continually work toward ensuring that our practices are industry-leading. In 2021, we took significant steps to help facilitate complete and accurate progress reporting against our science-based target. We updated our GHG emissions accounting methodology for the Coca-Cola system aligned with the GHG Protocol and undertook an assessment to evaluate and expand the emissions sources included within our reporting boundary to align with requirements of the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). In 2022, we plan to track our target progress in real-time across the system, putting us in a strong position to publicly report on progress against our target next year.\nSustainable Agriculture\n\nWe rely on agricultural ingredients to make and package our beverages. Ensuring these ingredients are sustainably sourced is a key priority for us, essential to our efforts on climate resilience, water security, human rights, sustainable packaging and economic empowerment. As climate change leads to more extreme weather and increased water stress, more sustainable agricultural practices will play a vital role in promoting resilience across our supply chain and in the communities that produce our agricultural ingredients.\n\nWe track progress against our sustainable sourcing goal for 12 global priority ingredients: cane sugar, mango, grape, orange, apple, corn, lemon, beet sugar, tea, pulp and paper, coffee and soybean. Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) advance and standardize our core values at the farm level\u2014from small-scale farmer cooperatives to large commercial operations\u2014supporting livelihoods and helping to ensure continuity of supply. Introduced in 2021 to improve upon our previous Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP), the PSA aim to strengthen our progress toward sustainable sourcing of agricultural ingredients.\n\nWe are currently in the process of mapping the volume of the 12 global priority ingredients we procure against the PSA framework.\n\nHuman Rights\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company\u2019s policies and practices are aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which we have supported since their inception in 2011. We work to embed respect for human rights across our system through a comprehensive framework of policies, stakeholder engagement, due diligence and remediation.\n\nWe maintain an industry-leading global audit program of our own operations, as well as those of our bottling partners and Tier 1 suppliers, with over 38,000 human rights assessments conducted since 2003. As of the end of 2021, 95% of our own operations, 93% of system bottlers and 92% of our Tier 1 suppliers complied with our rigorous Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP) protocols. These audit results are reviewed by the ESG and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors on an annual basis.\n\nDespite falling short of our ambitious goals due to the impact of COVID-19, these results show remarkable improvement across our value chain. We will continue to advance our human rights strategy and work.\n\n1 Data is based on supplier reporting according to our requirements, which is consolidated and internally validated. Results can fluctuate due to changes in volumes and sourcing origins while we get new suppliers on board with our requirements.\n\n2 This bar graph shows progress towards total sustainable sourcing of all 12 global priority ingredients, combined, using third-party validation programs approved under our PSA, effective 2021, alongside progress against our previous SAGP, effective 2013-2020. The company is working to finalize our benchmarking of third-party validation against the PSA standard, including verifications accepted under the SAGP but for which benchmarking continues in 2022.\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nWe believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace makes us stronger as a company, enables us to create a better shared future for employees and communities, empowers access to equal opportunity, and builds belonging in our workplaces and in society. In 2021, we refreshed our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) strategy to expand the global reach and impact of our programs and policies while driving accountability.\n\nOur refreshed DEI strategy is rooted in three long-term ambitions:\n\n1. We aspire for our diverse workforce to mirror the markets we serve.\n2. We strive for equity for all people.\n3. We celebrate uniqueness and create an inclusive environment.\n\nMirroring the Markets We Serve by 2030: 2021 Progress\n\n2021 Global Gender Representation in Senior Management\n\n2021 Total U.S. Race/Ethnicity Representation\n\nGiving Back\n\nThe Coca-Cola Foundation, the independent philanthropic arm of The Coca-Cola Company, is committed to a charitable giving strategy that makes a difference in communities around the world.

Grants included $5 million in funding to Project Last Mile to support vaccine rollouts in eight African countries.\n\n2.0% of operating income invested back into local communities from The Coca-Cola Company and The Coca-Cola Foundation in 2021\u2014well above our annual goal of 1%.\n\n$1.4B+ DONATED by The Coca-Cola Foundation since its inception in 1984.\n\n1 Data as of December 31, 2021, for salaried and hourly employees.

As part of our networked, global organization, we are continuing to curate and innovate a tailored collection of global, regional and local brands that are organized within the following five categories.\nAccelerating Innovation Across Our Portfolio\n\nThe consumer remains at the heart of everything we do as we provide drinks for every occasion. New innovations, such as the products shown here, are designed with scalability in mind to have staying power across markets and to support our growth.\n\nTrademark\nCoca-Cola\n\nNew Coca-Cola Zero Sugar\nOur newly reformulated recipe for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar provides a more refreshing and delicious taste with no changes to ingredients or nutritional values. The new recipe hit store shelves in the United States and Canada in the summer of 2021.\n\nSparkling Flavors\n\u201cWhat The Fanta\u201d Mystery Flavor\nIn Europe in 2021, we brought back our \u201cWhat The Fanta\u201d campaign for a second year, featuring a \u201cmystery\u201d blue, zero-sugar flavor. To find out the flavor, customers could scan the QR code on-pack to unlock a series of online clues. The previous year, a campaign for a \u201cmystery\u201d green flavor drove five times the rate of sales as traditional Fanta Orange during the same period.\n\nHydration, Sports, Coffee & Tea\nBODYARMOR\nIn 2021, we acquired full ownership of BODYARMOR, a line of sports performance and hydration beverages that has significant potential for long-term growth. In 2021, BODYARMOR launched BODYARMOR Edge, which combines the hydration of a sports drink with a boost of natural caffeine.\n\nNutrition, Juice, Dairy & Plant-Based Beverages\nfairlife Nutrition Plan Shake\nfairlife Nutrition Plan is an ultra-filtered milk nutrition shake with 30 grams of high-quality protein, 2 grams of sugar and 150 calories. In 2022, fairlife announced that it surpassed $1 billion in annual retail sales.\n\nEmerging Beverages\nTopo Chico\nHard Seltzer\nTopo Chico Hard Seltzer blends sparkling water and natural flavors and is inspired by Topo Chico sparkling mineral water\u2019s 125-year heritage and growing popularity as a craft cocktail mixer. Four flavors\u2014Tangy Lemon Lime, Exotic Pineapple, Strawberry Guava and Tropical Mango\u2014are offered in variety packs, and select flavors are offered in single-serve slim cans.\nEncouraging Collective Action\n\nWe believe our company\u2019s ESG goals and progress can make a difference for our business, communities and the planet. We also know we can\u2019t achieve these goals alone.\n\nTo encourage collective action, we\u2019re raising awareness and communicating the importance of recycling, water stewardship and other ESG priorities through our brands and company communications channels.\n\nHere are just a few examples of how we\u2019ve engaged with consumers in recent years:\n\n**Never Settle**\nIn 26 European markets, we ran our #neversettle campaign, which focused on our company\u2019s work around waste reduction, water stewardship and youth unemployment. The series of films, social media posts and advertisements shared how we are helping to solve some of the world\u2019s most urgent challenges.\n\n**Help Us Recycle**\nIn Belgium and The Netherlands, we launched the \u201cHelp Us Recycle\u201d campaign, designed to raise awareness of recycling and motivate consumers to pitch in.\n\n**Recycle Me Again**\nConsumers play an important role in achieving a circular economy. To support the launch of our new 100% rPET bottles (excluding caps and labels) in the United States, we ran the \u201cRecycle Me Again\u201d campaign. Each bottle included a prominent message urging people to help give the bottles another life\u2014again and again.\n\n**Label-Less Bottles**\nIn South Korea, we launched the nation\u2019s first label-less sparkling water product, Seagram\u2019s, where the product name and logo are engraved on the bottle itself. By removing the label, it helps make it easier to recycle the bottle.\n\n**National Recycling Week**\nWe want to make it as easy as possible for people to do their part to turn the tide on plastic waste. In Australia, we teamed up with Planet Ark during National Recycling Week to help educate consumers on recycling\u2014including what to recycle, how to recycle and where to recycle.\nGovernance & Management\n\nCorporate Governance\nAt The Coca-Cola Company, our business principles and practices are designed to foster an innovative and collaborative culture\u2014a culture that is committed to ethical behavior, accountability and transparency. The company\u2019s Board of Directors has established several committees to assist in discharging its governance duties. These are an Audit Committee, a Talent and Compensation Committee, a Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance, a Finance Committee, an ESG and Public Policy Committee and an Executive Committee. The charter for each committee can be viewed on our website, along with information about the company\u2019s corporate governance, including our Code of Business Conduct, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Certificate of Incorporation and Corporate By-laws. For more information or to contact us, visit our website.\n\nESG Governance\nThe ESG and Public Policy Committee assists the Board in overseeing the company\u2019s policies and programs\u2014and related risks to the company\u2014that concern environmental, social, legislative, regulatory and public policy matters, including progress against the company\u2019s ESG goals. The Committee\u2019s scope includes public issues of significance that may affect the company\u2019s business, our shareowners, the broader stakeholder community or the general public. This entails evaluating and reviewing information pertaining to social, political and environmental trends, in addition to oversight of the company\u2019s ESG goals and human rights practices.\n\nIn addition to its previously stated responsibilities, the ESG and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors oversees and reviews, at least annually, the company\u2019s public policy agenda, its position on significant public policy matters, political contributions, and lobbying activities. The Committee reviews shareowner proposals on issues within its purview and makes recommendations on the proposals to the Board. In addition, the Committee receives updates on priority ESG issues, including information on actions and progress toward goals. Annually, the Committee conducts a self-evaluation, which it presents to the full Board.\n\nThe ESG and Public Policy Committee also bears the highest level of direct responsibility for climate-related issues. For a deeper dive into our climate governance, visit the Climate section.\n\nAdditionally, the company\u2019s Talent and Compensation Committee oversees human capital management policies and strategies across the company, including talent management, leadership and company culture initiatives such as those promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. This senior-level commitment and alignment drives top-down accountability toward our goals for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and helps support a positive company culture.\n\nEmbedding ESG into Executive Compensation\nIn 2022, the Talent and Compensation Committee approved plans to link ESG performance measures to our annual and long-term incentive programs for executives. In the Annual Incentive program, we are reinforcing our commitment to DEI by incorporating demonstrable progress toward goals that reflect our 2030 aspirations to be 50% led by women globally, and, in the United States, to align race and ethnicity representation to U.S. census data. Similarly, in the long-term incentive program, predetermined goals related to the company\u2019s World Without Waste packaging strategy and its 2030 Water Security Strategy have been incorporated into the 2022-2024 incentive awards.\n\nOur Approach to Disclosure\nWe have a comprehensive reporting process that spans many years, and we aim to provide stakeholders with complete, transparent and candid information in all our public communications. This is our fourth annual Business & ESG Report, which combines financial data and sustainability progress and performance in one publication. We also respond to the CDP climate, water and forests questionnaires and make those disclosures publicly available. For our 2021 report, we continue to expand our disclosure, including on public policy, sweetener research, and DEI issues.\n\nWe recognize there is a desire for standardization across reporting frameworks, and we\u2019re continually evaluating reporting options and listening to stakeholder feedback.\n\nThis report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, a globally recognized framework; this is the eleventh year that these principles have informed our reporting process. We provide an index for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and participate in the SASB Advisory Group. We also index to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF).\n\nPublic Policy & Political Engagement\nIn addition to its previously stated responsibilities, the ESG and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors oversees and reviews, at least annually, the company\u2019s public policy agenda, its position on significant public policy matters, political contributions and lobbying activities. In the United States, participation in the political process provides opportunity for meaningful engagement on public policy, regulatory and legislative matters with potential impact on our business.\n\nIn 2021, The Coca-Cola Company suspended contributions to U.S. political candidates. During this time, we strengthened our alignment of government engagement with key issues affecting our business, employees, customers, consumers and shareowners. Building upon equality and inclusion factors we formally incorporated in 2020, we further enhanced our political contributions criteria to ensure consistency with the company\u2019s values. We also increased our disclosures and transparently outlined the non-deductible lobbying amount provided by the company to trade associations and organizations based in the United States in which we have membership. Our participation, contributions and disclosures are routinely reviewed against leading industry standards.\nOur ESG Approach\n\nWe pursue our ESG goals through a concerted effort by The Coca-Cola Company and approximately 225 bottling partners in more than 200 countries and territories. We have robust internal processes and an effective internal control environment that facilitate the identification and management of risks and regular communication with the Board, our Chairman and CEO and internal teams such as the Enterprise Risk Management team, the Risk Steering Committee and the Networked Sustainability team, which includes Technical, Innovation and Supply Chain; Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability; Global Human Rights; Procurement; Legal; and Finance. Beyond this, our networked teams work with operating units, bottling partners, NGOs, governments, investors and people in communities all around the world to identify risks and progress toward our goals. For more about our approach to risk management and priority issues, see Our Priority ESG Issues.\nOur Priority ESG Issues\n\nFocusing on the highest-priority ESG issues for our company, system and stakeholders is a foundational step in how we conduct business and develop our corporate strategy. It is also foundational to how we evolve and report on our business and our ESG progress. Strategies employed against these priority issues are designed to build business resilience and adaptation to current and future disruptions to operations, supply chain and communities in which we operate.\n\nDuring 2019, we undertook a thorough review of our priority issues in collaboration with a cross-functional internal team and key external stakeholders. These stakeholders represented deep expertise across a range of issues and sectors, including NGOs, academia, some of our business partners, suppliers, customers and beyond. We were guided by BSR, a leading sustainability NGO. In 2020, we reviewed our assessment to determine if any of the priority issues had shifted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or the increased global spotlight on social justice. A revised matrix adjusted several key issues to better reflect priority issues.\n\nBoth the 2019 analysis and the 2020 refresh were aligned with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. In 2021, we further strengthened the alignment with our ERM processes and cross-functional teams. The aligned matrix adjusted several key issues to better reflect current ESG priority issues, including: third party service providers, bottling and business partners; information protection and cybersecurity; and political uncertainties and regulation.\n\nAnalyzing our priority issues on a regular basis ensures that we take into consideration the changing social, environmental and economic context as we continue to evolve our business.\nStakeholder Engagement & Partnerships\n\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nCompanies like ours play an important role in helping to create the systemic change necessary to achieve a healthier planet and a more inclusive and sustainable economy.\n\nCollaboration with a multitude of internal and external stakeholders is essential if we are to achieve our purpose of refreshing the world and making a difference. Meaningful partnerships with governments, business and civil society can drive collective action and build shared opportunities for people and communities around the globe.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest and most recognized companies, we have an opportunity to use our size and scale to take on global challenges that require broad collective action, such as fostering excellence in water stewardship, helping eliminate plastic waste and supporting sustainable agriculture. As a global business that operates locally, we can extend our influence and reach because of the strength of the Coca-Cola system, which includes bottling partners in hundreds of communities worldwide.\n\nTransparency and accountability are fundamental elements of our stakeholder engagement approach. We recently added new disclosures on our website to provide an expanded, holistic overview of our stakeholder engagement and scientific research, including details of the journal articles we have authored or funded dating to 2008 in areas such as low- and no-calorie sweetener innovation, hydration, safety and sustainability. Learn more.\n\nPartnerships\n\nPartnerships are an important part of our work to advance ESG goals, in part because many of our goals cannot be achieved on our own. We must join forces with others to address some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nWe have formed partnerships with a range of incredible organizations that are making a difference in areas such as sustainable agriculture, water replenishment and sustainable packaging. Here are some of them:\n\n- For more than a decade, we have partnered with the World Wildlife Fund to improve the health of freshwater basins. In August 2021, we renewed our partnership for three more years.\n- WASH4Work mobilizes business to improve access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in the workplace, in communities and across supply chains. We are aligning with the WASH4Work framework as part of our 2030 Water Security Strategy.\n- The investment management firm Circulate Capital incubates and finances companies and infrastructure that prevent the flow of plastic waste into the world\u2019s oceans and advance the circular economy. In 2021, Circulate Capital announced a $4 million investment in the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Group\u2019s innovation lab to support startups in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n- We\u2019re partnering with TerraCycle and Burger King\u00ae in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Japan to reduce single-use packaging waste by offering reusable cups and food containers.\n- The Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) promotes widespread adoption of sustainable agriculture practices. In 2021, our partnership with SAI Platform led to a significant jump in the percentage of sustainably sourced oranges from Florida groves.\n- The Ocean Cleanup has developed Interceptor\u2122 solutions to stop new plastic from entering the world\u2019s oceans through rivers. We\u2019re partnering with them to place Interceptor solutions in 15 priority rivers.\n\nTo showcase our work and partnerships across a variety of ESG areas, the company held an ESG investor event in 2021, where members of our executive leadership shared progress on the company\u2019s ESG strategy and goals, and how they come to life in the regions.\n\nProject Last Mile is a pioneering, cross-sector partnership to help life-saving medicines\u2014including COVID-19 vaccines\u2014go the last mile in Africa.\nAddressing climate change and eliminating plastic waste are two of our highest priority ESG issues. Although we are taking action within our own operations and across our value chain, these global challenges are far too great for any single company, industry or government to solve on its own. In response, we are using our influence to drive meaningful policy changes in partnership with peer companies, civil society and all levels of government.\n\nClimate Action\n\nIn April 2021, The Coca-Cola Company supported coalitions led by We Mean Business and Ceres in the United States, and by European Parliamentary Environment Committee Chair Pascal Canfin. These coalitions called on the Biden Administration to set an ambitious science-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target for the United States. The response was to establish a target ahead of the COP26 summit, which brings the United States to a position of global climate leadership.\n\nRecognizing our climate advocacy in the United States, in July 2021, Ceres released its report \u201cPracticing Responsible Policy Engagement: How Large U.S. Companies Lobby on Climate Change.\u201d The report highlighted that The Coca-Cola Company \u201chas disclosed its engagements to evolve the (U.S.) Chamber\u2019s climate change positions and lobbying.\u201d The report also noted that we sent a letter encouraging the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to embrace the Business Roundtable\u2019s principles and policies on climate change.\n\nIn the European context, in support of the EU\u2019s Green Deal and Farm-to-Fork strategy, in 2021 we signed up to the EU Code of Conduct on Responsible Food Business and Marketing Practices. This advocacy stance complements our climate actions in collaboration with our two major bottling partners in Europe.\n\nRecycling and Reuse of Plastic\n\nThe role of government regulation in creating a circular economy for our packaging materials is essential to ensure that societies can move from a linear to a circular operating model\u2014one where materials stay in the economy for reuse and recycling and out of the environment. To support governments in the evolution toward better recycling outcomes, we work with them as well as with trade associations to provide evidence of the safety and quality of recycled materials, which in turn leads to increased take-up of recycled materials.\n\nIn 2021, a number of governments around the world established plastic packaging regulations similar to our World Without Waste strategy, helping address both the waste challenge and the climate challenge. The regions that established food/beverage grade acceptance standards for recycled plastic content use include Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The state of California also adopted new recyclability standards.\n\nWe continue to play an active role in driving for progressive policies that help solve environmental challenges, whether that is direct engagement with regulators on recycled PET usage standards or policy advocacy directly or through trade associations.\n\nAdditionally, several regions established minimum recycled content guidelines, including Chile, Ecuador, the European Union, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the United States (California, New Jersey and the state of Washington). Our World Without Waste goals aim for 50% recycled material in all our packages by 2030; regulatory guidelines can help create scale in the supply chain that helps with the economics of recycling and a circular economy.\n\nAlong with increasing recycled content, plastic collection is essential to achieving a truly circular economy. In 2020, we added our voice to the Business Call for a UN Plastic Pollution Treaty calling for a legally binding United Nations treaty on plastic pollution. We also continued to work in partnership with WWF, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the Ocean Plastic Leadership Network to bring diverse stakeholders together to help shape a long-term treaty. In early 2022, the United Nations agreed to start negotiations to draw up a global treaty.\n\n\u201cWhen we work together, we can take meaningful steps to advance a circular economy and reduce waste.\u201d\n\nBea Perez\nSenior Vice President and Chief Communications, Sustainability and Strategic Partnerships Officer, The Coca-Cola Company\nWater Leadership\n\nWater is essential to every person and every ecosystem in the world; it is also essential to the products we make and the agricultural ingredients we use.\n\nOur 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing water security through a context-based approach to water replenishment, advocacy for smart water policies and responsible water use across our operations and supply chain. We\u2019re using the size and scale of our company to improve water security where water risks impact our business, supply chain and communities.\n\n167% of the water used in our finished beverages returned to nature and communities in 2021\n\n18.5M+ people provided access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene since 2010\n\n1 Peer-reviewed methodologies were used to calculate volumetric benefits per project and operating unit; calculated benefits per project and operating unit using peer-reviewed methodologies; all replenish data are internally validated and verified; the equivalent volume for 100% Replenish rate (175 Billion Liters; BL) is externally assured; Benefits fall into three categories: Watershed Protection and Restoration (229.1 BL), Water for Productive Use (47.5 BL) and Water Access and Sanitation (16.7 BL). Due to joint venture or merger and acquisition activities between 2019 - 2021, certain brands may not be accounted for in this metric. Unless otherwise stated, in this report finished beverages is based on global sales volume.\n\n2 Calculated with self-reported and internally validated data.\nOur Water Security Strategy\n\nOur 2030 Water Security Strategy outlines a vision of increasing water security for our operations, watersheds and communities. Water security is defined as the availability of a sufficient quantity and quality of water, access to safe water services and effective governance of shared water resources. It is underpinned by global goals and specific context-based targets that will enable us to measure our progress toward reaching this vision.\n\nOur global goals for 2030 fall under three pillars with one cross-cutting goal, maintaining at least 100% global replenishment of the water used in our finished beverages:\n\n1. Our Operations\n2. Our Communities\n3. Our Watersheds\n\nPrioritization Framework: Operations, Communities and Watersheds\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, we analyzed water-related risks to identify priority operating facilities, which allows us to segment our operations into three categories: Leadership Locations, Advanced Efficiency Locations and Contributing Locations. We catalogued these locations based on the detailed mapping and results from an Enterprise Water Risk Assessment (EWRA) from the World Resources Institute\u2019s Aqueduct 3.0 tool and from Facility Water Vulnerability Assessments (FAWVA), our site-level, internal proprietary tool.\n\nThe categories are defined as:\n\n1. LEADERSHIP LOCATIONS: our highest priority system facility locations and their correlated watersheds that have the highest potential water-related risks. Facilities are on a path toward 100% regenerative water use by 2030. See next page for more on regenerative water use.\n\n2. ADVANCED EFFICIENCY LOCATIONS: system facility locations in a water-stressed context that will drive advanced water efficiency improvements in operations.\n\n3. CONTRIBUTING LOCATIONS: system facility locations in areas with potential low water-related risks yet will contribute to water security overall by meeting 100% compliance with global Coca-Cola Company water stewardship requirements.\n\nWe are mapping priority ingredient sourcing regions and watersheds according to highest exposure to water stress. We also began mapping priority communities based on local context to identify opportunities for action to strengthen communities\u2019 access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and their resilience to climate change (e.g., floods and droughts). By mapping and overlaying all three of these categories (operations, watersheds and communities), we will identify overlaps and interconnectivity across our action areas to develop a holistic, integrated and context-based approach.\nPillar 1 Our Operations\n\nRegenerative Water Use\n\nFollowing the process to identify and segment our priority operating facilities, we are now setting local, context-based targets for these facilities to contribute to the achievement of our 2030 targets for this pillar, which include:\n\n- 100% regenerative water use in all Leadership Locations\n- Drive advanced water efficiency improvements in water-stressed contexts.\n\nWe will also continue to replenish at least 100% of water used in our finished beverages globally.\n\nAll our system production operations around the world will continue to adopt and implement our new Coca-Cola system Water Resource Sustainability Standard, which is aligned with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) principles.\n\nDefining Regenerative Water Use\n\n\u201cRegenerative\u201d is our new integrated metric reflecting the concept of circularity in using water in our operations. By 2030, the Coca-Cola system manufacturing facilities that we designate as high priority (\u201cLeadership Locations\u201d) must reduce, reuse, recycle and replenish the water used in operations in the local correlated watersheds for beneficial social, economic and/or environmental uses by other stakeholders and nature.\n\nWe have continued to improve the efficiency of our water use. We now need only 1.81 LITERS of water used per liter of product produced, a 20% IMPROVEMENT compared to 2010.\n\nCASE STUDY\n\nOur Bottling Partner in China Continues to Invest in Water Efficiency\n\nWe have been working with our bottling partner COFCO Coca-Cola Beverages Limited (CBL) to implement water saving initiatives at a manufacturing facility in water-stressed Beijing. CBL has invested in multiple projects including the recovery of water from cleaning and rinsing processes, the redesign of a recovery system for reverse osmosis treatment and using recycled water for the flushing of toilets and cleaning of external areas. These initiatives have resulted in an approximately 2% reduction in water use between December 2020 and December 2021, which is contributing to decreased stress on local freshwater sources and reduced operational costs.\n\nManaging Water Supports Diverse ESG Priorities\n\nWater issues intertwine with nearly all of our company\u2019s highest priority ESG issues. Water is the nexus that links individual health and well-being, economic prosperity, environmental health and the empowerment of the most vulnerable in society, including women and girls. Enhanced water management helps our business, supply chain and local communities build resilience to a changing climate. This means improving capacities to withstand, recover from and adapt to the shocks and stressors related to climate change.\nPillar 2 Our Communities\n\nResilient Communities\n\nWe implement a human rights-based approach to water and communities. We recognize the connection between our social license to operate and adequate water infrastructure.\n\nInsufficient access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and poor water quality are key challenges faced in water-stressed communities. Population growth, climate change, political conflict and forced migration are further straining water infrastructure and supply. COVID-19 exacerbated stresses on water systems, highlighting the importance of WASH to enable communities to protect themselves from disease spread.\n\nOver the past decade, The Coca-Cola Company has established strong leadership in community water programs with the support of The Coca-Cola Foundation and many nonprofits, governments, customers and other partners. Together, we have delivered sustainable community water interventions ranging from improving access to WASH to institutional capacity building, benefiting more than 18.5 million people since 2010. In 2021, our WASH projects included:\n\n- Installation of handwashing facilities and water connections for communities in the Philippines to help respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, benefiting over 200,000 people.\n- Access to drinking water for more than 130,000 people impacted by flooding and other natural disasters in China in 2021.\n\nOur 2030 Water Security Strategy builds on this work, seeking to improve access to water and sanitation and strengthen community resilience. We\u2019re focused on projects that will support and empower women and girls who, in many parts of the world, bear most of the responsibility for fetching water and running households.\n\nAs outlined in the Risk Assessments and Prioritization section, we are identifying our priority operational, commercial and sourcing communities. We are using a set of criteria from leading global institutions specializing in water and health. We aim to support all our priority communities in addressing shared water challenges by identifying and implementing interventions focused on three primary action areas:\n\n1. Improving access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene\n2. Enabling adaptation to water-related climate change impacts\n3. Ensuring rapid recovery from crises.\n\nThese actions will contribute to the achievement of our 2030 Water Security Strategy targets:\n\n- Support access to WASH initiatives in all our priority communities\n- Promote access to WASH throughout our bottling system and priority suppliers\n\nWASH Programs Focus on Needs of Women and Girls\n\nClean water is only one piece of the water resilience puzzle. To achieve the greatest health and economic benefits, improvements in sanitation and hygiene must be prioritized alongside access to clean water.\n\nWe recognize our business operates in areas with significant challenges to water access and sanitation. This is one reason why sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygiene\u2014particularly for women and girls\u2014is specifically addressed in our 2030 strategy.\n\nWe\u2019re collaborating with international organizations and coalitions such as WaterAid and Global Water Challenge to understand and meet the needs of women and girls and to systemically embed and measure gender-related outcomes of community WASH programs. This work will build on the groundbreaking findings of the 2018 Ripple Effect Study\u2014which quantified the significant impact of WASH improvements on women\u2019s empowerment\u2014and draw on learnings from the successful Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN) and our 5by20\u00ae economic empowerment initiative.\n\nSince 2010, our RAIN initiative has reached more than 6.7 million people in 41 countries and territories in Africa with safe, sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygiene, impacting more than 4,000 communities.\n\nCASE STUDY\n\nLaunching a New WASH Program in Latin America\n\nIn Latin America, we\u2019re launching a new program, Aliados por el Agua (Allies for Water), across 18 countries that will mobilize collective action to improve critical access to water, sanitation and hygiene in vulnerable and water-stressed communities and key watersheds. The program, which aims to benefit an estimated 2 million people by 2030, will replicate best practices from a program that we have supported for more than a decade in Africa. Aliados is a multi-sector partnership platform bringing together actors from the public and private sectors and civil society, and will be managed by The Global Environment Technology Foundation (GETF).\n\n\u201cIn communities where water is scarce, women and girls are responsible for the grueling task of collecting water, resulting in missed opportunities for learning, generating income and pursuing a brighter future. We\u2019re proud to work with The Coca-Cola Company to drive change through the power of clean water and to involve women every step of the way to ensure inclusive, long-term solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\u201d\n\nKelly Parsons\nCEO, WaterAid America\nHealthy Watersheds\n\nWatersheds supply water for drinking, agriculture and manufacturing, provide habitat for plants and animals, and offer opportunities for recreation. While watershed protection has been a core element of our work for more than a decade, our new strategy places much greater emphasis on the holistic improvement of watershed health.\n\nAs outlined earlier in this section, in 2020, we began analyzing and prioritizing our operational, commercial and ingredient sourcing watersheds.\n\nOver the past year, we have developed a Watershed Health Framework to provide our operations with help to assess watersheds\u2019 challenges and risks, and implement context-based Watershed Stewardship Plans. Watershed risks vary from location to location. For some, water availability may be the primary risk; for others, it might be water quality, water access, soil health or forest fires, to name a few. By adopting a context-based approach, we aim to support interventions relevant to our priority watersheds.\n\nThis work at the local watershed level will contribute to the achievement of our 2030 high level targets:\n\n- Implement watershed stewardship plans in all of our priority watersheds.\n- Promote advanced water management practices for our global priority ingredients grown in water-stressed regions.\n\nOur Water Footprint\n\nImproved agricultural management practices can promote watershed health. Water use within our agriculture supply chain accounts for 92% of our blue water footprint. (See the Sustainable Agriculture section for more detail on our work on sustainable sourcing.) Our work to identify priority watersheds and communities includes an assessment of water risks for watersheds where our global priority ingredients are grown.\n\nCASE STUDY\n\nAssessing Watershed Health in California\n\nA pilot project in the highly water-stressed state of California is just one example of the focus on watershed health in our strategy. Our North American operating unit is partnering with The Nature Conservancy and other nonprofits to establish a watershed health plan for three vulnerable California watersheds that supply water to our system bottling plants and for our agricultural ingredients (particularly almonds and lemons). We developed watershed health scorecards, highlighting the greatest challenges and risks in the prioritized watersheds. The pilot project developed corresponding Watershed Stewardship Plans that identify actions to help improve watershed health and water security for our operations, ingredient sourcing areas and communities. This includes projects such as meadow and forest restoration, invasive species removal, fire management and prevention, and water-use efficiency. These plans will also help us to track improvements in watershed health and co-benefits of projects (e.g. enhanced biodiversity and carbon sequestration).\nThe Importance of Nature-Based Solutions\n\nInfrastructure and construction can help protect vulnerable water systems. But nature itself often offers the best mechanisms for restoring watershed health. We invest in nature-based solutions (NBS), which build on natural processes to manage water systems. To achieve our 2030 vision, we will lean even more heavily into nature-based solutions, such as forest protection and floodplain management.\n\nThese types of solutions can provide a wide range of benefits, such as better water quality, carbon sequestration and enhanced biodiversity. Other direct and indirect benefits include water resource improvements, socioeconomic and public health benefits and climate change mitigation.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, we worked to identify and quantify the co-benefits of some of our replenishment projects to help us determine where to support future investments. In Europe, we partnered with denkstatt, an organization that advises businesses on natural and social capital, to develop a methodology to help us quantify the co-benefits of NBS projects. We also worked with The Nature Conservancy to pilot the CEO Water Mandate NBS Tool across more than 10 projects globally to better understand the links between various types of replenishment projects and nature-based solutions, helping to strengthen the business case for investment in these projects.\n\nCollaboration and Collective Action\n\nThe shared nature of water resources requires collective action to remediate water challenges. Read more about our approach to stakeholder engagement and partnerships.\n\nSome of our key partnerships are with:\n\n- 2030 Water Resources Group, hosted by the World Bank\n- Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS)\n- CEO Water Mandate, a partnership between the UN Global Compact and the Pacific Institute\n- Global Water Challenge\n- Science Based Targets Network (SBTN)\n- The Nature Conservancy\n- The Water Resilience Coalition\n- WASH4Work, an initiative hosted by the CEO Water Mandate\n- World Wildlife Fund (WWF)\n\n\u201c...The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s ongoing commitment to managing water risks sets an example to the industry on the type of work we need to see more of in corporate America.\u201d\n\nKirsten James\nSenior Program Director, Water, Ceres\nThe integrated approach behind the WWF Guatemala project defines how companies need to think and act if we\u2019re truly going to improve water, agricultural and climate resilience. This approach underpins the thinking behind our 2030 Water Security Strategy. We\u2019re breaking down silos, designing holistic water stewardship interventions that have cross-cutting impacts.\n\nMadhu Rajesh\nSenior Director\u2014Water & Agriculture,\nThe Coca-Cola Company\n\nFor more than a decade, The Coca-Cola Company has partnered with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Fundaci\u00f3n Defensores de la Naturaleza on an integrated watershed management project that addresses the interconnected issues of climate, water and agriculture.\n\nThe cloud forest of the Sierra de las Minas mountains of Eastern Guatemala serves as the primary source of water for thousands of people who live and work in communities that are located in the Pasabien and Teculutan watersheds. The rivers that flow down the mountainside once provided a plentiful supply of water for human consumption, agriculture and business.\n\nHowever, deforestation, intensive agriculture and human encroachment into the area\u2014combined with a changing climate\u2014degraded the natural ecosystem of these watersheds. This led to droughts, forest fires, polluted water sources and crop failure, with dire consequences for both nature and people: loss of biodiversity, respiratory problems from smoke and increased competition for scarce resources.\n\nIn response, more than a decade ago, WWF and the Fundaci\u00f3n Defensores de la Naturaleza launched an integrated watershed management project that simultaneously addressed the interconnected issues of climate, water and agriculture. The Coca-Cola Company was among the first to sign on as a partner and joined the project in 2007\u2014now one of many WWF projects we are proud to support around the world.\n\nIn the Teculutan and Pasabien watersheds, The Coca-Cola Company provided funding and partnered with WWF for technical expertise while our local bottling partner, ABASA, signed a conservation agreement to help protect 500 hectares of forests through fire prevention activities and controlled burning.\n\nWWF also engaged local communities, farmers and businesses on the importance of forest preservation and supported farmers to use sustainable agriculture practices, such as improved crop irrigation, to reduce water use and agricultural run-off. In addition, the project provided local people with energy efficient cook stoves to help reduce the demand for charcoal required for cooking. And local businesses, including our bottling partner, were encouraged to reduce their water use and improve their treatment of wastewater.\n\nThese activities have helped to reduce deforestation and land clearing for agriculture use, decrease forest fire frequency by 46% (comparing 2020 to 2015), reduce agricultural run-off by over 30,000 tons per year, improve farmer incomes and replenish 400 million liters of water annually.\n\n\u201cThe Coca-Cola Company has been one of our pilot partners when it comes to investing in the right way and the right solutions. We have three core concepts of resilience: not harming nature, using nature to help people, and helping nature adapt. Coca-Cola has been great working with us toward implementing these very important principles in Guatemala.\u201d\n\nDavid Kuhn\nLead, Corporate Resilience, WWF\nOur Total Beverage Portfolio\n\nOffering More Choices and Reducing Added Sugar\n\nFor more than a century, our company has been known for our refreshing beverages\u2014a legacy that began in 1886. Over the decades, we\u2019ve continued to evolve, and today we offer a lineup of beverages across five categories, providing consumers with a wealth of choices\u2014including drinks with less added sugar and beverages with nutrition benefits.\n\n~200 master brands across five categories:\n\n- Trademark Coca-Cola\n- Sparkling flavors\n- Hydration, sports, coffee & tea\n- Nutrition, juice, dairy & plant-based beverages\n- Emerging beverages\n\n1 This metric is based on the number of products in our beverage portfolio.\n2 Low- or no-sugar products have between zero and 5g of added sugar per 100 ml.\n\nOffering a portfolio of drinks for consumers\u2019 beverage needs and preferences throughout the day, including nutrition and hydration.\n\nTransforming Our Portfolio\n\nOur evolution as a total beverage company continues as we respond to consumer desires for more choices across a wider range of categories. We have streamlined our portfolio, focusing on brands with the greatest potential to scale and grow.\n\nContinuing to seek opportunities to reduce added sugar across our portfolio, including investments in sweetener innovation.\n\nPROGRESS\n\n~38% of our portfolio is low- or no-sugar.\n\nProviding smaller package choices so it\u2019s easier for consumers to control their added sugar intake.\n\nPROGRESS\n\n~41% of our sparkling soft drink brands come in smaller packages.\n\nGiving people the information they need to make informed choices.\n\nKeeping the consumer at the center, responding to evolving needs and preferences.\n\nPROGRESS\n\n28% of our volume sold in 2021 was low- or no-calorie.\nReducing Added Sugar and Investing in Sweetener Innovation\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company supports the recommendation of leading health authorities that individuals should consume no more than 10% of their total daily calories from added sugar, and we continue to prioritize sugar reduction. In 2021, we continued to change recipes to reduce added sugar; offer more beverages in smaller packages to enable portion control; and promote low- and no-calorie beverage options.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company has a decades-long history of investment in sweetener innovation for beverages, developing the first zero-sugar sparkling soft drink in 1963. More recently, we have focused on naturally occurring sugar alternatives and worked with suppliers to develop some of the first commercially available versions of stevia. Our investments\u2014typically in collaboration with industry peers, suppliers, startups and academic institutions\u2014have helped lead to the development and broad use of stevia and other options. The Coca-Cola Company has invested more than $100 million in sweetener innovation and sugar reduction research since 2008. We have been joined in such efforts by other members of the food, beverage and ingredient industries, which have invested more than $1 billion combined during this same period. A global list of published journal articles going back to 2008, reflecting research that The Coca-Cola Company has directly funded (either partially or fully) or authored, can be found on our website. These include a range of topics core to our business, including sweetener innovation.\n\nWe continue to develop and market new beverage options that maintain the great tastes people love, but with less added sugar and fewer calories. In 2021, we rolled out a new and improved recipe of Coca-Cola\u00ae Zero Sugar, which brings the brand even closer in taste to original Coca-Cola. First launched in 2005, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar grew volume by double digits in 2021, and the new formula has driven accelerated growth in 80% of the markets where it was launched. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is available in more than 180 markets around the world.\n\nTracking Results\n\nWe track the results of our sugar-reduction efforts; the majority of the added-sugar reductions stem from changes to our sparkling beverage recipes and packaging size reductions. Average calories per pack1 dropped by 3.4% in 2021.\n\n| 900,000+ | ~18,500 | 96 | 242 | 19 of TOP 20 | ~66% | 28% |\n| tons of added sugar removed from our global portfolio cumulatively2 through efforts to reformulate more than 1,000 beverages | tons of added sugar removed on an annual basis through recipe changes in 2021 | recipe changes to reduce added sugar in 2021 | low- or no-sugar products launched in 2021 | brands are reduced-sugar or zero-sugar, or have a reduced-sugar or zero-sugar option | of the products within our portfolio have less than 100 calories per 12-ounce serving | of our volume sold in 2021 was low- or no-calorie |\n\n1 The calories per pack metric takes into account both levers to reduce sugar: recipe changes and package size changes.\n2 From 2017 through 2021.\n3 2015-2019: 14.6% reduction on average; 2000-2015: 13.3% reduction on average.\n\nIn 2021, average sugar per 100 ml declined while global volume grew. In 2020, both average sugar per 100 ml and volume declined, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSugar Reduction Initiatives\n\nWe have joined with industry peers to participate in more than 40 sugar reduction initiatives around the world, tailoring our approach in each market to help reduce intake of added sugar.\n\nIn North America, we\u2019re part of the American Beverage Association\u2019s Balance Calories Initiative (BCI), which has committed to decrease beverage calories in the American diet by 20% per person by 2025. A BCI report released in early 2022 found that average calories per 8-oz. serving have declined between 10% and 15.5% since 2014 in five select communities where the beverage industry is measuring progress.\n\nWe have also signed on to:\n\n- The Mexican Beverage Industry Association\u2019s pledge, which has committed to reducing the calorie content of its member companies\u2019 portfolios by 20% between 2018 and 2024.\n- The European soft drinks industry (UNESDA) pledged to reduce average added sugars in soft drinks by another 10% from 2019 to 2025 across the European Union and the United Kingdom. This will represent a 33% overall reduction in average added sugars over the last two decades, building on past sugar reduction milestones that the industry achieved.\n\n10% GROWTH FOR MINI CANS\n\nIn North America in 2021, offering portion control to consumers.\n\nSmaller packaging options help people control added sugar intake for themselves and their families. Globally, about 41% of our sparkling soft drink brands come in packages of 250 ml (8.5 oz) or less.\nInvesting in Products with Added Nutrition and Enhanced Benefits\n\nWe\u2019re bringing drinks such as teas, juices, dairy, plant-based products and purified water to more people in more places. We\u2019re making many of our beverages nutritious by fortifying them with vitamins and minerals, while also introducing more dairy and plant-based beverages. We\u2019re focused on addressing the specific nutritional needs of populations where under-nutrition is an ongoing concern.\n\nFor example, our fairlife brand is adding protein to more diets while introducing new and reformulated products that continue to improve taste and nutritional profile. fairlife removed nearly 2 million pounds of sugar from the diets of those who drink fairlife versus other milk.1 For those looking to add even more protein to their diets, fairlife\u2019s Nutrition Plan\u2122 shake offers 30 grams of protein with just 2 grams of sugar.\n\nIn 2021, we launched fairlife in China, where milk consumption is on the rise. Beyond protein, fairlife products offer multiple benefits, including high calcium content and zero lactose. The brand uses ultra-filtration technology to retain more nutrients.\n\nIn 2021, we launched Minute Maid Kids in the United Kingdom. Made with 100% fruit, two new smoothie flavors contain 30% less natural sugar than the original Super Smoothie range. The Super Smoothie Light drinks are high in select B vitamins and E vitamins and provide a good source of fiber.\n\nIn 2021, vitaminwater gutsy, which launched in the United States in 2021, is a refreshing watermelon-peach-flavored water beverage with B and C vitamins and zero sugar. At just 10 calories per 20 fluid ounces, it also offers 5 grams of fiber and electrolytes.\n\nAdeZ Barista professional series offers 100% plant-based drinks with no added sugars for sale in Costa stores across a number of European markets. The drinks, which come in coconut, almond, soy and oat, are naturally free of lactose and gluten.\n\nsmartwater+ water enhancers are naturally flavored and have been formulated by biomedical engineers with a patented oxygen delivery technology to include vitamin B12 and iron to contribute to the reduction of fatigue.\n\nMojo is a range of kombucha sodas with added prebiotic fiber to support gut health. Available in Australia, the certified-organic sodas are naturally low in sugar and made with real fruit puree and juice.\n\n1 Calculated by number of products sold multiplied by sugar reduced (50%) for full year 2021. This is based on the volume of fairlife milk having 50% less sugar than other milks, and Good Moo\u2019d milk having 25% less sugar than other milks.\nGiving People the Information They Need\n\nWe are committed to providing transparent back- and front-of-package nutrition information, in line with local regulations. We support evidence-based interpretive front-of-package nutrition labeling, which can be a useful tool to help people make informed dietary choices that fit their diets and lifestyles. We\u2019re working with trade associations, governments, civil society and other stakeholders to develop the most appropriate labeling programs aligned with local needs.\n\nNo Marketing to Children\n\nWe\u2019re committed to the responsible marketing of our products and have a history of aligning our commercial practices with our sustainability goals, our business goals and our values.\n\nWe do not market any of our products directly to children under 13, regardless of nutritional profile. We respect the role of parents and caregivers as the primary decision-makers for what their children drink.\n\nWe hold everyone who is involved in our marketing and communications accountable to our Global Responsible Marketing Policy, from our employees and bottling partners to our agency and media partners. We require annual trainings for all relevant employees and communications accountable to our Global and local taskforces across all our operating units who monitor compliance, guide our marketers in their daily work and are equipped to address any identified non-compliances. Read our full policy.\n\nScaling Efforts with Industry Peers\n\nIn addition to our own company\u2019s Global Responsible Marketing Policy, we are a founding member of the International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA), a group of 11 leading food and beverage companies that self-regulate globally on responsible marketing to children. In 2021, together with our industry peers at IFBA, we strengthened our policy further. Effective January 1, 2022, we increased the age threshold from under 12 to under 13 and we reduced the audience threshold from 35% to 30%. This means we will not place our marketing or advertising in any media, platform or event where more than 30% of the audience is under 13.\n\nWe also partner with industry at regional and local levels to scale collective action in responsible marketing pledge programs. These include the EU Pledge in the European Union and The Children\u2019s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) in the United States.\n\nThrough our voluntary actions we aim to reduce children\u2019s exposure to foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) across all media, including digital. In 2021, an independent study commissioned by the World Federation of Advertisers in 12 markets showed that only 1.45% of online ads served to children are HFSS products.\n\nResponsible Alcohol Marketing\n\nWe recognize that our growth into alcohol brands brings new responsibilities. To ensure accountability, we developed The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s Global Policy on Alcohol Responsibility. As part of our entry into the category, we developed local partnerships and communications programs to help reduce and prevent the harmful use of alcohol in line with goals established by leading health authorities. We worked with Drinkaware in Great Britain; the Social Research Foundation in Mexico (FISAC); the Akatu, CISA and Ekloos organizations in Brazil; and organizations in Japan to support responsible drinking programs or messages. In all our activities, we seek to grow our alcohol brands in a responsible and sustainable manner.\n\n1 The Digital Avatar Project was commissioned by the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) and was conducted by independent research firm Nielsen using avatars that mimic the real browsing behavior of children online. The study was conducted across 12 major markets; a total of 30,593 ads were analyzed, captured by the child avatar visiting 100 URLs per market over a period of three weeks in October 2021.\nWorld Without Waste\n\nTackling the global plastic waste crisis requires cross-sector collaboration and alignment on common principles and targets. Our World Without Waste initiative is anchored by three fundamental goals: making 100% of our packaging recyclable globally by 2025\u2014and using at least 50% recycled material in our packaging by 2030 (Design); collecting and recycling a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030 (Collect); and bringing people together to support a healthy, debris-free environment (Partner).\n\nReduce our use of virgin plastic derived from non-renewable sources by a cumulative 3 MILLION METRIC TONS BY 2025\n\nIn 2022, we announced a new global reusable packaging goal. By 2030, we aim to have at least 25% OF OUR BEVERAGES SOLD BY VOLUME worldwide in refillable/returnable glass or plastic bottles or in fountain dispensers with reusable packaging.\n\nRead more in our 2021 World Without Waste Report\nThe Importance of Collective Action\n\nOur World Without Waste packaging goals require collective action in partnership with a range of stakeholders at a global, regional and local level.\n\nTogether with our bottling partners, we are working with:\n\n- Governments and community organizations to strengthen recycling infrastructures and boost collection rates\n- Customers, peers and industry associations to shape public policy and take action that supports a circular economy\n- Nonprofits and NGOs to engage civil society in ways that address pollution\n- Suppliers, startups and R&D partners to fuel sustainable packaging innovation that reduces waste and minimizes our environmental impact\u2014one bottle at a time.\n\nA World Without Waste, where materials are reused and recycled as part of a circular economy, is a world with dramatically lower carbon emissions and climate impacts, which is why our packaging and climate strategies are intertwined. Because packaging accounts for up to 30% of our overall carbon footprint, our World Without Waste efforts are essential to meeting our science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and our vision to be net zero carbon.\n\nWe continue to rethink our beverage packaging to become more sustainable. Most recently, we announced a global, and industry-leading, reusable packaging goal.\n\nIn North America, we eliminated more than 60,000 metric tons of virgin PET from our packaging mix in 2021 by increasing our usage of recycled PET plastic (rPET) to 12% of our portfolio and through regional and national launches of 100% rPET3 packaging on select brands. In Europe, we eliminated more than 130,000 metric tons of virgin PET from our packaging mix in 2021 by increasing our usage of recycled rPET to 31% of our portfolio.\n\nWe now offer beverages in 100% rPET bottles (excluding caps and labels) in approximately 30 markets. In 2021, Coca-Cola Japan introduced 100% recycled PET bottles for two brands: Coca-Cola and Georgia - and 40% of the PET plastic used in Japan in 2021 was either from recycled or renewable material.\n\nIn countries accounting for approximately 25% of our global PET use, rPET cannot currently be used in food-grade material. We continue to work with industry peers to advocate for government regulations permitting the use of rPET in food and beverage packaging. Over the last several years, countries as diverse as Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and South Korea have adopted standards for food- and beverage-grade rPET usage.\n\nWe avoided almost half a million tons of virgin plastic usage through our lightweighting, recycled plastic and renewable material efforts in 2021.\n\nBy 2030, we aim to have at least 25% of our beverages worldwide by volume sold in refillable/returnable glass or plastic bottles or in fountain dispensers with reusable packaging.\n\nSee additional performance indicators in the Data Appendix.\nNew Reusable Packaging Goal\n\nIn February 2022, we announced an industry-leading reusable packaging goal.\n\nBy 2030, we aim to have at least 25% of our beverages worldwide by volume sold in refillable/returnable glass or plastic bottles or in fountain dispensers with reusable packaging.\n\nThis builds on our already strong track record with refillable packaging, especially in parts of Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated consumer interest in refillables, as more families enjoy multi-serve beverages at home and seek affordable options in uncertain economic times.\n\nGlobally, we have increased our focus on refillable packaging through initiatives that include:\n\n- Investing in the expansion of the \u201cuniversal bottle,\u201d which was first introduced in 2018 by Coca-Cola Brazil and used in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala and Panama. This innovative solution\u2014which the Ellen MacArthur Foundation recognizes as a great example of reusable packaging, aligned with its vision for a circular economy for plastics\u2014drives efficiency of collection, cleaning and filling by offering multiple sparkling and still brands in the same reusable bottle. Additionally, we expanded the rollout of refillable 2-liter and 1.5-liter PET plastic bottles in South Africa, and partnered with Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages to pilot a 500-ml returnable glass bottle in Texas.\n\n- Collaborating with Tesco to pilot the Loop\u2122 shopping system in 10 retail outlets across Europe. Consumers can order a variety of products, including Coca-Cola, in packaging that is collected, cleaned, refilled and reused or recycled.\n\n- Launching a marketing campaign promoting the benefits of refillable packaging across Latin America.\n\n- Piloting a digital solution in Brazil and Chile for the returnable bottle exchange process through virtual coupons.\n\n- Partnering with several foodservice customers, including teaming up with Burger King\u00ae in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan to reduce single-use packaging waste by offering reusable cups and food containers, and piloting an exchangeable cup, called the Cup Crew, with A&W Canada restaurants.\n\n- Introducing reusable cups with microchip technology for Coca-Cola Freestyle machines in theme parks, on university campuses and on cruise ships in the United States.\n\n- Stepping up our commitment to the NextGen Consortium to accelerate the circularity of foodservice packaging, including cups. The consortium has expanded its work to advance reuse and refill packaging models, strengthen recycling and composting infrastructure and recovery pathways, and scale foodservice packaging innovation.\n\n- Trialing package-less vending machines at Universal Studios theme parks in Japan. The machines, which allow consumers to fill their own containers with sparkling and still water, also offer reusable bottles and a rinsing station.\n\n- Offering three of our most popular brands in Germany\u2014Fanta Orange, Sprite and Mezzo Mix\u2014as soda syrups for consumers to prepare drinks at home by adding carbonated water. The pilot supports our ongoing efforts to provide people with the brands they love with less packaging.\n\nBy 2030, we aim to have at least 25% of our beverages worldwide by volume sold in refillable/returnable glass or plastic bottles or in fountain dispensers with reusable packaging.\n\nLearn about our governance of packaging waste and other key ESG issues.\n100% Plant-Based Bottle\n\nMore than a decade ago, we introduced the world\u2019s first recyclable PET plastic bottle made with up to 30% plant-based material. In 2021, we unveiled a first-ever prototype bottle made from 100% plant-based plastic, that has been made using technologies that are ready for commercial scale (excluding the cap and label).\n\nThe new prototype exclusively uses materials from renewable, plant-based sources, removing all petroleum-based content from the bottle. It represents a significant technological step forward in the reduction of virgin oil-based PET across commercially produced bottles. Learn more.\n\nPlant-based plastics will play a critical role in our overall PET mix in the future, supporting our goals to decrease our carbon footprint, reduce our reliance on virgin fossil fuels and boost collection of PET in support of a circular economy.\n\n\u201cWe have been working with technology partners for many years to develop the right technologies to create a bottle with 100% plant-based content\u2014aiming for the lowest possible carbon footprint\u2014and it\u2019s exciting that we have reached a point where these technologies exist and can be scaled by participants in the value chain.\u201d\n\nNancy Quan\nChief Technical and Innovation Officer,\nThe Coca-Cola Company\n\nSprite Clear Bottles\n\nSprite, one of our largest global sparkling soft drink brands, is transitioning from its iconic green bottles to clear PET to help make them easier to make into new bottles by increasing the supply of high-value recycled plastic in the after-use market. As of the end of 2021, 47 markets had switched from green to clear, and another 70-plus\u2014including the United States and Canada\u2014plan to transition in 2022.\n\nLabel-Less Bottles\n\nBuilding on the 2020 launch of our first label-less bottle for I LOHAS in Japan, South Korea launched the first label-less Coca-Cola PET plastic bottle with the iconic contour shape and engraved logo, and Bonaqua launched its first label-less bottle in Hong Kong. Since labels have to be removed prior to recycling in these markets, these innovations make our packaging easier to recycle.\n\nPlant-Based Costa Cups\n\nCosta recently introduced cups made from 100% plant-based materials in its coffee shops in the United Kingdom. The carbon footprint of these cups, when recycled, is 26% lower than standard to-go cups. The brand also refreshed its reusable cup incentive program, further encouraging consumers to play their part in helping to reduce waste.\n\nRead more in our 2021 World Without Waste Report\n\n1 Excluding lid.\nCollect\n\nWe work with partners across business, government and civil society to create closed-loop systems that ensure our packages are collected and recycled or reused. Our 2021 efforts included:\n\n- In Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, we joined the ANZPAC Plastics Pact to pursue four 2025 targets: Eliminate unnecessary and problematic plastic packaging through redesign, innovation and alternative delivery models; make 100% of plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable; increase plastic packaging collected and recycled by 25%; and achieve an average of 25% recycled content in plastic packaging across the region.\n- In Brazil, we teamed up with bottling partners Solar Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola FEMSA on the Recicla Solar and SustentaPet post-consumer PET collection and recycling initiatives. Since launching in 2019, SustentaPet has collected 46,000 tons of PET (more than 1 billion bottles).\n- In Indonesia, we broke ground on a joint venture PET recycling facility with Dynapack Asia in West Java.\n- In the Philippines, we are partnering with Indorama Ventures to establish PETValue, the country\u2019s first bottle-to-bottle recycling facility capable of processing almost 2 billion plastic bottles per year.\n- In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), we joined Project RECAPP along with industry peers and the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment to create the country\u2019s first free, door-to-door recycling service. RECAPP has built a community of 15,000 registered users and collected 115 metric tons of recyclables.\n- In Mexico, we announced a $500 million system investment to expand the refillables capacity through four new production lines and to expand the country\u2019s recycling infrastructure by boosting production capacity at PETSTAR and inaugurating a new recycling plant in Tabasco. This will generate approximately 2,900 direct and 35,000 indirect jobs and increase Mexico\u2019s rPET capabilities by up to 51%.\n- In Islamabad, Pakistan, we partnered with TeamUp/ National Incubation Center (NIC) and Capital Development Authority (CDA) to pave the country\u2019s first plastic road using 10 tons of recycled plastic bottles.\n\nBottle Exchange Programs\n\nIn Mexico, we partnered with small retail customers on the \u201cMi tienda sin residuos\u201d (\"My store without waste\") program to transform stores into PET collection centers. Consumers can return empty bottles to participating retail outlets to be recycled. In addition to promoting environmental awareness in local communities, early results show consumers are more likely to buy our beverages in participating stores.\n\nIn Romania, we support Carrefour\u2019s \u201cPay with 1 PET\u201d program, which lets grocery shoppers exchange empty PET bottles for free fruit and vegetables. More than 10,000 consumers have participated to date, resulting in more than 200,000 PET bottles collected. Our partnership with Carrefour in Romania is underpinned by our commitment to The Food Transition Pact, a reciprocal commitment between Carrefour and its partner suppliers.\n\nEngaging with Consumers\n\nIn the United States, we launched a national marketing campaign to promote our sustainable packaging strategy following the national rollout of the 13.2-oz. Coca-Cola bottle, and 20-oz in certain markets, made of 100% recycled PET. The campaign\u2019s \u201cRecycle and Re-Enjoy It\u201d message conveys that plastic is a valuable commodity designed to be used again and again, and that empty packages can be part of the circular economy.\n\n1 The collection rates represent average collection rates for select primary consumer packaging, which is the percentage of our packaging that was collected for recycling (or refill).\nPartner\n\nWe believe that solutions to the world\u2019s plastic waste challenges can best be unlocked when stakeholders work collaboratively to create systems that enable positive change.\n\nWe have partnered with The Ocean Cleanup, which has developed solutions and technology to reduce ocean plastic. Its Interceptor\u2122 solutions extract plastic from rivers, preventing it from reaching oceans. Our new Rivers partnership, which pairs our scale and network with The Ocean Cleanup\u2019s technology and data-driven solutions, aims to place cleanup systems in 15 priority rivers around the world so that they can validate the technology and extend to additional critical rivers.\n\nLocal teams will partner with waste management coalitions to sort and, where possible, eventually turn PET plastic bottles captured from river waste into new bottles.\n\nOur partnership with The Ocean Cleanup builds on The Coca-Cola Foundation\u2019s support to the Benioff Ocean Institute at the University of California-Santa Barbara, which supports river cleanup efforts in Panama, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Ecuador, Mexico, Thailand, Jamaica and Kenya. Despite ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the coalition collected 425 tons of plastic waste in 2021; hosted its first-annual virtual symposium; and launched a data dashboard highlighting key metrics, including plastic captured by type and number of people reached through education and community outreach.\n\nRead more in our 2021 World Without Waste Report\n\nAccelerating Sustainable Innovation\n\nWe sponsor AB InBev\u2019s 100+ Accelerator, an open-innovation program that is committed to crowdsourcing and piloting sustainability-focused startups and solutions. In the most recent cohort, we provided funding, training, mentoring and other hands-on support to seven startups for a pilot program of about nine months, including two startups focused on the circular economy. For example, ReciVeci developed a mobile app to increase the recovery of recyclable and returnable materials in Ecuador and RecyclePoints in Nigeria incentivizes people to recycle PET bottles and other materials through points that can be redeemed for cash and household goods. Learn about BanQu\u2014a 100+ Accelerator alum.\n\nWe are an investor in Circulate Capital, a fund focused on ventures, infrastructure and innovations preventing the flow of plastic into oceans. Since 2019, Circulate Capital has raised more than $100 million and invested in 14 companies in India and Indonesia. In 2021, Circulate Capital announced a $4 million investment in the Inter-American Development Bank Group\u2019s innovation lab to support startups in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s interconnected world, none of us can solve the biggest social and environmental challenges of our time alone. We believe that partnerships and collective action are needed to deliver both a more sustainable business and a sustainable future, and that we must look outside our company for ideas and solutions.\u201d\n\nBen Jordan\nSenior Director of Environmental Policy,\nThe Coca-Cola Company\nClimate change is a priority issue for our business. We have a responsibility to reduce the carbon footprint of our value chain; to improve business resilience by managing short- and long-term risks and impacts of a changing climate; and to foster partnerships that drive positive change.\n\n**SCIENCE-BASED TARGET**\n\n25%\n\nabsolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction by 2030, against a 2015 baseline\n\n**2021 SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT LEADER**\n\nRecognized by CDP as a\n\n**3X**\n\nTHE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS\n\nproviding climate data to CDP in 2021 compared to 2020\nIncreasing Our Climate Ambition\n\nOur approach to addressing climate change has accelerated in recent years in keeping with the scale and urgency of the issue. Even as we achieved our 2020 \u201cdrink in your hand\u201d goal to reduce our relative carbon emissions by 25% against a 2010 baseline, we increased our climate ambition.\n\nWe\u2019ve announced both our science-based target to reduce our absolute emissions by 25% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline and an ambition to be net zero carbon by 2050. Several of our bottling partners have announced their own science-based targets and net zero pledges, which will help drive even more positive climate action across the Coca-Cola system.\n\nIn line with our net zero ambition, we conducted preliminary modeling in 2021 that will enable us to define the key actions and goals needed for a net zero transition by 2050.\n\nA significant amount of our impact is in our supply chain, so we encourage suppliers\u2014representing approximately 80% of spend across most major procurement categories\u2014to respond to the CDP Supply Chain Climate Change questionnaire. In 2021 we saw a threefold increase in the number of supplier responses compared to the previous year.\n\nWe believe that continued progress against our goals\u2014in combination with supporting key stakeholders as they strengthen their own ambitions\u2014will be critical to making meaningful advances on climate. We have also undertaken additional climate scenario risk analysis to better understand the potential near- and longer-term impacts of a changing climate on our business.\n\nGovernance on Climate Change\n\nThe ESG and Public Policy Committee, established by our Board of Directors, bears the highest level of direct responsibility for climate-related issues. The committee assists the Board in overseeing the company\u2019s environmental, social, legislative, regulatory and public policy matters, including progress against our science-based target. The committee reports regularly to the full Board on matters it oversees, including climate-related issues.\n\nTo learn more about our ESG governance structure, see the Governance section. For more on climate-related governance, see our most recent CDP Climate Change response, Section C1.\n\nEmbedding Climate Action into Our Strategy\n\nBuilding on our first climate risk scenario analysis in 2019, we undertook a far-reaching new study across our company and agricultural supply chain in 2021, looking at three scenarios: Business As Usual (warming above 5\u00b0C), Middle of the Road (warming limited to 2.7\u00b0C) and Low Carbon (warming kept below 2\u00b0C). This process enabled us to identify a refined set of climate-related risks and opportunities\u2014including both physical and transition impacts\u2014in a range of possible futures. This will be a critical tool for strategic planning and implementing resilience plans. We will further analyze the risks and opportunities identified to ensure we have appropriate risk-management strategies in place. We will disclose details in our forthcoming CDP Climate Change response.\n\nManaging Climate Risk\n\nWe have established a cross-functional and cross-company Enterprise Risk Management process and Risk Steering Committee to oversee regular system-wide risk assessments, and we work to integrate climate risk planning into this process.\n\nRelevant risks that could materially affect our business, including our financial results, are disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. These include risks relating to climate change, such as physical risks from changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters which may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities. Climate change may also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the Coca-Cola system\u2019s bottling operations. Increasing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements, among others.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company applies the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in this report and in a TCFD Index and provides comprehensive disclosures to CDP on Climate Change.\n\n1 Physical Scenario: IPCC AR5 SRES A1B \u201cFossil-fueled Development\u201d and Transition Scenario: IEA World Energy Outlook \u201cCurrent Policies Scenario.\u201d\n2 Physical Scenario: SSP2-4.5 \u201cMiddle of the Road\u201d and Transition Scenario: IEA World Energy Outlook \u201cStated Policies Scenario.\u201d\n3 Physical Scenario: SSP1-2.6 \u201cSustainable\u201d and Transition Scenario: IEA World Energy Outlook \u201cSustainable Development Scenario.\u201d\nTransitioning to a Low-Carbon Economy\n\nAchieving our science-based target means looking at our full value chain, including bottling partners and suppliers. Our target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 includes system partners within our scope 1 and 2 boundary. Following are examples of how we are integrating our climate initiatives across our value chain and in collaboration with system partners.\n\nSupplier Reporting on Emissions & Reduction Plans\n\nMany of our agricultural suppliers report annually on their performance and progress in reducing emissions, which constitute 20-25% of our total value chain emissions, and on plans to achieve further reductions. Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) include maximizing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy, employing responsible forest management practices that protect biodiversity and restore degraded ecosystems, and maintaining or improving soils by preventing degradation\u2014all of which are important in mitigating climate impacts. To find out more, see Sustainable Agriculture.\n\nInnovations in Packaging Design & Increasing Collection Rates\n\nBecause packaging accounts for almost one-third of our overall carbon footprint, virtually everything we do toward our World Without Waste initiative also helps to achieve our science-based target. This strategy includes more plant-based packaging that requires less petroleum-based virgin plastic; lightweighting our packaging; using more reusable packaging (both traditional refillables as well as fountain and Coca-Cola Freestyle dispensed solutions), using more recycled material; and recycling more bottles and cans. For more about our packaging efforts, see World Without Waste.\n\nInvestments in Renewable Energy for Manufacturing\n\nApproximately 10-15% of our emissions come from manufacturing. Renewable energy use as a percentage of total electricity for the system was 12% in 2021. In February 2022, we released a Renewable Energy Implementation Guidebook, a step-by-step guide for company-owned facilities and bottling partners to build knowledge and increase facilities\u2019 generation and procurement of renewable energy. We also conducted analyses of renewable energy opportunities in six countries where implementation is more complex to support our teams in identifying renewable energy procurement options. In 2022, we will continue to support operating units and bottling partners to further scale their use of renewable energy. In 2021, we also re-joined the Clean Energy Buyers Association (formerly known as the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance) and are leveraging their resources and networks as we scale up our use of renewable energy.\n\nMore HFC-Free & Intelligent Connected Coolers\n\nCold drink equipment and dispensing accounts for approximately one-third of our emissions. We are working to place more hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free coolers, replace older equipment with newer and more energy efficient coolers, as well as place more \u201cintelligent connected\u201d coolers that transmit data such as product throughput, maintenance status, temperature and energy use, which can improve our placement and management of coolers while reducing emissions.\n\n1 Due to an improvement in our data collection process and rigorous assessment of renewable energy claims throughout the system, this resulted in a drop in renewable energy use as a percentage of total electricity for the system from 17% to 12%.\nGoing Solar in the United Kingdom\n\nCoca-Cola Europacific Partners completed Phase 1 of a three-phase solar development project at their facility in Wakefield, UK, the largest soft drinks plant in Europe. The early results are promising, already saving \u00a3340,000 in 2021 with installation of an 8.2 megawatt solar system that accounts for almost 20% of the facility\u2019s electricity consumption. By the completion of Phase 3, we expect that the project will generate an additional 30 megawatts in solar energy and include up to 40 megawatts of battery storage capacity, ultimately transitioning the facility to be carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nSupplier Engagement Is Key to Transition\n\nBecause approximately 85% of our total carbon emissions come from things we buy, and not what we do in our direct operations, engaging with suppliers is critical to achieving our science-based target. Our recent efforts include:\n\n- Each year we encourage key suppliers to disclose, and 75% of these suppliers responded.\n- We are proud to have been recognized by CDP as a 2021 Supplier Engagement leader for the third year in a row. This is an acknowledgement of our efforts to mobilize collective climate action by providing suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge to support their climate journey.\n- We have piloted a questionnaire with 12 of our major suppliers across ingredients and packaging to begin moving toward supplier-specific emissions factors for the commodities we procure. This allows us to better understand our supply chain and more accurately track the emissions reductions of specific suppliers in key areas of our supply chain.\n- In 2022, we joined the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition initiative along with Atlantic Packaging, The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, General Mills, Nestl\u00e9, Keurig Dr Pepper, Restaurant Brands International, Mars Incorporated, McCormick & Company, Mond\u00e9lez International, and Yum! Brands to mobilize collective climate action by providing suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge to support their climate journey.\n\nClimate Resilience\n\nWe are witnessing the impacts of changing weather patterns, which is why investing in the resilience of our supply chain and the communities where we operate is critical to our long-term success. Our work on resilience helps ensure we can withstand, recover from and adapt to the shocks and stressors of a changing climate. Many of our climate resilience efforts relate to our ingredient supply chain and water stewardship. For more information, see our Sustainable Agriculture and Water sections, as well as our featured story about resilience in action.\n\nWe are also sharing the outputs of our work on climate resilience with peer companies. As founding members of the BSR Climate Risk to Resilience platform, we helped shape the development of resilience metrics and risk planning tools as well as the report Rising to Resilience (produced in collaboration with WWF and published in November 2020). This report provides practical application for businesses on how to integrate climate resilience into their water stewardship strategies.\n\nTracking Progress Toward Ambitious Climate Targets\n\nAccurately measuring our impact and tracking reductions is essential to achieving our climate goal. We\u2019ve recently implemented a new data system for collecting sustainability metrics and continually work toward ensuring that our industry-leading. In 2021, we took significant steps to help facilitate complete and accurate progress reporting against our science-based target. We updated our GHG emissions accounting methodology for the Coca-Cola system aligned with the GHG Protocol and undertook an assessment to evaluate and expand the emissions sources included within our reporting boundary to align with requirements of the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In 2022, we plan to track our target progress in real-time across the system, putting us in a strong position to publicly report on progress against our target next year.\n\nCoca-Cola System Climate Targets\n\nAcross our system, many of our bottling and supplier partners have set their own science-based targets or have goals for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner.\n\nIn December 2021, the Coca-Cola system in Europe announced a goal to reach net zero by 2040 across all European markets, covering the entire European value chain, building on net zero and science-based targets set by The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s two leading bottling partners in Europe, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners and Coca-Cola HBC. This effort seeks a reduction of 2.5 million tons of CO\u2082 equivalent annually in Europe by 2030 compared to 2015\u2014a reduction of 30%.\n\nComplementing these net zero commitments, several of our other bottling partners have also announced their own science-based targets, including Suntory Coca-Cola Limited (Asia) and Coca-Cola FEMSA (Mexico).\n\nAdditional details on Coca-Cola system emissions can be found in the Data Appendix.\nSustainable Agriculture\n\nWe rely on agricultural ingredients to make and package our beverages. Ensuring these ingredients are sustainably sourced is a key priority for us, and is essential to our efforts on climate resilience, water security, human rights, sustainable packaging and economic empowerment. As climate change leads to more extreme weather and increased water stress, more sustainable agricultural practices will play a vital role in promoting resilience across our supply chain and in the communities that produce our agricultural ingredients.\n\nSTRENGTHENED OUR PRINCIPLES FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE (PSA)\n\nEvaluated more than 500 suppliers across 115+ countries and territories against the PSA framework.\nGrowing a More Sustainable Supply Chain\n\nThe quality and integrity of our products depends on a secure, sustainable supply chain with successful and thriving farming communities. Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) advance and standardize our core values at the farm level\u2014from small-scale farmer cooperatives to large commercial operations\u2014supporting livelihoods and helping to ensure continuity of supply.\n\nIntroduced in 2021 to improve upon our previous sustainable agriculture framework, the PSA aim to strengthen our progress toward sustainable sourcing of agricultural ingredients, taking a longer-term perspective that reflects our expanding portfolio, increasingly diverse supply chains and the most recent science. The principles are designed to help farms become more productive, resilient, transparent and compliant. Working with our suppliers, we seek to advance on-farm practices and thereby create long-term, systemic change in our supply chains.\n\nMore sustainable farming practices lead to improved farm incomes, through higher crop yields, better management, reduced costs and increased resilience to changing weather patterns\u2014as well as enhanced product quality and a more stable supply.\n\nThe PSA are designed to encourage continuous improvement of farming practices. Recognizing the diversity of supply chains, farm structures and risk contexts, the PSA introduced a new framework for evaluating compliance and performance of our supply farm base to reflect the on-the-ground realities in sustainable farming practices.\n\nThe PSA\u2019s \u201cLeader/Mover/Improver\u201d framework helps us to catalog our ingredient supply into three performance categories so we can prioritize our actions in line with our company\u2019s highest sustainability priorities, including climate change, water resources, ecosystems and biodiversity, human rights, and animal health and welfare. These categories are:\n\n- **LEADER LEVEL**, which means that the supply volume is verified to a TCCC approved, third-party validation aligned with the PSA.\n- **MOVER LEVEL**, which means that the supply volume is sourced from farms using other agricultural farming standards, effectively identifying and addressing key sustainability issues and advancing sustainable practices.\n- **IMPROVER LEVEL**, which applies when the supply volume is sourced from smallholder/small-scale producers participating in a support program and continuously improving practices to address their priority sustainability issues over time.\n\nWe are currently in the process of mapping the volume of the 12 global priority ingredients we procure against this framework. This mapping will form the basis for how we engage with suppliers to drive continuous improvement in line with our Leader-Mover-Improver framework.\n\nOur long-term ambition is two-fold:\n\n- All of our agricultural-based suppliers will demonstrate continuous improvement and will be categorized by The Coca-Cola Company as either Leaders, Movers or Improvers.\n- All of our global priority ingredient suppliers and their farm supply base will achieve \u201cLeader\u201d status over time.\n\n1 These approved standards, which can be found on our website, currently include Bonsucro for sugar; the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform\u2014Farm Sustainability Assessment (PSA) for crops including cane sugar, beet sugar and fruit; the Round Table for Responsible Soy for soybean; the Forest Stewardship Council for pulp and paper; and Field to Market for U.S. corn, among others. Certain third-party validation programs under the Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP)\u2014our previous framework that was in effect from 2013 to 2020\u2014are still in the process of being evaluated for use under the PSA. Once this benchmarking process has been completed, the list of approved verifications will be updated.\n\n**CASE STUDY**\n\n**Leader**\n\nFlorida Orange Growers Achieve \u201cLeader\u201d Performance Level\n\nWe source a significant volume of oranges from Florida\u2014but in 2020, none of our supply had been verified by an approved sustainable agriculture program. We approached the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and asked for their support to engage Florida orange growers on the topic of sustainability. The resulting project, known as the Florida Orange Sustainability FSA Accelerator, brought together 14 companies aligned around the same goal: to increase the volume of sustainable oranges grown in Florida. Together, the SAI Platform created consensus across the orange-processing industry, supporting growers in implementing more sustainable practices\u2014and communicating the sustainable practices they were already employing. Our volume of sustainably sourced Florida oranges jumped significantly, from 0% in 2020 to 41% in 2021, and we expect the percentage to continue to grow.\n\n**CASE STUDY**\n\n**Improver**\n\nSmallholder Farmers Improve Practices in India\n\nIn India, the majority of farmers are smallholders who often lack the ability to verify their production against global standards. We have been driving several initiatives to help small-scale sugar cane and fruit farmers improve productivity, increase profitability and become more resilient. The sustainable agriculture project Meetha Sona Unnati began in 2016 with investments in sugar cane farmers in the state of Uttar Pradesh. It proved so successful that, together with our partners, we expanded it to the state of Karnataka. Under the flagship program Fruit Circular Economy we have extended these projects for growers of mangoes, oranges, apples, lychee and grapes\u2014all crops that are important to our beverage production. To date, these programs have trained a combined total of more than 150,000 farmers in sustainable agricultural practices, including ultra-high-density plantation and drip irrigation.\nProgress Toward Our Goal\n\nWe track progress against our sustainable sourcing goal for 12 global priority ingredients (cane sugar, mango, grape, orange, apple, corn, lemon, beet sugar, tea, pulp & paper, coffee and soybean), which represent about 80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases. In 2021, following the launch of our PSA, we benchmarked over 500 suppliers in more than 115 countries and territories to begin mapping our global priority ingredient volumes against this new framework and establish a baseline. 58% of our priority ingredient volumes were sourced sustainably from suppliers using third-party validation programs already approved under the PSA, effective 2021. This means they met the \u201cLeader\u201d level in our PSA framework. We have made significant progress with our suppliers to validate or verify the farms where our ingredients are grown. We recognize, however, that sustainable agriculture is not a fixed destination but a long-term process that requires ongoing engagement between our business and our supply chains.\n\nCASE STUDY\n\nFruto Resiliente in Brazil\n\nSmallholder farmers often face major challenges in having their production validated by a third party. So in 2019, we launched the \u201cFruto Resiliente\u201d project with a goal of improving the farming practices of 480 smallholder orange growers in the Brazilian citrus belt by the end of 2023, with at least 50% of them reaching the equivalent of bronze level of the SAI PSA standard. The project is a collaborative partnership between The Coca-Cola Company, The Coca-Cola Foundation, innocent, Solidaridad, Cutrale (our largest orange juice supplier in Brazil), and Eckes Granini (a leading supplier of fruit juices and beverages). As of December 2021, the project had reached 800 orange growers through the dissemination of information using digital tools such as messaging apps, videos and live streams, and a website where farmers can download training manuals, booklets, etc. The project also included more than 300 visits by agriculture extension workers, who provide advisory services to farms and tailored action plans, and a signed partnership agreement with the Sylvo Moreira Citriculture Center (CCSM) of the Campinas Agronomic Institute (IAC). The project will utilize CCSM/IAC\u2019s demonstration farm to showcase and demonstrate sustainable agricultural practices to farmers. The project\u2019s goal for 2022 is to improve the agricultural practices of at least 200 orange farmers.\n\nCASE STUDY\n\nPlanting Cover Crops Improves Soil Health in Indiana\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and The Coca-Cola Company partnered with producers in the Big Pine Creek watershed in Indiana to establish cover crops on 2,660 acres of farmland.1 Producers planted a cereal rye cover crop outside the growing season of the main crops of corn and soybean, which are planted in rotation. When planted over several years, cover crops improve the overall health and water-holding capacity of soils,2 sequester carbon and reduce soil erosion and runoff.3 Following this initial investment and support, many farmers have continued to plant cover crops each year using their own funds. In 2021, out of the original 2,660 acres that were supported, a total of 1,264 acres of cover crops were planted.1 The total estimated decrease in runoff associated with the planting of these cover crops is 484 million liters per year.4 The decrease in sediment erosion is estimated at 2,001 metric tons per year.4\n\nTotal Sustainable Sourcing of All Priority Ingredients\n\nGOAL: 100%\n\nThis bar graph shows progress toward total sustainable sourcing of all 12 global priority ingredients, combined, using third-party validation programs approved under our PSA, effective 2021, alongside progress against our previous SAGP, effective 2013-2020. The company is working to finalize our benchmarking of third-party validation against the PSA standard, including verifications accepted under the SAGP for which benchmarking continues in 2022. We anticipate resumption of data reporting for individual priority ingredients once we have completed our benchmarking exercise.\n\n1 Data provided by The Nature Conservancy.\n2 The Ohio State University Extension. 2009.

This is because The Coca-Cola Company buys our ingredients from suppliers that purchase agricultural raw materials directly from farms or through intermediaries.\n\nAll agricultural-based ingredient and packaging suppliers are informed of our PSA, with clear expectations on making measurable progress in meeting our PSA (on the farms where raw materials for our products are grown), set out through sourcing contracts and other supplier communications. Through our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA)-Supplier Guide, we provide guidance to suppliers on implementation of the PSA.\n\nThe Water-Agriculture Connection\n\nOur comprehensive enterprise Water Footprint assessment showed that 73% of our company\u2019s total water footprint and 92% of our freshwater footprint is from growing the ingredients needed for our beverages. We have, therefore, integrated ingredient sourcing into our water security vision by unifying our water and sustainable agriculture strategies.\n\nAs we explore ways to address water use in our agriculture supply chain, we are focusing on two main tracks, similar to the approach we have taken for operational water use in our production facilities:\n\n- Actions we take to promote advanced water management practices for our global priority ingredients grown in water-stressed regions.\n- Actions we take to improve overall watershed health in priority sourcing regions where our global priority ingredients are grown.\n\nIn 2021 we began developing a Water-Agriculture guidebook to outline a prioritization framework of global priority agricultural ingredients with the highest water dependency and risk, priority sourcing watersheds and relevant suppliers. The guidebook will provide a system-wide action plan that aligns with the PSA and our water security goal.\n\nCircular Water Use for Sugar Cane in China\n\nAs much as 60% of the sugar produced in China comes from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), in an area that suffers from both droughts and floods. To help address this challenge, we have been working with The Coca-Cola Foundation, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the China International Center for Economic and Technical Exchanges (CICETE) over the last decade to help increase the production of sugar cane while reducing water use. This has been done by promoting drip irrigation systems and the use of treated wastewater from nearby sugar mills for irrigation. The project is a great example of scaling up: it started with direct support by project partners on ~200 hectares in 2011-2013. Through the demonstration of the benefits of taking this new sustainable agriculture approach, the Chinese local government supported the project\u2019s replication and expansion to an additional 6,500 hectares in 2013 before leading to a full-scale rollout across the entire sugar cane sector in Guangxi. As of January 2021, a total of ~350,000 hectares have benefited from agricultural practices piloted by the program, both in Guangxi and neighboring provinces.\n\nSupporting Regenerative Agriculture\n\nBy restoring and rebuilding degraded soils, regenerative agricultural practices can conserve and rehabilitate farmland, increase biodiversity and yield, build resilience to climate change and improve the water cycle. Many of our water replenishment programs promote regenerative farming practices such as no-till/reduced/conservation tillage, precision agriculture, edge of field practices, crop rotations, the use of cover crops and efficient use of fertilizers/compost.\n\nIn Turkey, for example, we have been working in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry General Directorate of Agricultural Reform and the Nature Conservation Centre to introduce regenerative agricultural practices in Konya province. Begun in 2013 on 125 hectares, the project expanded these practices to more than 3,500 hectares of farmland. Regenerative agricultural practices have resulted in an estimated increase in soil organic matter of at least 30%, an increase in soil moisture content of 10%, and a reduction in required irrigation of 10% during the growing season.\n\nAs a founding member of the SAI Platform\u2019s Regenerative Agricultural Programme, which aims to set an industry benchmark for measuring outcomes at the farm level, we are collaborating pre-competitively with industry peers and suppliers to promote and implement regenerative agricultural practices, by supporting the development of tools and guidance documents to build farmer capacity. We also continue to be actively involved with SAI Platform\u2019s work on Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA), which helps drive relevant and demonstrable continuous improvement of on-farm environmental, social and economic performance through supply chain collaboration and fostering a common understanding of sustainable agriculture.\nWe believe in putting our people first.\n\nOur people and culture initiatives are critical business priorities, and we strive to be a global employer of choice that attracts and retains high-performing talent with the passion, skills and mindsets to drive us on our journey to refresh the world and make a difference.\n\nWe believe each one of us has the power to make a difference, and our company and The Coca-Cola Foundation have a long history of investing in programs and activities that improve lives.\n\nWe value how we work as much as what we achieve, emphasizing inclusivity, empowerment, curiosity and agility. We champion diversity, equity and inclusion by building a workforce as diverse as the consumers we serve. And we use our global scale to be a force for progress and for good.\n\nOur company\u2019s impacts on people extend well beyond our own business. We are committed to caring for those who make our success possible, whether through respecting human rights across our operations and supply chain, empowering access to equal opportunities, supporting more sustainable agriculture practices, or giving back to communities through our philanthropic initiatives.\n\n~ 700K\nemployed by The Coca-Cola Company and our approximately 225 bottling partners\n\n~ 79K\nemployed by The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSee additional performance indicators in the Data Appendix.\nRespecting Human Rights\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company's policies and practices are aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which we have supported since their inception in 2011. We work to embed respect for human rights across our system through a comprehensive framework of policies, stakeholder engagement, due diligence and remediation.\n\nPolicies\n\nOur Human Rights Policy captures the company\u2019s overall commitment to human rights. We extend these requirements contractually to suppliers through our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP) and our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), each setting clear and strict requirements for human rights.\n\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nOur approach to stakeholder engagement is an ongoing dialogue that enables us to identify and address potential human rights issues proactively and collaboratively. We partner with a wide range of stakeholders both within the Coca-Cola system and externally across the private, public, civil society and labor sectors, leading to continuous improvement in our work to respect human rights.\n\nSee our Human Rights 2022 Overview for comprehensive disclosures of our human rights policies, governance, due diligence, access to remedy and grievance mechanisms.\n\nHuman Rights Due Diligence\n\nIn line with the UN Guiding Principles, we carry out human rights due diligence across our value chain. We regularly assess our key human rights risks and ensure that we are taking steps to identify and address them.\n\nWe maintain an industry-leading global audit program of our own operations, as well as those of our bottling partners and Tier 1 suppliers, with over 38,000 human rights assessments conducted since 2003. We audit facilities using the same protocol in every market where our system and suppliers operate. As of the end of 2021, 95% of our own operations, 93% of system bottlers and 92% of our Tier 1 suppliers complied with our rigorous SGP protocols. These audit results are reviewed by the ESG and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors on an annual basis. Despite falling short of our ambitious goals due to the impact of COVID-19, these results show remarkable improvement across our value chain. We will continue to advance our human rights strategy and work.\n\nWe have also worked to extend our supplier due diligence beyond Tier 1. For instance, we collaborate with our Tier 1 ingredient suppliers to drive respect for human rights within their supply chain at the farm-level through our PSA program. And we have developed a due diligence module specifically tailored to the unique challenges of the informal waste collection sector and our World Without Waste initiative. More information on our due diligence program can be found in our Human Rights 2022 Overview.\n\nSee additional performance indicators in the Data Appendix.\n\n2,848 AUDITS conducted in 2021\n\nHuman Rights Training and Resources\n\nIn addition to compliance audits, our company supports bottling partner and supplier capacity building through in-person training sessions and the provision of human rights resources such as checklists, toolkits and guidelines. In 2021, we conducted bottler and supplier human rights-focused training attended by more than 1,500 participants.\nWorking to Eliminate Child Labor in Turkey\n\nIn 2019, The Coca-Cola Company joined Harvesting the Future, a joint program led by the Fair Labor Association in Turkey that brings together NGOs, local government agencies, companies and sustainable agriculture platforms. The goal is to improve child protection and responsible labor recruitment for commodities such as beet sugar, tea, apples, citrus, grapes, hazelnuts, pulses and apricots.\n\nIn Phase I, the project mapped supply chains, engaged stakeholders, trained suppliers and labor intermediaries and assessed human rights risks, including risks of child labor and hazardous tasks by young workers.\n\nIn Phase II, which will continue until December 2023, the project is improving conditions for young workers of legal age through a number of activities and mechanisms such as proper contracting, age verification and training for supplier staff. Phase II seeks to integrate child protection and remediation systems into suppliers\u2019 core operating procedures as well as engage with labor intermediaries to legally register workers with the local government and establish no child-labor clauses and decent work principles.\n\nLearn more about the project here and our action pledge to end child labor.\nWe've recently partnered with two companies to harness their technologies to empower some of the most vulnerable members of society who operate in different areas of our value chain and to better identify and analyze human rights risks in labor recruitment supply chains.\n\n**BanQu Improves Transparency and Traceability in the Recycled Material Supply Chain**\n\nIn South Africa, much of the paper and packaging waste that is collected is sold to small buy-back centers or aggregators before ultimately reaching large recycling companies. Waste pickers involved in this process typically lack access to formal financial services.\n\nEnter our new partnership with BanQu, which uses blockchain technology to track, trace and ensure payment for collected recyclable material. Our Africa operating unit is rolling out the BanQu platform as a service to 100 buy-back centers or aggregators that buy and sell recyclable material. The project is providing these small businesses with free access to the BanQu system, allowing them to record their cashless transactions in a blockchain-based system that works with any smartphone or tablet. Waste pickers also benefit by receiving verification of transactions via text message.\n\nThese records, which are similar to a pay slip, can provide waste pickers with the proof of economic activity necessary to access banking and financial services as well as gain integration with the government\u2019s waste picker registry. Waste pickers will be able to receive and make payments on the cashless system at low cost, avoiding the risks inherent in handling cash. We plan to register around 10,000 waste pickers by the end of 2022.\n\n**diginexLUMEN Supports Responsible Recruitment Practices**\n\nIn the Middle East, we have a project to help support responsible recruitment of migrant workers.\n\nWe recently partnered with Diginex to develop diginexLUMEN (LUMEN), a technology-led due diligence and governance tool that can provide greater transparency of the labor recruitment supply chain. LUMEN helps to identify and prioritize human rights and labor risks by collecting, verifying and mapping data on recruitment and employment practices from various sources including workers, suppliers and labor agencies. Risk scoring is used to develop action plans to address risks and ensure continuous improvement in ethical recruitment.\n\nIn 2021, we piloted LUMEN at several locations, including two bottling plants, five supplier facilities and three labor agencies in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. We are looking to expand the use of LUMEN to more facilities in the near future.\nEconomic Empowerment\n\nThe Coca-Cola system has a long history of enabling the economic empowerment of local communities where we do business. With operations in more than 200 countries and territories and a network of more than 225 bottling partners, we partner with entrepreneurs in markets where we operate around the world.\n\nIn 2010, we set out to address the structural inequalities and economic barriers faced by women entrepreneurs in particular. We publicly pledged to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million female entrepreneurs by 2020 through our 5by20\u00ae initiative, by providing access to business skills training, mentoring networks, financial services and assets. Together with our public and private sector partners, including our bottling partners and The Coca-Cola Foundation, we exceeded our target, enabling the economic empowerment of more than 6 million women.\n\nEconomic Empowerment in 2021\n\nWe surpassed our economic empowerment goal in 2020, and the Coca-Cola system continued to drive women\u2019s economic empowerment initiatives across our regions in 2021.\n\nThe Nigerian Bottling Company kicked off the second phase of \u201cCatalyst for Change,\u201d an economic empowerment program coordinated in partnership with the nonprofit Karis and Eleos Hand of Hope Foundation, with funding from The Coca-Cola Foundation. The project will provide startup capital for 1,000 women and ultimately empower 5,000 women.\n\nIn the Philippines, we extended our support of a program that offers interest-free loans to entrepreneurs who operate small variety stores and food stalls. The Rebuilding Sari-Sari Stores Through Access to Resources and Trade (ReSTART) program, which began in 2020 in partnership with government agencies and two leading micro-finance institutions, has supported more than 20,000 micro and small business owners\u2014the majority of them women.\n\nIn 2021, Coca-Cola Bangladesh partnered with the development organization United Purpose to create 30 Women\u2019s Business Centers where more than 30,000 women received business skills training. Between 2015 and 2020, Coca-Cola and United Purpose built a network of more than 70 such training centers, supporting 100,000 women with business and technology skills and putting them on the path toward economic self-reliance.\nEmployee Safety & Health\n\nA safe workplace is fundamental to our success as a company. Our objective is simple: Every day, the people who make and distribute our products should leave work as healthy and as safe as when they arrived. Inspired by our \u201cZero is Possible\u201d vision, we work to identify and control preventable serious injuries in our system\u2019s facilities.\n\nIn 2021, we strengthened our Safety & Health strategy to drive performance across our system and reinforce safety as a key part of our core values. We implemented a comprehensive, preventative program to further identify and mitigate the potential for serious incidents to occur in our facilities. Our safety program includes a set of front-line and management responsibilities and behaviors that must be proactively demonstrated, including guidance tools and indicators to recognize, evaluate and ensure controls are in place to prevent such incidents from occurring.\n\nManagement commitment and strong employee engagement play an important role in creating a safe and healthy workplace and supporting a culture of learning and improving, and all employees are our partners in embedding safe habits and strengthening our safety culture. We are also promoting a learning environment by continuing to engage directly with employees to uncover hidden safety risks and challenges and to champion transparency.\n\nWhile we have been demonstrating year-over-year improvements to our injury rates, we continue to experience preventable incidents within our global system. We believe that one preventable serious injury is too many, and we have processes in place to ensure our employees and contractors report all injuries, regardless of severity.\n\nOur digital Environmental Occupational Health and Safety performance management tools help us identify potential incidents so we can gain insights and establish ways to prevent them. Our knowledge-sharing platform allows our operating units and bottling partners to easily communicate information so we can learn faster, share those learnings across the system and prevent similar incidents from happening elsewhere.\n\nAfter any preventable incident occurs or had the potential to occur, we conduct thorough learning sessions, develop corrective action plans and share them across our system and with our Global Safety Council.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company\u2019s global Lost-Time Incident Rate was 0.28 in 2021.1\n\nSee additional performance indicators in the Data Appendix.\n\n1 Global Ventures, CHI, fairlife and BODYARMOR employees are currently excluded from our LTIR reporting. For more information, view the criteria statement.\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nWe believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace makes us stronger as a company, enables us to create a better shared future for employees and communities, empowers access to equal opportunity, and builds belonging in our workplaces and in society.\n\nIn 2021, we refreshed our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) strategy to expand the global reach and impact of our programs and policies while driving accountability. The updated strategy also deepens our focus on equity that took center stage in 2020 amidst a climate of widespread civil unrest and global conversations about systemic racism and inequality.\n\nWe focus our internal and external DEI efforts across five broad dimensions of diversity:\n\n- Gender Balance\n- Culture & Heritage\n- Ability & Wellness\n- Generations & Life Experiences\n- LGBTIQ+\n\nOur strategy, which incorporates social justice and economic empowerment work, will be woven into how we do business and function as teams\u2014from talent management to supply chain.\n\nPay Equity\n\nAt The Coca-Cola Company, we believe in equal pay for equal work. We define pay equity as compensating employees fairly and equitably, without regard to gender, or race and ethnicity (globally and in the United States, respectively).\n\nFor several years, we have conducted pay equity analyses in the United States to ensure base pay structures are fair and to identify and address potential issues or disparities. In 2019, we extended pay equity analysis for gender globally. In 2021, we took a deeper dive on pay equity, hiring an external consultant to conduct a global pay equity audit. Given the company\u2019s significant organizational changes in 2021, we will conduct a follow-up analysis in 2022. We will continue to conduct annual analyses and are motivated by the opportunity to build a more equitable and inclusive culture. Read more about our pay equity philosophy.\n\nBuilding Accountability and Developing Tools\n\nIn 2022, the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved plans to link ESG performance measures to our annual and long-term incentive programs for executives. In the annual incentive program, we are reinforcing our commitment to DEI by incorporating demonstrable commitments by executives to reach goals that reflect our 2030 aspirations to be 50% led by women globally, and, in the United States, to align race and ethnicity representation to U.S. census data across all job levels.\n\nIn 2021, we developed a global social justice issue evaluation methodology and tool in partnership with BSR, a leading sustainability nonprofit, to help regional public affairs and human resources leaders effectively and consistently evaluate whether and how to engage on social justice issues locally.\nMirroring the Markets We Serve by 2030\n\n- Aspiring to be 50% led by women globally\n- Aligning U.S. race/ethnicity representation to U.S. census data across all job levels\n\nTransparency and Reporting\n\nWe are committed to transparency and disclosure. We share diversity metrics with senior leaders on a quarterly basis and publish representation data by race and gender for our overall workforce and leadership, including data submitted to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEO-1 survey results), on our website.\n\n2021 Gender Representation by Level (global)\u00b9\n\n| Level          | Female | Male |\n|----------------|--------|------|\n| Senior Leadership | 58.7%  | 41.3%|\n| Middle Management | 50.5%  | 49.5%|\n| Professionals   | 35.3%  | 64.7%|\n| Total           | 42.9%  | 57.1%|\n\n2021 Race/Ethnicity Representation by Level (U.S. only)\u00b9\n\n| Level          | American Indian/Alaskan | Asian | Black | Hispanic | Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander | Not disclosed | Two or more races | White |\n|----------------|-------------------------|------|-------|----------|----------------------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|\n| Senior Leadership | 0.2%                   | 10.0%| 0.2%  | 0.4%     | 0.2%                             | 0.9%          | 0.2%             | 62.7% |\n| Middle Management | 0.3%                   | 12.4%| 15.4% | 8.9%     | 0.2%                             | 4.6%          | 0.2%             | 58.0% |\n| Professionals   | 0.6%                    | 42.3%| 27.4% | 20.6%    | 2.5%                             | 2.2%          | 0.3%             | 50.4% |\n| Total           | 0.5%                    | 50.4%| 20.9% | 14.8%    | 2.2%                             | 3.8%          | 0.2%             | 57.2% |\n\n\u00b9 Data as of December 31, 2021, for salaried and hourly employees.

Our Inclusion Networks serve as valuable resources to employees and to our company. These regionally structured, globally connected employee groups help build affinity and allyship, and they enhance our ability to recruit, retain, engage and develop diverse talent. They also create diverse sounding boards for business strategies and initiatives, capturing input on potential actions through the lens of inclusion.\n\nBUILDING A PIPELINE OF WOMEN LEADERS\n\nSince 2019, a Global Women's Leadership Council (GWLC)-led sponsorship program has paired high-potential female talent from around the world with members of the company's executive leadership team to help prepare them for senior roles. The two-year initiative supports our ambition to be 50% women-led globally by 2030 by building our leadership pipeline. Participants gain exposure to different experiences across the business and ongoing networking opportunities with executive sponsors and peers.\n\n\"The Coca-Cola Company is deeply rooted in relationships, whether it be with our bottlers, customers, consumers or employees. Relationships open the door to opportunity. The GWLC sponsorship program provided me with an opportunity to build relationships with senior leaders, enhancing my chance to fulfill my aspiration to become general counsel. I am confident it will create and enhance opportunities for other women as well.\"\n\nMonica Howard Douglas\nSVP and General Counsel, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nPROMOTING RACIAL EQUITY AND CULTURAL SENSITIVITY\n\nBuilding on contributions to social justice organizations committed to building understanding and driving change, The Coca-Cola Foundation awarded several grants in 2020-2021 to Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI)-focused nonprofits, including: $1 million to The Asian American Legal Defense & Education Fund; $500,000 to Asian Americans Advancing Justice; $250,000 to the Center for Pan Asian Community Services; and $100,000 to the National ACE #AAPIStrong program.\n\nSupporting LGBTIQ+ Rights in Japan\n\nCoca-Cola Japan and five bottling partners jointly established policies to offer the same medical and parental leave benefits to same-sex partner employees. Furthermore, to support LGBTIQ+ equality in Japan, we joined other Japan-based companies to sign an open letter, written by Human Rights Watch and a coalition of 100+ LGBT organizations in Japan, which endorsed changes to the laws that would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and contribute to an inclusive society where everyone is treated equally.\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company 2021 Business & ESG Report\n\nOverview Human Rights Economic Empowerment Safety & Health Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Giving Back\n\nCEO Message\n\nOur Company Water Portfolio Packaging Climate Agriculture People Operations Data Appendix Frameworks\n\nHuman Rights\n\nOverview Economic Empowerment Giving Back Safety & Health Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nFOSTERING DIVERSITY IN DATA SCIENCES\n\nTogether with SAP, we are partnering with the Atlanta University Center Data Science Initiative to establish a virtual computer lab at the Robert W.

The initiative aims to become the largest producer of Black graduates with expertise and credentials in data science.\n\n\"Today\u2019s consumers reflect a richly diverse culture\u2014not only of ethnicity, but also of thought and experience. They are looking for brands that are authentic, purpose-driven and relatable. It\u2019s our job to reflect the diversity of the communities we serve and the consumers we\u2019re trying to attract.\u201d\n\nMelanie Boulden\nChief Marketing Officer, North America Operating Unit\nThe Coca-Cola Company\n\nAccelerating Our Supplier Diversity Commitments\n\nWe are focused on increasing the overall diversity of our suppliers and have committed to spending at least $1 billion annually with diverse suppliers. We aspire to join the Billion Dollar Roundtable\u2014the gold standard of supplier diversity, currently with only 27 member companies.\n\n$800M\nspent by the Coca-Cola system with diverse suppliers in the United States in 2021\n\n\"We acknowledge the disadvantages that some smaller companies have in competing for business opportunities with large multinational companies. We\u2019re excited about the potential of this program to pioneer a more evolved and inclusive approach to supporting minority-owned media companies and partners.\u201d\n\nFernando Hernandez\nVice President, Supplier Diversity, The Coca-Cola Company\n\nSUPPORTING MINORITY-OWNED MEDIA\n\nIn 2021, we announced plans to nearly double our spending with minority-owned media companies over the next three years in North America. This means that Black, Hispanic and Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI)-owned and led media companies and partners will increase to account for 8% of our total annual media budget in North America by 2024. We achieved our stated goal of a fivefold increase in spending with minority-owned media companies in 2021 versus 2020, and we are on track to achieve our three-year target by 2024. Across our supply chain, we have committed to step up spending with Black-owned enterprises by at least $500 million cumulatively by 2025.\n\nTo help Black, Hispanic and AAPI media partners grow, our global procurement team launched a pilot certification assistance program in partnership with the Georgia Minority Supplier Development Council.\n\n1 As of 2021, we are aligning our reported spending metrics with the Roundtable\u2019s criteria by only including Tier 1 supplier spending. We previously combined both Tier 1 spending (our direct suppliers) and Tier 2 spending (the amount our suppliers spend with their diverse suppliers).\nGiving Back to Communities\n\nThe Coca-Cola Foundation, the independent philanthropic arm of The Coca-Cola Company, is committed to a charitable giving strategy that makes a difference in communities around the world. In 2021, The Coca-Cola Foundation contributed $109.2 million to approximately 350 organizations globally.\n\nStopping the Spread of COVID-19\n\nIn 2021, our contributions included the creation of a $20 million fund to help stop the spread of COVID-19, including support for distribution of vaccines and personal protective equipment (PPE), public awareness campaigns and more\u2014bringing the Foundation\u2019s total pandemic-focused funding to more than $75 million over the last two years.\n\nThe $20 million \u201cStop the Spread\u201d Fund awarded 63 grants to 56 nonprofit partners, benefiting 30 million people in 59 countries. Larger grants included $3.6 million to United Way of Mumbai to support vaccine distribution initiatives and public awareness campaigns in 22 districts across India and $5 million in funding to Project Last Mile to support vaccine rollouts in eight African countries.\n\nResponding to Natural Disasters and Humanitarian Crises\n\nWe remain committed to supporting communities in times of crisis. In 2021, the Foundation provided more than $7 million in funding for natural disaster preparedness and relief\u2014as well as other humanitarian aid efforts. These donations supported 15 countries and included responses to earthquakes in Haiti and Croatia; flooding in Sudan, Canada, Germany, China and Belgium; tornados, winter storms and Hurricane Ida in the United States; wildfires in Turkey; a volcano in the Caribbean; a super typhoon in the Philippines; and the refugee crisis in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Foundation 2021 Contributions\n\n| Category                        | Amount   |\n|---------------------------------|----------|\n| COVID-19                         | $22.6M   |\n| Social Justice                  | $0.3M    |\n| Water & Environment             | $19.7M   |\n| Community Well-Being            | $13.9M   |\n| Recycling                       | $16.1M   |\n| Education & Youth Development   | $11.6M   |\n| Women\u2019s Empowerment             | $10.9M   |\n| Disaster Relief & Humanitarian Aid | $8.0M   |\n| Matching Gifts                  | $6.1M    |\n| Total                           | $109.2M  |\n\n2.0% of operating income invested back into local communities from The Coca-Cola Company and The Coca-Cola Foundation in 2021\u2014well above our annual goal of 1%.\n\nLENDING A HAND IN OUR HOMETOWN\n\nWe continue to invest in the well-being of Atlanta, a city we\u2019ve proudly called home for more than 135 years. In 2021, we awarded several major grants to organizations in our community:\n\n- $5 million to Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta\u2014the largest and only freestanding pediatric healthcare system in Georgia\u2014to create a behavioral and mental health system of care that will leverage early intervention to improve outcomes, reduce stigma and enhance access to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.\n- $2 million to the Robert W. Woodruff Arts Center for expansion of community access to the performing and visual arts and for support of professional development for diverse artists.\n- $2 million to the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership in support of green infrastructure projects at two parks.\n- $1 million to support scholarships at Morehouse College for students who are the first in their families to attend college.\n- $1.5 million to support the United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta\u2019s Child Well-Being Impact Fund.\n\n1 This percentage was calculated based on the company\u2019s prior year operating income (excluding the Bottling Investments Group operating segment).\nProject Last Mile launched in 2010 with a simple premise: How can the private sector, and The Coca-Cola Company in particular, share its supply chain and distribution expertise to help ensure life-saving medicines and health services reach communities that need them most\u2014those in the so-called \u201clast mile.\u201d\n\nOver the last decade, our company and The Coca-Cola Foundation have worked with a coalition of partners, including The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the United States Agency for International Development, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to get medicines to go the \u201clast mile\u201d for communities in Africa.\n\nIn South Africa, for example, Project Last Mile worked with the National Department of Health to design and operationalize a dispensing and distribution system for chronic illness medications, including HIV antiretroviral treatments, that now includes 2,800 pickup points.\n\nWhen COVID-19 struck, Project Last Mile jumped in to help accelerate the distribution of vaccines across the continent with help from the Coca-Cola system, including $5 million in grants from The Coca-Cola Foundation since 2021.\n\nUsing expertise from the Coca-Cola system, Project Last Mile has connected government agencies with private sector and NGO partners, offering data and strategic, logistical and technical support to organizations and health ministries to deliver vaccines. For example, Project Last Mile reviewed GPS coordinates of private clinics, pharmacies and other potential vaccination locations, and conducted an audit of the Coca-Cola system\u2019s dry ice capacity to safely transport across 70 countries vaccines that must be stored at cold temperatures.\n\nIn Eswatini, Project Last Mile supported the Ministry of Health in developing and executing their cold-chain storage plan for 1.5 million vaccine doses. Project Last Mile also launched a digital social media campaign to address myths and increase demand for COVID-19 vaccines, reaching 70% of Eswatini\u2019s social media users within two months.\n\nIn South Africa, Project Last Mile supported small and medium enterprises to stimulate local production of essential COVID-19 supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE), creating more than 400 local jobs, and facilitated a partnership to establish \u201cVaccStations\u201d to reach 42,000 people per month in areas without brick-and-mortar vaccine sites or health facilities.\n\nProject Last Mile and Coca-Cola teams have helped health ministries promote preventative pandemic protocols, such as hand washing and social distancing, and drive demand for the vaccine through public awareness campaigns targeting people living with HIV who are especially vulnerable to the pandemic. These campaigns have reached more than 30 million people through a combination of traditional media and innovative communications platforms.\n\n\u201cAs more Coca-Cola teams around the world come to understand our work, we are getting requests for insight on how to leverage our NGO and private sector partners to support COVID-19 efforts,\u201d said Adrian Ristow, Project Last Mile project director. \u201cWe\u2019re helping them think through how to create a model that makes it easier to partner with government at such a critical time by leveraging the capabilities, resources and networks of the Coca-Cola system.\u201d\n\n**PROJECT LAST MILE BY THE NUMBERS SINCE 2010**\n\n- **12 COUNTRIES**\n- **35.6M LIVES REACHED**\n- **6 GLOBAL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERS**\nOperations Highlights\n\nOur networked organization is comprised of nine operating units that are focused on regional and local execution and sit under four geographic operating segments\u2014Asia Pacific; Europe, Middle East & Africa; Latin America; and North America, plus Global Ventures and Bottling Investments Group.

Includes select primary consumer packaging materials.\n4. In 2019, we modified the methodology we use for calculating the amount of recycled material used in our Primary Consumer Packaging. These changes are designed to integrate a more accurate dataset, including primary data where it is available. Moving forward, we expect that these numbers will continue to evolve as data sources improve, at the same time that we work to increase rates of recycled material use.\n5. We changed our method to track the packaging collection rate against our World Without Waste goal beginning with 2018 data. With better data available, we expanded the metric to encompass all of our packaging types, including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc.\n6. Collection rate represents a weighted average of national collection rates, collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to TCCS\u2019s sales in units to express the percent of equivalent bottles and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling for the year. Collection rates are determined by country for each packaging type based on either national studies (approximately 80%), plant standards (approximately 15%), or internal estimates (approximately 5%).\n7.

In 2019, Employee Relations redefined how cases were captured in the case management tool of record. Therefore, the reported figure includes only those allegations that required investigations only as opposed to general questions raised to Employee Relations. Please note, however, that all questions presented to Employee Relations were answered even if the question did not warrant an investigation. While we previously reported on all cases and questions raised through our case management tool, we no longer capture that data. This helps us to ensure that we have more accurate visibility to annual Human Rights cases. This change accounts for the 2019 variance when compared to previous years.\n3.

The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s management is responsible for the Subject Matter, in accordance with the Criteria. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review.\n\nOur review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria. A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the subject matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter is in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. A review also does not provide assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.\n\nIn performing our review, we have also complied with the independence and other ethical requirements set forth in the Code of Professional Conduct and applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA.\n\nAs described in Note 3 of Exhibit A, the Subject Matter is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.\n\nThe information included in The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s 2021 Business & ESG Report, other than the Subject Matter, has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our review and, accordingly, we express no conclusion on it.\n\nBased on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the Schedule of Selected Sustainability Indicators as of (for the year ended) December 31, 2021 in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\nErnst & Young LLP\nSuite 1000\n55 Ivan Allen Jr. Boulevard\nAtlanta, GA 30308\nTel: +1 404 874 8300\nFax: +1 404 817 5589\ney.com\n### Exhibit A\u2013Schedule of Selected Sustainability Indicators\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021\n\n| INDICATOR NAME                                                                 | SCOPE                                                                 | UNIT                                                                 | REPORTED VALUE |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Greenhouse gas emissions (manufacturing activities); Location based Method      | The Coca-Cola System                                                  | CO\u2082e emissions in millions of metric tonnes                          | 5.49           |\n| Lost time incident rate                                                        | The Coca-Cola Company                                                 | Number of lost time incidents multiplied by 200,000 and divided by the number of hours worked | 0.28           |\n| Water replenished                                                              | Projects funded by The Coca-Cola Company, The Coca-Cola Foundation and/or The Coca-Cola System | Liters of water replenished per liters of finished beverages sold | More than 100% |\n| Water use ratio                                                                | The Coca-Cola System                                                 | Liters of water used per liter of product produced                  | 1.81           |\n| Percent of recycled material used in select global primary consumer packaging   | The Coca-Cola System                                                 | %                                                                   | 23%            |\n| Percent of the equivalent bottles and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling | The Coca-Cola System                                                 | %                                                                   | 61%            |\n\nAs of December 31, 2021\n\n| INDICATOR NAME                                                                 | SCOPE                                                                 | UNIT | REPORTED VALUE |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------|----------------|\n| Global gender representation                                                   | The Coca-Cola Company                                                 | %    |                |\n| Senior Leadership                                                              |                                                                      |      | Female 38.7%; Male 61.3% |\n| Middle management                                                              |                                                                      |      | Female 50.5%; Male 49.5% |\n| Professionals                                                                  |                                                                      |      | Female 35.3%; Male 64.7% |\n| Total                                                                         |                                                                      |      | Female 42.9%; Male 57.1% |\n| US ethnic/racial representation                                                | The Coca-Cola Company                                                 | %    | Asian 7.2%; Hispanic 14.8%; Black 20.9%; American Indian/Alaskan 0.5%; Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 0.2%; White 50.4%; Two or more 2.2%; Not specified 3.8% |\n\n1 Refer to Note 2 for additional information about the scope and boundaries of the indicators.\nNote 1: Scope of Reporting\n\nThe Coca-Cola global business system is composed of the Coca-Cola company (TCCC) and 225 bottling partners. TCCC markets, manufactures and sells beverage concentrates and syrups and finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages. Our bottling partners are independent bottling operations authorized through bottler\u2019s agreements to prepare, package, distribute and sell finished beverages to customers and/or consumers. TCCC and its bottling partners together are collectively known as The Coca-Cola system (TCCS), or simply \u201csystem.\u201d\n\nAlthough the system is not a single entity from a legal or managerial perspective, TCCC strives to positively influence environmental activities and policies throughout the bottling system and to become more transparent by reporting information from both company-owned operations and the broader system. Contract manufacturers are also used to manufacture and distribute Coca-Cola brands.\n\nTCCC provides a reasonable time period before including newly acquired facilities in the organizational boundary. This allows for the implementation of sustainability data collection policies and procedures. In general, newly acquired facility sustainability data will be included within the first two calendar years that operational sustainability data are available. An exception has been granted for our January 2019 acquisition of Costa Limited, which includes retail stores and roasteries, in which additional time has been allowed due to the fundamental difference in the business model.\n\nNote 2: Selected Sustainability Indicators Criteria\n\n| INDICATOR NAME | CRITERIA |\n|----------------|----------|\n| Greenhouse gas emissions (manufacturing activities) | The criteria can be found in the \"Carbon Accounting Manual.\" This includes manufacturing-related scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082e) emissions and scope 3 CO\u2082e emissions from franchises. Emissions from standalone (i.e., not co-located) warehouses, distribution centers and offices (based on emissions being lower than the threshold of five percent of total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) are excluded, CO\u2082 loss during production and AC/Chiller are excluded. |\n| Lost time incident rate | The Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) represents the number of Lost Time Incidents (LTI) per 100 employees and contractors. Total LTI is multiplied by 200,000 (100 full time equivalent employees working 40 hours per week for 50 weeks) then divided by the number of hours worked for the reporting period. **Scope:** The scope of reporting is limited to self-reported or witness-reported data collected for TCCC and active company-owned or controlled production facilities, distribution centers, offices, laboratories and route-to-market (fleet) operations as of December 31, 2021. Global Ventures, CHI Limited (CHI), fairlife and BODYARMOR are excluded. The exclusion represents approximately 31% of employees. **Lost Time Incident:** An LTI is a reported work-related injury or illness that results in one or more Lost Days. **Lost Day:** A Lost Day occurs when, in the opinion of the medical professional of record, the employee\u2019s work-related injury or illness prevents the person from being able to work for one or more days. The first counted Lost Day is the first day following the injury, regardless of whether it was a scheduled workday, and ends when the person is able, in the opinion of the medical professional of record, to return to work, leaves employment, or reaches 180 Lost Days. **Hours worked:** The hours worked include total hours worked during the reporting period by all employees. This excludes hours not worked, such as vacation, holidays, or absences. **Employees and contractors:** Employees and contractors include all hourly, salary and temporary employees who are on the payroll of the company (as well as non-payroll contractors and temporary employees for whom facility or fleet management provides day-to-day supervision of their work and provides the details, means, methods and processes by which the work objective is accomplished). **Uncertainties in reported LTIR:** LTIR is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The number of LTIs is based upon employees and contractors self-reporting or witnesses reporting work-related injuries or illnesses to TCCC which may be affected by culture, societal norms and/or local laws and regulations. To the extent an LTI is not reported, it would not be included in the LTIR calculation. |\n\n---\n\n2 Global Ventures is an operating segment that includes Costa coffee, Monster beverages, innocent juices and smoothies, and dogadan tea.\n\n3 Starting in 2021, fatalities are no longer reported as LTIs. Fatalities that may occur are documented and governed through a separate incident management and crisis resolution process.\nThe intent of the replenish program is to develop a global portfolio of Community Water Partnership (CWP) projects that yield an annual volumetric water benefit equivalent to the company\u2019s annual global sales volume. Water replenish is defined as the ratio of the volume of water safely provided to communities and to nature by the CWP portfolio divided by the sales volume of company beverage products as disclosed in the 2021 10-K. Volumetric project benefits are quantified using TCCC\u2019s peer reviewed methodology as outlined in the Corporate Water Stewardship: Achieving a Sustainable Balance paper published in the Journal of Management and Sustainability in November 2015, or the methodology described in Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting (VWBA): A Method for Implementing Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting (VWBA) (2019), which builds on the 2013 paper.\n\nThere are three primary CWP project types:\n1. Watershed Protection and Restoration\n2. Water Access and Sanitation\n3. Water for Productive Use\n\nWhile public education, awareness programs and business engagement on water policy reform are critical responses to water risks and challenges, the water replenish contributions from such efforts cannot reliably be quantified and are not included in the water replenish indicator. As many replenish projects are co-financed with partners, TCCC claims the portion of the total water benefits equivalent to the company\u2019s cost share for the project. TCCC also claims the annual water benefits from each project following a benefit duration framework of up to 15 years as long as the projects remain in productive service; benefits of reforestation and land conservation projects may be claimed for up to 20 years with documentation that ecosystem services and biodiversity are being achieved.\n\nFor individual projects with benefits greater than 5% of global sales volume, benefit caps are unchanged from 2020, which are based on 5% of global sales volume or 100% of the business unit sales volume, whichever is greater.\n\nWater use ratio\nWater use ratio (efficiency) is defined as liters of water used per liter of product produced. Total water used is the total of all water used by TCCS in all global production facilities and co-located distribution centers, from all sources, including municipal, well and spring, surface, sea, and collected rain. This includes water used for: production; water treatment; boiler makeup; cooling (contact and non-contact); cleaning and sanitation; backwashing filters; irrigation; washing trucks and other vehicles; kitchen or canteen; toilets and sinks; and fire control. This does not include return water or non-branded bulk water donated to the community. Liters of product produced include all production, not just saleable products.\n\nPercent of recycled material used in select global primary consumer packaging\nRecycled material used in select global primary consumer packaging is expressed as a percent of packaging material used in manufacturing as occurring within TCCS, not within co-packaging operations.\n\nSelect global primary consumer packaging includes the following for TCCS:\n- Aluminum cans\n- Beverage cartons (e.g., aseptic fiber packaging, including juice boxes)\n- Non-refillable glass bottles\n- Non-refillable PET bottles\n- Refillable glass bottles\n- Refillable PET bottles\n- Steel cans\n- Coffee cups, coffee pods, tea bags, fountain cups and cold drink cups, other (e.g., aluminum bottles and prepackaged non-refillable plastic cups) and food packaging are excluded.\n\nRecycled material is comprised of pre-consumer and/or post-consumer material. Metric tonnes of recycled material in packaging (e.g., PET, cartons, steel) is collected based on weight purchased and received throughout the year (e.g., invoices, goods received). For glass and aluminum packaging, recycled material percentages for the year are self-reported by suppliers and applied to the packaging footprint. In some cases, the supplier-provided percentages for the year are primary data; in other cases, the percentages are estimated or based on supplier-provided country or industry averages. When recycled content for the reporting period is not provided or is not available, zero is assumed.\n\nPackaging footprint is defined as the total packaging used, in metric tonnes, for the specific packaging type. Packaging data is calculated based upon packaging volumes delivered to facilities or packaging entered into production in a calendar year.\n\n4 Methodology used in 2021 remains unchanged from prior years. In 2022, TCCC expects to report on water replenished in accordance with its 2030 Water Security Strategy.\n5 Sales volume is measured in number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners (\u201cCoca-Cola system\u201d) to customers as reported by TCCC and the bottlers to TCCC and disclosed in the 2021 10-K. A \u201cunit case\u201d is a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces (5.678 liters) of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Refer to TCCC 2021 10-K for additional information regarding the 2021 measured unit cases.\n6 Primary consumer packaging represents that in direct contact with the product itself.\n7 Material from industrial waste streams that have been diverted to recycling. Reworked or reground material within the same facility does not count towards this category.\n8 Material generated by households or facilities in their role as end-users of a product which can no longer be used for its initial intended purpose.\nNote 3: Measurement Uncertainties\n\nThe Subject Matter is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.\n\n9 The plant standard for refillables is calculated as 1/n, where n is the number of uses. For refillable glass, uses are capped at n=20 or 95% collection rate. For refillable PET, uses are capped at n=5 or 80% collection rate.\n\n10 Senior Leadership is defined as employees with Job Grades 14 and above, Middle Management as Job Grades 10-13 and Professionals as Job Grades 9 and below as recorded in the Company\u2019s Human Resources systems.\nIn a separate PDF document available [here](#), we index the contents of this report to several reporting frameworks and standards.\n\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI)\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\nThe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\nThe United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)\nUN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF)\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nGRI provides a globally recognized framework for companies to measure and communicate their environmental, economic, social and governance performance. We prepared this report in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. This is the eleventh consecutive year that these reporting principles have informed our reporting process, and we assess our progress against these guidelines. In this report, the GRI General Disclosures are solely for The Coca-Cola Company. For all other indicators, the scope is identified in the referenced documents. Beyond reporting on performance indicators required by the GRI, we report on additional indicators important to our broad range of stakeholders.\n\nThis report also meets the requirements of the UNGC Advanced Communication on Progress and aligns with the UNGPRF, which addresses reporting on human rights.\n\nWe review our reporting regularly and aim to be as responsive as possible to our stakeholders\u2019 feedback.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/coca-cola_2021.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 86, "total-input-tokens": 209171, "total-output-tokens": 60938, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 38, 1], [38, 259, 2], [259, 4098, 3], [4098, 7655, 4], [7655, 8254, 5], [8254, 12779, 6], [12779, 16939, 7], [16939, 20024, 8], [20024, 22051, 9], [22051, 23129, 10], [23129, 24277, 11], [24277, 26557, 12], [26557, 26901, 13], [26901, 28946, 14], [28946, 30820, 15], [30820, 36984, 16], [36984, 37956, 17], [37956, 39736, 18], [39736, 43575, 19], [43575, 47864, 20], [47864, 49387, 21], [49387, 51969, 22], [51969, 54663, 23], [54663, 59688, 24], [59688, 62551, 25], [62551, 64800, 26], [64800, 68176, 27], [68176, 69921, 28], [69921, 74763, 29], [74763, 77375, 30], [77375, 81242, 31], [81242, 82169, 32], [82169, 85106, 33], [85106, 88539, 34], [88539, 91088, 35], [91088, 94749, 36], [94749, 97809, 37], [97809, 98363, 38], [98363, 103019, 39], [103019, 106477, 40], [106477, 111443, 41], [111443, 112165, 42], [112165, 117971, 43], [117971, 122556, 44], [122556, 127571, 45], [127571, 128929, 46], [128929, 132187, 47], [132187, 133437, 48], [133437, 136042, 49], [136042, 138325, 50], [138325, 140952, 51], [140952, 143724, 52], [143724, 145727, 53], [145727, 148480, 54], [148480, 151676, 55], [151676, 155352, 56], [155352, 158846, 57], [158846, 159543, 58], [159543, 162573, 59], [162573, 165231, 60], [165231, 168622, 61], [168622, 171145, 62], [171145, 173308, 63], [173308, 176578, 64], [176578, 177096, 65], [177096, 181949, 66], [181949, 185069, 67], [185069, 188155, 68], [188155, 191533, 69], [191533, 195474, 70], [195474, 197812, 71], [197812, 202136, 72], [202136, 204628, 73], [204628, 207582, 74], [207582, 209254, 75], [209254, 211602, 76], [211602, 213767, 77], [213767, 216654, 78], [216654, 220513, 79], [220513, 223590, 80], [223590, 227460, 81], [227460, 232367, 82], [232367, 237935, 83], [237935, 238746, 84], [238746, 240125, 85], [240125, 240125, 86]]}}
