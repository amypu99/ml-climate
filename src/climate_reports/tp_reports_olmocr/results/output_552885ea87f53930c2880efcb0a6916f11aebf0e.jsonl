It is organized around operating excellence, environmental stewardship, social responsibility, governance and financial performance. Our approach has enabled us to deliver on our vision to provide energy and improve lives, and to drive shareholder value since our start in 2012.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nPhillips 66 has published annual sustainability metrics and information on our website since the company was founded in 2012.\n\nThis year\u2019s report continues that transparency with critical performance data, the inclusion of feedback from our stakeholder engagement programs, details on our governance, oversight, policies and programs, as well as acknowledgment of our achievements and descriptions of our investments and resources, all of which are vital to our company\u2019s long-term sustainability.\n\nWe have assessed our operations against the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) materiality criteria for Refining, Marketing and Midstream, addressing those most relevant to our business and stakeholders, and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. SASB and GRI information is included on the Phillips 66 Supplemental Information website.\n\nWe also provide analysis and disclosures based on the latest version of the Task Force of Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.\n\nIn compiling this report, we considered industry trade association publications, including sustainability reporting guidance for the oil and gas industry published by Ipieca, the American Petroleum Institute and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers.\n\nUnless otherwise explicitly stated, this report covers Phillips 66\u2019s performance in 2021 and focuses on outcomes from our operated assets, including our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners LP, and WRB Refining LP, an operated joint venture. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) and DCP Midstream, LLC publish sustainability reports on their websites for interested readers.\n\nA glossary of our terms can be found in the Performance Data section of this report.\nOur Businesses: Today and Tomorrow\nWe are providing energy and finding lower-carbon ways to meet the world\u2019s energy demands and power human progress toward tomorrow.\nWe work to meet the world\u2019s growing energy needs and improve lives across the globe. Through our diverse portfolio of assets in our Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, and Marketing and Specialties businesses, we manufacture, transport and market products that drive the global economy.\n\nOur company and our industry have an important role in people\u2019s quality of life every day. We work to provide affordable, reliable energy while also positioning Phillips 66 for long-term competitiveness. We have an inclusive culture that promotes innovation and delivers value for our stakeholders. We recognize the need for investments to address climate challenges. This is why we\u2019re using our existing infrastructure and capabilities along with our research into emerging energies and renewables to help us thrive in the energy transition.\n\nACHIEVING LONG-TERM CHANGE\nWe are committed to helping the world address climate change. In 2021, we set measurable, impactful and attainable targets for GHG emissions intensity reductions. By 2030, we plan to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity from our operations by 30% and Scope 3 emissions intensity of our energy products by 15% below 2019 levels. In 2022, we added a goal to reach a 50% companywide reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by 2050.\n\nOur commitment to a lower-carbon future includes our investment in technology to improve our assets, products and processes for increased efficiency and the ability to capitalize on emerging possibilities as the energy market transforms. We recognize our employees\u2019 skills will evolve during the energy transition. Please refer to our Stakeholder Engagement section for more information about our approach to a just transition. Our compensation plan is aligned with these priorities, and, in 2021, we increased the weight of environmental metrics in calculating our annual incentive program payouts.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), global energy consumption is projected to increase by almost 50% by 2050, with petroleum and other liquid fuels remaining the main source of that energy. Achieving long-term GHG emissions reductions is ambitious and will require changes at Phillips 66, throughout our industry and in the rest of the world. The effort will also require significant shifts in consumer behavior, and supply chains will need to adjust. We believe that national policies are needed to spur investment in lower-carbon infrastructure and technology development.\n\nWhile petroleum and other liquid fuels will still be the main source of energy in 2050, renewables will likely be the fastest-growing energy source.\n\nOUR POSITION ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nPhillips 66 recognizes the need to address climate change, and we know that access to energy is an important part of the solution to many of the world\u2019s major challenges. We develop affordable energy solutions to promote human progress and economic growth while also advancing climate change solutions.\n\nThe company supports global action to reduce GHG emissions. Our approach is to improve the efficiency of our diversified and resilient operations and make investments to meet the world\u2019s evolving energy needs while advancing a lower-carbon future.\n\nPhillips 66 supports climate policy that:\n\n- Offers market-based, economywide solutions that are fuel- and technology-neutral for all energy sources to facilitate the meaningful GHG emissions reductions that are most beneficial and least costly to society\n- Balances economic, environmental, energy security and local community needs\n- Rationalizes overlapping policies or programs\n- Ensures that energy producers, manufacturers and suppliers are responsible for their direct emissions\n- Recognizes and appropriately accounts for early or voluntary actions\n- Makes any regulatory cost, and associated climate benefits, transparent to the consumer\n- Promotes fundamental public research at the pre-commercial stage to advance viable energy solutions\n2021 Financial Performance\n\nAs part of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, we navigated a challenging economic landscape while continuing to safely provide reliable, abundant, accessible and affordable energy. We funded our sustaining capital programs, generated $6 billion of operating cash flow, paid down $1.5 billion of debt, and reported record earnings in Midstream, Chemicals, and Marketing and Specialties.\n\nWe are an essential part of the value chain for many businesses and industries. In addition to manufacturing transportation fuels, we produce the raw materials used to create health care products and medical devices, including personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals, plastics and rubber, adhesives and sealants, electronics, smartphones, cars, batteries, agricultural products, and the wind turbines and solar panels that capture alternative energy. The petroleum coke we produce is part of the global supply chain for electric vehicles (EVs), and it also enables steel recycling. Our lubricants reduce friction to improve efficiency and cool EV battery packs.\n\nWEB-EXCLUSIVE VIDEO\nOur Value Chain\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nCapital Investments\n\nOur $1.9 billion 2022 capital program includes $916 million for growth capital, 45% of which supports lower-carbon opportunities. We\u2019re also planning to invest $1 billion in energy-efficiency projects over the next decade.\n\n$13+ billion\nin capital investments over the past five years\n\n$1.9 billion\nin capital investments in 2022\n\nFor more details on our assets and operations, read the Year in Review. Financial information is available on the Phillips 66 Investors site.\nEmerging Energy\n\nIn 2021, we launched our Emerging Energy organization. Our team, from various disciplines, is focused on executing our lower-carbon strategy by commercializing and implementing new technology within our operations and portfolio of assets and increasing renewable power usage. The team concentrates on four key areas: building on existing businesses to become a market leader in renewable fuels, participating in the battery value chain, establishing a competitive position in carbon capture and participating in low-carbon hydrogen markets.\n\nGlobal Specialties Provides Essential Products\n\nOur Global Specialties business brings value to our diversified portfolio and vertical integration between refining and petrochemical processes.\n\nWe refine and sell specialty products, including fuel coke, premium coke, solvents and polypropylene, all of which contribute to improving the quality of life worldwide.\n\nWe are the only producer and marketer of specific grades of petroleum coke, which are used in manufacturing steel, lithium-ion batteries, aluminum, titanium dioxide and specialty graphite products.\n\nWhile making clean products, our Bayway facility in Linden, New Jersey, also upgrades refining gas byproducts to make polypropylene resin. Polypropylene is recyclable and used in automotive components, appliances, carpeting, and health care and hygiene products.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nEV Specialty Products\n\nOur products can be found in all types of vehicles.\nResearch and Innovation\n\nPhillips 66 is one of the few downstream energy companies with in-house research and development capabilities via our Energy Research & Innovation (ERI) organization. In addition to supporting current operations, this team supports a lower-carbon future by helping to develop and commercialize new technologies.\n\nThe scientists and engineers at our Phillips 66 Research Center in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, work to enhance the safety and reliability of our operations and to develop air, water and energy solutions, including battery technology and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which can be used for electricity storage.\n\nPhillips 66 has 399 active U.S. patents in specialty carbon, premium coke, low-carbon hydrogen, solid oxide fuel cells, carbon capture, organic photovoltaics and biofuels, as of Dec. 31, 2021.\n\nSOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS\n\nPhillips 66 continues to progress its solid oxide fuel cell technology, holding nine U.S. patents and 29 U.S. pending patent applications in our SOFC\u2019s intellectual property portfolio.\n\n- We published our patented SOFCs fabrication technique and research data in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society\n- We installed a field demonstration of this technology at a Phillips 66 pipeline that has been in operation since 2020\n- We anticipate a second application will be installed at a Phillips 66 marketing site in 2022\n- In 2021, we announced that Phillips 66 was awarded a $3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to advance high-performance reversible SOFCs\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nSOFCs Explained\n\nSOFCs generate electricity efficiently by oxidizing a fuel, such as natural gas, through electrochemical reactions rather than combustion. SOFCs can generate electricity at high efficiencies from an abundant, reliable and inexpensive fuel source. They produce no noise, have a 50% lower-carbon footprint than conventional power plants, have no combustion emissions and are an ideal technology for carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) capture.\n\nSOFCs also can be paired with solar- or wind-generated power, ensuring reliable energy even when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing. Their quiet, compact, modular design makes them a convenient source of on-site power for homes and businesses.\nRenewable Diesel and Alternative Fuels\n\nPhillips 66 provides transportation fuels that move people and goods, and as we push forward into a lower-carbon future, we are prioritizing renewable fuel projects that leverage existing infrastructure. We will process waste fats, cooking oils and other renewable feedstocks into transportation fuels. In 2021, we began producing renewable fuels from vegetable oil at our San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, and we refine fuel from used cooking oil (UCO) at our Humber Refinery in North Lincolnshire, United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2021, we announced that we are securing feedstock for our growing portfolio of renewable fuels projects by investing in Shell Rock Soy Processing, a new soybean-processing plant in Iowa. Additionally, we support future renewable diesel production through our agreement with New Rise Renewables in Nevada.\n\nCONVERTING OUR SAN FRANCISCO REFINERY\n\nThe Rodeo facility\u2019s focus on energy efficiency was recognized in early 2020 when it became the first crude oil refinery in California to earn an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ENERGY STAR certification for superior energy efficiency. Now we\u2019re taking the refinery to the next phase. It\u2019s being converted to process waste fats, UCO and other renewable feedstocks. When the conversion is complete in early 2024, Rodeo will be one of the world\u2019s largest renewable fuels facilities, able to produce more than 800 million gallons per year (over 50,000 BPD) of renewable diesel, renewable gasoline and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The conversion is expected to significantly reduce criteria pollutant emissions from our operations, preserve well-paying jobs and help California meet both its demand for transportation fuels and its environmental goals.\n\nTo further reduce GHG emissions, the refinery is pursuing other sustainable projects, including solar power to provide electricity to run its processes and exploring carbon capture.\n\nPhillips 66 made a final investment decision in 2022 to move forward with Rodeo Renewed after the project received approval from Contra Costa County.\nRodeo Renewed\nThe Rodeo Renewed project will help California meet regional demand for renewable and conventional transportation fuels while assisting the state in achieving its environmental goals, including carbon neutrality by 2050. Projected environmental and economic results are highlighted below.\n\n**EMISSIONS**\n(Once converted)\n\n- **\u2193 80%** sulfur oxides (SO\u2082)\n- **\u2193 33%** nitrous oxides (NO\u2093)\n- **\u2193 20%** particulate-matter emissions (PM\u2081\u2080)\n- **\u2193 65%** fewer life-cycle carbon emissions, the equivalent of taking 1.4 million cars off the road each year\n\n**160 million**\ngallons of water saved per year\n\n**800 million**\ngallons of renewable transportation fuels produced per year, including:\n- **Renewable diesel**: a high-cetane fuel that runs in all diesel engines and has a lower-carbon intensity than conventional diesel\n- **Sustainable aviation fuel**: a lower-carbon intensity fuel alternative for the airline industry\n\n**FEEDSTOCKS**\nWe will have the capability to process a variety of renewable feedstocks, including:\n- Fats and greases\n- Used cooking oil\n- Vegetable oils\n\n**JOBS IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY**\n\n- **650** full-time and contractor jobs preserved through the conversion\n- **500** construction jobs to be created and filled using local union labor\n- **~4 million** projected construction work-hours\nBRINGING MORE RENEWABLE FUELS TO CALIFORNIA DRIVERS\n\nBiodiesel and renewable diesel are both renewable fuels but have different manufacturing processes. Biodiesel\u2019s process requires it be blended with traditional diesel before being used in an engine. Renewable diesel can be used as a drop-in fuel.\n\nOur Richmond and Sacramento terminals in California have blended up to 20% biodiesel since 2018. We also blend biodiesel at our Colton Terminal in Bloomington, California.\n\nIn 2021, we added capability to sell renewable diesel in almost 600 76 branded stations in California.\n\nADVANCING SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL\n\nSAF is a lower-carbon intensity aviation fuel produced from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, fats, greases and vegetable oils. Because it is a drop-in fuel, it works in existing aircraft engines and airport fuel infrastructure.\n\nPhillips 66 is a major U.S. refiner and supplier of petroleum jet fuel and avgas, and, in 2021, we signed a multiyear supply agreement with British Airways to provide SAF directly to the airline through existing pipelines. Also in 2021, we signed a memorandum of understanding with Southwest Airlines to advance the commercialization of SAF in the United States. These agreements leverage our history of innovation and our expertise in refining, distribution and technical commercialization.\n\nENABLING ADOPTION OF EVs\n\nLithium-ion batteries help power products from EVs to millions of smartphones and other consumer electronics, and the need for these batteries is projected to experience sharp growth over the coming decades.\n\nWe are a market supplier for the coke used as a precursor in lithium-ion batteries, and our battery program is focused on improving existing materials. As part of this effort, we are working to find ways to incorporate readily available, responsibly sourced materials that have the potential to extend the driving range for EVs.\n\nIn 2021, we acquired a 16% stake in NOVONIX, and we have an agreement to advance the production and commercialization of next-generation anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The agreement enables both companies to leverage leading industry positions, existing intellectual property, and research and development capabilities to drive commercial development of optimized feedstocks and lithium-ion anode materials with reduced carbon-intensive processing.\n\nWe\u2019re also part of a technical collaboration with battery-maker Faradion to develop lower-cost and higher-performing anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. This energy storage technology has an advantage because it uses sustainable and widely available materials. The collaboration is expected to leverage our experience developing specialty carbon materials and Faradion\u2019s work as a leader in sodium-ion battery technology. Applications for this technology include mobility, stationary storage, backup power and energy in remote locations.\n\nIn 2022, we signed a letter of intent with FreeWire Technologies in support of its first EV charging program in the United States. The program will bring consumers electric fueling stations that meet their expectations for high-speed, on-the-go charging. In addition to batteries, we produce high-performing lubricants formulated to meet the unique needs of EVs. In 2021, we launched the new Phillips 66 e-Shield line of products, including system fluid, grease and coolant.\nUSING HYDROGEN AS A FUEL\n\nHydrogen is important in a number of manufacturing and agricultural applications. Phillips 66 is evaluating ways to invest in using hydrogen in our operations and expanding consumer choices as a transportation fuel.\n\nHydrogen fuel can be produced from 100% renewable energy, including hydropower, wind, sun, biomass and geothermal sources, and when hydrogen is used to power fuel cell electric vehicles, the emissions are entirely CO$_2$-free.\n\nIn 2022, we announced our commitment to form a joint venture with H2 Energy Europe to develop as many as 250 retail hydrogen refueling stations in Germany, Austria and Denmark by 2026. The partnership leverages the strength of our existing JET brand and will also utilize new locations on major transportation routes.\n\nWe anticipate demand for hydrogen will, in part, come from H2 Energy\u2019s ownership in Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility, a European retail and distribution partner for Hyundai\u2019s commercially available heavy-duty fuel cell truck.\n\n250\n\nprojected hydrogen refueling stations in Europe by 2026\n\nOur Swiss joint venture, Coop Mineraloel AG, in which Phillips 66 has a 49% interest, already has a hydrogen fueling program and has worked with Hyundai on the world\u2019s first fleet of hydrogen-powered trucks.\n\nCAPTURING CARBON FROM OUR OPERATIONS\n\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) could enable decarbonization across manufacturing and heavy industry. International Energy Agency (IEA) projections indicate that, by 2040, CCS could lower global emissions by as much as 15%. Without this technology, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates global decarbonization efforts could be twice as costly.\n\nPhillips 66 joined several other companies in 2021 in expressing support for the large-scale deployment of CCS technology in and around the Houston, Texas, industrial area. Together, these companies and others in the region could capture and store up to 50 million tons of CO$_2$ per year by 2030 and about 100 million tons per year by 2040.\n\nIn 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded Phillips 66 a grant to perform an initial engineering design study for employing CCS technology at the hydrogen production unit at our San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California. We are also evaluating projects to decarbonize our operations at other locations, including the Humber Refinery in the United Kingdom.\nBuilding a Lower-carbon Value Chain\n\nPhillips 66 Limited, a U.K.-based, wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, is pursuing projects, technologies and partnerships that support decarbonization and the U.K. government\u2019s 2050 net-zero ambitions. We are creating the refinery of the future by producing lower-carbon fuels from waste and reducing the carbon intensity of our manufacturing processes. We are also contributing to the growth of a lower-carbon value chain by supplying battery-grade coke to power EVs, supporting EV charging stations and developing hydrogen refueling networks.\n\nFROM USED COOKING OIL TO USABLE FUEL\n\nIn 2017, the Humber Refinery was the first refinery in the United Kingdom to produce high-performing biofuels at scale when we started using UCO in our refining processes. The decarbonization benefit of using waste oil in refining is significant. Life-cycle emissions are 90% lower with UCO than with conventional fuels.\n\nThrough co-processing waste oils and other renewable feedstocks, Humber produces a broad range of products, from battery coke to bio-propane, bio-gasoline and SAF.\n\nSUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL\n\nHumber is the first refinery in the U.K. to produce SAF at scale. We are a member of the Department for Transport\u2019s Jet Zero Council Delivery Group and support U.K. government plans for a future SAF mandate and a business model for investing in advanced waste-to-jet-fuel projects.\n\nIn 2022, we made our first delivery of SAF to British Airways from our Humber Refinery as part of a multiyear supply agreement. In recognition of this achievement, Humber Refinery received the Humber Renewables award for Green Innovation in 2022.\n\nRENEWABLE DIESEL\n\nAlongside our work to provide the lower-carbon fuels of tomorrow such as hydrogen and EV batteries, we are also focused on decarbonizing the existing road fleet. JET Renewable Diesel is a fuel that is chemically similar to conventional fossil-fuel-based diesel, but it\u2019s derived from biomass sources such as UCO, fats, greases and vegetable oils, resulting in a fuel of significantly lower-carbon intensity. JET Renewable Diesel meets specific sustainability and supply chain criteria that qualify it as a renewable transport fuel* under U.K. law.\n\n*\u201cRenewable transport fuel\u201d as defined under Energy Act 2004 c. 20, s. 132 interpretation of Chapter 5 of Part 2 and applied under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation Order 2007/3072 (as amended). The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation Order (RTFO) regulates renewable fuels used for transport in the U.K. For further information see our JET Renewable Diesel.\nEV BATTERY COKE\nHumber Refinery is the only European facility producing battery-grade coke, which forms a critical component for batteries in EVs and consumer electronics.\n\nBy 2024, all U.K.- and EU-produced EVs are required to have at least 55% of the vehicle content by value produced domestically.\n\nEV CHARGING\nWe are supporting decarbonization of the U.K. car fleet through the launch of JET Charge ultra-rapid charging service. This service debuted at our JET Refinery service station in Immingham, providing high-speed chargers for EV drivers.\n\nCARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE\nHumber Refinery sits in the largest GHG-emitting industrial cluster in the United Kingdom and can play a pivotal role in not only reducing its own carbon footprint but also the wider region\u2019s.\n\nHumber Zero\nWe are a leader in Humber Zero, a regional CCS project capable of removing 8 million metric tons of CO\u2082 per year by 2030.\n\nPhillips 66 and combined heat and power company VPI Immingham are investing a total of \u00a312.5 million to advance the Humber Zero project. Innovate UK Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is matching that investment.\n\nRENEWABLE HYDROGEN\nPhillips 66 believes the U.K. has the potential to be a global leader in low-carbon hydrogen production, with exciting applications in transportation fuels, home heating, power storage and decarbonizing industrial processes that require energy inputs at levels electrification cannot achieve.\n\nGigastack\nHumber Refinery is part of a consortium leading the Gigastack project to generate renewable hydrogen using renewable power from wind, which will be used to heat the refinery\u2019s furnaces and reduce fuel consumption.\n\nThe refinery has an existing industrial-scale hydrogen infrastructure, mitigating the risks and costs associated with low-carbon hydrogen projects.\n\nWe are working toward a low-carbon hydrogen refueling network capable of supplying hard-to-decarbonize elements of the transportation sector, such as heavy goods vehicles and ships. By leveraging Gigastack, we can deliver low-carbon hydrogen produced using wind power for vehicles not suited to battery technology.\nEnvironment and Safety\nWe take the time to work safely \u2014 every job, every day \u2014 to protect people and the environment.\nIn 2021, sustainability priorities were integrated into key company systems, including capital guidelines, Health, Safety and Environmental Management System (HSEMS) assessment, new hire orientations and asset acquisitions.\n\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and comply with the many local, state and federal regulations that affect our operations, including those concerning air emissions, water effluent and solid waste-handling. We strive to eliminate environmental events, and we work to prevent releases of hydrocarbons or chemicals.\n\nOur Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) policy defines our commitment to protecting our employees, contractors, customers and communities while achieving our goals for growth, returns and distributions. We integrate our health, occupational safety, process safety and environmental stewardship principles throughout our businesses, with a commitment to continuous improvement that minimizes our potential impact on our neighbors and the environment. We also consult with stakeholders on environmental issues.\n\nHealth, Safety and Environmental Management\n\nOur HSE policy is the foundation for our HSEMS. The HSEMS creates environmental awareness internally and is the framework for consistently monitoring our environmental performance and ensuring our operations minimize their impact on the environment.\n\nOur HSEMS guides our entire workforce, including labor and management, experienced workers, new hires, contractors and subcontractors. It provides the framework to reduce risks and improve performance while establishing a continuous improvement process for policy implementation, leadership expectations and core values. This focus on operating excellence facilitates HSE performance and compliance with key standards, procedures and guidelines.\n\nOur rules apply to all business units and are often stricter than regulatory requirements. Core standards include reporting, metrics, crisis management, emergency response, due diligence, incident investigation, risk assessment and corporate auditing.\n\nOur rigorous auditing protocols enable us to assess our performance and progress frequently. On-site inspections are conducted by both third-party auditors and Phillips 66 internal auditors trained to recognize health and safety best practices. All deviations are investigated and corrected.\n\nAll Phillips 66 sites have HSE controls and practices, along with HSE management and staff dedicated to excellence and risk mitigation. Our Senior Vice President of HSE and Projects has direct responsibility for the HSEMS and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer. HSE considerations are embedded into every task and business decision.\n\nOur business units have internally audited multiyear plans for environmental improvement. Our dynamic \"Plan-Do-Assess-Adjust\" approach allows our HSEMS to be proactive in making adjustments to drive environmental progress.\nOur Environmental Steering teams drive site-level improvement, track and review key metrics, and develop improvement plans. Those plans are shared with corporate leadership to highlight best practices. Leadership directs efforts to reduce environmental events and increase work practice consistency.\n\nAdditionally, peer reviews of air permits and active environmental networks allow subject-matter experts in areas such as air monitoring, leak detection, waste management and water treatment to work across functions. They share best practices and lessons learned to drive sustainable improvement. Business units are also adopting this method.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2021, we invested approximately $5 billion in sustaining capital, which includes environmental protection projects. In 2021, we invested over $800 million in safety, environmental and reliability projects, with approximately $500 million targeted specifically for refining reliability, safety and environmental projects.\n\nThese investments improve our operating standards and procedures, business assurance programs, and companywide asset maintenance. We use energy and other resources efficiently, make strategic investments in research and development, and support habitat and conservation programs. We also focus on investments in technology to improve our assets, products and processes to increase efficiency.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nAwards and Recognition\n\nTHREE REFINERIES ACHIEVED AFPM SAFETY AWARDS\n\nAFPM bestowed its safety recognition awards for\n\nDistinguished Safety Award, the industry\u2019s highest recognition to:\nSweeny Refinery\n\nElite Gold Safety Award, top 1% of industry performance:\nBillings Refinery\n\nElite Silver Safety Award, top 5% of industry performance:\nBayway Refinery\n\nMIDSTREAM SAFETY PERFORMANCE RECOGNITION\n\nGPA Midstream Company Safety Award\nGPA Midstream Perfect Record Award\nAPI Distinguished Pipeline Safety Award\nILTA International Liquid Terminals Association Platinum Safety Award\n\n31 VPP STAR FACILITIES\n\nOSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) recognition across our Refining, Midstream and Lubricants operations\n\nSIX ENERGY STAR SITES\n\nRefineries that have earned this US EPA certification since 2012\n\n\"MOST TRUSTWORTHY COMPANY AWARD\"\n\nFrom Newsweek in 2021\nOSHA\u2019S VOLUNTARY PROTECTION PROGRAM\nAcross our Refining, Midstream and Lubricants assets, 31 facilities have Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR recognition, meaning about half our U.S. employees work at a VPP site. Six contractor companies at our sites also participate in VPP. The STAR recognition is OSHA\u2019s highest workplace honor, and to maintain this status, each site must complete self-evaluations every year and undergo an OSHA site inspection every three to five years. In 2021, our Tacoma Terminal in Washington, and our Coke Handling Terminal and Clifton Ridge Marine Terminal in Louisiana all achieved VPP STAR recertification for another five years.\n\nISO CERTIFICATIONS\nOur facilities follow Phillips 66 quality management systems, and many are certified to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) measures. Some customers require this certification of our polypropylene products and lubricants, and even though we don\u2019t certify all units to ISO, our comprehensive process safety event (PSE) and environmental management systems meet or exceed ISO standards.\n\nOur Lubricants business conforms to the ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management System. Five of our lubricants facilities have certification to ISO 14001 and the ISO 9001:2015/IATF16949:2016 Quality Management System Standard. Lubricants Research and Development is accredited to the ISO/IEC 17025 standard for testing and calibration laboratories.\n\nBayway Refinery\u2019s polypropylene business in Linden, New Jersey, is certified to ISO 9001:2015 for the design and manufacturing of pellets. We have numerous practices for containing and mitigating loss. Pellets are piped to an on-site storage silo, creating a closed system. From there, the product is blended and fed into rail cars for transportation to customers. We inspect rail cars for operable and closed caps and valves. Environmental performance includes collecting scrap and vacuuming sumps to recycle pellets, preventing plastic pellets from leaving the property. We are prepared with booms and vacuum trucks should a spill occur. Our Bayway facility management and employees are committed to Operation Clean Sweep and support the goal of zero pellet loss. We have also implemented a rail car return policy intended to eliminate the possibility of pellets entering the environment due to unsealed or improperly sealed rail cars returning from our customers.\n\nWood River Refinery\u2019s odorless mineral spirits and benzene business lines in Roxana, Illinois, conform to ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System Standards.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Humber Refinery is working to transition to the new ISO 14001 standard and is certified to the 2015 version.\nSafety Performance\n\nOur safety culture, comprehensive HSE policies, management systems and an across-the-board company commitment resulted in an OSHA Total Recordable Rate (TRR) of 0.12 in 2021. That\u2019s 25 times lower than the overall U.S. manufacturing average and lower than the 2021 average in refining and other industries. Our 2021 combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 Process Safety was 0.13, our best-ever performance.\n\n2021 was also a record year for Midstream Operations, as we recorded the safest year in Midstream history:\n\n- Recorded our best TRR ever at 0.03\n- Achieved two years without an employee recordable injury\n- Set a record for fewest spills and fewest PSEs\n- Added the 17th Midstream facility to our list of operating facilities that are recognized as VPP STAR sites\n\nTOTAL RECORDABLE RATE (TRR) BY INDUSTRY\n\n(Incidents per 200,000 hours worked)\n\n| Industry                        | TRR |\n|---------------------------------|-----|\n| Food manufacturing              | 4.0 |\n| Retail trade                    | 3.5 |\n| Construction                    | 3.0 |\n| Motion picture, video industries| 2.5 |\n| Electric power generation, transmission, distribution | 2.0 |\n| Petroleum refineries            | 1.5 |\n| Phillips 66                     | 0.12|\n\nSources: Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020 data; Phillips 66, 2021 data\n\nWORKING TOWARD ZERO\n\nWe are determined to be the energy industry\u2019s safest and most reliable company. We believe that a zero-process-safety-incident and zero-injury workplace is achievable. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone at our worksites and in the communities where we operate. This priority is embodied in our investment in asset maintenance and integrity and our HSE policies, programs and procedures.\n\nWe proactively perform focused audits on major work activities such as energy isolation, startup/shutdown activities, turnaround events, procedures and human performance tools. Our business units complete an annual report on risks, including a list of corrective actions to address risks identified and closed during the year. In addition, business unit managers verify compliance with company risk management requirements.\n\nThe reports are reviewed and signed off by each subsequent level of management. Ultimately, a complete report containing the status of risk items throughout the company is developed, reviewed with the chairman and CEO, and summarized for the Public Policy and Sustainability Committee.\n\nSafety and environmental performance are part of our compensation structure for executives and employees. We measure ourselves against the best performers in our industry and target top-quartile performance in safety, environmental stewardship and effective management of unplanned downtime.\n10 LIFE SAVING RULES\nIn conjunction with the HSEMS, our 10 Life Saving Rules program is fundamental to Phillips 66\u2019s safety culture. All employees are trained on the rules, which are clear, concise and apply to all routine and critical activities. They enhance safety performance and benefit both individuals and communities by preventing injuries.\n\nCONTRACTOR SAFETY\nWe involve our contract companies in planning work to be performed to ensure safe practices. Regular communication at all levels is foundational to achieving our mutual goals. Many of our sites have an established Contractor Safety Alliance. These teams include safety professionals, front-line supervisors and leadership from Phillips 66 and each of our contract companies and business trades. They meet regularly to discuss safety issues, performance and lessons learned. Subcommittee members mentor and onboard new contractors and train them on our 10 Life Saving Rules and other safe work procedures.\n\nWe have contractor-to-contractor audits to support smaller contract companies. The teams include Phillips 66 employees and several contract company leaders. They reach out to workers and address any barriers to safe work.\n\nHands-on Learning Leads the Way\nSafety is our first core value. We seek out impactful ways to keep safety at the forefront. In 2021, the Sweeny Refinery created a hands-on safety training experience for more than 850 employees and contractors.\n\nThe Safety Days program focuses on improving understanding of the Phillips 66 10 Life Saving Rules and Sweeny\u2019s safe work practices. It is facilitated by safety teams and operations and maintenance personnel who bring their front-line perspective to the training.\n\nOver five weeks, groups of about 50 cross-functional employees rotate through eight hands-on stations, including energy isolation, fall protection, confined space entry, hazard recognition and live fire extinguisher training. Each station meets requirements for annual refresher training, uses prior incidents as examples, addresses frequently asked questions and allows employees to practice what they\u2019ve learned.\n\nTraining stations feature a multilevel scaffold, a lock-out tag-out and work permitting room, access to mobile equipment, and retired process equipment for hands-on practice.\n\nEmployee feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and this critical training has been key to the Sweeny Refinery achieving excellence in safety performance.\n\nSHIELD YOUR FUTURE\nShield Your Future is a training program for all new employees and contractors. It includes case studies based on real incidents at Phillips 66 and exercises to enhance understanding of safety protocols. These lessons are the foundation and the \u201cwhy we do what we do\u201d for many of our 10 Life Saving Rules.\n\nNew employees get materials to review before their first day, and the information is covered as part of orientation. The training is also used as a refresh for existing employees.\n\nThere are three components of Shield Your Future:\n1. Be Aware of Your Actions\n2. Stop Work When Unsure\n3. Recognize Hazards\nSTOP-WORK AUTHORITY\nTwo principles that guide all employees and contractors working within our facilities are taking the time to work safely and having the right to speak up and stop work if a safety concern is identified.\n\nEveryone working at or visiting our sites is empowered \u2014 and required \u2014 to stop any work they believe poses a risk to themselves, the people around them or the environment. We train our workforce to \u201cstop when unsure.\u201d No employee or contractor will ever experience negative repercussions for using their stop-work authority in good faith, even if it turns out that there wasn\u2019t a hazard; in fact, employees and contractors who speak up when they spot a potential problem are rewarded through the company\u2019s Good Catch program. It\u2019s another way we hold ourselves accountable for everyone\u2019s safety every day.\n\nSAFETY MEETINGS, SUMMITS AND TRAINING\nEach of our sites conducts a monthly safety committee meeting. Employees, managers and union representatives review goals and safety practices. They also audit results and work together to keep an open dialogue focused on continuous improvement. In addition to providing continuing education opportunities, these meetings enable knowledge-sharing from experts such as industrial hygienists, safety specialists and process safety representatives. We have more frequent meetings within our field staff groups and perform job safety analyses for each field job.\n\nWe periodically host large-scale company training summits. This is an opportunity to gather people from every health and safety committee in the company to share best practices, goals and performance milestones. In addition, attendees gain new techniques, skills and knowledge they can implement at their home facility. The summits also encourage union leaders and Phillips 66 management to maintain an open dialogue and speak with a unified voice about safety.\n\nWe also hold periodic contractor safety summits with all our major contracting companies to set expectations and goals, share best practices, and keep lines of communication open. Each Midstream Region holds a regional contractor summit with its primary and secondary contractors. In 2021, in compliance with COVID-19 restrictions, we held a virtual summit with select primary contractors and contractor mentors.\n\nAUDITS AND INSPECTIONS\nOur facilities are subject to rigorous internal, industry and external audits and inspections, and our operations are managed to ensure compliance and asset integrity. There are hundreds of audits each year across our operations. External auditing agencies include OSHA and the U.K. Health and Safety Executive, the EPA and U.K. Environmental Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the Chemical Safety Board.\n\nHSE audits are on a predetermined cycle that covers all operations. Additionally, refinery operating excellence audits, insurance risk assessments, trade association assessments and third-party safety audits happen each year.\n\nAudits are documented and include a process for communicating results to management and provisions for periodic review and corrective actions.\n\nHSE performance is verified through robust assurance processes that involve corporate staff and business unit employees. Each business unit establishes and maintains auditing processes to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of HSE controls and compliance with legal requirements and standards of operation. Joint ventures, partnerships and contractors are all included in the auditing process.\n\nWe are also involved in numerous industry improvement and standard-setting committees of American Petroleum Institute (API), American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) and the Association of Oil Pipe Lines. Our facilities follow industry-leading quality management systems, and many are certified to international standards. These efforts have made our sector, and specifically Phillips 66, a safety leader among U.S. industries.\n\nThrough our occupational health and industrial hygiene program, we evaluate our workplaces for health hazards to ensure that we protect everyone at our facilities. Employees and contractors report both actual incidents and near misses that have or could have resulted in injury, property damage or environmental impact. We learn from these situations, identifying and removing the root causes to reduce the risk of recurrence.\nProcess Safety\n\nProcess safety is about ensuring containment of hazardous materials to avoid harming people and the environment. We recognize the need to be proactive and continuously improve. Accordingly, we have identified these focus areas:\n\n- Leveraging process hazard assessment best practices across the company, with added emphasis on safeguards to prevent the highest consequence events\n- Reducing the number of events caused by imprecise execution of tasks\n- Improving our learning efficiency and effectiveness\n\nOur active participation in trade associations and benchmarking groups also helps us identify opportunities for our business while advancing overall industry performance.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY EVENTS\n\nPSEs are unplanned or uncontrolled releases of hazardous material. We closely monitor and measure our performance in this area. Phillips 66 works to eliminate PSEs by applying best practices in design, engineering, operations and maintenance. We also perform hazard analyses and use change-management procedures to mitigate risk.\n\nWe routinely audit our safety, mechanical integrity, operating and maintenance programs. We investigate serious incidents and near misses to develop corrective actions and capture learnings. We create and improve our procedures to ensure employees and contractors are aware of hazards and how to address and mitigate them.\n\nTier 1 and Tier 2 PSEs are defined by the API Recommended Practice 754. Tier 1 PSEs are the most significant type of unplanned or uncontrolled release of material from primary containment.\n\nTier 2 events have lesser consequences than Tier 1 events, yet they are still important. All Tier 1 and Tier 2 events are investigated to determine the underlying causes so we can act to prevent recurrences. Our goal is zero PSEs.\n\nIn 2021, our Refining business unit had zero energy isolation-related Tier 1 PSEs, and its overall Tier 1 process safety event rate of 0.05 led our industry. Our 2021 companywide PSE Tier 1 and Tier 2 rates were better than the refining industry average rate.\n\nOptimization\n\nTo thrive in the energy transition, we must focus on efficiencies within our processes and decision making, leverage digital capabilities, and advanced automation.\n\nAdvantEdge66 is an enterprisewide digital transformation program focused on utilizing data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to deliver agility, efficiency and value. Optimizing our current operations is essential to operating a sustainable business.\n\nOur Value Chain Optimization Engine effort released nine new tools in 2021. These tools include cloud-based applications that help us improve performance projections, scenario planning and supply comparisons.\nDigitizing Operating Procedures and Permits in Refining\n\nIn 2021, we began a multiyear initiative that will ultimately impact 18,000 refining operating procedures.\n\nAs part of our DOM project, the first step, completed in 2021, was converting procedures detailed on paper to digital files stored in a cloud-based tool. This allows operators to access and execute procedures from the field using a mobile device.\n\nDuring the second phase, which began in 2021 and will continue through 2023, we are incorporating human factors principles to improve procedures and make them clearer and easier to follow. Cross-functional teams review each procedure to ensure all critical content is included. This work is critical to reducing the risk of procedure-related errors.\n\nData on Tier 1 PSEs reveals that unclear, vague, irrelevant or unfollowed procedures contribute to about 40% of events. Our procedure management initiative is intended to improve our procedures and reduce the risk of errors. Midstream is also piloting this approach.\n\nOur Electronic Work Permitting process is live across all sites. The fully electronic system allows refineries to complete routine and major maintenance projects more safely and efficiently, brings consistency, reduces reliance on personal knowledge, improves hazard recognition and increases the overall safety of the permitted work. It includes a leading-edge Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment tool with artificial intelligence technologies to improve safety planning. Another benefit of digitizing these records is eliminating paper use and the associated waste.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR REFINING COMPETITIVENESS\n\nIn 2022, we rolled out a new digital workflow tool called Applications for Refining Competitiveness (ARC). Users access ARC through a mobile interface that alerts them when action is needed. The system has increased efficiency, managing more than 14,000 process steps simultaneously. It also improves accuracy by offering users instructions on how to complete tasks.\nASSET PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT\n\nAsset Performance Management (APM) provides data and analytics to identify and eliminate reliability issues. In 2021, we completed the APM rollout to all our refineries. Now, with a common platform, data can be accessed in minutes, not hours, enabling dashboards and metrics that drive actions to prevent failures. As a result, we can better prevent unplanned downtime, monitor equipment to optimize utilization and eliminate defects, and track successes.\n\nImproving Operations in Refining\n\nOur Advanced Integrated Mechanical Integrity (AIMI) project is improving early detection of corrosion threats at our refineries.\n\nIn 2021, we completed pilot programs at our Borger and Ferndale refineries, uncovering many opportunities to improve our inspection program and several near-miss inspection findings that were subsequently repaired. This proactive approach reduces lost-profit opportunities and improves safety, environmental and turnaround performance.\n\nAIMI takes a risk-based approach to systematically standardize, validate and digitize our design and process information. It improves inspection planning because we are using leading-edge software and analytical tools, communicating across operating groups, improving access to information, linking corrosion threats to specific equipment, and facilitating cross-site sharing of findings.\n\nDRONE TECHNOLOGY\n\nDrones allow us to monitor assets from a safe distance and at various elevations while also allowing pilots to zoom in and take close-up images to identify anomalies. By the end of 2022, we plan to have over 90 trained and qualified drone pilots across our Refining and Midstream organizations. Pilots must meet Federal Aviation Administration and Phillips 66 proficiency requirements by completing the FAA\u2019s Part 107 certification and advanced operations training through a third-party drone pilot training company.\n\nSome of the applications across our assets are:\n\n- Inspections, including:\n  - Elevated structures\n  - Tank seals\n  - Flare stacks\n  - Heater stacks\n  - Foam chambers\n  - Environmental conditions\n  - Overhead electrical lines\n- Volumetric measurements such as coke pile volume and tank dike volume\n- Site mapping\n- Support for emergency response\n\nASSET PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT\n\nAsset Performance Management (APM) provides data and analytics to identify and eliminate reliability issues. In 2021, we completed the APM rollout to all our refineries. Now, with a common platform, data can be accessed in minutes, not hours, enabling dashboards and metrics that drive actions to prevent failures. As a result, we can better prevent unplanned downtime, monitor equipment to optimize utilization and eliminate defects, and track successes.\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\n\nWe are prepared to respond to emergencies and work with local, state and federal agencies. Our Emergency Response Management System provides a model for building and maintaining crisis management and emergency response plans.\n\nAt the corporate level, the company maintains a Crisis Management Plan with personnel who can provide practical and prompt support to supplement actions taken in response to an emergency. The company also utilizes Regional Response teams to support businesses during significant emergencies.\n\nEach facility has a written emergency response plan that includes a process for identifying potential emergencies and planning for mitigation and control. We focus on individualized, site-specific training rather than larger-scale general training exercises. Employees are trained for their responsibilities and assignments under each scenario. Drills are conducted frequently and critiqued so plans can be adjusted as needed. Emergency response plans and documents are thoroughly reviewed each year.\n\nIn our annual emergency response drills, we use realistic scenarios to ensure that our Emergency Response Organization and the communities around our facilities are prepared to respond to emergencies. Participation by local and corporate leaders ensures high standards for training and competence for our on-site first responders.\n\nOur teams of first responders protect lives and secure the area in an emergency. We invest in training and sending emergency responders to premier institutions such as the Fire Service Institute at the University of Illinois and the Emergency Services Training Institute at Texas A&M University. We extend this specialized training beyond our first responders, covering the costs for firefighters based near our refineries so they can train alongside our teams.\n\nIn addition, when we hold drills and training exercises in areas near Native American communities, we also invite tribal representatives to participate. We believe that sharing these resources is a way to make our communities safer and keep important lines of communication open.\n\nWe ensure our first responders are prepared to serve on our Incident Response teams and coordinate with government agencies that have authority and jurisdiction over our emergency response efforts. Each of our business units also completes multiple notification accountability drills for emergencies and one tabletop exercise every year.\n\nIn addition, we hold dozens of exercises for other scenarios, including the following:\n\n- Process safety management\n- Risk management fire or vapor cloud scenarios\n- Supervisory control and data acquisition failure exercises at least twice a year\n- Responses to real-world events\n- Government-initiated unannounced exercises\n- Earthquake responses\n- Hurricane exercises\n- Continuity of business or pandemic exercises\n\nIf there's ever an interruption of operations, the business continuity plans are put into action to quickly resume manufacturing and transporting energy products to markets worldwide.\nAsset Integrity\n\nEnsuring the integrity of our assets is a crucial HSEMS component. Business units develop programs and procedures to ensure proper asset design, fabrication, installation, operation and maintenance to minimize asset integrity risks associated with operations and equipment failure. Asset integrity programs include quality assurance and quality control, defined inspection and maintenance intervals for process equipment, and meeting company standards.\n\nThese high-tech integrity programs and processes are designed to prevent unintentional product releases and protect everyone at our facilities and surrounding communities. Many of our company\u2019s process safety and environmental standards exceed industry requirements, promoting our goal of an incident-free workplace.\n\nPIPELINE INTEGRITY\n\nLiquids pipelines move crude oil and natural gas liquids to our operating assets and take the natural gas liquids, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel we produce to market.\n\nOur approach to pipeline safety is rooted in preventing product releases and staying ahead of maintenance requirements and emergency preparedness. Elements of these programs include exacting design and construction standards, comprehensive pipeline maintenance, 24/7 remote-line monitoring, leak detection, community education programs and strong relationships with emergency response teams across our asset footprint.\n\nStarting at the planning stage, we work to ensure a project complies with all applicable regulations and laws, including the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act and others. We coordinate and engage with many agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and local and state regulators.\n\nWe take environmental considerations into account during the planning for all pipeline projects and work to identify community needs and wants.\n\nWe seek existing pipeline corridors where feasible and use advanced construction techniques to minimize the impact on the environment, local communities, wildlife and natural resources.\n\nWhen we build or repair pipelines, we use various state-of-the-art techniques to ensure asset integrity, such as horizontal directional drilling technology, which allows us to bury pipelines deep underneath riverbeds, preventing pipeline exposures. Since 2012, Phillips 66 has spent approximately $130 million to enhance resilience at river crossings.\n\n~$130 million\n\ninvested to enhance resilience at river crossings since 2012\n\nWe support response efforts along a pipeline\u2019s planned route, and we regularly donate equipment to emergency response teams.\n\nClemens to Gregory (C2G) Pipeline\nBRAZORIA, TX\nExisting pipeline rights-of-way are visually inspected biweekly, and in some areas, we also inspect via regular aerial pipeline patrols to look for potential signs of leaks and any other pipeline integrity threats such as unauthorized digging or exposures. We are recognized for our efforts to go beyond regulatory requirements. We have implemented state-of-the-art leak detection technology, real-time transient modeling, on all our operated pipelines.\n\nOur Pipeline Control Center staff in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, continuously monitors each pipeline\u2019s operations and pressure. At the first sign of a pressure change that could indicate a leak, an employee will shut down the pipeline as a precautionary measure until the matter is understood and resolved. Our proactive \u201cthink leak\u201d approach, in which we work to prove that there is not a leak versus the more traditional approach of proving that there is a leak, has been noted by a representative of the Department of Transportation\u2019s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration as industry-leading.\n\nWe developed tools to monitor pipeline pressure cycles in real time. These tools give us insight into the pipelines with a high risk of pressure-cycle fatigue. In pressure-cycle reduction projects, we\u2019ve achieved pressure-cycle reductions as high as 80%. This translates into a lower risk for leaks caused by crack failures. It also results in fewer crack remediation excavations and can lengthen the intervals between crack inspections.\n\nWe also have an industry-leading maintenance program that uses smart pipeline inspection gauges, or \u201cpigs,\u201d which travel through the pipelines and send images, enabling us to inspect and assess the interior of our pipelines and proactively identify maintenance needs from the inside.\n\n**Hydrocarbon Spills**\n\nWe are improving the integrity testing of pipelines and using data analytics to reduce seam cracks. We apply our technical resources and know-how through joint studies with the Pipeline Research Council International, Joint Industry Partnership, and various committees within API and the Association for Materials Protection and Performance.\n\nIn 2021, 95% of the Midstream environmental spill release volume directly resulted from damages sustained during Hurricane Ida.\n\n---\n\n**AT A GLANCE**\n\n**Pipeline Safety**\n\nPipelines are one of the safest ways to transport the energy we use every day, delivering products safely 99.999% of the time. We manage more than 22,000 miles of pipeline systems and directly operate about 12,800 of those miles, making Phillips 66 one of the largest pipeline operators in the United States by barrel-miles.\n\n| 1+ billion | 3.3 million |\n|------------|-------------|\n| barrels of product delivered through operated pipelines in 2021 | BPD of product delivered |\nLiving Our Values Through a Pipeline Replacement Project\n\nOur pipelines deliver crude oil, refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids.\n\nAs segments of the pipelines age, we replace or reroute them to ensure the safe delivery of our products. Approximately 30% of the Midstream sustaining capital budget is allocated for pipe replacements.\n\n- Our 90-mile Cherokee East Pipeline runs from our refinery in Ponca City, Oklahoma, to the northeastern part of the state, and, in 2021, we replaced and rerouted 27 miles of the clean product pipeline. Construction will be complete in 2023.\n- The 250-mile-long Blue Line transports propane and butane from Paola, Kansas, to customers in Missouri and Illinois. Over the last six years, we\u2019ve replaced more than 100 miles; an additional 34 will be replaced in 2022 and another 14 miles in 2023.\n\nThe projects are notable for their importance and scope and for the safety example set by about 300 employees and contractors who worked on-site. Their teamwork, communication and commitment to safety led to more than 800,000 operational work-hours with zero recordable employee injuries and zero pipeline system release events.\n\nSafety goes beyond our workforce; the safety of the environment and the surrounding community is also a priority.\n\nCOMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY\n\nWe also made investments in several Missouri communities surrounding the Blue Line replacement project, including:\n\n- A utility terrain vehicle for the Pacific Fire Protection District\n- A safety fence around a commuter parking lot\n- A Utility Task Vehicle with fire suppression and Emergency Medical Services skid insert for the Eureka Fire Protection District\n- Equipment for the Fenton Fire Department Regional Training Facility\n- A park shelter and trail project for Jefferson County Parks and Recreation\nEnvironmental Stewardship\n\nWATER CONSERVATION\n\nWater is an essential resource in our manufacturing facilities and processes. All our refining assets have on-site water treatment systems, many of which use available brackish, saltwater or non-freshwater resources, as well as solutions that involve industrial reuse processes. In North America and the United Kingdom, we operate 12 biological treatment plants and 15 pre-treatment facilities.\n\nPhillips 66 researches and develops best practices for water use to ensure that we will have sufficient, sustainable water resources well into the future, and we are responsibly managing this critical natural resource. We also evaluate new technologies and products to decrease our water footprint by recycling more water, and we collaborate with research institutions to solve water challenges.\n\nTo meet and exceed the strict requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or industrial pre-treatment permits, we have improved our water management procedures, setting higher environmental performance standards, minimizing plant upsets, and reducing chemical use and waste generation. We have developed leading Key Performance Indicators as part of our water use efficiency program for our facilities, including condensate returned to steam produced and condensate recovered versus consumed in the process.\n\nOur refineries produce 15 million pounds of steam per hour. Each pound of steam is more than a pound of water, which is why we\u2019re working to optimize our use of steam and minimize losses. As part of our DOM program, we\u2019re rolling out an optimization tool to all our refineries. The tool allows operators and engineers to see the entire steam system and provides prescriptive actions to use the steam and minimize loss from venting. This is expected to help us recover 250 million pounds of steam a year.\n\nClosed-circuit Reverse Osmosis\n\nWe repurposed a conventional reverse osmosis unit to use closed-circuit reverse osmosis (CCRO) to treat about 900 gallons per minute (GPM) of concentrated brine for use in boilers.\n\nCCRO works like a cooling tower that cycles water until it reaches a set salt content, at which point it blows down the brine while continuing to generate clean water. We see results in significantly improved cooling tower cycles, and the annual raw water demand for Borger\u2019s boilers is down by 473 million gallons.\n\nUsing Technology to Save Water\n\nPilot program reduced water usage and saved energy costs.\n\nOur Billings and Bayway refineries implemented steam trap monitoring as part of the DOM program. Using hand-held acoustic sensors coupled with a cloud-based analytics program, steam traps were periodically tested. Initial surveys identified areas for prioritized maintenance. Repairing the identified traps netted $1.3 million per year savings in energy costs at the two facilities. The work also helped improve third-party energy intensity performance statistics and reduce GHG emissions.\n\nThree additional refineries will start the program in 2022 and remaining refineries are scheduled to be included in 2023.\nWastewater\nWe regularly engage with wastewater trade associations like the Water Environment Federation to work with our peers to develop and share best practices. Our wastewater experts volunteer their time to peer-review articles published in Environmental Engineering Science, a journal covering climate change, energy and environment; contaminant fate and transport; environmental sensors; and green technologies.\n\nWe are also working on a project to treat and recycle 3,200 GPM of wastewater to be used in boilers at our Borger Refinery. This project will help the refinery meet new selenium discharge requirements.\n\nRemediated Water Recycling Estimates\nOur Remediation Management team is responsible for treating water that may have been contaminated. In 2021, the team treated and recycled over 48 million barrels of water for reuse at our facilities, reducing the amount of freshwater needed to operate.\n\n48 million\nbarrels of water recycled for reuse at our facilities\n\nTypical reuses can include temperature control of cooling towers, emergency response application and outfalls.\n\nBioreactor Bugs\nProcessing crude oil requires water, which must be cleaned to remove nitrates before discharge. If nitrates aren\u2019t removed, they can encourage excess algae growth in rivers and streams.\n\nThe ERI teams in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and at Humber Refinery discovered that, in low-oxygen conditions, certain bugs break down nitrates into nitrogen gas, which is safely dissipated into the atmosphere. This method has helped our Humber Refinery, in the U.K., decrease its total nitrogen output by more than half, allowing the refinery to meet environmental requirements and realize additional utility cost savings on oxygen and fresh caustic usage.\nReducing Freshwater Use\n\nWe are committed to reducing freshwater withdrawals at our facilities. Our efforts extend to our Houston Headquarters, where we collect and reuse rainwater. Several of our refineries have developed processes to meet the facility\u2019s unique needs. Recycling water is one way we do that. Understanding the local water demand and the potential for water scarcity in the future are key considerations, as we prioritize projects to improve efficiency and decrease our environmental footprint.\n\n**BORGER REFINERY**\n\nOur Borger Refinery has several ways to conserve water, including recovering 200 GPM of condensate for use in boilers. This saves 105 million gallons of freshwater each year.\n\n**LAKE CHARLES REFINERY**\n\nAt our Lake Charles Refinery, we recycled 378 million gallons in 2021. That\u2019s a 17% reduction in our raw water demand.\n\n**PONCA CITY REFINERY**\n\nOur Ponca City Refinery reduces its freshwater usage by reclaiming water and harvesting stormwater. This practice has reduced freshwater needs by 2,500 GPM, or 1.3 billion gallons per year. That\u2019s a 32% reduction in our freshwater usage.\nWASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING\n\nAcross all our operations in 2021, we recycled 184,000 metric tons of materials, bringing us to more than 1 million metric tons recycled companywide since 2014. That total includes more than 220,000 pounds of recycled electronic waste, refinery process catalyst captured for metals reclamation, oils and solids captured for reuse, and recyclable materials such as metal, glass and paper. We also achieved a 20% reduction in power usage at company-operated data centers.\n\n| 20% reduction in power use at company-operated data centers | 184,000 metric tons of materials recycled in 2021 |\n\nWe track every raw material used in the manufacturing process at our lubricants plants. In 2021, we recycled 950 tons of scrap material across our portfolio, including cardboard, bottles, cans, pallets and shrink wrap.\n\nTanks at our refineries and terminals require periodic cleanouts, and we must dispose of the residual product in compliance with strict environmental laws. Phillips 66 has a systematic hazardous waste program with processes and practices executed by trained personnel. Each of our operating sites has environmental professionals whose expertise is supplemented by corporate staff. In 2021, our tank cleanout methods led to the generation of 1.7 million gallons of waste-derived fuel for manufacturing processes and conserved more than 170,000 gallons of water.\n\nObsolete electronic equipment is sustainably processed through a third-party provider. When possible, the equipment is refurbished and used for other purposes. Other times, it\u2019s broken down into useable component materials. We recycled or refurbished 223,724 pounds of Information Technology (IT) equipment across our U.S. facilities in 2021.\n\nArrows of Impact\n\nOur Arrows of Impact program is designed to reduce waste at our Houston Headquarters by 20% by the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nLaunched on America Recycles Day in 2021, the program makes recycling more convenient and educates employees on what and how to recycle.\n\nIn 2021, we generated about 200 pounds of waste per person at our Houston Headquarters, and through our program, we recycled 26 metric tons and composted 0.55 metric tons of caf\u00e9 waste, coffee grounds and napkins.\n\nOur recycling efforts:\n- Conserved 172,848 gallons of water and 36,632 kilowatt-hours of electricity\n- Saved 468 mature trees\n- Prevented 7 metric tons of CO\u2082e GHG emissions\n\nBut we can still do better. That\u2019s why we implemented the following initiatives to achieve our Arrows of Impact goal:\n- Adding reusable containers in the cafeteria: Each reusable container can be used 1,000 times. Using 500 reusable containers will replace 50 months\u2019 worth of disposable containers\n- Increasing composting from the caf\u00e9\n- Reducing the use of disposable cups\n- Installing hand dryers in our restrooms\nPreventing Loss With Artificial Intelligence\n\nWhen trucks enter our terminals to be filled, we need to know how much product we can put in each truck to prevent overflow.\n\nRetained product that was part of a previous delivery, but is still in a truck's tank, is the leading cause of spills at our truck racks. We completed a proof-of-concept test and are testing a permanent installation of a retained product detection system utilizing artificial intelligence and infrared cameras to spot retained product in trucks as they enter our Denver Terminal. Identifying when there's product already in the tanker before loading is expected to reduce the number of releases and subsequent downtime at the truck rack. The system is targeted for implementation at additional sites in 2022.\n\nAIR EMISSIONS\n\nOver the past 10 years, we have focused on significant investments in reducing air emissions. Since 2012, volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from our Refining business unit have decreased by 34.5%.\n\nThe air research and development program at the Phillips 66 Research Center collaborates with government agencies, trade organizations and academic institutions to provide data that leads to effective rule-making to improve air quality in the communities where we operate.\n\nWe also find efficient ways to use resources. For example, in July 2021, we found a way to allow a third party to use excess fuel gas from our Bayway Refinery during turnaround and nonturnaround operations. Instead of burning in process heaters and boilers or flaring the excess, off-gas can now be piped directly to the cogeneration unit. This agreement has numerous benefits, including improved fuel balance, increased fluid catalytic cracking and improved energy performance at the site.\n\nFlare Gas Recovery\n\nAt our Lake Charles Manufacturing Complex in Louisiana, the West Flare Recovery Gas Compressor system for Excel Paralubes was commissioned in 2021. Gas that would have normally been flared was instead recovered and recycled back into the refinery, resulting in less flaring and fewer emissions.\n\nFlare Gas Recovery systems minimize flaring during routine operations yet allow flares when needed for emergency safety mitigation purposes.\nBiodiversity and Conservation\n\nOur environmental stewardship goes beyond regulatory requirements and focuses on connecting conservation efforts to our business and managing natural capital in and around the communities where we work and market our products. Natural capital encompasses the supply of the world\u2019s natural resources from which economic value and benefits can be derived, such as forests, oceans and freshwater, and the biodiversity that supports these ecosystems. We believe the careful management of natural capital is a core component of a resilient, long-term strategy.\n\nWe collaborate with local and national environmental and conservation organizations to promote biodiversity and environmental stewardship and support their efforts by donating money and resources. Our employees and interns volunteer their time and make monetary contributions, many of which are matched by the company. Phillips 66 has long-standing partnerships with many national conservation organizations, including the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, Trees For Houston and the Wildlife Habitat Council.\n\nWe view the management of natural capital and biodiversity risks as essential. We address them throughout the planning and development of major capital projects by conducting environmental impact analyses, collecting critical environmental data, and implementing mitigation and monitoring programs to reduce impacts and ensure results.\n\nProtecting Wildlife in Our Communities\n\nWe also make an annual contribution to a bird or wildlife rescue and rehabilitation organization in every region. In 2021, we donated to numerous groups, including:\n\n- Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research\n- The Wildlife Center of Texas\n- International Bird Rescue\n- Sutton Avian\n- Treehouse Wildlife Center\n- Wild West Wildlife Rehabilitation Center\n\nCreating Green Space\n\nThe Edwardsville Children\u2019s Museum Micro Forest project near our Wood River Refinery in Roxana, Illinois, is aiding the environment in a big way. When micro forests \u2014 small, wooded areas in urban settings \u2014 are planted, they can become a diverse ecosystem in just 20 years. This benefits biodiversity and air quality and slows stormwater runoff, helping prevent flooding and water pollution. Phillips 66 was proud to sponsor and provide volunteers to plant more than 100 trees in spring 2021. The museum hopes to have a full 2-acre forest preserve by 2033. The micro forest project also connects to a STEM forest display sponsored by the refinery inside the museum.\nA Multifaceted Approach to Monarch Conservation\nIn 2022, we applied for a Nationwide Monarch Butterfly Candidate Conservation Agreement for Energy and Transportation Lands. This effort would enroll 11,194 miles of our rights-of-way with an average width of 50 feet \u2014 approximately 67,842 acres \u2014 in a project to protect these threatened insects. Our rights-of-way span 243 counties in 17 states: Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.\n\nWe plan to address key threats to monarch butterflies with actions that promote monarch habitat and benefit all pollinators. These include maintenance and management practices such as conservation mowing, idle lands, woody vegetation removal, targeted herbicide application, and limiting broadcast herbicides to high-activity areas like terminals and valve sites.\n\nOur Houston Headquarters is a certified Monarch Waystation location. In collaboration with our landscape management company, we\u2019re renovating our landscape to provide a butterfly habitat for monarchs and other species. Phase one of the project earned us status as an official Monarch Waystation with more than 600 milkweed plants and numerous host and nectar plants that sustain the entire life cycle of the monarch butterfly. Phase two will include even more plantings.\n\nLeaving the Lights Off for Birds\nEvery spring, approximately 3 billion birds migrate through the United States, and it is estimated that one-third of those pass through Texas on their travels. Bright lights from homes and businesses can disorient the birds at night. During peak migration, we only used essential lights at our headquarters overnight to support the Lights Out Texas initiative to help the birds fly safely to their summer nesting spots.\n\nFor more details on environmental data, see the Performance Data section in this report.\n\nBuilding a Safe Place for Migrating Waterfowl\nPhillips 66 is a sponsor of a first-of-its-kind waterfowl refuge being built at ZooMontana near our Billings Refinery. The refuge will be a natural stopping spot for waterfowl during migration. The exhibit will have observation decks, an underwater area to watch native fish and boardwalks so that zoo visitors can learn about wildlife and wetland ecology.\n\nRestoring the Louisiana Coastline\nWe teamed up with the Louisiana Coastal Conservation Association (CCA) and more than 100 local school children and other volunteers to restore marshland in Lake Charles\u2019 Prien Lake Park. Volunteers created 10 floating islands measuring 8 feet by 20 feet; each island was then planted with about 150 native plants. Afterward, CCA volunteers floated the completed islands to a spot in Prien Lake by boat and then anchored them down. Projects like this help create habitats for native species and restore marshland that has been destroyed by erosion and hurricanes.\n\nPhillips 66 volunteers also worked with the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana to help build the Plaquemines Oyster Reef. We\u2019re honored that our employees are featured in the organization\u2019s Champion Our Coast 2022 Corporate Coastal Stewardship Guide.\nGovernance\nWe are committed to doing the right thing, always.\nGood governance and ethics are an integral part of every level of our organization. Rigorous and consistent corporate governance practices contribute positively to our corporate culture and shareholder value.\n\nBoard and Managerial Oversight and Governance\n\nOur board of directors and our Executive Leadership Team are committed to ethical business practices. The board regularly reviews evolving corporate governance best practices, regulatory requirements and feedback from shareholders, making changes it believes are in the best interest of Phillips 66 and its shareholders. Directors also collaborate with senior leaders and stay connected to our corporate culture through regular visits to our facilities, where they study the company\u2019s day-to-day operations and talk to employees.\n\nEach of our board committees has specific responsibilities.\n\nThe Public Policy and Sustainability Committee manages the company\u2019s sustainability program and associated initiatives and:\n\n- Reviews compliance with HSE policies and impacts of environmental and social trends and uncertainties\n- Reviews exposure to and management of environmental, social and political trends and risks, including climate risk\n- Reviews and makes recommendations on the company\u2019s policies, programs and practices regarding HSE protection, government relations and political contributions, philanthropy, and sustainability matters\n- Reviews the company\u2019s global reputation as a good corporate citizen in the communities where it operates\n\nThe Audit and Finance Committee monitors our enterprisewide risk management program and our controls, compliance and ethics. It oversees the integrity of our financial reporting and financial statements.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee oversees board composition and succession planning. It is committed to enhancing diversity and seeking candidates with diverse backgrounds and perspectives who possess the collaborative spirit, character, skills, experiences and expertise required to oversee the execution of the company\u2019s strategy, risk management and operational objectives.\n\nThe Human Resources and Compensation Committee determines compensation for the Executive Leadership Team. It oversees our human capital management strategy, including workplace culture, diversity and inclusion, and other talent management programs and initiatives.\n\nThe Executive Committee can exercise the powers of authority of the board to direct the business affairs of the company between meetings of the full board. The company and board governing documents lay out the specific roles and responsibilities of the board and its committees. The full charters for each committee can be found on the Phillips 66 Investors site.\nEthics and Governance\n\nWritten policies and auditing programs create strong governance throughout the company and our supply chain. Key policies and documents, including board governance documents and charters, are publicly available on our website. These and many other formal procedures and controls set the standards that guide our actions and ensure the highest levels of responsibility, integrity and legal compliance across our businesses.\n\nETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\nSafety, honor and commitment are our values. At Phillips 66, we do not compromise our integrity. We recognize that questions can arise in today\u2019s increasingly complex global business environment. Therefore, we follow the operating guidelines in our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (Code of Ethics) to ensure we tie our company\u2019s values to our decision-making processes.\n\nOur company policies, programs and practices ensure ethical business and good governance. We expect every person who works at Phillips 66 \u2014 directors, officers and employees at all levels within the company \u2014 to work for the greater good and act with integrity, abiding by our Code of Ethics. All employees participate in biannual training on the Code of Ethics and must attest that they will comply with the Code annually. Phillips 66\u2019s principal executive officer and senior financial officers are also expected to adhere to a supplemental Code of Ethics for the Principal Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers. We conduct annual benchmarking of our ethics program via a third party and share those results with our board\u2019s Audit and Finance Committee.\n\nThe Code of Ethics covers topics including, but not limited to, human rights, conflicts of interest, discrimination, harassment, confidentiality, anti-bribery, anti-boycott, employee grievances, insider trading, competition and fair dealing. It encapsulates the company\u2019s human rights position and prohibits human trafficking and forced labor, consistent with international norms.\n\nWe recognize and respect the dignity of all human beings. We believe business has a role in promoting respect for human rights worldwide.\n\nWe embrace the right of all people to live their lives free from social, political or economic discrimination or abuse. It oversees the integrity of financial reporting and financial statements. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights informs our Position on Human Rights. We don\u2019t use corporal punishment, and where we provide housing for employees, we ensure living conditions are safe and sanitary.\n\nSHARED VALUE\n\nOur company contributes to the local, state and national economies and the communities in which we live and operate. Since 2012, Phillips 66 has paid approximately $10 billion in income and property taxes to local, state and federal governments, helping fund programs for public schools and projects like roads, bridges, ports and waterways.\n\n~$10 billion\nincome and property taxes paid to local, state and federal governments since 2012\n\nFrom 2012 through the end of 2021, we distributed over $29 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and share exchanges. We achieved these results through our continued commitment to safe, reliable and environmentally sustainable operations.\n\n$29+ billion\n\nto shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and share exchanges from 2012 through the end of 2021\n\nGlobal Ethics Toll-free Help Line\n855-318-5390\nBUSINESS PARTNER, SUPPLY CHAIN AND SOCIAL SUPPLIER STANDARDS\n\nThe products manufactured in our refineries and developed along the supply chain significantly contribute to local, state and national economies. In keeping with our core value of honor, we choose business partners objectively and fairly and act with honesty in all business dealings. We comply with laws where we do business to ensure our supply chain standards meet minimum wage, child labor, right to associate or bargain collectively, and working-hour requirements.\n\nBusiness partners and suppliers are expected to comply with the contractual obligations and expectations in our Business Partner Principles of Conduct. These principles require our suppliers to work with our employees in a manner consistent with our values and our Code of Ethics. Priorities include fair wages, nondiscrimination, no human trafficking, anti-bribery, cybersecurity, and upholding all health, safety and environmental laws.\n\nOur procurement policy governs all our supply chain activities. We employ formal processes to consistently vet suppliers to protect people, ensure adherence to industry-standard frameworks for quality and monitor financial stability. Maintaining ongoing engagement with our suppliers helps ensure the continued safety, quality and sustainable delivery of goods and services to our operations. Understanding and monitoring the work conducted by our suppliers and business partners is integral to efficient and robust business operations, sustainability and respect for human rights. We audit suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities and examine contracts within our supply chain to ensure adherence to policy. Our suppliers are expected to certify that the materials incorporated into products sold to Phillips 66 comply with all laws, including those pertaining to human rights, slavery and human trafficking. We engage with suppliers to enhance our operating performance through innovative products and the execution of continuous improvement opportunities.\n\nSupply Chain Sustainability\n\nPhillips 66 seeks to do business with diverse businesses across all our operations, and we are committed to providing equal and impartial opportunities. This approach stimulates local economic development and enhances our long-term business performance by improving supplier responsiveness, competition and sustainability.\n\nWe actively participate in organizations that support the development of diverse businesses in the United States. This support includes our corporate memberships in the National Minority Supplier Development Council, the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council and active support of API diversity activities.\n\nOur goals encourage the expanded utilization of a diverse, sustainable supply base while delivering quality and competitive goods and services. We piloted supply chain sustainability training for our employees, highlighting items of impact and our initiatives. We anticipate offering training to all employees in the Procurement organization by the end of 2022.\n\nADVANCING SUPPLIER DIVERSITY\n\nWe advanced our supplier diversity program by establishing collaborative relationships, developing digital tools, providing data visibility and establishing internal metrics for diverse supplier benchmarking and utilization in alignment with our business needs. In 2021, we developed a dashboard that allows business units to analyze their current supplier diversity landscape. We increased our Tier 1 and 2 supplier reporting program to engage with and advance our efforts.\n\nPOLITICAL AND PUBLIC POLICY PROCESS\n\nPhillips 66 participates in the U.S. legislative and regulatory policy development and political process to serve the best interests of our shareholders, our workforce and other stakeholders. Our operations are highly regulated and are affected by actions at many levels of government. Our public policy activities include education and advocacy efforts at the local, state and federal levels. We are also committed to complying with all applicable state and federal rules on lobbying and disclosures.\n\nOur Political Giving and Activity Policy governs our actions. It discloses political activity by the board of directors and management and lays out the criteria by which we evaluate contributions made over the past five years. In addition, the board\u2019s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee has oversight of political risks and receives updates from the board throughout the year.\nPHILLIPS 66 EMPLOYEE POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE\n\nIn accordance with board and company policies, Phillips 66 does not make direct corporate contributions to candidates in state and federal elections where prohibited. Employees can, however, support candidates for office through PAC66, a political action committee that is funded exclusively through voluntary contributions from eligible employees and members of the board of directors. It is registered with the Federal Election Commission, and contributions are reported monthly. Employees participating in PAC66 are not reimbursed \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 for political contributions or expenses.\n\nPAC66\u2019s board of directors is comprised of a broad cross-section of company employees. The board approves all PAC66 disbursements, which are made solely in the best interest of the company and its shareholders, and not according to the personal agendas of individual directors, officers or employees. PAC66 contributes to state and federal political candidates who support responsible energy industry activities and other business issues of interest to the company.\n\nTRADE ASSOCIATIONS\n\nWe participate in industry trade associations where we share technical and standards expertise and lessons learned from incident investigations. We also develop best practices and take part in public education efforts regarding issues of common concern to our industry. Our participation in trade and industry associations is subject to management oversight by our Government Affairs team, which serves as the principal representative in such associations and recommends memberships to our Executive Leadership Team. We regularly review associations and memberships to ensure that they continue to serve our business needs.\n\nPhillips 66 pays regular membership dues to several trade associations, some of which use a portion of those dues for nondeductible state and federal lobbying and political expenditures. Following the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, these trade associations provide us with documentation of the part of our annual dues that is attributable to lobbying expenses. We disclose these contributions in our Political Giving and Activity Policy.\n\nTrade associations are advocates on many issues, including climate change. We use our climate change position and principles when evaluating a trade association\u2019s position on specific legislation or regulation.\n\nParticipation in a trade association, including membership on its board, does not mean that the company agrees with every position the association takes on an issue. When our corporate position differs from that of the association, we seek to work with the association members to promote reasonable compromise on major initiatives affecting our business and stakeholders.\n\nAdditionally, we are active members in local Chambers of Commerce and other civic organizations where our operating assets are located. A list of these organizations can be found in our Political Giving and Activity Policy. Analysis of trade associations\u2019 alignment with our positions are detailed in our Lobbying Activities Report, available on our website.\nCybersecurity\n\nWe recognize the increasing threat of cybercrimes and enforce comprehensive Corporate Information Security policies, standards and technical controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the company\u2019s systems and information assets.\n\nThese policies and standards, followed by all business units, align with recognized cybersecurity frameworks and industry best practices.\n\nAt a corporate network level, Phillips 66 applies controls and processes to actively monitor, detect, prevent and respond to external cybersecurity threats. Every inbound email is inspected for malicious activity. External threats are mitigated through external penetration testing conducted by independent third-party specialists.\n\nFor internal business-critical process control networks, specific controls are implemented to mitigate the risk of cybersecurity threats. These controls include, but are not limited to, the segregation of process control networks and systems from the Phillips 66 corporate network and external networks.\n\nThe Phillips 66 Digital Security team provides information security operational support and general cybersecurity guidance for all locations. The team is also responsible for general and specific employee awareness programs that promote good cybersecurity habits. A privacy program has been implemented to protect personal information assets.\n\nPhillips 66 Risk Management standards require regular information security risk assessments for business units and projects. These assessments include internal networks and systems, as well as third-party suppliers and partner assessments.\n\nWe\u2019ve also selected leading managed network service providers to deliver secure broadband network services with secure transaction and settlement processing for reliable and secure payments. These system elements are reviewed annually by third-party assessors to demonstrate ongoing compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.\n\nEach year, we conduct a range of IT audits across the company\u2019s IT infrastructure, networks, systems, applications, operational processes and procedures to ensure compliance with our Information Security policies and standards. Process control network assurance audits are done on a rotating schedule with coverage at each facility on a cycle of no greater than five years.\n\nAs part of the Business Continuity Plan development, all corporate IT systems are assessed for business criticality with key systems and data included in the IT Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). The DRP supports the resumption of corporate IT services related to essential business processes in a major unplanned event causing significant damage or loss to the infrastructure.\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Analysis\n\nWe include our TCFD analysis in our governance chapter to provide you with a look at how we are assessing and mitigating risks and opportunities associated with climate change.\n\nGOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT OF CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nAt Phillips 66, risk management starts with our board of directors and its committees providing oversight of strategic planning. Our governance structure provides the board and executive leadership the necessary opportunities to exercise their oversight responsibilities concerning risks, including those related to climate change, and our executive leadership is responsible for the strategic and operational management of climate-related financial risks and opportunities.\n\nThe board and management review long-term energy outlook scenarios and leading indicators annually and as a consideration in business planning. The Audit and Finance Committee monitors our enterprisewide risk management program more frequently. It also reviews company controls, compliance and ethics.\n\nThe board\u2019s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee considers environmental, social and political trends and risks to guide the company\u2019s long-term business objectives.\n\nOUR VISION\n\nAt Phillips 66, our commitment to providing energy and improving lives extends to every aspect of our business. As the global population grows, access to affordable, reliable and abundant energy is needed to drive human progress and the need for global action to reduce GHG emissions increases.\n\nWe strive to increase the efficiency of our diversified operations. Our integrated portfolio provides ongoing opportunities to strengthen our competitiveness and maximize upside in the near term and mitigate downside risk longer term. Our strong balance sheet, scale, commercial acumen, leadership in research and innovation, and growth opportunities within our expanding lower-carbon portfolio contribute to our long-term resilience.\n\nTechnology development and deployment are needed to provide energy now and achieve energy transition goals consistent with the Paris Agreement.\n\nTo test our financial resilience under multiple scenarios, we consider a range of possible long-term energy outlooks, and we evaluate and mitigate potential risks, including climate-related risks. We adjust our plans to capture new opportunities considering technology developments, policy changes and consumer energy demand.\nCLIMATE-RELATED RISKS\n\nPotential Short- and Medium-term Risks\nThese are risks that may impact financial results. They include any that may materialize over the current annual reporting cycle and up to a five-year time frame.\n\nREGULATORY \u2014 EMISSIONS\nOur industry is highly regulated, and we comply with the many local, state and federal laws that affect our operations, including those on air emissions. Our Health, Safety and Environment Management System (HSEMS) facilitates HSE performance and compliance with standards, procedures and guidelines that often exceed regulatory requirements and are consistently applied by all business units.\n\nWe have made significant investments in environmental projects, including efforts to reduce emissions that focus on efficiency, resilience, adaptation and renewable fuels. For more details, see the Risk Management section of this report.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to predict how future GHG emissions legislation would impact the company\u2019s business, legislation or regulation that emerges over the medium- to long-term that imposes reporting obligations on, or limits emissions of GHGs from, the company\u2019s equipment and operations could require the company to incur costs.\n\nPHYSICAL RISK \u2014 BUSINESS CONTINUITY\nThe company is prepared for the possibility of extreme weather events that might impact our operations.\n\nWe have developed an Emergency Response Management System and Crisis Management Plan based on risk evaluations and business impact analyses. Each facility has a written emergency response plan to ensure continuous availability, or prompt recovery, of critical business processes, resources and facility operations.\n\nPotential Long-term Risks\nThese risks may fundamentally impact the viability of our long-term strategy and business model. They include risks that may materialize over a five- to 10-year time frame.\n\nMARKET \u2014 OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES\nThe deployment of disruptive new technologies at mass scale within government policy environments that strongly incentivize investment and innovation would have long-term impacts on oil and natural gas demand and prices.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, Phillips 66 remains committed to ongoing scenario analysis, responsible risk management, and transparency about our financial and portfolio resilience and how we are preparing to adapt for the longer term.\n\nPLANS FOR OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE ARE SUBJECT TO SOCIETAL AND POLITICAL PRESSURES\nPlans to expand or construct assets and plans for future performance, including our joint ventures, are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. Such risks could adversely impact our results of operations.\n\nCLIMATE-RELATED OPPORTUNITIES\n\nProviding Lower-carbon Alternatives\nBy 2030, our Emerging Energy organization is targeting $2 billion of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) contributions through investments that are consistent with our disciplined approach to capital and emphasis on returns.\n\nWe\u2019re evaluating our assets and increasing our supply of renewable fuels. We continue to assess new opportunities within our portfolios and with third parties. While doing so, we remain focused on operating reliability.\n\nWe commercialize premium coke for the world\u2019s lithium-ion battery anode market using petroleum coke, a byproduct of our refining process.\n\nThe company is also assessing longer-term technologies, including carbon capture, lower-carbon hydrogen production for multiple applications and the development of hydrogen fueling networks.\n\nInvesting in Technology Development\nWe enhance our business programs and initiatives with research to improve our operations and provide a science-based approach.\n\nWe invest in the development of lower-carbon technologies such as OPVs, SOFCs and next-generation batteries.\nSCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\nToday, the world population is close to 8 billion, and it\u2019s expected to increase to 8.5 billion people by 2030 and nearly 10 billion by 2050.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration anticipates petroleum and other liquid fuels will remain the world\u2019s largest energy source in 2050, with renewable energy sources, including solar and wind, growing the fastest. The rising global population, coupled with higher standards of living, will increase pressure on Earth\u2019s natural resources, with implications for the energy transition. As the energy transition progresses and evolves, Phillips 66 will continue to adjust its strategic plans accordingly.\n\nWe assess proprietary and public long-term energy demand scenarios in our corporate strategy planning, such as IHS Markit, the IEA Stated Policies (STEPS), IEA Sustainable Development (SDS) and IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenarios. Considering this range of scenarios allows us to test our portfolio across a wide range of potential environments. We formulate views on potential market fundamentals, regulatory developments needed under various scenarios, and emerging risks and opportunities under various market conditions. We are then able to identify changes to our strategy in light of the results. We consider implications to our capital allocation, growth opportunities, potential mergers and acquisitions, and which lower-carbon investments to pursue.\n\nPRIMARY ENERGY DEMAND BY FUEL TYPE\n\n(Billion Tons of Oil Equivalent)\n\nGLOBAL LIQUIDS DEMAND\n\n(Million Barrels per Day)\n\nBusiness Planning\n\nOur business planning process utilizes several inputs to develop a range of forecasts to inform our capital allocation decisions and enable sustainable, resilient and profitable operations. We consider metrics for key strategic, physical and policy variables within our scenarios. Our decision-making processes include consideration of key climate policies, energy mix, energy efficiency, access to capital, tax, reputational, technological and human capital risks and opportunities.\n\nAs a result of our scenario planning, we invest in infrastructure to meet global energy needs. We are investing in heat recovery hardware, process controls and energy dashboards that enable operators and engineers to improve the energy efficiency of our pipelines, refineries and fractionators. We are converting our Rodeo facility in California to make lower-carbon fuels, and in the United Kingdom, we are expanding renewable fuels production at our Humber Refinery. We are evaluating potential investments in the EV battery supply chain, carbon capture and lower-carbon hydrogen.\nEffects on Our Assets\nThe potential physical effects of climate change and severe weather on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present at the various sites where our businesses are located. We have systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks that could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations, including those that may be caused by climate change.\n\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to protect our assets from physical risks and to employ processes to the extent available to mitigate such risks.\n\nMany of our facilities are located near coastal areas. As a result, extreme weather and rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to operate these facilities or transport crude oil, refined petroleum, or petrochemical and plastics products. Extended periods of such disruption could negatively affect our operations. We could also incur substantial costs to prevent or repair damage to these facilities. Finally, depending on the severity and duration of any extreme weather events or climate conditions, our operations may need to be modified and material costs incurred, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAT A GLANCE\nCore Components of Planning and Management\n\n1. Mitigating physical risks\nPhillips 66 operations are affected by nature \u2014 droughts, floods, hurricanes, storms, heat, cold and earthquakes. We have substantial systems and processes to help us identify, measure, manage and mitigate risks associated with each of these possibilities.\n\n2. Forecasting policy risks\nWe are subject to changing laws, regulations and judicial opinions; community, national and global preferences; and contractual obligations. We have developed sophisticated, multilevel, integrated systems to anticipate, inform, manage and comply with these requirements and expectations. For clarity, we include cybersecurity risks because cybersecurity can span policy and technology.\n\n3. Seeking technology opportunities\nAs an energy company focused on both the present and the future, we realize the value of our in-house research and development center staffed with scientists and engineers. This differentiator enables us to create solutions to current and future physical or policy risk challenges. Our ERI team members analyze and develop technologies and evaluate feasibility, economics, scalability, key milestones and timing. They find ways to increase clean product yields and overall energy efficiency; make our operations safer, more reliable and more sustainable; reduce water risks and other environmental impacts; and manage changing regulations and expectations. The solutions we develop benefit our company, our customers and our communities. For more details, see the Research and Innovation section in this report.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nAt Phillips 66, we use a detailed and disciplined process to identify potential risks and opportunities that could significantly impact our business.\n\nEnterprise Risk Management\nOur enterprise risk management program provides a systematic approach to identifying and understanding significant risks, including climate-related issues, changes in energy policy, and physical or operational risks. Our strategic planning and scenario planning seek to manage our businesses\u2019 risks while evaluating opportunities to execute our strategy.\n\nExperts from all areas of our business units and functions \u2014 including Refining, Midstream, Commercial, Marketing and Specialties, Corporate Strategy, Research, Finance, Treasury, Tax, Legal, Compliance, Government Affairs, Community Relations and Environment, Social and Governance \u2014 are actively involved in our risk management program and processes. Our Risk Management team works to identify risks falling into any of the categories described above that could affect our overall policies and governance, strategy development, business units, forecasts and capital allocation decisions, among others.\n\nAdditionally, our Risk Management team provides detailed, regular, timely and relevant information to our board of directors and Executive Leadership Team. This information is one of many inputs that enables our board and its committees to oversee and guide our company effectively.\n\nIn our program we:\n\u2022 Quantify the risks based on our assessment of the probability of each risk and the potential significance of its financial, reputational or other impacts\n\u2022 Assess each of these risks in light of potential mitigating strategies or factors that may be available\n\u2022 Assign values to each mitigating factor based on assessments of potential timing, costs, effectiveness and other features\n\u2022 Include assessments of potential GHG emissions policies and impacts\n\nEach of these risks has a corporate owner, creating accountability within our organization. Management directs, and the board oversees, the enterprise risk management program and processes.\n\nRISKS TO OUR BUSINESS\n\u2022 Physical environmental factors, risks associated with weather or climate, and our efforts and ability to measure, report and control GHG emissions\n\u2022 The impact of regional or global energy accords and related forecasts of program impacts and costs\n\u2022 Financial variables, including the likely location, scale and duration of all tax regimes, including carbon taxes\n\u2022 Evolving investor opinions and initiatives\n\u2022 Community, cultural, political and public opinion factors that could influence where, when and how we operate and at what cost\n\u2022 Demographic, scientific, technological, reputational and human capital matters\n\u2022 Trade leakage, which can result when imported goods transfer from one jurisdiction to another\nIdentifying, Assessing and Managing Climate-related Risks\n\nClimate-related risks are integrated into multiple larger risk categories because of the interconnected nature of these risks across multiple categories.\n\nWe test our assumptions against CO$_2$ cost-forecasting, energy-efficiency indices and best practices, carbon capture technology and cost, and renewable fuels forecasts, alongside regulatory requirements. Data on our GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions and the possible physical effects of climate change on our assets are incorporated into our planning, investment and risk management decision making.\n\nWe account for anticipated GHG emissions when we are designing and developing facilities and projects and implementing energy-efficiency initiatives that also reduce GHG emissions. Regulatory certainty and economic viability are integral considerations. We test a variety of future scenarios that could have a material impact on the company and variables that may be associated with an incident. This system ensures we mitigate risk to the company and conduct regular gap analyses. It also enables us to position the company to benefit from energy efficiency, emissions reductions and other business and policy goals.\n\nProcesses for Managing Climate-related Risks\n\nEFFICIENT ENERGY USE\n\nEnergy expenditures can account for a significant portion of a refinery\u2019s operating expenses. We capitalize on opportunities to reduce these expenses, such as improvements in heat exchange or recovery, furnace controls, and steam optimization.\n\nSince our inception in 2012, six of our 11 U.S. refineries have earned U.S. EPA ENERGY STAR\u00ae certifications for performing in the top 25% of similar facilities nationwide for energy efficiency and meeting EPA performance levels.\n\nOur headquarters building in Houston, Texas, is certified as a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum facility.\n\nAdditionally, seven of our refineries have associated cogeneration units. Cogeneration uses a single fuel source to produce both electricity and heat simultaneously. The process helps us meet our manufacturing needs and converts heat that would otherwise be lost into thermal energy to power our process equipment.\n\nThree cogeneration units \u2014 at Los Angeles and San Francisco in California and Sweeny in Texas \u2014 are owned by Phillips 66. Any excess power not used in our facilities is sold to the local utility market. Four other refineries \u2014 in the Texas Panhandle, New Jersey, Washington state and the United Kingdom \u2014 purchase some of their heat or electricity from third-party-owned cogeneration units adjacent to our facilities. The Sweeny cogen unit produces power for the refinery and CPChem petrochemical plants. During normal operations, we can export as much as 165 megawatts of electricity to the local power grid. That\u2019s enough to power 100,000 homes. During Winter Storm Uri, in 2021, we increased that output to 370 megawatts, doubling our impact. To accomplish that, we shut down operating units, minimizing our energy usage and maximizing our output to the community.\n\nWe have an active Energy Best Practices network of representatives from all our refineries and major corporate support groups, including Refining Business Improvement, ERI and IT. Members of the network meet regularly to share information about technology, experiences at their plants and ongoing energy conservation projects.\n\nEFFICIENT WATER USE\n\nAccess to water, maintaining its quality and using it efficiently are critical elements in sustainable energy production. Therefore, our facilities have wastewater systems and oil recovery units. These units separate reusable water from oil streams, reducing freshwater use and improving discharged water quality. For more detail, see the Environmental Stewardship section in this report.\nRESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION\n\nWe maintain and test robust business continuity planning and preparedness programs and other initiatives. Examples include:\n\n- Hardening assets to enhance their reliability, including our industry-leading pipeline river crossing program and the power substation elevation at Bayway Refinery in Linden, New Jersey\n- Installing a state-of-the-art power distribution facility at Wood River Refinery in Roxana, Illinois, improving facility reliability and reducing flaring from unplanned events\n- Providing comprehensive community awareness, education and outreach programs to ensure that everyone living or working near pipelines or facilities is aware of their existence, adopts safe digging practices, learns the signs of a potential pipeline leak and knows how to respond quickly if a problem is suspected\n\nGHG METRICS AND TARGETS\n\nThe majority of our GHG emissions are from refining. Our goal is to improve our operational excellence, improve our energy efficiency and reduce our GHG emissions intensity.\n\nWe have set a goal for our refining sites to achieve top-third energy efficiency by 2030. We use a third-party industry manufacturing energy-efficiency index to measure our progress. In the fall of 2021, Phillips 66 became an ENERGY STAR Partner to reflect our commitment to improving energy efficiency.\n\nOur refineries process a combined average of about 2 million barrels per day of crude oil into clean, affordable everyday energy products. Most of our Scope 1 GHG emissions are CO\u2082, resulting from manufacturing energy products. Our methane and other GHG emissions are negligible. More stringent regulatory standards can require more processing, which takes more energy.\nIn 2021, we announced 2030 targets to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of our operations (Scope 1 and 2) and products (Scope 3) by 30% and 15%, respectively, from a 2019 baseline.* These medium-term targets are tied to projects currently underway and projects that are planned or under development consistent with the company\u2019s disciplined approach to capital allocation and focus on returns. These projects:\n\n- Improve the energy efficiency of our operations\n- Grow production and blending of renewable fuels and lower-carbon supply chain products such as premium coke and lubricants\n- Produce commercial-scale low-carbon-intensity hydrogen\n- Capture carbon from our operations\n- Increase renewable power sources to use in our operations\n- Support enterprise growth and portfolio optimization\n\nOur 2030 targets are based on many factors, including planned projects that may be impacted by future equipment turnarounds and maintenance periods. These periods can vary by two to five years and may be affected by operational, materials or labor availability, and market demands. As a result, reductions are not anticipated to be ratable year over year. In 2021, we advanced permitting for conversion of our Rodeo facility, decided to convert the Alliance Refinery to a terminal and progressed several other lower-carbon initiatives.\n\n*Ernst & Young LLP provided limited assurance for certain 2019 GHG data\n\nIn 2022, we continue to progress our planned projects and are on track to meet our emissions intensity reduction targets. For more details on GHG data, see the Performance Data section of this report.\n\nAchieving our 2050 target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 manufacturing-related emissions intensity by 50% will require changes beyond Phillips 66\u2019s sphere of influence and control, such as:\n\n- Advancements enabling broad commercial deployment and use of lower-carbon technologies\n- Global policies that fund and incentivize the development of a lower-carbon energy system\n- Changes in consumer behavior and energy choices\n- Available materials throughout the supply chain\n\nOur commitment to sustainability is also reflected in changes to our employee bonus program. In 2021, the board\u2019s Human Resources and Compensation Committee increased the weighting of environmental factors in our Variable Cash Incentive Program from 5% to 15%. In addition, we added metrics for advancing lower-carbon investments, optimization and innovation, reducing manufacturing emissions intensity, and setting GHG emissions-intensity reduction targets.\n\nPhillips 66 recognizes the importance of credible disclosure to shareholders. Reputational and potential economic harm could result from setting emissions reduction targets outside our current understanding of feasible and economic pathways. We are committed to reassessing our targets in step with technological developments, policy changes and consumer energy demand trends.\nStakeholder Engagement\nWe provide Good Energy to improve the lives in the communities where we live and work.\nStakeholder engagement is part of our commitment to social responsibility. Our approach is one of mutual respect. This means respecting human rights, demonstrating our values through our actions and being a good neighbor.\n\nOur stakeholders include employees, shareholders, investors, customers, communities where we operate, Indigenous peoples, legislators and energy consumers. They enable us to fulfill our purpose and execute our strategy. Reaching out and listening through open lines of communication is a priority for us.\n\nWe respect human rights by demonstrating our values through our actions and by being a good neighbor. We conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable laws, including environmental laws, regulations and policies. In alignment with the EPA\u2019s definition of environmental justice, we believe in the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin or income. Our processes provide a proactive, measured and responsive approach to stakeholder engagement.\n\nIn this report, we are focusing on our external stakeholder engagement activities. Our Human Capital Management Report offers an in-depth look at the programs and policies that support our employees. It covers such topics as inclusion and diversity, employee programs, employee resource groups, philanthropy, compensation and benefits. As we progress through the energy transition, we are committed to preparing our highly skilled employees for evolving job opportunities. The Human Capital Management Report, linked below, expounds upon the training, education and skills development we offer our employees.\n\nWe reviewed the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) Assessment and Methodology on just transition, and, while the topic and definition of just transition are evolving, Phillips 66 is directionally aligned with the WBA social dialogue and planning transition indicators. We will monitor and participate in the development of these frameworks as they pertain to our businesses. One example of our approach to just transition for employees, labor unions, government and communities is reflected in the Rodeo Renewed project.\n\nFor more details on programs and policies that support our employees, see the Human Capital Management Report.\n\nBuilding Trust in Our Communities\n\nBuilding local capacity for resilience and preparedness is part of our commitment to our values, human rights, environmental protection and rapid response. We participate in community safety and preparedness programs and proactively support local police, fire and emergency management personnel to bolster their resources, providing every community where we have facilities with equipment, experience or other resources.\n\nWe maintain open communication channels with the communities surrounding our facilities and regularly participate in dialogue on safety concerns, feedback and grievances. This includes community awareness, education and listening panels, social media, and our community hotlines. Concerned citizens can call our Midstream community relations hotline at 832-765-3887 or 24-hour hotlines for each of our refineries.\n\nWe cast wide nets internally and externally to identify trends and materiality issues that may be important to our stakeholders so that we can collect and understand essential data and perspectives. We tap into various sources inside and outside the sector, across countries and political views, and cover physical, policy, human capital, reputational risk and opportunities-related information.\n\nWe routinely acquire additional information about stakeholder interests from sources including customers, in-person interviews and surveys. Data comes from investors, service companies, consultants, industry bodies, research firms and analyst reports. We also rely on sources such as governmental databases, environmental and social nongovernmental organizations, global policy bodies, ratings agencies and indices, community advisory boards, and scorers and activists in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) areas.\nCOMMUNITY AWARENESS ABOUT PIPELINES\nOur Midstream operations are responsible for pipelines across 17 states and over 230 counties. Our pipeline operators have year-round community awareness, education and listening panels to stay in touch with people who are involved with and affected by our extensive pipeline network.\n\n811: Call Before You Dig!\nPhillips 66 operates about 12,800 miles of U.S. pipeline systems, and the safety of the people who live and work nearby is a priority. U.S. government and oil industry statistics show that the most common cause of pipeline incidents is improper or unauthorized digging. If someone puts a shovel or heavy machinery in the ground without knowing there\u2019s a pipeline buried beneath, they can cause serious damage.\n\nThat\u2019s why our pipeline operations business maintains an 811 call center, and it has handled more than 1.6 million calls since 2012. Phillips 66 also offers specialized programs for farmers, ranchers, emergency officials and schools.\n\nIn 2020, we began collecting real-time data via the Phillips 66 Damage Information Reporting Tool, known as DIRT, and discovered a high number of unauthorized excavations in specific locations. Because of the potential danger, we launched a media geofencing campaign.\n\nWe identified and geofenced home improvement stores, landscapers and nurseries, heavy equipment sales and rental stores, planning and zoning buildings, and road department and public works buildings close to our pipelines.\n\nWhen someone entered geofenced locations, their phones, laptops and tablets received Phillips 66 and 811 Call Before You Dig ads linked to stakeholder-specific portions of the pipeline safety website.\n\nThe program was a success. In 2021, we implemented geofencing campaigns near the U.S. pipelines that saw the most excavation activity. The campaigns generated over 4 million impressions, increased the traffic to our pipeline safety website by an average of 160% year over year and introduced more than 20,000 new users to our site. We also initiated additional audience-specific e-campaigns during Safe Digging Month, enhanced our school outreach programs to increase pipeline safety awareness and emergency preparedness, and shared access to our response action plans for local emergency responders.\n\nWe\u2019re also spreading the word with a 28-foot tall by 95-foot long 811 message on a highway-adjacent storage tank at our Pasadena Terminal in Texas and through our road transport subsidiary, Sentinel Transportation. We put 811 decals on the Sentinel tankers, and because the fleet travels 24 million miles a year, millions of people see the message.\n\nTRUCKERS AGAINST TRAFFICKING\nPhillips 66 is a platinum sponsor of Truckers Against Trafficking, an organization that educates truck drivers on how to spot potential human trafficking and what to do. In 2021, we launched computer-based training to teach field employees to notice and report the signs of potential human trafficking.\n\nREACHING OUT TO OUR REFINERY COMMUNITIES\nOur Refining operations have well-established Community Advisory Councils or Panels (CACs or CAPs) that represent a cooperative and empowering environment for collaboration in the community. CACs and CAPs include company representatives and community members who meet regularly. Leaders from Refining and, in some instances, Midstream and Lubricants operations provide feedback on performance and share insights on plans and activities. The Wood River CAP also serves our Midstream and Marketing and Specialties operations in the area. The Billings CAC covers the Refining and Midstream operations there.\n\nCACs and CAPs are also communication channels for safety issues, feedback and grievances. Leaders are focused on their communities and breaking down communication barriers, taking into account members\u2019 preferences to respond to community needs. Discussions such as these help us plan for the next five to 10 years and ensure that we keep our communities top of mind.\nCONNECTING WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES\n\nPhillips 66 has been working with Indigenous peoples to build meaningful relationships and honor them and their connection to the land in the regions where we do business. As Todd Denton, our Senior Vice President for Health, Safety and Environment, and Projects, said at a company forum during Native American History Month, \u201cGetting diverse Indigenous perspectives is invaluable to us as a company and industry. We want Native American people to know Phillips 66 is engaged with the tribes and Indigenous peoples.\u201d\n\nWe work with tribal representatives when repairs or updates need to be made to pipelines or other assets on or near land that is important to them. For example, in the summer of 2021, Midstream leadership met with members of the Osage Nation to discuss replacing parts of the Cherokee East Pipeline between Ponca City and Glenpool, Oklahoma, which crosses native lands.\n\nPlanting the Seeds of Cultural Appreciation\n\nOutside the Phillips 66 Research Center in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, you\u2019ll find three plants intertwined in an example of Native American agricultural tradition \u2014 the Three Sisters garden.\n\nIn spring 2021, members of our Native American Network Employee Resource Group planted this small garden of corn, beans and squash.\n\nThis method of companion planting is called a Three Sisters garden because the three plants support one another as they grow, deterring pests and increasing total crop output. Group members say these crops are the center of Native American agriculture and cuisine and provide a starting point for talking about inclusion, diversity and cultural awareness.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nIndigenous Peoples STEM Education Support\n\n$110,000 contributed to the American Indian Science and Engineering Society and its efforts to bring more Indigenous students into STEM studies\n\nTop 50 workplace for Indigenous STEM Professionals awarded by AISES Winds of Change Magazine\n\n$30,000 contributed by the Ferndale Refinery, as the title sponsor of the Annual Auction for the Lummi Nation Boys & Girls Club\nSeeking Different Perspectives: A Salinan Tribal Cultural Resource Monitor Talks About Working With Phillips 66\n\nAnother example of working together with Indigenous peoples comes from the central coast of California. Phillips 66 purchased pipeline assets from another company and is now working to remediate the soil, which was contaminated decades ago.\n\nThe active pipeline runs through 20 acres of a working ranch, with a rich history going back for centuries. That means any project on this land has the potential for significant cultural considerations. This site, in Santa Margarita, California, is known to have been inhabited by Native Americans, Spanish missionaries and others.\n\nIn situations like this, when local, state or federal agencies determine that ground-disturbing work in the soil is required in some areas, we work with tribal representatives \u2014 often from more than one tribe \u2014 and archeologists so that any artifacts or remains recovered can be handled properly and respectfully. Robert Piatti, the Cultural Resource Monitor Lead for the Salinan Tribe of San Luis Obispo and Monterey counties, worked with crews on the site. He says some of the artifacts and remains found at this site could be 700 to 800 years old or even older. This was the first time he\u2019d worked with Phillips 66, and, he says, what stood out to him was that most of the tribes with interest in the land were included in discussions, which doesn\u2019t always happen. \u201cWe kept an open line of partnership from the get-go, which was really important \u2026 If [a company is] not willing to do what they did in this case and participate and have those conversations, and address the issues that happen, it can be confrontational.\u201d\n\nPiatti says monitoring a site where remains and cultural items are buried can be emotionally difficult, but it\u2019s necessary.\n\nDespite the challenging nature of the situation, Piatti says he enjoyed getting to know the Phillips 66 employees at the site and seeing their dedication to serving the greater good and doing the right thing. He says his voice is one of many first-hand views that could be shared, \u201cI appreciate the people, the care and consideration. They did more than they had to and I feel good about the direction forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting diverse Indigenous perspectives is invaluable to us as a company and as an industry.\u201d\n\nROBERT PIATTI\nSalinan Tribe of San Luis Obispo and Monterey counties\nCultural Resource Monitor Lead\nSOCIAL RISK ASSESSMENT PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES\nWe adhere to local and national laws and regulations regarding environmental, social and health assessments before starting operations at a new site, including pipelines. We conduct a comprehensive social risk assessment for new projects to understand the people and concerns along a proposed route.\n\nWe provide up-to-date information to stakeholder communities about potential impacts and environmental, health and safety aspects of our work. We regularly update and disseminate information through press releases, our website, social media, and, in some cases, door-to-door flyer distribution. We also hold public consultations at which we encourage dialogue and welcome feedback from our stakeholders.\n\nWe are proud to meet or exceed regulatory requirements and industry best practices for informing the public about our operations. Our public awareness programs have been benchmarked as top-of-industry.\n\nMEDIA\nWe maintain local, national and trade media relationships as part of our commitment to communication and transparency with our stakeholders. We are responsive to inquiries and proactively share information with news outlets. In the event of an incident, we strive to ensure that community information is available within an hour.\n\nINVESTORS AND BANKS\nWe proactively engage with many of our banks and investors, including socially responsible investors, to update them on our progress, discuss items of interest or concern, and learn about their stakeholders\u2019 topics of interest. Regular communication enables these stakeholder groups to fulfill commitments related to Principles for Responsible Investments, a voluntary set of investment principles related to integrating sustainability issues in investment decision-making processes.\n\nCUSTOMERS\nWe know sustainability is important to our customers, and we engage with them because they are a valuable stakeholder. They distribute the products we make to consumers and businesses. We market petroleum products through wholesale and joint venture outlets under the Phillips 66, Conoco, 76, JET and Coop brands, primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Switzerland \u2014 among many others.\n\n7,110\nbranded U.S. outlets\n\n1,700\nbranded international outlets\nWorking for the Greater Good in the Community\n\nPhillips 66 takes seriously our corporate responsibility to our employees, our communities and our environment. Living our core values of safety, honor and commitment, we create purposeful partnerships and work to strengthen economic, social and environmental resilience and sustainability in the communities where our employees live and work. Good Energy, our employee volunteerism program, was designed to inspire employees to connect with our neighbors and share our compassion, talents and hard work to improve our communities.\n\nPROVIDING RELIEF IN A FOOD DESERT\n\nThe northern part of Lake Charles, Louisiana, is what the U.S. Department of Agriculture classifies as a \u201cfood desert.\u201d That means people have limited access to healthy food options. To help families in need, Phillips 66 donated funds and helped distribute 60,000 pounds of meat, produce and other food items to 400 Lake Charles families.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nSocial Impact\n\nOur corporate philanthropy program is one way we live our values, support our stakeholders and contribute to the sustainability of our communities. It is based on the four key areas below.\n\nEDUCATION AND LITERACY\n\n- In Montana, we provided a grant for Crow Tribe education to the Plenty Doors Community Development Corporation, a Native American-led nonprofit that promotes food access, supports cultural sharing and offers resources for small businesses, including technical assistance and education\n- Phillips 66 Midstream employees donated funds to Tulsa Public Schools in Oklahoma through Elevate Our Kids, a nonprofit organization that supports childhood education in under-resourced communities\n\nCOMMUNITY SAFETY AND PREPAREDNESS\n\nIn 2021, Hurricane Ida affected our Alliance Refinery in Louisiana, our Bayway Refinery in New Jersey and our Midstream operations. Phillips 66 contributed $1 million to the American Red Cross to provide shelter, relief supplies, food and other necessities to people impacted by the storm.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\n- More than 70 employees and contractors helped the Bayway Refinery\u2019s Veterans Network Employee Resource Group beautify an amphitheater and internal courtyard at a retirement home for military veterans\n- The Linden Blue Acres Floodplain Restoration Project, sponsored by Phillips 66, among others, was awarded a 2021 Land Ethics Award by Bowman\u2019s Hill Wildlife Preserve\n- The Lake Charles Manufacturing Complex won an Outstanding Community Service award from the Louisiana Recreation and Parks Association State Conference for our contributions to park beautification\n\nCIVIC ENRICHMENT\n\n- Phillips 66 employees and families participated in the Harrington Cancer and Health Foundation\u2019s 24 Hours in The Canyon mountain and road bike event in Palo Duro Canyon near Amarillo, Texas, to provide resources for cancer survivors\n- The Ferndale Refinery Veterans Network raised funds for Brigadoon Service Dogs, which provides service dogs for veterans\n## Performance Data\n\n### PERSONAL & PROCESS SAFETY\n\n|

As defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). All rates are calculated as incidents per 200,000 work-hours.\n\n2. American Petroleum Institute for combined rates, Environmental Health, and Safety Group benchmarks for Midstream.\n\n3. American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, U.S. refining benchmark for combined rates.\n\n4. Also known as Lost Time Incident Rate, as defined by OSHA. All rates are calculated as incidents per 200,000 work-hours. Includes employees and contractors.\n\n5. Calculated using the OSHA incident rate formula. Incidents per 200,000 work-hours.\n\n6. Number of motor vehicle incidents x 1 million miles \u00f7 business use miles driven. Business use of a company-owned, leased or rented vehicle includes all miles driven while on duty, including commuting to and from work, driving to and from a call-out location and going to and from lunch.\n\n7. Tier 1 and Tier 2 Process Safety Events differ by release rate, type of product and impact as defined by the American Petroleum Institute RP-754.\n\n8. The company reports 100% of the Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG from assets over which it has operational control. Operated joint ventures such as WRB Refining and Excel Paralubes are included on a 100% basis; non-operated joint ventures such as CPChem LLC and DCP Midstream, LLC are not included. Emissions are included of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), and nitrous oxide (N\u2082O). Other GHG emissions are not considered to be material to our operations and are therefore excluded. Downstream refers to operations from Refineries and lubricants facilities. The global warming potentials for each GHG are sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report, Appendix A: Global Warming Potentials. For emissions data post-2018, absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are reported in accordance to the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development\u2019s GHG Protocol, and emissions intensity calculations follow the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards Disclosure GRI 305-4. Phillips 66 calculates and reports emissions in accordance with the mandatory reporting requirements such as the U.S. EPA\u2019s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Regulatory frameworks may differ from the frameworks referenced in this report and, accordingly, agency data may vary.\n\n9. Scope 1 direct GHG emissions by the company, such as fuel combustion and fugitive emissions, including those from operated refineries, NGL fractionators, pipelines, terminals, lubricants facilities, corporate headquarters and research facilities, are calculated utilizing actual emissions data. If actual data was not available, emissions were calculated using emission factors referenced in the U.S. EPA\u2019s Mandatory GHGRP for all U.S. assets and the EU ETS for European assets. Phillips 66 does not include emissions from operated vehicles.\n\n10. Scope 2 indirect emissions are from imported electricity and steam used in our operated refineries, NGL fractionators, pipelines, terminals, lubricants facilities, corporate headquarters and research facilities. The Sweeny cogeneration unit is assumed to supply all electricity to the Sweeny NGL Fractionator. Consistent with the market-based method guidance, supplier-specific emission factors were utilized where available. If supplier-specific emissions factors were not available, EPA eGRID regional emissions factors for CO\u2082, CH\u2084 and N\u2082O were utilized. Contractual instruments (e.g., renewable energy credits or renewable power purchase agreements) are not included in Scope 2 emissions.\n\n11. Product-related emissions include Scope 3 emissions from products manufactured in operated Refining assets and NGL fractionators. Our products include jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, petroleum coke, NGLs and other products. The data in this report assumes that all fuels are 100% combusted by the end user for purposes of calculating Scope 3 Category II emissions. Non-fuels products, such as sulfur, are not combusted by the end user and therefore are not included in these Scope 3 estimates. For U.S. assets, GHG emissions are calculated using the EPA factors identified in Table MM-1 of 40 CFR Part 98 as of March 2020. GHG emissions for NGL fractionators are calculated using the EPA factors identified in Table NN-1 of 40 CFR Part 98 as of March 2020. All Phillips 66 NGL fractionators are in the United States. For European assets, GHG emissions are calculated using U.K. Government Conversion Factors for GHG emissions as of July 2020.\n\n12. Manufacturing-related intensity is calculated as Scope 1 and 2 metric tons of CO\u2082e divided by processed inputs. Processed inputs include feedstocks, primarily crude and NGLs, processed in operated global Refining, Excel Paralubes and NGL fractionators. Manufacturing-related intensity is calculated as Scope 3 from Use of Sold Products metric tons of CO\u2082e divided by total products produced. Total products produced include all refined petroleum products, combusted and not combusted by the end user, and NGLs fractionated at our operated assets. Products moved through pipelines and terminals are excluded.\n\n13. Environmental events are those that result in an exceedance of the permit or regulatory-based numeric emissions limit, or a significant release of hydrocarbon or chemical. The count is of events that require immediate agency notifications.\n\n14. Spills represent liquid hydrocarbons from operating assets that reach land or water and are >1 bbl.\n\n15. More than 80% of 2021 spills due to 2 incidents. Lessons learned have been shared widely across the organization.\n\n16. Spills beyond secondary containment; includes free product recovered; does not include remediated soil.\n\n17. Midstream liquid hydrocarbon spills outside primary containment.\n\n18. Includes free product recovered; does not include remediated soil.\n\n19. Refining only.\n\n20. Freshwater is defined as water that has low salinity \u2013 usually less than 0.1% (local legal definitions vary). The reported value includes freshwater used as once-through cooling water. Water recycle practices are prevalent within Phillips 66, and result in reduced water withdrawn. Examples include reuse of intermediate refinery streams and optimization of cooling tower and boiler systems to improve water use efficiency.\n\n21. The World Resources Institute Aqueduct\u2122 Water Risk Atlas is used to identify areas with high water demand or potential for water scarcity in the future. Sites are classified as water scarce if withdrawing and consuming water in locations with High (40%-80%) or Extremely High (>80%) Baseline Water Stress as classified by the Aqueduct\u2122 Water Risk Atlas. Water use in water scarce areas is expressed as a percentage of the total freshwater use.\n\n22. 1000 bbls of water per 1000 bbls of processed inputs.\n\n23.
