We develop and apply next-generation technologies to help safely and responsibly meet the world\u2019s growing needs for reliable and affordable energy and high-quality products.\n\nCreating sustainable solutions that improve quality of life and meet society\u2019s evolving needs\n\nAt ExxonMobil, we are committed to improving quality of life by meeting the critical needs of society. That is what we have done throughout our history\u2014as the world evolves, so do we. We are constantly working to meet the changing needs of our customers and stakeholders. This ability to adapt has been the key to creating long-term shareholder value and will be critical to continued success in the years to come.\n\nAs we move forward, we will remain focused on five strategic priorities. First, leading industry across the metrics that are the foundation of success\u2014safety, reliability, environmental performance, earnings and cash flow growth and ultimately shareholder returns. Second, being a valued, essential partner through the creation of win-win solutions for our customers, partners and broader stakeholders. Third, building on our advantaged portfolio, continuously upgrading it to ensure it leads competition and delivers value across a range of external environments and through volatile and evolving markets.\n\nTo do this, we must continue to innovate. We are providing solutions that meet the growing needs of society reliably and affordably. This means new products, technologies and approaches that better meet the needs of today and tomorrow. These solutions need to be deployed at scale to create meaningful impact. This requires that we fully leverage all of our competitive advantages the most important of which, is of course, our people. Continually developing our people and maintaining a strong culture is a core strategic priority and essential to achieving our long-term objectives.\n\nWe remain focused on building a diverse workforce and productive work environment where individual and cultural differences are respected, where every individual is challenged to deliver their best and has the opportunity for unrivaled personal and professional development.\n\nTo deliver on these priorities, and fully leverage our competitive advantages we continue to evolve our business model and change the way we work and are organized. We are organized along three business lines\u2014ExxonMobil Upstream Company, ExxonMobil Product Solutions and ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. These business lines are supported by a single technology organization, ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering, and other centralized service-delivery groups including Global Operations and Sustainability.\n\nMore information on our business divisions and operations can be found on our Business Divisions page.\n\n\u201cWe strive for a diverse workforce and productive work environment where individual and cultural differences are respected and valued. We challenge our people to contribute fully, demonstrate courage of conviction and adhere to the highest standards of excellence and integrity. We embrace learning, flexibility and innovation to meet society\u2019s evolving needs and outperform competition. We take pride in being part of ExxonMobil, where we work hard, have fun and live our values.\u201d\n\nDarren W.

We have continued to expand our portfolio to help meet energy demand while addressing potential impacts to the environment and society. We have improved our sustainability disclosures to increase transparency and strengthen relationships with stakeholders. In this report, we highlight our Sustainability Focus Areas and how we aim to help protect the environment and meet the needs of modern society.\n\nOur talented and dedicated workforce forms the cornerstone of our approach to sustainability: Protect Tomorrow. Today.\n\nOur focus areas\n\nOur approach to sustainability\nLeadership\nApplication\nPerformance\nOur approach to sustainability\n\nExxonMobil works to create sustainable solutions that improve quality of life and meet society\u2019s evolving needs. We intend to do this in ways that help protect people, the environment and the communities where we operate.\n\nOur advantaged portfolio of assets and products, coupled with our competitive advantages, provides flexibility for continued success across a broad range of potential scenarios. Our focus on innovation and technology, combined with supportive government policies, can further accelerate large-scale deployment of solutions essential to enabling modern life and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe plan to play a leading role in the energy transition, and we strive to accomplish this by applying the company\u2019s top strengths, which include scale, integration, technology, functional excellence and people. Building on a strong history of leadership, we are focused on achieving our aims, including our sustainability goals. This approach helps build resiliency into our business and operations.\nSustainability approach\n\nLeadership\n\nOur governance and business ethics underpin our actions and behaviors. This internal leadership drives our policies, systems, expectations and standards.\n\nApplication\n\nStrategies, capital, innovation and stakeholder engagement enable us to focus our resources and develop plans in the areas of greatest potential impact to ExxonMobil and society.\n\nPerformance\n\nExecution of plans, processes and stewardship of progress support delivery in areas of focus and drive continuous improvement.\nLeadership\n\nExxonMobil is committed to being a leading energy and chemical company, achieving strong financial and operating results and adhering to the highest ethical standards. We are dedicated to running safe and environmentally responsible operations.\n\nCorporate governance\n\nGood corporate governance creates a business environment conducive to long-term growth. Our efforts are overseen by our Board of Directors, which provides guidance to company management.\n\nEthics and integrity\n\nWe strive to always uphold high ethical standards in all aspects of our business. Our Standards of Business Conduct set the ethical conduct expectations for ExxonMobil and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Employees are reminded of these Standards of Business Conduct annually. Business practices training is required for employees every four years. ExxonMobil requires all employees, officers, directors and those working on our behalf to comply with all applicable laws.\nExxonMobil encourages employees and contractors to ask questions and voice concerns, and we insist on the reporting of any alleged violations of company policies. In addition to our open-door communication procedures, we have several confidential mechanisms for reporting. Employees can submit concerns anonymously through a 24-hour hotline or a mailing address. We respect confidentiality, subject to legal requirements, and have protections in place to prevent retaliation against any employee for submitting concerns. A hotline steering committee reviews reports of suspected violations.\n\nThe Board Audit Committee, comprised of four independent, non-employee directors, oversees accounting and internal control matters for the company, including compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee receives a quarterly report summarizing the hotline steering committee\u2019s findings, including any policy violations. Confirmed violations lead to disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. For more information on the Board Audit Committee, please see the company\u2019s annual proxy statement on our Investor Relations webpage.\n\n- Standards of Business Conduct\n- Proxy Statement\n\nPerformance and initiatives\n\nExxonMobil conducts regular internal audits and self-assessments to verify the effectiveness of our control systems and adherence to our Standards of Business Conduct. Our team of internal auditors annually reviews approximately one-third of ExxonMobil\u2019s activities and processes on a rolling basis. Internal auditors have access to all operations, records, personnel and properties. We thoroughly investigate suspected acts of noncompliance.\n\nEmployees in relevant job functions receive online and in-person training on antitrust, anti-corruption, anti-boycott, trade sanctions and export controls soon after entering their positions, as well as every year thereafter. In 2021, more than 17,000 employees and contractors participated in such training.\nOur Board of Directors\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s Board of Directors oversees the corporation\u2019s management, including its risk management. It also reviews long-term strategic plans, selects and reviews the performance of the chief executive officer (CEO), reviews development and succession plans for top executives, as well as a number of other functions. The Board is comprised of independent directors and the CEO. All members of the Audit; Nominating and Governance; Compensation; and Environment, Safety and Public Policy committees are independent. Individual directors leverage their experience and knowledge in Board and committee deliberations and Board decisions reflect the collective wisdom of the group.\n\nThe Board added five new independent directors in 2021. These new directors add to the Board\u2019s existing skillsets and expertise by providing additional experience in energy, business transition and capital allocation. Each new director participated in comprehensive onboarding sessions; these sessions included the company\u2019s history, culture, practices, risk framework, legal and regulatory requirements and ethics as well as other policies. Additional information regarding director qualifications can be found on page 18 of ExxonMobil\u2019s 2022 Proxy Statement.\n\nAn independent lead director is selected by and from the independent directors. The lead director is expected to serve for a minimum of two years. To enhance Board governance, ExxonMobil\u2019s independent lead director\u2019s board authorities were enhanced in 2020 and include leading the annual performance evaluation of the Board and its committees.\n\nThe lead director also chairs the Nominating and Governance Committee, with authorities that include establishing the criteria for director engagement with shareholders, overseeing independent director succession planning and establishing and maintaining procedures for interested parties to communicate with non-employee directors. Additionally, the lead director works together with the Compensation Committee to oversee the annual evaluation of the CEO, the communication of resulting feedback to the CEO and the review of CEO succession plans. The Board believes shareholder interests are best served through a leadership model combining the roles of Chairman of the Board and chief executive officer.\n\nAt year-end 2021, 11 of ExxonMobil\u2019s 12 directors were independent as defined by New York Stock Exchange guidelines. In 2021, the Board met 13 times. This is a greater frequency of meetings than other Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 company boards, which met on average approximately 9 times in 2021 and approximately 8 times in 2020 per the 2021 Spencer Stuart Board Index. ExxonMobil\u2019s incumbent directors, on average, attended approximately 97% of Board and committee meetings in 2021.\nBoard composition\n\nExxonMobil recognizes that the strength and effectiveness of the Board reflects the diversity of strengths and experience of the individual directors; their commitment and the ability of directors to work effectively as a group in carrying out their responsibilities. The Nominating and Governance Committee leads the Board refreshment process, which incorporates the perspectives of external experts and shareholders. Qualifications sought for director nominees are documented in the Board\u2019s Guidelines for the Selection of Non-Employee Directors.\n\nThe Board considers director longevity of service and experience to be of great value and it also recognizes the importance of director refreshment. The average tenure of our non-employee directors at year-end 2021 was 3.8 years, which was well below the 2021 average of S&P 500 companies of 7.7 years[2]. The Nominating and Governance Committee looks for highly qualified, non-employee candidates with demonstrated leadership, competency and a commitment to represent the interests of our shareholders. An independent executive search firm helps identify external candidates for consideration. The qualifications the Nominating and Governance Committee considers for director candidates include:\n\n- Prominence in their fields.\n- A diversity of experiences and backgrounds, including gender and racial/ethnic diversity.\n- Experience and demonstrated expertise in managing large, relatively complex organizations, such as that of CEOs of a significant company or organization with global responsibilities.\n- Financial and other risk management expertise.\n- Experience in government, regulatory or public policy.\n- Experience on one or more boards of significant public or nonprofit organizations.\n- Expertise resulting from significant academic, scientific or research activities.\n- Experience in the energy industry or with cyclical businesses, such as commodities.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee considers recommendations from shareholders and Board directors to help ensure the selection process is collaborative. At year-end 2021, 42% of the Board\u2019s directors were female and/or racially/ethnically diverse.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee, chaired by the independent lead director, recommends committee assignments to the full Board. These recommendations consider the tenure, skills and experiences of each director and the collective group.\n\nGuidelines for the Selection of Non-Employee Directors\nSustainability governance\n\nOur sustainability governance framework helps enable the long-term viability of our business, maintains a culture of ethical behavior and supports the sustainable development of the communities where we operate.\n\nBoard engagement on sustainability topics\n\nThe Board of Directors provides oversight of key enterprise risks to ExxonMobil\u2019s business. Throughout the year, the Board participates in reviews with management on the company\u2019s business, including identified enterprise risks.\n\nAs a whole, the Board reviews:\n\n- Long-term strategic plans.\n- Stewardship of business performance.\n- Litigation and other legal matters.\n- Political contributions, budget and policy.\n- Lobbying costs.\n- Developments in climate science and policy.\n- World energy supply and demand to 2050.\n- Approach to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of a net zero future.\n\nThe Board engages with both internal and external experts on issues of importance to the company. These reviews cover a range of topics, including climate change, research and development efforts, operating strategies, business and corporate planning, technology, current events, shareholder engagements and company performance. More detailed information is available in the company\u2019s Outlook for Energy, Advancing Climate Solutions report and this Sustainability Report, among other publications.\n\nThe independent lead director\u2019s responsibilities include engaging with shareholders, as appropriate, including on environment, social and governance (ESG) topics. The Board\u2019s Environment, Safety and Public Policy Committee oversees operational risks associated with safety, security, health and environmental performance including actions taken to address climate-related risks, lobbying activities and expenditures, and community engagement.\n\nThe Board, including the Environment, Safety and Public Policy Committee, visits an ExxonMobil site regularly. These visits enable directors to observe and provide input on safety, operating practices, environmental performance, technology, products, industry and corporate standards and community engagement.\n\nMore information on the ExxonMobil Board of Directors\nManaging sustainability\n\nThe ExxonMobil Management Committee provides ongoing oversight of sustainability with the business lines and functions, including regular assessments of strategic risks, safeguards and mitigation plans. Each year, the business lines coordinate with ExxonMobil\u2019s Global Operations and Sustainability organization to present sustainability-related goals, plans and progress.\n\nThe Management Committee consists of four members:\n\n- Darren Woods\u2014Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n- Neil Chapman\u2014Senior Vice President\n- Kathryn Mikells\u2014Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n- Jack Williams\u2014Senior Vice President\n\nThe Global Operations and Sustainability Vice President collaborates with Corporate Strategic Planning and the business lines to develop sustainability-related goals and supports the integration of those goals into operating plans. Stewardship of sustainability-related activities to the Chairman and Management Committee occurs quarterly. Within Global Operations and Sustainability, the Sustainability Director manages the focus areas and subject matter experts are responsible for identifying opportunities.\n\nMore information on the ExxonMobil Management Committee\n\nExecutive compensation\n\nThe decisions that our executives make and the risks that they manage play out over multi-year time horizons. Executives are required to carefully consider current and future risks, such as those related to climate change and to make decisions across a broad range of business investments that generate sustainable shareholder value over the long term.\n\nOur executive compensation program design aligns executives\u2019 compensation with the results of their decisions including the returns to our shareholders over the long term. The program is designed to drive long-term accountability, reward outstanding performance and promote retention.\n\nOur strategic objectives have been established to drive sustainable value while positioning ExxonMobil for long-term success in a lower-emissions future. These objectives are translated into annual goals through a comprehensive process that incorporates corporate and functional plans. Goals are incorporated in the corporate plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board and provides the framework for the organization\u2019s commitments.\n\nMore information on executive compensation can be found in the 2022 Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in the annual proxy statement\n\nProxy Statement\nWe Are ExxonMobil leadership culture\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s strong culture has underpinned our success for decades. Our culture framework, We Are ExxonMobil, articulates our core values and leadership expectations necessary to position the company for long term success. It also outlines key skills that apply to all employees.\n\nAround the world, we share a commitment to excellence in pursuit of our common goals. Our expectations steer the actions and development of our leaders to achieve business results that meet and exceed our strategic business objectives.\n\nOur culture is enabled by a strong focus on leadership and key talent systems, including performance assessment, on-the-job experience and formal training.\n\nRedesign of our formal leadership learning programs started in 2019 with implementation of the programs beginning in 2022. These courses, developed in partnership with the University of Michigan and the University of North Carolina, are designed to help our supervisors and managers fully embrace We Are ExxonMobil, connect it with our strategic priorities and unlock the full potential of our workforce.\n\nCore values\n\nIntegrity\n- Be honest and ethical\n- Do what is right\n\nCare\n- Be respectful and inclusive\n- Look after each other\n- Contribute to the well-being of our communities and the environment\n\nCourage\n- Take initiative and make a difference\n- Think boldly and act with conviction\n- Take personal ownership\n\nExcellence\n- Hold ourselves to high standards\n- Be thoughtful, thorough and disciplined\n\nResilience\n- Be determined and persevere\n- Be purposeful and steadfast in our principles\n\nExpectations of leaders\n\nSet standards\nCreate clarity\nInspire and motivate\nPromote innovation\nCompete to win\nOur policies, systems, expectations and standards\n\nThe methods we employ to attain results against our strategic priorities are as important as the results themselves. Each of our directors, officers and employees is expected to observe the highest standards of integrity.\n\nThe Board of Directors has adopted and oversees the administration of our Standards of Business Conduct, which include foundation policies covering environment, health, safety, product safety, customer relations, equal employment opportunity and harassment in the workplace. This collection of policies and standards defines the global ethical conduct of ExxonMobil and its majority-owned subsidiaries. This includes detailing our values on important matters like human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. Our directors, officers and employees are required to review these policies annually and apply them in their work.\n\nAcross ExxonMobil\u2019s global operations, we rigorously apply management systems to identify, track and report the metrics that demonstrate and guide our performance. These systems enable us to comply with regulations and provide a framework for maintaining high standards in places where applicable laws or regulations do not exist. These expectations provide the basis for managing risk and achieving excellence in each of our business lines.\n\nOur Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) establishes expectations that apply across all our operations to address risks inherent to our business, including environmental risks. The OIMS framework contains 11 elements related to leadership, operations and maintenance, community relations, emergency response, incident investigation and information and documentation, among others. It also provides protocols and guidance for mitigating risk. ExxonMobil monitors the performance of joint ventures and company assets operated by others against OIMS expectations and encourages them to consider improvements, as appropriate.\n\nEach element of OIMS contains overarching objectives and expectations. The OIMS framework also includes the characteristics of and processes for implementation.\n\nStandards of Business Conduct\nKey policies, systems and standards include:\n\n- **Controls Integrity Management System (CIMS):** CIMS is used to assess and measure financial control risks, identify mitigation procedures, monitor compliance with standards and report results to the appropriate operations and management groups within ExxonMobil.\n\n- **Sustainability Management: Environmental Aspects Guide (EAG):** The EAG establishes a consistent approach to identify, evaluate and assess environmental and socioeconomic risks resulting from our activities so these risks can be managed.\n\n- **Environmental Business Plans (EBPs):** EBPs use a corporate-wide framework to address environmental requirements and expectations as part of the annual business cycle.\n\n- **Environmental Data Management System (EDMS):** EDMS is used to collect, collate and consolidate site-level data at the corporate level to help manage environmental performance indicators globally. EDMS is being integrated with existing site-based emissions monitoring and measurement systems to enable collection of up-to-date, site-specific information.\n\n- **Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Impact Assessment (ESHIA):** The ESHIA enables a formal analysis to identify key environmental, socioeconomic and health risks and develop strategies to manage these risks through the full life cycle of an asset.\n\n- **ExxonMobil Capital Projects Management System (EMCAPS):** EMCAPS provides a framework to guide project development and execution and helps account for environmental and socioeconomic concerns and regulatory requirements.\n\n- **Global Energy Management System (GEMS):** GEMS identifies opportunities to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity in Downstream and Chemical operations, which are part of ExxonMobil Product Solutions.\n\n- **IMPACT:** IMPACT is a corporate-wide database which captures and analyzes safety and environmental data on incidents, near-misses, observations, assessment findings, lessons learned and follow-up activities.\n\n- **National Content Guidelines, Strategies and Best Practices:** This document contains the key elements of a national content strategy and plan, models and tools for the successful development of national content and roles and responsibilities at the corporate, country and project levels.\n\n- **Product Stewardship Information Management System (PSIMS):** PSIMS applies common global processes and a global computer system to capture and communicate information on the safe handling, transport, use and disposal of our products.\n\n- **Project Environmental Standards (PES):** PES identifies applicable company environmental standards for new projects, which provide environmental and social protections.\n\n- **Technology Management System:** Includes processes for technology investments that follow a gated management system from early technical innovation to final deployment.\nApplication\n\nExxonMobil has defined 14 Focus Areas to accelerate our sustainability progress. In developing these Focus Areas, we considered and analyzed our environmental and social impacts, business strategies and internal and external stakeholders.\n\nTopic selection process\n\nExxonMobil conducts assessments to identify environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics of interest to stakeholders and to enhance our understanding of current events and evolving business priorities. The results of these assessments help inform the development of our Sustainability Report.\n\nIpieca, the global oil and gas association for advancing environmental and social performance across the energy transition, defines important topics as those that, in the view of management and external stakeholders, have the potential to significantly affect ESG performance and stakeholder awareness, assessments or decisions. In 2021, we engaged a third-party consultant to conduct a robust topic selection process in line with Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry (4th edition, 2020) developed by Ipieca, the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) referred to as \u201cIpieca/API/IOGP Guidance\u201d in this report[3].\n\nSustainability reporting guidance for the oil and gas industry\nWe identified topics based on peer benchmarking, a review of leading sustainability frameworks (including those published by Ipieca, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)), and other external research. We also engaged internal and external stakeholders to gather data on our community impacts and potential impacts on stakeholders. We analyzed peer and industry reporting, regulations and media and provided data-driven insights into strategic, regulatory and reputational risks and opportunities for ExxonMobil and its stakeholders. We carefully reviewed these inputs in order to select our topics. Global Operations and Sustainability leadership reviewed and validated the results of this topic selection process and supported alignment with our Sustainability Focus Areas.\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\nWe work to foster mutual understanding, trust and cooperation with stakeholder groups on sustainability topics. We interact with these groups through community meetings, digital and social media, corporate publications and one-on-one discussions. Open dialogue enables us to hear concerns, discuss approaches and share plans. Across a range of stakeholder groups, including communities, non-governmental organizations, employees and shareholders, we continue to see broad interest in our impact on the communities we serve.\n\nSome of our primary stakeholder groups include:\n\n- Academia\n- Communities\n- Customers\n- Employees\n- External Sustainability Advisory Panel\n- Governments\n- Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)\n- Shareholders\n- Suppliers\n- Trade associations and industry groups\n\nEngagement approaches vary. Our goal is to better understand stakeholders\u2019 views. We collaborate on topics such as technical projects, potential sustainability impacts, community concerns and public policy development. ExxonMobil hosts sessions to share information on project updates, market-based approaches to sustainable matters, policy insights and updates on the company\u2019s safety, environmental and human rights practices. We also meet one-on-one with many stakeholders as part of ongoing business relationships.\nEngaging with shareholders\n\nExxonMobil is focused on creating long-term value while seeking to meet the world\u2019s growing energy needs. Responsible engagement provides an effective forum to discuss issues and share relevant information, facts and viewpoints. The Nominating and Governance Committee has established procedures for shareholders and other interested parties to communicate with Board members. Individuals can email our non-employee directors through the corporate governance page of our website. All communications are recorded by an ExxonMobil assistant secretary or designated staff member and forwarded to the appropriate director or directors or otherwise handled as the Nominating and Governance Committee has directed.\n\nEvery year, shareholders or their proxies may submit proposals regarding operations or governance. Company management and the Board consider each proposal and management seeks a dialogue with the proposal sponsor. When speaking with shareholders, we actively listen and, where possible, look to find common ground, potential for improvement and a better understanding of the issues raised. More information can be found in ExxonMobil\u2019s 2022 Proxy Statement.\n\nPerformance and initiatives\n\nExxonMobil engages with shareholders or their proxies on a range of issues. Since 2016, we have more than doubled the number of sessions we hold on ESG issues with institutional investors, pension funds and labor, religious and nongovernmental organizations. In 2021, we held approximately 145 of these sessions with shareholders owning nearly 1.7 billion shares. The sessions comprise an estimated 77% of outstanding stock held by institutional investors and about 41% of total shares outstanding. These shareholder engagements can often eliminate the need for more formal shareholder proposals at the annual shareholders meeting.\n\nAt the 2022 annual meeting, shareholders owning approximately 3.4 billion outstanding shares, or over 80%, were represented. In 2022, shareholders voted on 10 issues, including seven shareholder proposals. More information on the voting outcomes can be found in the 2022 proxy voting results.\n\nProxy Voting Results\nEngaging with governments\n\nExxonMobil believes that sound public policy should include input from a variety of stakeholders. We recognize policy decisions made at all levels of government can have significant effects on our current and future operations. We support sound policies promoting economic growth and stable investment for long-term business viability.\n\nAs sound government policies are required and can act as an accelerator for lower-emission alternatives, ExxonMobil actively participates in climate-related policy discussions around the world.\n\nThe company focuses on practical policy solutions that recognize the increasing global demand for affordable and reliable energy while enabling scalable development and deployment of lower- and zero- greenhouse gas emission technologies.\n\nDurable and predictable market-driven policies can further encourage these developments and increase investments in lower-emission technologies to help achieve the Paris Agreement goals at the lowest cost to society.\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s positions on climate, including its Scopes 1 and 2 net-zero 2050 ambition from operated assets, and other key issues are available at our website and in our Advancing Climate Solutions\u20142023 Progress Report, along with our annual proxy statement, press releases and the Exxchange, ExxonMobil\u2019s online advocacy hub. Our lobbying and political contributions are aligned with these positions.\n\nU.S. lobbying expenses\n\nExxonMobil undertakes lobbying to advocate positions on issues that affect the company, the energy industry and competitive free markets. ExxonMobil has a rigorous process to determine which public policy issues are of most importance to the corporation.\n\nExxonMobil also produces a Report on Lobbying, which lists all U.S. organizations of which ExxonMobil or its affiliates are members, membership fees and portions used for lobbying, along with amounts. The report also includes an accounting of the company\u2019s direct lobbying and grassroots lobbying. ExxonMobil fully complies with federal and state regulations by reporting its federal lobbying to the U.S. Congress and state-level lobbying to appropriate entities, as required. ExxonMobil publicly reports, on a quarterly basis, its federal lobbying expenses and the specific issues lobbied. The total figure reported in ExxonMobil\u2019s public Lobbying Disclosure Act filings includes expenses associated with the costs of employee federal lobbying, as well as those portions of payments to trade associations, coalitions and think tanks spent on federal lobbying.\n\nThis process, along with the oversight of our lobbying and political engagement, can be found on our website.\n\n- ExxonMobil report on lobbying activities\n- 2020 Lobbying Report\nPolitical contributions\n\nThe Board of Directors has authorized ExxonMobil to make political contributions to candidate committees and other political organizations as permitted by applicable laws. The Board annually reviews ExxonMobil\u2019s political contributions, as well as contributions from the company-sponsored Political Action Committee (PAC). Internal audits of the corporation\u2019s public and government affairs activities routinely verify contribution amounts.\n\nAs required of U.S. federal contractors by law, ExxonMobil has not used corporate treasury funds to support any federal candidates, national political parties or other political committees, including Super Political Action Committees. ExxonMobil has chosen not to use treasury funds or PAC funds for direct independent political expenditures at the federal level, including electioneering communications.\n\nEligible employees and shareholders may participate in the U.S. political process by contributing to a voluntary, company-sponsored, federal PAC. ExxonMobil reports PAC contributions to the U.S. Federal Election Commission every month.\n\nPerformance and initiatives\n\nIn 2021, ExxonMobil contributed $300,000 in support of five national political organizations of state officials. In addition, the company contributed $222,000 in election support to 197 state-level candidates and six committees in six U.S. states. Contributions are reported to applicable governing agencies and on our website.\n\nTransparency in payments to governments\n\nWe believe that disclosing relevant payments to governments is an important tool to reduce corruption, improve government accountability and promote greater economic stability worldwide. We consider the most successful transparency initiatives to be those that:\n\n- Apply to all foreign, domestic and state-owned companies.\n- Protect proprietary information to promote commercial competitiveness.\n- Comply with international trade conventions and treaties.\n- Do not violate host government laws or contractual obligations.\nOur Sustainability Focus Areas\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s 14 Sustainability Focus Areas articulate sustainability in the context of our business.

Our objectives and strategies ensure a consistent approach across the company while empowering our business lines to take action and advance our sustainability priorities.\n\nCommunicating progress\n\nExxonMobil publishes several comprehensive reports annually to provide insights into how we create value through our integrated businesses and how we manage associated risks, opportunities and impacts.\n\n- Our Advancing Climate Solutions\u20142023 Progress Report outlines our work toward a lower-emission future.\n- Our Outlook for Energy is our view of global energy demand and supply, which helps inform our long-term business strategies, energy and energy transition investment plans and research programs.\n- Our Annual Report provides information on our prior-year operating and financial performance while highlighting our advantaged portfolio and competitive strengths in technology, scale, integration, functional excellence and people that enable us to create value.\n- Our Sustainability Report details our approach to managing ESG topics across our operations and describes our performance in these areas.\nSupporting the United Nations\n\nThe United Nations has adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve progress on global economic, social and environmental challenges by 2030. Although the goals are directed at governments, the private sector and civil society play an important role in supporting national plans. ExxonMobil supports governments\u2019 efforts to meet the SDGs.\n\nMost notably our aim to create sustainable solutions that improve quality of life and meet society\u2019s evolving needs, supports progress toward U.N. SDG 7, \u201cEnsure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy.\u201d Our business and sustainability efforts enable ExxonMobil to help advance prosperity and power economies through the supply of reliable and affordable energy and products. Energy and human development are inextricably linked; access to energy and essential products enables both economic and social progress through improved living standards and opportunities. Far too many people still do not have access to modern energy and products. ExxonMobil is well positioned to contribute to supplying the energy and products the world needs and to play a leading role in a lower-emissions future.\n\nAs we continue to help supply this energy, we also support progress toward SDG 13, \u201cTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\u201d We work to provide innovative solutions that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our operated assets, help customers reduce their emissions and develop and deploy scalable technologies to help decarbonize high-emitting sectors. These actions support our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction plans and our net-zero by 2050 ambition concerning Scope 1 and 2 emissions at operated assets. These actions are supported by our plans to invest approximately $17 billion through 2027 on lower greenhouse gas emission initiatives. A significant share is focused on scaling up carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels opportunities that underpin our Low Carbon Solutions business.\n\nThe ExxonMobil Product Solutions portfolio also supports progress toward SDG 12, \u201cEnsure sustainable consumption and production patterns.\u201d Our Product Solutions business provides materials used in the production of solutions across health care and medical, agricultural, food and beverage packaging and other applications. We are advancing infrastructure and technology for collecting, sorting and processing discarded plastics, which includes our plans to build approximately 500,000 metric tons annually of advanced recycling capacity by year-end 2026 across multiple sites. Advanced recycling enables a broader range of plastic waste to be recycled back into high-value raw materials.\nExxonMobil\u2019s Advancing Climate Solutions Progress Report outlines the company\u2019s approach to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of a net-zero future. The full Advancing Climate Solutions 2023 Progress Report can be found on our website, including important cautionary statements.\n\nAs the world continues to face the challenge of securing adequate energy supply while ensuring the energy transition proceeds at pace\u2014divergent views have emerged. There are some who believe that society\u2019s efforts should be solely directed toward the energy transition without considering the very real consequences of not ensuring energy security. ExxonMobil and others see the situation for what it is: There are two challenges of great importance, both necessitating the full cooperation and effort of companies, governments and NGOs worldwide in order to address these critical issues.\n\nIn this edition of our Advancing Climate Solutions Progress Report, we share the ways in which ExxonMobil remains determined to tackle head-on the challenges of strengthening energy supply security and reducing emissions to support a net-zero future while growing value for our shareholders and stakeholders. We discuss the ways we will continue delivering solutions that lower the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our portfolio and help meet society\u2019s growing need for affordable and reliable energy and products.\n\n[Advancing Climate Solutions\u20142023 Progress Report]\nOur approach\n\nOur diverse portfolio includes projects in remote and sensitive environments, such as deep water environments and areas of high biodiversity.\n\nOur environmental management approach is guided by an understanding of the potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts of our operations and a commitment to develop, maintain and operate projects responsibly, using appropriate standards that enable us to Protect Tomorrow. Today.\n\nOur focus areas\n\nManaging environmental performance and compliance \u2192\nReducing impacts to land and habitats \u2192\nConserving water resources \u2192\nImproving air quality \u2192\nMinimizing operational waste \u2192\n\nProgressing environmental initiatives\nManaging environmental performance and compliance\n\nWe strive to be a leader in environmental management. We evaluate risks at each stage of a project to mitigate environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Our Corporate Ethics Policy is to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and we apply standards designed to minimize risks to the environment and society where applicable laws and regulations do not exist.\n\nProtect Tomorrow. Today, is our guiding principle, focusing our efforts on the need to protect the environment where we operate and support the social and economic needs of the community today and for future generations. This principle embodies the environmental expectations and globally accepted industry practices that guide our day-to-day operations.\n\nOur approach to managing environmental performance\nPerformance and initiatives\n\nOIMS conforms to environmental standards, including International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 and American Chemistry Council Responsible Care\u00ae requirements. ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Company (now part of ExxonMobil Product Solutions Company) is ISO 14001-certified at its global network of more than 20 lubricant plants. The ISO certification confirms OIMS effectiveness in managing potential environmental impacts and compliance obligations.\n\nSuccessful project execution requires deep insights into the environmental and socioeconomic characteristics of the areas where we operate. We typically perform an Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Impact Assessment for major capital projects. We use our Environmental Aspects Guide to identify and evaluate environmental and socioeconomic risks and impacts throughout the life of each asset or project. Then we develop management plans to avoid, reduce or address them. We integrate stakeholder feedback as part of our assessments, including those of local communities and stakeholders.\n\n- International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001\n- American Chemistry Council Responsible Care\u00ae\n- Environmental Aspects Guide\n\nLeading sustainability in Guyana\n\nEverywhere we operate, our fundamental goal is to reduce environmental incidents to zero through continuous improvement of our operation standards and practices. We apply international standards and practices which often go beyond local compliance requirements. The Liza Unity floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, built for our affiliate\u2019s operations in the Stabroek Block in Guyana, is the first FPSO in the world to be awarded the SUSTAIN-1 notation by the Classification Society American Bureau of Shipping (ABS).\n\nTo be awarded the SUSTAIN-1 notation, a vessel must align with key elements of the ESG requirements outlined in the SDGs and adhere to the requirements of the ABS Guide for Sustainability Notations. This guide covers sustainability aspects of the asset design, outfitting and layout, including pollution, energy use, recycling, coastal and marine ecosystems and human-centered design. We are pleased with the progress we have made in Guyana, and this notation represents yet another important step in our efforts to provide safe and responsible energy to society.\n\n- SUSTAIN-1 notation\n- American Bureau of Shipping\n- ABS Guide for Sustainability Notations\nReducing impacts to land and habitats\n\nThe way we manage land and habitats, and their effect on biodiversity, is critical to the communities in which we operate. ExxonMobil works to mitigate potential impacts to ecosystems and the value those ecosystems provide. In new projects and ongoing operations, we build land and habitat management plans featuring protective measures specific to the location and scale of operations.\n\nExxonMobil employs a comprehensive process to understand how our activities interact with the environmental settings. We operate in locations with a broad range of environmental and socioeconomic conditions and use a robust environmental management system to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor impacts on the environment, including potential effects on biodiversity and the value particular ecosystems provide.\n\nFor major projects, we use an Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment process to identify and evaluate environmental, social and health risks. We also use an Environmental Business Planning process to identify, assess and establish solutions to environmental issues (e.g., potential mitigation measures) throughout the life of the asset.\n\nMore information on Land and Habitat programs, including Project Environmental Standards, how we operate near protected areas, and how we think about land management can be found on our website.\n\nOur approach to reducing impacts to land and habitats\nManaging biodiversity in Papua New Guinea\n\nPapua New Guinea (PNG) is home to vast natural gas resources and more than 200,000 plant and animal species. The PNG LNG Project, of which ExxonMobil PNG Limited is the operator, has operations that encompass many areas of high biodiversity significance and conservation value.\n\nTo assess and manage potential long-term impacts on biodiversity, ExxonMobil PNG Limited has developed a biodiversity strategy that includes an offset program, an implementation and monitoring program and programmed monitoring activities (PMAs).\n\nSome of the notable activities in 2021 include:\n\n- For the first time, a field team of Papua New Guinean fauna experts completed the biennial biodiversity survey in the project\u2019s Upstream area. Expatriate scientists led the previous surveys with support from PNG students and citizens. In 2021, ExxonMobil PNG Limited decided that PMAs would be led by and include only national scientists, with remote support from expatriates. The PNG team leads for the 2021 survey had participated in the surveys since 2015, gaining knowledge and helping build the PNG scientific community.\n\n- An assessment to verify 2020 annual forest cover changes against 2019 data in the Upstream area after construction activities concluded that the identified broad-scale forest loss or degradation was not attributable to ExxonMobil PNG Limited\u2019s activities. Many of the detected disturbances came from a local tradition of landowners setting up shelters or gardens closer to project facilities or the pipeline right-of-way to symbolize their ownership.\n\n- ExxonMobil PNG Limited\u2019s awareness programs, community messaging and engagements with local communities help them gain an understanding of biodiversity values and importance of conservation. The awareness and training have been provided to communities, community leaders and village liaison officers.\n\nThe annual Environmental and Social Report for 2021 discusses the performance of the PNG LNG biodiversity management program in detail.\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s work in Papua New Guinea provides lower-emission energy to Asian markets, supports economic growth and community development within the country, and operates in a way that respects and sustains the biodiversity of the region.\n\n[Environmental and Social Report for 2021]\nConserving water resources\n\nWe value water as an essential resource for human development and for the support of the world\u2019s ecosystem. That is why ExxonMobil works to manage water resources used in our operations, in a manner that helps protect human health and the environment. We strive to be a leader in safeguarding water resources, and we try to understand water stress at the local level, as well as the potential impact of our operations. We also endeavor to integrate this understanding into our project design and operational practices.\n\nOur team works to minimize the potential impact of our operations, especially in areas of water stress, as defined by measuring the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable water supplies. We aim to integrate this understanding into operational practices and project design, which includes adding technology applications focused on water management.\n\nWhen sourcing water for our operations, ExxonMobil identifies and manages risks related to supply and quality. We regularly review our consumption and look for ways to use water more efficiently. ExxonMobil is piloting a tool to further enhance our understanding of risks associated with water, including wastewater discharge, water quality and supply and proximity to environmentally sensitive areas.\n\nMore information on water programs, including site-specific strategies and strategic collaborations can be found on our website.\nSaving water in the Permian\n\nThe Permian Basin remains an important strategic area of U.S. oil and gas production, representing more than 40% of ExxonMobil\u2019s U.S. net production. It is an area of water stress. As we work to maximize the value of our competitive position in the Permian, we are working to safeguard the Permian\u2019s water sources, including availability and quality.\n\nIn 2021, we implemented a comprehensive water management roadmap for the next 10 years of Permian development to manage potential future risks and uncertainties related to water sourcing, production, transport, reuse and disposal. We considered and cataloged a range of water supply, demand and disposal scenarios to understand the potential implications and opportunities for our Permian operations. While we operate in various locations within the Permian, this work has helped us identify site-specific management strategies that best meet the needs and limitations of each area. To minimize the potential impacts of water withdrawal, consumption, and discharges, we are implementing water recycling and sharing initiatives, increasing advocacy and industry engagement on water-related issues, and piloting and commercializing technologies to accelerate progress.\n\nThese efforts are intended to increase the availability and quality of water within the Permian region, help us manage our water-related risks and position us for long-term success. Focusing on effective water management, we currently utilize only recycled or brackish water sources for our Permian hydraulic fracturing operations. In 2021, we recycled nearly 100 million barrels of water, which enabled us to offset almost half of our water needs for fracking operations.\nSupporting the NFWF Pecos Watershed Initiative[7]\n\nExxonMobil is a proud member of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation\u2019s Pecos Watershed Conservation Initiative (PWCI). The PWCI is an innovative public-private collaboration to support both water and land habitats. Participants have invested more than $8 million to support 43 projects across the Permian Basin from southeastern New Mexico to West Texas.\n\nThe PWCI works on conservation projects to bolster the health of habitats within the Pecos Watershed, including:\n\n- Improved management of native grasslands.\n- Protection of endangered native fish and aquatic species unique to the Chihuahuan Desert.\n- Repopulation of areas with species that have previously been lost.\n\nThe PWCI also supports programs that improve water quality and availability for both wildlife and agricultural purposes. We sponsor this work to support the health and sustainability of ecosystems within the Pecos Watershed.\nManaging spills\n\nExxonMobil is committed to the prevention and elimination of spills from our operations. We seek to implement industry best practices to continually reduce the number of spills. We design and operate facilities with the objective of preventing unplanned releases from entering the environment and causing adverse effects.\n\nOur Spill Prevention Program establishes corporate-wide procedures for inspecting and maintaining equipment, training operators and conducting practice drills. If a spill does occur, we conduct a rapid, comprehensive response to minimize impact on communities and the environment. Our spill response research program is an industry-leading in-house program with a focus on cold-water and remote locations that also applies to local or surface spills.\n\nAt ExxonMobil refineries, we recently enhanced the existing human factors approach to reinforce the zero-spill mindset among employees. Specialists developed a best practice guide that outlines 17 high-risk elements and corresponding procedures designed to reduce the likelihood of a spill caused by human error. This guide is credited with reducing such spills by more than 36% from 2016 to 2021.\n\nExxonMobil uses comprehensive integrity-management programs to oversee the transportation of millions of barrels of petroleum and chemical products over thousands of miles of pipeline around the world. For example, our pipeline affiliate in the U.S. regularly tests its pipelines to detect corrosion and other integrity concerns and uses skilled personnel in ground and air patrols, state-of-the-art systems, alarms and other techniques to continuously control and monitor pipeline routes.\n\nIn addition to prevention, we focus on maintaining a state of readiness to quickly and effectively respond to incidents resulting from our operations. To ensure that a response to an incident will be coordinated and effective, each site conducts emergency drills in accordance with regulatory requirements or management guidelines, ranging from \u201cdesktop\u201d exercises to full-scale field drills. Annually, we conduct comprehensive multi-day drills at sites around the world, involving emergency response teams and hundreds of employees, contractors and specialists. Participants run through realistic scenarios and interact with local authorities and agencies.\nImproving air quality\n\nExxonMobil recognizes the importance of clean air to our communities and implements emission-reduction initiatives, including those that reduce nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds at our operated assets. From 2016 to 2021, total reportable emissions of volatile organic compounds, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides decreased by approximately 24% at operated assets.\n\nAs part of our approach to improving air quality, we evaluate the potential impact of our emissions to the communities where we operate. Based on these insights, we advance appropriate capital projects and initiatives while working with regulatory agencies to assess and address potential air quality issues.\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s approach to air quality management includes:\n\n- Understanding the composition and extent of our emissions.\n- Meeting or exceeding environmental regulations.\n- Reducing air emissions to minimize potential impacts on local communities.\n- Monitoring the science and health standards related to air quality.\n\nOur corporate-wide initiatives to reduce GHG emissions intensity also have the potential to further improve air quality by lowering non-GHG emissions.\n\nOur approach to improving air quality\nMinimizing operational waste\n\nEveryone at ExxonMobil plays a role in reducing operational waste. Our \u201cwaste mitigation hierarchy\u201d prioritizes waste avoidance when feasible and when waste is unavoidable, we work to reduce, recover or reuse it whenever possible.\n\nWe aim to dispose of waste only if other options have been exhausted and we have robust processes to select waste sites that meet our high standards and expectations. Our global network of lubricants blending and packaging plants have a Zero Waste to Landfill Silver validation from Underwriters Laboratories (UL). We were the first petroleum products company to receive this status by diverting over 90% of waste produced in our global plant network from local landfills.\n\nOur objective is to continuously look for ways to minimize waste through practices like process changes; raw material changes; material handling, storage, transportation; as well as treatment and/or disposal of any remaining waste in compliance with applicable regulations. To do that, we utilize a waste mitigation hierarchy that starts with waste avoidance.\n\nUnderwriters Laboratories\nDecommissioning and rehabilitation\n\nDecommissioning is the process of dismantling, removing and/or reusing facilities. ExxonMobil\u2019s approach to decommissioning assets varies by location, type of asset and environmental characteristics of the site. We incorporate applicable regulatory requirements and globally accepted practices and take into account views expressed by relevant stakeholders, including fishing communities, environmental organizations, recycling experts and academia.\n\nDecommissioning an offshore asset presents complex challenges. In addition to the inherent risks of removal, our plans must consider each asset\u2019s specific marine ecosystems and facility characteristics, including complexity, size and weight. Planning and preparation for decommissioning assets can start up to 10 years before execution, and ExxonMobil has a dedicated offshore decommissioning Center of Expertise for this purpose.\n\nInstead of decommissioning an asset, the company may choose to rehabilitate it. Rehabilitation is the process of safely repurposing properties that no longer support our operations. We consider the interests of various stakeholders when selecting site-specific approaches to repurpose properties. Our goal is to prevent legacy impacts on the environment while creating opportunities for beneficial reuse. ExxonMobil Environmental and Property Solutions (E&PS) is our global organization that supports the remediation and stewardship of surplus onshore sites.\n\nMore information on waste programs, including project waste management standards and waste site audits, can be found on our website.\n\n\u2610 Our approach to minimizing operational waste\nCreating sustainable solutions\n\nOur approach\n\nAround the world, ExxonMobil aims to be a preferred business partner, neighbor, employer and supplier.\n\nExxonMobil is committed to creating sustainable solutions that improve quality of life and meet society\u2019s evolving needs in ways that help protect people, the environment and the communities where we operate.\n\nOur focus areas\n\nProgressing product safety \u2192\nExpanding the plastics life cycle \u2192\nExcerpt: Delivering economic benefits \u2192\nProgressing product safety\n\nExxonMobil aims to provide the energy and products the world needs in a way that protects human health and the environment. Our scientists and product stewardship professionals collaborate with industry and academic researchers, regulatory bodies and policy makers to help ensure that the best available science informs industry product safety policy. We apply rigorous processes and standards, including updating and translating annually approximately 86,000 safety data sheets listing risks and proper use of products. In 2021, we continued our strong performance in our Fuels, Lubricants and Chemicals businesses with zero high-consequence product stewardship-related incidents, a key internal metric.\n\nExxonMobil works to mitigate potential impacts of our products by factoring relevant health, environmental exposure and use data into our development process and communications with employees and customers. We strive to identify and manage risks associated with our products, and to avoid manufacture or sale of products when it is not possible to provide an appropriate level of safety through proper design, procedures and practices.\n\nOur focused objective is to identify and manage risk associated with our products and to provide the appropriate level of safety for people and the environment. Please see our Product Safety Policy to more fully understand our approach to health, safety and environmental management of our products.\n\nMore information on product safety, including product standards, safe handling and strategic relationships can be found on our website.\n\n- Our approach to progressing product safety\n- Product Safety Policy (page 15)\nExpanding the plastics life cycle\n\nPlastics play a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enabling modern life. They also play an important role in our portfolio. That is why we are focused on providing the products the world needs while working to develop and deploy solutions to reduce plastic waste. To this end, we have started up our first, large-scale advanced recycling facility and are progressing activities throughout the world with the expectation to have about 1 billion pounds of annual advanced recycling capacity by year-end 2026.\n\nPlastics are increasingly one of society\u2019s materials of choice because of their superior performance, affordability and life-cycle benefits compared to alternatives. Step into any hospital, kitchen, daycare center, science lab, airplane or automobile, and you will find abundant examples of critical plastic products. The plastics found in cell phones, computers, vehicles, packaging, surgical devices, personal protective equipment, facemasks and many other applications provide countless benefits as well.\n\nFrom our operations, our goal is to continue experiencing zero pellet loss to the environment. Although laws and regulations related to the reporting of plastic pellet loss to the environment vary by jurisdiction, ExxonMobil adopted a global standard across our resin-handling facilities. Because of these efforts, ExxonMobil had no reportable plastic pellet losses from our resin-handling facilities in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nMore information on plastics life-cycle, including Advanced Recycling and strategic collaborations, can be found on our website.\nExcerpt: Delivering economic benefits\n\nEnergy and human development are tightly linked, with energy demand up 15% to support rising human development in the developing world.\n\nAccess to affordable and reliable energy has enabled billions of people to live longer, healthier lives. Yet many more can\u2019t count on having clean cooking fuel or electricity, especially in developing countries which represent more than 80% of the world\u2019s people. As they gain access to energy and improve their living standards, they will create the largest expansion of the global middle class in history. That means more demand for energy to power homes, transportation and consumer goods.\nGlobal fundamentals\n\nEnergy is essential for human progress. Economic expansion and improving access to energy enable longer, more productive lives for the growing global population.\n\nA deep understanding of long-term energy fundamentals underpins ExxonMobil\u2019s business planning.\n\nThese fundamentals include energy supply and demand trends; the scale and variety of energy needs worldwide; capability, practicality and affordability of energy alternatives including lower-emission solutions; greenhouse gas emission-reduction technologies; and supportive government policies. The ExxonMobil Outlook for Energy (\u201cOutlook\u201d) considers these fundamentals to form the basis for long-term business planning, investment decisions, and research programs.\n\nThe Outlook reflects our view of global energy demand and supply through 2050. It is based on current and expected trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics and economic development.\n\nMore information can be found in ExxonMobil\u2019s Outlook for Energy.\n\n[Outlook for Energy]\nEngaging communities and our supply chain\n\nOur approach\nExxonMobil is committed to being a good corporate citizen in the places we operate worldwide.\n\nWe work to safeguard the health and security of our employees and the public, responsibly manage our social impacts, and uphold respect for human rights in our operations.

During employment, employees are reminded of the Standards of Business Conduct annually. Business practices training is required for employees every four years. This includes training on select foundation policies such as Ethics, as well as complaint procedures and open-door communication. Our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries generally adopt policies similar to our foundation policies and provide similar training.\n\nHuman rights-related training\n\nDue diligence\n\nOur practices support early identification and assessment of potential human rights impacts, along with other socioeconomic impacts and opportunities associated with our activities. We work to avoid or reduce any human rights or socioeconomic risk through comprehensive planning, effective mitigation, monitoring and other measures. As part of our Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Impact Assessment and Management process we conduct initial country assessments that include early identification of qualitative human rights risks. We also apply a human rights risk screening tool to support our analysis of these potential risks at country, project and operation levels, incorporating elements aligned with key global human rights principles.\n\nOur socioeconomic management practices are guided by our corporate Environmental Aspects Guide (EAG) and consistent with our Environment Policy and Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).\n\nEnvironmental Aspects Guide (EAG)\n\nAccess to remedy\n\nConsistent with international standards, we help provide effective, accessible and culturally appropriate channels for individuals or communities to raise concerns in a way that seeks to support confidentiality and non-retaliation. We make these available through our community and operations-level grievance management processes, as well as our complaint procedures and open-door communication for employees.\n\nMore information can be found on our website on how our processes and practices for stakeholder engagement and grievance management support our integrated approach to human rights and access to remedy.\n\nOur approach to managing community engagement and grievances\n\nStrategic elements\n\nCommunities and people\n\nOur goal is to maximize benefits of our business to local communities and to appropriately manage environmental, socioeconomic and health risks. Our socioeconomic management practices support our integrated approach to respecting human rights and include elements such as community health, safety and security; local economic development; land use, resettlement and livelihood restoration; cultural heritage and Indigenous peoples.\n\nOur approach to socioeconomic management\n\nSecurity\n\nSince 2002, ExxonMobil has been a member of the Voluntary Principles Initiative, a multi-stakeholder effort supporting the implementation of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Our standard security services contracts include provisions, where appropriate, requiring training for security personnel on expectations and responsibilities associated with one or more of the goals articulated in international principles, local laws and regulations.\n\nOur approach to security and human rights\nWorkforce and suppliers\n\nWe respect the human rights of our workforce through our focus on workforce development, safety, security and health, as well as our procedures for complaints and open-door communication. We use an integrated, risk-based due diligence approach that focuses on workplace rights and leverages our current practices and systems to identify, assess and manage potential human rights risks within our supply chain.\n\nMore information on our integrated, risk-based due diligence approach to supply chain human rights can be found on our website.\n\nHow we measure our performance\n\nTo monitor our effectiveness, we have processes to track performance. We also do the following:\n\nWe continue to actively engage with evolving international initiatives.\n\n- In 2020 and 2021, ExxonMobil helped develop the new edition of the Human Rights Due Diligence Guide, the Labour Rights Risk Identification in the Supply Chain, and the Supply Chain Library of Questions and Resources, all published by Ipieca.\n\nOver the past several years, we have provided the following training to reinforce our respect for human rights:\n\n- Since 2016, we have supported the development and delivery of training on the goals of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights for more than 40,000 security service providers and members of government security forces.\n\n- Since 2016, more than 700 procurement employees have received training tailored to procurement professionals to help improve their understanding of human rights in the supply chain.\n\n- Over the past several years, computer-based human rights awareness training has been available to company employees, including professionals in the Procurement function, to improve their understanding of human rights issues and awareness of potential human rights risks.\n\nKey examples of our disclosures and compliance with laws and regulations related to human rights include:\n\n- In accordance with the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015, the Australia Modern Slavery Act of 2018 and the Norway Transparency Act of 2022, our U.K., Australia and Norway affiliates prepared an Annual Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, a Modern Slavery Statement, respectively.\n\n- Our annual conflict minerals filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provides disclosures regarding supply sources of gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum.\nOur communities\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s Environment Policy and the Protect Tomorrow. Today. guiding principle serve as the foundation of our efforts, which are informed by a scientific understanding of the environmental impact of our operations, as well as an understanding of the social and economic needs of the communities in which we operate. We seek to contribute to the social and economic progress of these communities and believe that respecting human rights, managing our impacts on communities and making valued social investments are integral to the success of our business.\n\nManaging socioeconomic impacts\n\nOur integrated socioeconomic management approach supports the early identification of potential socioeconomic impacts and opportunities, including human rights, as well as the comprehensive planning and effective implementation of measures and advancements that avoid, reduce or remedy risks from our operations.\n\nThe core socioeconomic elements of our integrated approach include identification and assessment of potential impacts; human rights; community engagement and grievance management; community health and safety; local economic development; land use, resettlement and livelihood restoration; cultural heritage; and Indigenous peoples. These elements are often interconnected and are best managed in an integrated manner to develop effective approaches to managing risks and opportunities in a broad range of settings.\nImpact identification and assessment\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s projects and operations around the world provide socioeconomic benefits within and beyond the communities where we operate. While there are inherent risks in any type of development or operation, we seek to avoid those risks, reduce them to acceptable levels, or remedy the impacts.\n\nOur corporate Environmental Aspects Guide addresses identification and assessment of significant environmental and socioeconomic aspects consistent with our Environment Policy.\n\nWe use core processes to systematically identify, assess, manage and monitor environmental and socioeconomic risks and opportunities throughout the life cycles of our assets including:\n\n- Environmental Aspects Assessment.\n- Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Impact Assessment.\n- Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Management Plans.\n\nWe engage with local communities and stakeholders to incorporate feedback, scientific understanding and other due diligence into these processes to enable safe and responsible operations. We periodically update these assessments to reflect any changes to operational complexity or socioeconomic sensitivities, amending management plans where needed.\n\nCommunity health, safety and security\n\nWe integrate community health, safety and security elements into our impact assessments as a key component of our socioeconomic management approach. Where appropriate, our Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Management Plans include Community Health, Safety and Security Plans.\n\nFor example, in Papua New Guinea, our Community Health, Safety and Security Management Plan includes a summary of the identified risks, as well as mitigation and management measures. It also includes the monitoring required to determine the effectiveness of these measures. The plan considers risks, including those associated with road traffic; vector-related diseases; soil, water and sanitation-related diseases and cultural health practices.\n\n- Our approach to community health, safety and security\n\n- Environmental Aspects Guide (EAG)\n- Our approach to impact identification and assessment\nCommunity engagement and grievance management\n\nExxonMobil works collaboratively and transparently with local communities to promote positive, long-term relationships.\n\nWe consult with local groups and individuals regularly and we seek to have our stakeholders effectively represented as community concerns are discussed and decisions are made. Our engagement process is tailored to local communities to help provide effective, accessible and culturally appropriate channels for exchanging information and proactively identifying issues or concerns. Examples of activities in our engagement process include open houses, community gatherings and individual meetings.\n\nBy integrating the results of these discussions into our decisions, we can help avoid or reduce potential impacts on communities, enhance benefits, support effective investments, avoid delays and resolve issues at the local level.\n\nOur ongoing community engagement includes a grievance-management process that provides a diverse set of platforms for individuals or communities to raise concerns. They include direct, in-person and electronic engagement and the use of third-party proxies such as civil society organizations and nongovernmental associations. We dedicate personnel to map, track, analyze, respond to and resolve community grievances in a timely manner in a way that seeks to support confidentiality and non-retaliation.\n\nOur grievance management practices are guided by the World Bank International Finance Corporation and Ipieca. For more information on how our process and practices for stakeholder engagement and grievance management support our integrated approach to human rights due diligence, see the section on Human Rights.\n\n- World Bank International Finance Corporation\n- Our approach to managing community engagement and grievances\nLocal economic development\n\nExxonMobil works closely with local communities to understand the unique needs of the areas where we operate and to identify and help contribute to long-term, positive local economic and social development. Our approach to local economic development integrates local content and local community investment into project planning, execution and operations.\n\nLocal content\n\nHiring locally helps us meet our staffing needs and advances local economic development and education. We aim to enhance the long-term capability of the local workforce. Our approach includes recruitment, training and succession planning for national employees. We hire local individuals and help them develop technical and leadership skills that will benefit them throughout their careers, with ExxonMobil or future employers. Our development program includes training in relevant technical and vocational skills, health and safety, environmental protection, management skills and business conduct.\n\nWe understand the importance of building and maintaining a qualified and competitive supply chain in the countries in which we operate. Our approach to local supplier development and utilization includes purchasing goods and services from local suppliers and building their capabilities to help create a competitive local industrial base.\n\nWe work with a range of stakeholders, including host country governments, nongovernmental organizations and local communities to support the development of local vendors. To become a supplier for ExxonMobil a local vendor must meet our robust safety, technical, environmental and human rights expectations and requirements. When possible, we work with businesses owned by local individuals, women and members of historically disadvantaged communities to help them become competitive vendors that contribute to our business and the long-term economic progress of the community.\n\nInvestments in local communities\n\nWe support economic development of local communities with our investments. We engage and collaborate with community members, stakeholders and host governments to develop meaningful projects that help build and sustain economic growth while improving social conditions. We consider the development goals of each community when deciding where, when and how best to invest.\n\nIn addition to investments in local capacity building, ExxonMobil contributes to voluntary social investments worldwide. For more information on our global contributions including donations from the ExxonMobil Corporation, visit our 2021 Worldwide Giving Report.\n\nMore information on ExxonMobil\u2019s approach to local content can be found on our website. Additional information on workforce and Supply Chain Management can be found in our Investing in People report, and Supply Chain Management, respectively.\nGuyana workforce development\n\nFor example, in Guyana, providing opportunities for local hiring and workforce development is a vital part of our commitment to enhancing the economic and social benefits associated with our activities. Our strategy to develop a diverse and talented workforce has two components\u2014the recruitment and development of Guyanese personnel who can play a role in our local operations, and the continued development of a global pool of talent capable of meeting our future business needs wherever we operate. We apply proven training curriculums, industry best practices and leading technology to support local workforce development. There were over 4,400 Guyanese supporting ExxonMobil\u2019s Guyana affiliate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Ltd. (EEPGL) oil and gas activities in Guyana during the first half of 2022, representing approximately 64% of the total number of people supporting those activities.\n\nLand use, resettlement and livelihood restoration\n\nWe respect property rights in the countries and communities where we operate. We aim to minimize involuntary resettlement through a disciplined site selection process.\n\nWhenever land is necessary for projects, we adhere to applicable host country regulatory requirements governing land acquisition, in addition to our own internal standards. If projects are externally financed, we also adhere to lender stipulations regarding land use, access and resettlement requirements.\n\nTo the extent practicable, we seek to avoid involuntary resettlement and minimize the need for voluntary resettlement. To minimize the need for resettlement we assess multiple potential locations for our operations based on criteria such as availability, accessibility and safety, as well as environmental and social considerations.\n\nIf physical or economic displacement occurs, we develop and implement location-specific and culturally appropriate resettlement action plans (RAPs). We consult with landowners and other potentially impacted individuals or households. We survey and map housing structures, gardens, wildlife, sources for nature-based products, harvesting areas and other assets to support the development of RAPs and effective livelihood restoration programs.\n\nOur approach to managing land use, resettlement and livelihood restoration\nIndigenous peoples\n\nIn locations inhabited or historically used by Indigenous peoples, we work with communities to respect their cultures and customs. ExxonMobil seeks to understand the perspectives of Indigenous peoples through open consultation and we consider their feedback into project planning, design, execution and operations. We support local employment initiatives and cultural heritage programs through local content development and strategic community investments.\n\nOur interactions with Indigenous peoples around the world are consistent with the goals of the following frameworks:\n\n- International Labor Organization Convention 169 Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries\n- United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\n- International Finance Corporation Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability\n- World Bank Operational Policy and Bank Procedure on Indigenous Peoples\n\nExxonMobil is committed to conducting meaningful consultations with Indigenous peoples, incorporating traditional knowledge and land use information into our plans, and promoting community engagement programs that respect traditions and cultures. Meaningful engagement is a key aspect of Free, Prior and Informed Consent, a specific right that pertains to Indigenous peoples and is recognized in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nOne of our objectives is to determine how Indigenous peoples prefer to engage. Communities may decide whether they want us to meet with elected leaders, community elders or other representatives, and whether those engagements are conducted in a public forum, either formally or informally. We enable communities to establish their preference for how often and how long their members meet with ExxonMobil representatives, and who will provide their viewpoints or represent their wishes.\n\nCultural heritage\n\nWe look for opportunities to help preserve cultural heritage by managing the potential impacts of our operations and by making culturally appropriate community investments.\n\nAt ExxonMobil, our respect for the cultural heritage and customs of local communities carries into our business practices from project design and execution through ongoing operations. As we design our projects, we consider cultural and spiritual considerations, heritage sites, biodiversity conservation, traditional knowledge and efficient use of resources.\n\nWe value and honor the diverse cultural histories of the areas where we operate. To do that, we use a cultural heritage identification process to identify potential sites of cultural significance. If the recovery or relocation of an artifact is appropriate, ExxonMobil develops tailored procedures in consultation with technical experts, local communities and host country government officials. We leverage relevant studies to deepen the knowledge among our workforce and provide training to our construction and field contractor personnel to identify different types of cultural heritage in the areas where we work.\nPartnering with Indigenous peoples\n\nImperial Oil (IOL) has consistently demonstrated high standards, innovation and leadership in Canada\u2019s energy industry for more than 140 years and is critical to ExxonMobil\u2019s business in Canada. Core to IOL\u2019s strategy for collective success and delivering value is advancing social innovation and engagement by meaningfully supporting and contributing to local and Indigenous communities.\n\nIOL is a Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business procurement champion, placing the company in a select group of corporations that have committed to increasing supply chain opportunities for Indigenous businesses. For example, IOL developed a business partnership with Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation that identified heavy-duty welding as an area for strategic partnership. We are proud of the growth and opportunity that our partners have accomplished, and we continuously work to expand our relations with Indigenous communities throughout Canada.\n\nCanadian Council for Aboriginal Business\nSocial contributions and philanthropy\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s community contributions are intended to address strategic local priorities where we do business around the world. We work with governments, other companies and nongovernmental organizations to help support local communities and broader society in areas such as education, health and the environment. Our corporate and ExxonMobil Foundation contributions support a range of programs, including three key areas of concentration: combating malaria, promoting education (in particular STEM education) and supporting women\u2019s economic empowerment.\n\nPerformance and initiatives\n\nIn 2021, we contributed $163 million to communities around the world, including donations from Exxon Mobil Corporation, our divisions and affiliates, the ExxonMobil Foundation and employee and retiree giving through the Foundation\u2019s matching gift and volunteer programs.\n\nGlobal community contributions 2021[10][11]\n\n- **$84.5M** Civic and community\n- **$26M** Employee and retiree giving\n- **$15.7M** Health and environment\n- **$8.3M** Pre-college education\n- **$3.3M** Workplace giving\n- **$2.6M** Women\u2019s economic opportunity\n- **$14.1M** Higher education\n- **$5.7M** Workforce development/other education\n- **$3.3M** Public policy research\n- **$18.9M** Canada\n- **$60.0M** United States\n- **$4.9M** Latin America\n- **$45.5M** Europe\n- **$24.2M** Africa/Middle East\n- **$9.9M** Asia Pacific\n\n*Total contributions do not include environmental capital and operating expenditures.*\nCombating malaria\n\nAs a major employer and investor in many malaria-endemic countries, ExxonMobil has been part of a longstanding international effort to prevent, treat and cure the disease. Through a coordinated, comprehensive effort, significant progress has been made over the past two decades in reducing the impacts of malaria on families and communities.\n\nSince 2000, ExxonMobil has provided more than $170 million in funding for antimalarial programs that have reached more than 185 million people. Our support has resulted in the distribution of more than 15.1 million bed nets, 5.6 million doses of antimalarial treatments and 4 million rapid diagnostic kits, as well as training for nearly 900,000 health workers. Thanks to the work of the many collaborations with governments, businesses and civil society, malarial deaths have been reduced by more than half since 2000 and infection rates have drastically declined. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1.5 billion cases of malaria have been prevented since 2000[12].\n\nIn October 2021, the WHO authorized use of a malaria vaccine for children, a potential breakthrough in the fight against malaria. ExxonMobil was one of several organizations that helped support the development of this first-ever malaria vaccine.\n\nWomen\u2019s economic opportunity\n\nExxonMobil invests in organizations around the world dedicated to bolstering women\u2019s economic empowerment. Our supplier diversity program began in the U.S 50 years ago and has steadily expanded globally. Increasing women-owned businesses stimulates innovation, enhances competition in the supply chain and builds customer and supplier loyalty by supporting the communities in which we operate.\n\nWe focus investments on developing women entrepreneurs, implementing programs on financial literacy, and providing access to savings accounts and improving productivity of women farmers.\n\nExxonMobil and the ExxonMobil Foundation have supported women in more than 90 countries seeking to fulfill their economic potential and drive economic and social change in their communities. From 2005 through 2021, we have invested more than $127 million to help community-based and global partners implement programs that directly benefit women.\nFor instance, our funding has allowed 5,000 female entrepreneurs to benefit from the nonprofit Solar Sister\u2019s business training while bringing life-altering energy solutions to their local communities. This effort has reached more than 1.7 million people and created a positive ripple effect on health, education and the environment.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 2,800 women entrepreneurs have strengthened their skills and grown their businesses by participating in the Road to Growth program, a collaboration between the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women and ExxonMobil Foundation. Three-quarters of the participants in Nigeria increased their savings and more than half increased their business revenues, even during the pandemic.\n\nFor the past several years, ExxonMobil has invested approximately $500 million annually in women-owned businesses. ExxonMobil is also a founding member of the Global Business Coalition for Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment, a private-sector consortium that fosters economic change for women.\n\nEducation\n\nSince 2000, we have contributed $1.57 billion to education programs around the world, including about $28 million in 2021.\n\nIn Angola, for example, educational challenges include the shortage of educational facilities. A collaboration among RISE International, Educate A Child and the ExxonMobil Foundation led to the construction of 26 primary schools in Angola for nearly 30,000 out-of-school children in the provinces of Luanda, Benguela and Bi\u00e9. The final project was completed in 2021.\n\nIn the U.S., we continue to support the National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI) in its efforts to bring college education training programs to students and teachers across the country. ExxonMobil helped launch NMSI in 2007 to improve math and science education by providing a comprehensive program designed to increase student participation and performance in Advanced Placement coursework. The organization also provides educators with hands-on training, strategies and resources to raise academic rigor and prepare students for advanced critical and creative thinking.\n\nSince 2007, NMSI has partnered with more than 1,300 U.S. school systems, training more than 6,500 teachers and touching the lives of more than 2 million students. NMSI recently expanded its programming into several Texas and New Mexico high schools in the Permian Basin.\nEmployee participation\n\nOur employees are passionate about engaging with their neighbors and contributing to the communities where they live and work. Many are involved with local nonprofit organizations helping to build homes, serving as volunteer firefighters or providing pro bono legal services, as examples. Through our volunteer involvement program in the U.S., the ExxonMobil Foundation provides $500 grants to charitable organizations for every 20 hours an employee or retiree provides in volunteer service, up to four times per year. Some of our international affiliates maintain similar volunteer programs.\n\nPerformance and initiatives\n\nMore than 3,900 ExxonMobil employees, retirees and their families volunteered approximately 135,000 hours in 2021 to over 1,450 charitable organizations across 19 countries. More than 2,700 employees, retirees, directors and surviving spouses donated more than $11.5 million to 663 U.S. colleges and universities, as well as minority scholarship programs. The ExxonMobil Foundation matched those donations with more than $11 million in grants in 2021.\n\nWorldwide Giving Report\nOur global supply chain\n\nExxonMobil is committed to promoting inclusive sourcing, respecting human rights and working to minimize impacts to the environment in our supply chain. We seek to work with suppliers that share our commitment.\n\nOur Supplier, Vendor and Contractor Expectations call for the operations and business practices of our suppliers to be conducted in a manner consistent with the International Labor Organization 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (ILO Declaration) and the goals of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). They also communicate our expectation that they comply with all local laws and regulations. Our suppliers, vendors and contractors are held to stringent compliance, anti-corruption, conflict of interest, safety and other guidelines in order to remain in good standing.\n\n- Supplier, Vendor and Contractor Expectations\n- International Labor Organization 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (ILO Declaration)\n- United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)\nManaging our supply chain\n\nTo integrate sustainability into our practices, ExxonMobil leverages existing stewardship and purchasing processes and systems. Plans and initiatives are reviewed to identify opportunities related to inclusive sourcing and environmental performance as well as to identify potential human rights impacts within category families. Objectives are established annually.\n\nExxonMobil utilizes a source-to-contract platform that facilitates consideration of sustainability in the acquisition process. Steps have been included to assist in identifying diverse suppliers and incorporate sustainability elements into commercial activities.\n\nNot only do we review a potential supplier\u2019s operational, technical and financial performance, we also perform compliance due diligence. We screen potential suppliers across compliance areas such as sanctions, anti-corruption and human trafficking using third-party information.\n\nOur approach to managing our supply chain\n\nSupplier diversity and inclusive sourcing\n\nWe promote inclusive sourcing by championing local, small and diverse suppliers in order to increase competition and innovation while striving to make positive impacts on communities. Where there is a lack of diverse, small or local suppliers, ExxonMobil aims to contribute to building capacity within our supply chain. We are committed to economic empowerment and aim to increase the number of women-owned and historically disadvantaged-owned businesses in our global supply chain.\nCelebrating 50 years of supplier diversity\n\nExxonMobil celebrated the 50th anniversary of our focus on supplier diversity in 2021. Working with diverse suppliers creates new perspectives, ideas and practices that benefit communities and ExxonMobil.\n\nExxonMobil invites U.S. businesses owned by traditionally underrepresented groups to express interest in becoming an ExxonMobil supplier through our U.S. supplier diversity database. ExxonMobil works with organizations such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council, the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council, the National Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Chamber of Commerce and the National Veteran-Owned Business Association to help identify and develop relationships with certified diverse suppliers in the U.S.\n\nExxonMobil aims to increase the number of women-owned businesses in our global supply chain. We work with WEConnect International, an organization that identifies, educates, registers and certifies businesses outside the U.S. that are at least 51% owned, managed and controlled by one or more women.\n\nOur supplier diversity efforts continue to grow. To mark the 50th anniversary, ExxonMobil launched initiatives designed to expand the use of diverse suppliers including creating an Inclusive Sourcing Advisory Council with senior business line leaders to identify opportunities and increase engagement with diverse suppliers, creating the \u201cEM Mentor, Advocate, Teach\u201d program to help those suppliers build capacity and gain exposure. We work with API to expand supplier diversity throughout the oil and gas industry.\n\n- U.S. supplier diversity database\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council\n- Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council\n- National Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Chamber of Commerce\n- National Veteran-Owned Business Association\n- WEConnect International\nHuman rights in our supply chain\n\nAs discussed in the Respecting Human Rights section of this report, we respect human rights and expect the same of our suppliers. We leverage current processes and systems to assess our direct suppliers for potential human rights risks in the supply chain. These risks focus on workers\u2019 rights, including safe and healthy working conditions, as well as the elimination of forced labor, child labor and discrimination.\n\nOur approach to managing our supply chain\n\nEnvironmental performance in our supply chain\n\nWe seek and aspire to work with innovative suppliers to minimize environmental impacts in our supply chain. We incorporate environmental considerations when developing cost models and sourcing strategies. Examples include reducing energy use and incorporating recycled content into packaging materials. We also assess and engage with suppliers through relationship management.\n\nEnvironmental performance is an important consideration in our commercial decisions. Since 2021, sustainability questions have been embedded in our sourcing platform and considered in bid evaluation and supplier selection.\n\nSupply chain human rights\n\nOur Statement on Labor and the Workplace articulates our support of the principles of the International Labor Organization (ILO) 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles on Rights at Work, including elimination of child labor, forced labor and workplace discrimination, the recognition of the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and a safe and healthy workplace.\n\nThrough our regimented procurement process, we seek to do business with suppliers who observe similar standards. Purchases arranged by our global procurement organization include contract language that requires adherence to all applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, requests for quotations issued by our procurement staff typically include clauses relating to the prohibition of forced or child labor and the payment of wages in accordance with local laws. Participants are required to adhere to those requirements.\n\nAuditing is another important component of supply-chain transparency. Our contracts typically require suppliers and all their subcontractors to allow ExxonMobil to access all offices and work locations and to interview supplier and subcontractor personnel. We select a certain percentage of suppliers annually for such audits, which include a compliance review on contract provisions.\n\nHuman trafficking issues have received considerable attention in recent years. ExxonMobil proactively manages supply chain risks, including those associated with human trafficking, through our Standards of Business Conduct, our Statement on Labor and the Workplace and our due diligence processes. We also seek to reduce the underlying conditions that lead to human trafficking by working to engender economic growth and personal prosperity.\nPackaging reuse approach in Papua New Guinea\n\nAt the ExxonMobil PNG Limited warehouse close to Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, the operations team developed a structured approach to reusing packaging waste, leading to both monetary savings and landfill avoidance. Following a waste audit at the site, the team developed waste reduction strategies including:\n\n- Reusing packaging material and foams between the warehouse and other internal organizations.\n- Reusing wooden shipping pallets between the freight forwarder and the warehouse, reducing the need to purchase new pallets.\n- Recycling damaged pallets at a small local recycling business.\n\n\u201cWaste reduction is one of the key pillars of our Warehouse Operations 6S program, Star Awards. That initiative combined with our recycling program, drives adoption of more sustainable and cost-effective practices around the world. The Papua New Guinea team has done an outstanding job embracing and expanding their waste management program.\u201d\n\nJessica Sanders, Global Procurement Supply Chain Manager\nPerformance and initiatives[14]\n\nIn 2021, we surpassed $5.5 billion in annual spending with local suppliers in select countries, and with diverse suppliers and small businesses globally. We spent $2.4 billion of the $5.5 billion in the U.S. with businesses owned by minorities, women, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, veterans, service-disabled veterans, people with disabilities and small businesses. Our supplier diversity program continues to expand internationally\u2014we spent $421 million with women-owned and Indigenous-owned businesses around the world.\n\nDuring the year, new training was introduced to ExxonMobil employees to build skills in the areas of inclusive sourcing, human rights and environmental performance in the supply chain. More than 2,100 employees completed this training.\n\nIn Guyana, the Centre for Local Business Development launched a women entrepreneurship program called \u201cAccelerate-Her\u201d with the financial support of ExxonMobil. It offers Guyanese women the opportunity to enable the growth of small businesses through tailored workshops, access to one-on-one business advisory services, mentoring, pitch development and a strong and supportive peer-learning environment for professional women. This innovative program works in concert with ExxonMobil Foundation\u2019s Women Economic Opportunity Initiative and its partnerships with the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women\u2019s Road to Growth program and Counterpart International\u2019s Global Women in Management training course.\n\n[Accelerate-Her]\nCaring for our workforce\n\nOur approach\n\nThe people of ExxonMobil are our most important competitive advantage. Our success, today and in the future, is based on the talent, ingenuity and hard work of our people, fueled by pride in what we do and what we stand for.\n\nOur ability to attract the world\u2019s best talent is important to our success. Developing people and maintaining a strong culture are core strategic priorities essential to achieving our long-term objectives.\n\nOur focus areas\n\nLeading in personnel safety \u2192\nEnhancing process safety \u2192\nExcerpt: Investing in People \u2192\nLeading in personnel safety\n\nAt ExxonMobil, our people are our most valuable resource. We have a long history of embedding safety into our culture. The culture is reinforced by safety leadership, standards, practices and experience. We focus on an integrated framework of systems, processes, tools and behaviors aimed at eliminating injuries and fatalities. We aspire to an environment where Nobody Gets Hurt and our Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) demonstrates results from our top tier safety programs\\(^{[17]}\\). In 2021, we maintained best-ever results with a LTIR of 0.02 per 200,000 work hours\\(^{[18]}\\). We plan to build on this industry-leading position.\n\nExxonMobil is committed to protecting the safety, security and health of our employees, our contractors and others involved with our operations, as well as our customers and the public. These commitments are documented in the Safety, Health, Environment and Product Safety policies found in our Standards of Business Conduct.\n\nOur work in this area is put into practice through OIMS, which guides the daily activities of our global workforce by setting clear expectations for managing the risks inherent to our business. The OIMS framework goes beyond our employees to include third-party providers and contractors. We include specific safety and health expectations in contractual agreements with these third parties.\n\nWe focus on delivering consistent, sustainable results through OIMS and leaders engage with their teams to drive effective application. Each business unit has leadership management systems and work processes aimed to consistently meet operations objectives.\n\nMore information on personnel safety, including lifesaving rules and actions, human performance, culture of health and training can be found on our website.\n\n- Standards of Business Conduct\n- Our approach to leading in personnel safety\nHealthy and engaged workforce\n\nExxonMobil Global Medicine and Occupational Health uses Centers of Excellence in clinical, infectious disease, industrial hygiene and health promotion with members from across the globe to develop processes that guide programs in operations around the world. This approach supports the health of workers and surrounding communities where we operate. Our health management systems have recently been enhanced to focus on high-priority health issues and safeguards. These elements enable ExxonMobil to address total workforce health more effectively.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, our emergency preparedness and response procedures were swiftly triggered at the country, regional and facility levels, building on lessons learned from SARS, Pandemic Flu, MERS and Ebola. Our preventive and mitigation safeguards, combined with coordinated internal communications, helped protect the health and safety of our workers and their dependents. Our measures were continually refined as more information about the virus was identified, in consultation with internal and external health experts.\n\nWhen vaccines became available, they were globally promoted for early access by our employees through administration sites in the community and our workplaces, in close collaboration with local health authorities. Extensive information on the vaccines, COVID-19 and safeguard adaptation were periodically communicated to workers through multiple channels, including webinars with world-renowned experts.\n\nConcurrently, we globally deployed resilience programs and made mental health initiatives available to employees and dependents, effectively supporting them in minimizing the substantial impact of the pandemic on their personal and professional lives.\n\nBuilding safety into a new operation\n\nIn 2021, we announced the collaborative startup of Gulf Coast Growth Ventures (GCGV) petrochemical manufacturing facility in San Patricio County, Texas, a joint venture with Sabic. This plant, which began operations in early 2022, can produce packaging materials, agricultural film, construction materials, clothing and automotive coolants, helping to meet the growing demand for performance products.\n\nSafety was embedded in the development and operation of this facility to help protect our people, minimize risks across the operations and promote excellence in performance. Before employees could work at GCGV, they had to undergo 18\u201324 months of training at ExxonMobil facilities to learn responsible operating procedures. These actions enabled us to build and open the plant safely ahead of schedule and under budget.\nEnhancing process safety\n\nSafety is a core value and an integral part of our culture. Process Safety focuses on managing the hazards that can be created from the vast equipment and complex processes that are essential to our business. The primary purpose is to keep hydrocarbons, chemicals and process water controlled and safely managed at all times through all phases of our operations.\n\nProcess safety events can potentially impact the workforce, the community and the environment. Because of this, we set high expectations for ourselves. Everyone involved in our operations plays a role in driving process safety excellence. We are now in the fourth year of a corporate-wide Process Safety initiative. From 2016 through 2021, we achieved a 31% reduction in Tier 1 process safety events (those of greatest consequence) with further improvement steps underway.\n\nTo help protect our employees, contractors, communities where we work and the environment, ExxonMobil uses a proactive, disciplined approach to managing risks inherent to our operations. Our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) serves as the foundation for managing process safety risks, establishing clear expectations. The safeguards built into OIMS are integral to how we design, operate and maintain our facilities. We work to verify and rigorously manage these safeguards through maintenance, inspection, operations testing, competency demonstrations and emergency preparedness drills. As part of OIMS, ExxonMobil monitors the performance of joint ventures and assets operated by others consistent with our expectations and encourages them to consider improvements as appropriate.\n\nAs part of ExxonMobil\u2019s approach to enterprise risk management, higher-consequence process safety risks and risk management strategies are stewarded by the company\u2019s Management Committee. Our Upstream, Product Solutions and Low Carbon Solutions companies develop and execute these strategies with centralized support from ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company and from the ExxonMobil Global Operations & Sustainability organization\u2019s Process Safety and Reliability and Maintenance Center of Excellence.\n\nOur primary objective is to help protect our people, communities and the environment by successfully managing and enhancing process safety.\n\nOur approach to enhancing process safety\nWorkplace security\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s robust security measures are designed to protect our personnel, including senior executives, and facilities from threats. Our security programs comply with regulations, are risk-based, flexible and responsive to the environments in which we operate.\n\nFacilities undergo periodic security analyses to address potential threats. Each assessment considers geographic location, relationships with the community, criminal activity and the current political climate. We monitor local conditions and maintain detailed security preparedness plans, such as evacuation and intruder response plans. We train employees who travel to and live in higher-risk countries on personal safety in challenging security environments. Our security personnel work to improve our risk management methodologies, threat-assessment capabilities and technical security management processes through drills, training programs and industry forums.\n\nCybersecurity business continuity and management\n\nProtecting our people and assets includes managing the risks posed by cyber-attacks. As cybersecurity risks continue to evolve, we must protect our business against cyber-related business disruptions and threats that can potentially affect our data, facilities, operations and the safety and privacy of our people. Awareness remains one of our best defenses and cybersecurity education is a priority for ExxonMobil. All of our personnel must complete annual web-based cybersecurity training to help them understand and respond to potential cybersecurity risks and to reinforce safe behaviors.\n\nIn addition to promoting safe behaviors, we have developed business continuity plans with a suite of enablers that will be activated in the event of a major cyber-attack. Our business continuity plans are reviewed for compliance, performance and improvements via annual updates and periodic drills.\n\nEmergency preparedness\n\nExxonMobil is prepared to respond to a wide array of emergency events, including natural disasters, pandemics and operational incidents. Each ExxonMobil facility has access to trained responders and resources. Centralized and cross-functional teams develop and practice emergency response tactics through incident management teams and emergency support groups around the world, which enables us to provide a robust response in emergency situations to help protect people, the environment and our communities.\n\nIn 2021, our Regional Response Team (RRT) demonstrated its \u201cReadiness to Respond\u201d capabilities under pandemic circumstances by conducting an innovative exercise that simulated a global response to a potential real-life oil spill event. Approximately 300 RRT personnel and response partners from more than 35 countries were involved in a continuous 28-hour follow-the-sun event, with face-to-face hubs in Singapore, the U.K., Prague and Houston, along with virtual support globally. Exercises like this help support our objective to be prepared and ready to respond.\nExcerpt: Investing in People\n\nThe people of ExxonMobil are our most important competitive advantage. Our success, current and future, is based on the talent, ingenuity and hard work of our people, fueled by pride in what we do and what we stand for. Developing people and maintaining a strong culture are core strategic priorities essential to achieving our long-term objectives.\n\nWe remain focused on building a diverse workforce and productive work environment where individual and cultural differences are respected, where every individual is challenged to deliver their best, and has the opportunity for unrivaled personal and professional development.\n2021 Highlights\n\nThroughout 2021, the people of ExxonMobil strengthened our leadership position, consistently demonstrating our core values including care, courage and resilience as they helped society recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of their efforts, ExxonMobil delivered industry-leading safety, reliability and financial results in an extremely challenging environment.\n\n| Our goals                        | Our achievements                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| A place to thrive                | \u2022 Expanded benefits to support employees\u2019 well-being due to COVID-19            |\n|                                  | \u2022 Progressed *We Are ExxonMobil* culture initiative and expanded employee engagements |\n| Attract the best talent          | \u2022 Awarded #1 most attractive U.S. energy company for engineering students, #2 globally |\n|                                  | \u2022 Strong global acceptance rates                                                |\n|                                  | \u2022 Increased diverse talent across professional pipeline and wage populations     |\n| Enable employees to reach their full potential | \u2022 Continued investment in talent through job rotations, training and learning |\n|                                  | \u2022 500,000 courses delivered in 2021                                             |\n| Develop future leaders           | \u2022 Refreshed leadership training curriculum in support of *We Are ExxonMobil*     |\n|                                  | \u2022 Increased diversity among executives; women and U.S. minority representation up 35% since 2017 |\n| Harness diversity                | \u2022 Fostered inclusive behaviors, embedded in *We Are ExxonMobil* and through annual skills assessments |\n|                                  | \u2022 Expanded career advocacy and mentoring programs, focusing organizational effort |\nOur approach\n\nThe Sustainability Report summarizes ExxonMobil\u2019s approach to managing our operations and describes our ESG performance.\n\nThe results of our topic selection helped determine the key topics discussed in the report.

ambitions, goals, events or conditions, descriptions of business and community plans, and research efforts, including sustainability focus areas, projections, plans to reduce emissions and emissions intensity, sensitivity analyses, expectations, estimates, and the development of future technologies, are forward-looking statements. Similarly, emission-reduction roadmaps to drive toward net zero are dependent on future market factors, such as continued technological progress and policy support, and represent forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including in the sustainability focus areas, the achievement of ambitions to reach Scope 1 and Scope 2 net zero from operated assets by 2050, to reach Scope 1 and 2 net zero in Upstream Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030, to eliminate routine flaring in-line with World Bank Zero Routine Flaring, to reach near zero methane emissions from operated assets, to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction plans or goals, divestment and start-up plans, and associated project plans; technology efforts such as timing and outcome of projects to capture and store CO\u2082, produce biofuels, integrate hydrogen projects, and use plastic waste as feedstock for advanced recycling; future cash flows; and reserve or resource changes could vary depending on the ability to execute operational objectives on a timely and successful basis; policy and consumer support for emission-reduction products and technology; changes in laws and regulations including international treaties and laws and regulations regarding the sustainability focus areas, emissions, plastics, and carbon costs; government incentives; trade patterns and the development and enforcement of local, national and regional mandates; unforeseen technical or operational difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies such as advanced recycling on a commercially competitive basis; changes in supply and demand and other market factors affecting future prices of oil, gas, and petrochemical products; availability of feedstocks for biofuels or advanced recycling; changes in the relative energy mix across activities and geographies; the actions of competitors; changes in regional and global economic growth rates and consumer preferences; actions taken by governments and consumers resulting from a pandemic; changes in population growth, economic development or migration patterns; military build-ups or conflicts; and other factors discussed in this release and in Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in ExxonMobil\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2021 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q, as well as under the heading \u201cFactors Affecting Future Results\u201d on the Investors page of ExxonMobil\u2019s website at www.exxonmobil.com.\n\nWe do not undertake to provide any updates or changes to any data or forward-looking statements in this report. Neither future distribution of this material nor the continued availability of this material in archive form on our website should be deemed to constitute an update or re-affirmation of these figures or statements as of any future date. Any future update will be provided only through a public disclosure indicating that fact.\n\nThis report is not intended to communicate any material investment information. This report represents a good faith effort by the Company to address our efforts on diverse topics broadly defined as sustainability efforts. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future, including future rule-making.\n\nEnergy demand modeling aims to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario, including any potential net zero scenario, does not imply ExxonMobil views any particular scenario as likely to occur. In addition, energy demand scenarios require assumptions on a variety of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For example, the IEA describes its NZE scenario as extremely challenging, requiring unprecedented innovation, unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use or inclusion herein is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of ExxonMobil\u2019s separate planning process, but may be secondarily tested for robustness or resiliency against different assumptions, including against various scenarios. Any reference to ExxonMobil\u2019s support of, work with, or collaboration with a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect investment decisions made by the corporation or its affiliates. Individual projects or opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of supportive policy, technology for cost-effective abatement, company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emissions investments is based on plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set and focused on returns.\nExxonMobil reported emissions, including reductions and avoidance performance data, are based on a combination of measured and estimated data. Calculations are based on industry standards and best practices, including guidance from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and Ipieca. Emissions reported are estimates only, and performance data depends on variations in processes and operations, the availability of sufficient data, the quality of those data and methodology used for measurement and estimation. Emissions data is subject to change as methods, data quality, and technology improvements occur, and changes to performance data may be updated. Emissions, reductions and avoidance estimates for non-ExxonMobil operated facilities are included in the equity data and similarly may be updated as changes in the performance data are reported. ExxonMobil\u2019s plans to reduce emissions are good-faith efforts based on current relevant data and methodology, which could be changed or refined. ExxonMobil works to continuously improve its approach to identifying, measuring and addressing emissions. ExxonMobil actively engages with industry, including API and Ipieca, to improve emission factors and methodologies, including measurements and estimates.\n\nAll forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s knowledge and reasonable expectations at the time of publication. We do not undertake to provide any updates or changes to any data or forward-looking statements.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation has numerous affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Mobil, Esso and XTO. For convenience and simplicity, those terms and terms such as \u201cCorporation\u201d, \u201ccompany,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d and \u201cits\u201d are sometimes used as abbreviated references to one or more specific affiliates or affiliate groups. Abbreviated references describing global or regional operational organizations, and global or regional business lines are also sometimes used for convenience and simplicity. Nothing contained herein is intended to override the corporate separateness of affiliated companies. Exxon Mobil Corporation\u2019s goals do not guarantee any action or future performance by its affiliates or Exxon Mobil Corporation\u2019s responsibility for those affiliates\u2019 actions and future performance, each affiliate of which manages its own affairs.
