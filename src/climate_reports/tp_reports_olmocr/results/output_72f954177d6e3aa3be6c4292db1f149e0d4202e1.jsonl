It\u2019s what drives us, along with our corporate purpose: We make the world work better for everyone. Led by this purpose, we continue to evolve with our stakeholders\u2014employees, customers, investors, partners, suppliers, and communities\u2014as we enable everyone to contribute to a more sustainable, equitable, and ethical world.\n\nFor ServiceNow, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) is more than just words on a page. It\u2019s a mindset. A business imperative with tangible growth and risk management at its core.\n\nWe believe that executing an ESG strategy that deliberately aligns with our business strategy, culture, and values helps us drive long-term value creation by expanding our customer base and deepening our relationships. Creating positive impact for society and the environment delivers against critical business objectives\u2014deeper stakeholder engagement, stronger risk management, and a culture of innovation. These are compelling outcomes in any environment but as we face an unprecedented global landscape, they are crucial to developing a resilient business and a more sustainable world.\n\nOur company values\n\n- Wow our customers\n- Win as a team\n- Create belonging\n- Stay hungry and humble\n## Contents\n\n### SERVICENOW & ESG\n\n- **Accelerating ESG impact through technology**\n  - About this report\n  - Use of forward-looking statements\n  - Letter from our CEO\n  - About ServiceNow\n  - Our 2022 global impact highlights\n  - Our ESG strategy\n\n### OUR TECHNOLOGY\n\n- **The world works with ServiceNow**\n  - ServiceNow Platform delivers on our purpose\n  - Digital transformation for purpose and profit\n\n### ENVIRONMENTAL\n\n- **Sustaining our planet**\n  - Climate and energy\n  - Progress against our Science-Based Targets\n  - Our approach to net zero\n  - Carbon-neutral cloud\n  - Responsible procurement\n  - Waste\n  - Water\n\n### SOCIAL\n\n- **Creating equitable opportunity**\n  - Investing in the power of our people\n  - Attracting and retaining talent\n  - Workplace health and safety\n  - Learning and development\n  - Building an outstanding team\n  - RiseUp with ServiceNow\n  - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n  - Sustained progress\n  - New goals and new strategic programs\n  - Employee Belonging Groups\n  - Supplier diversity\n  - Community engagement\n    - Total Social Investment\n    - In-kind donation program\n    - Signature programs\n    - Employee engagement\n\n### GOVERNANCE\n\n- **Acting with integrity**\n  - Corporate governance and business ethics\n  - ESG governance\n  - Business ethics\n  - Emerging technology and ethics\n  - Security and data privacy\n  - Security\n  - Data privacy\n  - Business continuity\n  - 2023 and beyond\n\n### DATA\n\n- **Annex**\n  - ESG materiality\n  - Stakeholders\n  - Memberships and recognitions\n  - Policies and statements\n  - Cloud certifications, authorizations, and attestations\n  - Greenhouse gas emissions\n  - Human capital\n  - Community engagement\n  - Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\n  - Global Reporting Initiative\n  - Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure\n  - United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\nAbout this report\n\nOur third annual Global Impact Report provides a comprehensive, year-over-year update on our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy, initiatives, and metrics, with highlights of our plans. We continue to mature and drive progress on our ESG commitments and investments that our 20,000-strong employees have made possible across the organization and our broader stakeholder ecosystem.\n\nHow we drive global impact:\nWe focus on operationalizing our ESG strategy through delivering and disclosing on key commitments, targets, policies, initiatives, and stakeholder engagement. We\u2019re pleased to report that our ESG strategy and year-over-year progress continue to resonate with our stakeholders, addressing their expectations for greater governance and disclosure around our ESG material issues. In 2022, we increased our strategic focus by applying the new best practice of double materiality. ESG material issues were assessed and reprioritized based on the impact on enterprise value, as well as the impact on society and the environment. Additionally, our ServiceNow Platform for digital business is helping our customers and partners achieve more of their own ESG goals for greater impact and value creation. In this report, we\u2019ll highlight the evolution of our strategy and progress across our ESG material issues.\n\nHow we govern our efforts:\nOur board and management team oversee our ESG strategy. Our management reports at least twice a year to the Nominating and Governance Committee (NGC). The NGC reviews and discusses with management the company\u2019s ESG programs, initiatives, and progress against goals. Our management also reports at least twice a year to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management the regulatory environment and associated reporting requirements, and the controls and procedures supporting the company\u2019s ESG disclosures. In addition, our Compensation Committee oversees human capital management. Our enterprise-wide ESG Steering Committee, under the leadership of our CFO, helps guide our ESG strategy, goals, progress, and key initiatives. Our additional management steering committees and councils help address specific priorities such as risk and compliance, data governance, and others.\n\nOur greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, purchased and generated renewable energy (RE), purchased carbon offsets, and net emissions were once again verified by Apex, a third party, in accordance with ISO 14064-3.\n\nHow we report our progress:\nOur voluntary ESG reporting references the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Software and IT Services standards, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). With the revised GRI Universal Standards, we\u2019ve changed how we talk about our ESG material issues to address key components of this revision, including positive and negative impacts on the economy, environment, and people; related commitments and policies; actions to manage the topic; effectiveness of those actions; and engagement with stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, we\u2019re closely monitoring global developments in ESG-related regulations and reporting requirements to align accordingly. Unless otherwise noted, the data reflected in this report covers ServiceNow\u2019s global operations for fiscal year 2022, representing Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 2022.

An ambition of this magnitude is only possible when we deliver real impact for our customers, employees, partners, suppliers, and shareholders.\n\nBill McDermott\nChairman and CEO, ServiceNow\n\nWhen I think of ServiceNow\u2019s responsibility to make a positive impact on the world, I\u2019m reminded that none of us is as smart as all of us. Our founder, Fred Luddy, understood this well. From the time he started writing the code for our platform, he inspired a company that would relentlessly pursue its purpose to make the world work better for everyone. Today, from vaccine management to refugee resettlement to helping businesses navigate global economic uncertainty, ServiceNow is doing well for our customers and shareholders so we can do good things for the world.\nHere\u2019s the big picture:\n\nThe fundamentals of the global economy are changing. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG), fully integrated into a digital-first strategy, is creating immense business value. Countless chief executives agree with this premise. One summed it up perfectly. She said, \u201cWe need to inspect what we expect. If it counts, we should count it.\u201d\n\nIn this spirit, ESG case studies are compelling across every dimension of the global economy. In manufacturing, it is a core aspect of a complete value chain redesign. In the financial industry, leaders who allocate resources to organizations that generate sustainable value are seeing higher returns on those investments. In technology, delivering a carbon-neutral cloud helps our customers achieve their sustainability goals.\n\nConsistent with our stated ambition to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century, ServiceNow is committed to leading in ESG\u2014as both exemplar and enabler.\n\nFor our own operations, we take a long-term view of impact, and we take great care to make progress every single day. In the past year alone, we:\n\n- Delivered the ServiceNow Platform Tokyo Release, which included new, expanded capabilities in our ESG Management solution\n- Launched RiseUp with ServiceNow with the goal to skill 1 million people by 2024\n- Provided a carbon-neutral cloud for our customers\n- Developed our approach to net zero by 2030\n- Increased representation of women and underrepresented groups within ServiceNow\n- Grew employee volunteer hours by more than 80% year-over-year\n\nOur top priority is to make our customers successful. They invest in ServiceNow as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. They understand that workflow automation is at the core of delivering best-in-class customer service and a great employee experience while creating mission-critical business applications of their own. The technology strategy has become the business strategy.\n\nSignificantly, in the context of ESG, the sprawling nature of legacy enterprise systems has made it difficult for our customers to meaningfully track, measure, and report on their progress. ServiceNow\u2019s platform was engineered to bridge these silos, orchestrating data sources and processes to drive real outcomes. So, the ultimate value of our platform is that we enable ESG to be a core pillar of business transformation.\n\nAs we constantly look to set new standards for business success, we know our employees are inspired by our focus on ESG. Fulfilling our purpose together serves as a central tenet of our company\u2019s People Pact. Our employees have committed their time to our skills-based volunteering programs and in-kind donations.\n\nOur suppliers, which represent 77% of our carbon footprint, are partnering with us to set their own goals for ESG action. This reduces supply chain risk and improves business continuity. Our investors consider our ESG work as a best practice for high-growth, profitable companies.\n\nWe want to create a once-in-a-generation company that fundamentally changes the world\u2019s organizations. Our ESG strategy is core to that singular focus.\n\nThis is a pivotal moment in the history of enterprise technology. Advances in generative AI, one of many tools in the broader automation movement, have stimulated a bigger discussion about how technology will change the world. This isn\u2019t a moment we take lightly. On the contrary, we believe it demands a new approach to innovative leadership. We intend to deliver it.\n\nOn behalf of our hungry and humble team, thank you for investing your precious time in this report. We appreciate your interest in ServiceNow and your support as we help the world work with ServiceNow.\n\nBill McDermott\nChairman and CEO, ServiceNow\nAbout ServiceNow\n\nOur business\n\n20,000+ employees\n\n7,700+ global enterprise customers\n\n~85% of Fortune 500 companies use ServiceNow\n\n$6.89 billion in subscription revenues\n\n98% renewal rate\n\n76 offices in 31 countries\n\n30+ data centers in 13 countries\n\nRecognitions\n\nDow Jones Sustainability Index North America\n\nFORTUNE\u00ae World\u2019s Most Admired Company\n\nFORTUNE\u00ae Best Workplaces for Women\n\nGreat Place to Work\u2014Certified\u2122\n\nHuman Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index\n\nInstitutional Investor Best ESG (software)\n\nJUST Capital America\u2019s Most JUST Companies 2023\n\nJUST Capital 2022 Workforce Equity and Mobility Ranking\n\nNewsweek America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies 2023\n\nSilicon Valley Business Journal Top 50 Philanthropists\nOur 2022 global impact highlights\n\n100% renewable electricity\n\nCarbon-neutral cloud\u00b9 for our customers\n\n14.7% of our U.S. employees came from under represented groups\n\nWomen represent 32.5% of employees, a nearly 2% point increase from the prior year\n\n36K+ volunteer hours\n\n79% increase in employee volunteerism\n\n48.2% of our suppliers by spend have approved or committed to science-based targets\n\n19% spend with diverse suppliers\n\n$12M+ in community cash and in-kind grants, corporate match, and rewards\n\n10K+ NextGen beneficiaries trained on ServiceNow since inception\n\n99.993% average uptime\n\n\u00b9Included in carbon-neutral boundary for 2022: Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (market-based) data center-related emissions (Category 1: purchased goods and services, Category 2: capital goods, Category 3: fuel and energy-related activities, Category 6: business travel, and Category 7: employee commuting).\nOur ESG strategy\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve embedded an ESG mindset throughout the organization, fostering cultural awareness, deepening stakeholder trust, and driving proven, long-term value creation. Our employees want it. Our customers and global ecosystem expect it. ESG is a business imperative that has a lasting positive impact, driving top-line growth and bottom-line profitability. That\u2019s why I always say, \u2018Purpose and profits are not mutually exclusive\u2019.\n\nGina Mastantuono\nChief Financial Officer, ServiceNow\n\nAligned with ServiceNow\u2019s purpose\u2014We make the world work better for everyone\u2014our ESG strategy continues to make progress across all of our ESG material issues.

Through our programs, policies, and platform, we continue to operate with an ESG mindset\u2014a business imperative that promotes long-term growth and value creation for us and our employees, customers, investors, partners, suppliers, and communities. As we continue to grow and evolve, we\u2019re creating impact within our four walls and across our value chain.\n\nBecause ESG is constantly evolving and maturing, we worked with a third-party consultancy in 2022 to reassess and reprioritize our ESG material issues. We followed industry best practice by using a double-materiality assessment focused on how our actions impact enterprise values, as well as society and the environment. For this reassessment, we engaged 20+ internal business leaders and a dozen external stakeholders representing customers, partners, suppliers, investors, and thought leaders. We also put significant focus on ESG governance by working with subject matter experts across the business to mature our ESG metrics, disclosures, and controls.\n\nWe use the ServiceNow Platform and our solutions as enablers of our ESG strategy to achieve impact at scale.

This solution has allowed us to address the foundational needs of ESG governance and disclosure\u2014automating cross-functional ESG data collection, validation, and approvals with a single source of truth that\u2019s audit-ready. Through our use of ESGM, we\u2019re able to measure progress for enhanced decision-making and board oversight. Further, as the ESG landscape evolves and required and regulated reporting increases, our ESG disclosures are positioned to meet these rising expectations.\n\nAs more ESG regulations and raters require external assurance of carbon footprint disclosures, full carbon accounting is essential. ESG Management provides expanded support for greenhouse gas emissions tracking and net-zero goals.\nESG Command Center: Enabling the maturing governance of ESG\n\nWorking together to effectively address a range of ESG opportunities and challenges for organizations requires people, data, processes, and systems that span a wide network of employees, partners, customers, suppliers, and communities.\n\nThe ESG Command Center solution combines the power of the ServiceNow Platform, new and existing products, and ServiceNow\u2019s partner ecosystem to help organizations plan, manage, govern, and report on their ESG programs and initiatives. This drives greater environmental, social, and business impact with reduced risk. Together with our existing, partner, and custom-built workflows and applications, our ESG solution gives organizations the range of tools they need to activate their ESG strategies. It brings together the purpose-built ESG Management product with our Integrated Risk Management and Strategic Portfolio Management solutions, as well as our network of partners.\n\nA closer look at ESG Command Center\n\nOur ESG Command Center solution helps organizations at every level of maturity integrate their ESG initiatives\u2014from setting goals and collecting data to auditing activities and tracking and disclosing performance.

That\u2019s why we continue to apply the power of the ServiceNow Platform and our workflows to develop integrated solutions that cut across enterprise silos and ecosystems. These solutions help our customers manage their own ESG opportunities and challenges (and those of their customers, employees, and investors care about), including helping to mitigate risk, control costs, improve sustainability, and grow the top line.\n\nIn 2022, we launched our expanded solutions that meet the growing needs of the market around measuring ESG impact and delivering business outcomes. These include:\n\n- **Supplier Lifecycle Management (SLM):** SLM helps organizations communicate more easily with suppliers around ESG material issues\u2014like how to reduce the carbon footprint of their supply chain\u2014and better understand how changes in supplier behavior impact their business and ESG goals.\n\n- **Enterprise Asset Management (EAM):** Customers can now oversee the complete lifecycle of their physical business assets, beyond IT, to meet operational targets, maximize usable life, minimize risk, and responsibly reuse, resell, or recycle.

We continue to maintain 100% renewable electricity. And we\u2019ve decoupled our revenue growth from our carbon emissions growth, with a 54% reduction in carbon intensity since 2019.\n\nThis section provides updates on our environmental pillar, sustaining our planet, and includes our progress on climate and energy, responsible procurement, waste, and water.\nClimate and energy\n\nTo meet our net-zero and science-based target initiative (SBTi) commitments, we\u2019ve expanded our dedicated environmental sustainability team and have embedded sustainability leaders across our different organizations. We are also working with ServiceNow leaders to instill sustainability into their operations\u2014starting with offices, data centers, travel, marketing, and global sourcing. These functions cover more than 90% of our carbon footprint and, through the creation of working groups, will allow us to strive toward internal metrics that support our bigger external goals.\n\nWe are also investing in energy-efficiency programs, starting with improved data collection and monitoring initiatives across our global operations.\n\nOur 2022 carbon footprint by scope and business activity (unit of measure: mtCO2e)\nProgress against our Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) goals\n\n**SBTi target 1**\nReduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 70% by 2026 from 2019 (baseline)\n\n| Target: | Progress: |\n|---------|-----------|\n| 70% reduction by 2026 | 82% reduction for 2022 |\n\n**SBTi target 2**\nReduce Scope 3 GHG emissions (business travel and employee commuting) 40% per unit value added\\(^2\\) by 2026 from 2019 (baseline)\n\n| Target: | Progress: |\n|---------|-----------|\n| 40% reduction by 2026 | 42% reduction for 2022 |\n\n**SBTi target 3**\nEnsure 65% of our suppliers by spend, covering purchased goods and services and capital goods, have approval by the SBTi by 2026\n\n| Target: | Progress: |\n|---------|-----------|\n| 65% by 2026 | 48.2% have committed to or approval by the SBTi for 2022 |\n\n\\(^2\\) Value added is gross profit which is total revenue less cost of revenue.\nOur approach to net zero\n\nAchieving net zero by 2030 requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach that includes stakeholder engagement, development of standards and policies, operationalizing sustainability, and decarbonization\u2014with progress measured through metrics and public disclosures.\n\nEngage: Prioritizing stakeholder engagement\n\nWe continue to engage all of our stakeholders, including suppliers, employees, partners, and customers, working to bring them on board with our climate goals.\n\nCustomers:\nWe support our customers\u2019 carbon reduction goals in a variety of ways. First, we respond to our customers\u2019 climate-related inquiries, including calls, surveys/questionnaires, carbon footprint information, and sustainability ratings. In 2022, we tracked more than 130 customer requests. Secondly, we recognize the important role technology plays in measuring and tracking progress toward emissions-reduction key performance indicators (KPIs) for our customers. That\u2019s why we develop solutions that help our customers track and manage environmental sustainability-related processes.\n\nPartners:\nOur ESG partners are using the ServiceNow Platform to digitally transform enterprises to reach their ESG goals. They\u2019re creating more efficient ways to calculate carbon, validate carbon credits, track supply chain due diligence, ensure methane emissions are tracked and reduced, and more. See our ESG Partners section to learn more.\n\nSuppliers:\nOur suppliers make up 77% of our carbon footprint, so working with them is critical to achieving our carbon reduction goals.\n\nIn 2022, we engaged with 23% of our suppliers (by total spend) on sustainability topics. Engagement included dedicated presentations, surveys, and training to set out ServiceNow goals and expectation for suppliers on their sustainability performance. For example, we gave training on the CDP Supply Chain Program to 11 suppliers in our top 100. As part of our Global Cloud Services sustainability program, we met with critical suppliers as part of our quarterly business review to discuss their sustainability performance and potential to collaborate on efficiency programs. In addition, we surveyed all our colocation providers on their commitments to energy, water, and waste programs.\n\nWe initiated our CDP Supply Chain Program in 2022, where we invited 100 of our top suppliers (under capital goods and purchased goods and services category) to respond to the CDP climate change questionnaire. We achieved a 70% response rate. This year we will expand our invitation to the CDP Supply Chain Program to 280 suppliers covering 53% of our total spend. This will help inform our approach as we wish to engage with a greater number of suppliers to support them on their sustainability journey.\n\nEmployees:\nFor Earth Day 2022, we held 12 events around the globe and planted more than 1,900 trees with our community partner, One Tree Planted.\n\nDuring Climate Week, our EMEA region hosted week-long events focused on climate education and action. Through this, over 150 employees participated, creating 20 initiatives that impact personal choices, corporate-level sustainability mindset, and volunteerism.\nEngage: Prioritizing stakeholder engagement (cont.)\n\nCommunities:\nOne of our four focus areas for community engagement is decarbonization. In 2022, we donated $1.2 million to nonprofits that encourage rapid growth of natural vegetation with reforestation programs, and organizations that create more sustainable energy resources. Nonprofits we supported include GivePower, Amigos de Iracambi US, and One Tree Planted. Overall, we donated $1.54 million to decarbonization efforts by the end of 2022, exceeding our two-year, $1 million goal.\n\nInvestors:\nAs we continue to make progress toward our goals and expand our disclosures, we ensure engagement with our investors through various activities.\n\nPolicy: Creating change through operational policies\n\nLasting change begins with clear standards and policies. We continue to update our Environmental Sustainability Policy as our supplier expectations evolve, and we embed sustainability requirements into our processes and supply chain. Going forward, we\u2019ll be including more sustainability-focused language in our contracts and RFPs.\n\nHaving well-defined travel policies on the ServiceNow Platform helps us effectively manage travel emissions and costs. By requiring all travel to be preapproved on the ServiceNow Travel Safety App, we ensure every trip request is evaluated to align to our core values and business priorities. We strive to reduce travel time, cost, and environmental impact by reserving travel for only those times where being in the room plays a critical role in the interaction.\n\nIn 2022, we initiated a review of design and construction guidelines for new buildings and the criteria that we use to select our locations. We are now developing our global design and construction sustainability guidelines, which we will pilot in our Munich, Germany, and Dublin, Ireland projects in 2023. Alongside this, we have developed our sustainability real estate checklist, which will be a decision-making tool that results in a site \u201cscore\u201d to help determine optimal locations for ServiceNow\u2019s future locations.\n\nOperationalize: Embedding sustainability into all our operations\n\nWe continue to operationalize sustainability across our business through improved data collection, monitoring initiatives, and workflows that support sustainability initiatives. Here are a few examples of our work in 2022:\n\nIn our offices:\nWe invested in a utility data aggregator to improve energy data management. We have begun to pilot the program and give our workplace services team access to actionable data.\n\nAt our data centers:\nWe invested in implementing our data center monitoring solution with a leading provider. You can read more about this work in our Carbon-Neutral Cloud section.\n\nDecarbonization: Reducing our emissions\n\nWith our increased focus on decarbonization, we continue to decouple the growth of our carbon footprint from our revenue growth. In 2022, we continued to achieve our goal of 100% renewable electricity through a combination of methods. These include working with colocation partners in our data center facilities who are utilizing high-quality renewable electricity, investing in green utility tariffs, and purchasing renewable energy certificates.\n\nTo reaffirm our commitment to this goal, we joined RE100, a global initiative of organizations committed to 100% renewable electricity.\n\nCOP27\n\nAt the 27th annual Conference of the Parties (COP27), we engaged with the broader community on sustainability. We hosted a panel on the Climate Action stage in the Innovation Zone, where we delved into the role of technology-enabled governance in addressing climate change.\nCarbon-neutral cloud: Helping our customers achieve their sustainability goals\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our carbon-neutral commitment to provide our customers with a carbon-neutral cloud. Carbon neutral means reducing GHG emissions and using carbon offsets to balance all remaining emissions related to delivering our products. This includes Scope 1, Scope 2, all Scope 3 data center-related emissions (purchased goods and services, capital goods, and fuel- and energy-related activities), business travel, and employee commuting.\n\nAchieving carbon neutrality allows us to fulfill our commitment to sustaining our planet; helps our customers with their sustainability goals (as we are included in their Scope 3 emissions); and, through investments in high-quality carbon-offset projects, diverts money to regions that are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\n\nTo focus on reducing GHG emissions associated with our data centers, we created a Global Cloud Services (GCS) sustainability working group, which aligns with our approach to net zero. Some of our 2022 accomplishments include:\n\n- **Engaging through training:** Our goal was to have 70% of our operations staff become Certified Data Center Sustainability Professionals (CDCSPs) by the end of 2022, and 100% of them certified by the end of 2023. We\u2019re pleased to report that 72.5% of our staff are certified, which is an increase of 42.5% over 2021.\n\n- **Operationalizing data collection:** We recently implemented a requirement that each colocation service provider report monthly on power usage effectiveness (PUE). In 2023, we plan to pilot real-time power data collection through integration of our internal ServiceNow platform and a data center colocation partner with the aim of reducing the administrative overhead of collecting this data.\n\n- **Tracking compliance through policies and certifications:** We track certification compliance as well as our energy sources across our colocation partners and facilities. In 2022, 10 of our 41 data centers had a recognized environmental management system in place, such as ISO14001, and seven had an energy management system. We\u2019re also pleased to report that all of our global data centers are now fitted with the cold aisle containment (CAC) solution we developed in 2021 to improve efficiency in computer room cooling.\n\n- **Investing in decarbonization:** In 2022, we laid the groundwork to invest in hardware and software solutions that improve data center power and cooling efficiencies, which will result in carbon reduction.\nCarbon Offsets\n\nTo meet our carbon-neutral commitment, we have continued our support of several high-quality carbon-avoidance and -reduction projects.\n\nFor carbon avoidance, we supported a number of cookstove projects. Cookstoves help prevent the release of carbon into the atmosphere by reducing the need for firewood. They also help reduce exposures to smoke and decrease the prevalence of respiratory diseases. These programs are in areas that are seeing the greatest impact of climate change.\n\nFor reduction programs, we support REDD+ projects, which aim to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and support conservation and sustainable management of forests to preserve forestry globally and ensure carbon storage for the future.\n\n| Project and Location                  | Description                  | Region     | Type          | Registry       |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Baksa Stoves                          | Cookstoves                   | Asia: India| Avoidance     | VCS            |\n| Kampala Stoves                        | Cookstoves                   | Africa: Uganda| Avoidance   | Gold Standard |\n| Kyoga Cookstove Project               | Cookstoves                   | Africa: Uganda| Avoidance   | Gold Standard |\n| Naija Stoves                          | Cookstoves                   | Africa: Nigeria| Avoidance   | Gold Standard |\n| Borneo Peatlands | Katingan Mentaya            | Forest protection (REDD+) | Asia: Indonesia| Reduction     | Verra, REDD+   |\n| Central Kalimantan Peatlands | Rimba Raya                  | Forest protection (REDD+) | Asia: Indonesia| Reduction     | Verra, REDD+   |\n| Pulau Borneo REDD+ 2015 Vintage       | Forest protection (REDD+)    | Asia: Indonesia| Reduction   | Verra, REDD+   |\n\nPhotography of Kyogo Cookstove Project (left) and Pulau Borneo REDD+ 2015 Vintage (right) provided by EcoAct.\nResponsible procurement\n\nResponsible procurement enables us to work with suppliers who share our purpose, values, and vision while maintaining a disciplined cost-control structure to drive better operating margins. This means considering the environmental, social, and governance impacts of our procurement policies, and collaborating with our suppliers to support their sustainability journeys to advance and fulfill our commitments.\n\nTo achieve our near-term SBTi targets, we\u2019re committed to ensuring that 65% of our suppliers by spend (purchased goods and services and capital goods) have approved science-based targets by 2026. You can see our progress here. We also added our sustainability expectations to our Global Procurement Policy and updated our Environmental Sustainability Policy to include this commitment. We sent surveys to all colocation data center providers to understand their energy and water use and asked them to read and acknowledge our environmental policy.\n\nWe continued to advance our responsible procurement material topic by engaging our suppliers and working with EcoVadis to assess their predicted risk across four themes: environment, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement. In 2022, we conducted a series of webinars, and as a result, more than 20 high-risk, strategic, and critical suppliers submitted EcoVadis surveys. The webinars and survey helped our suppliers better understand their four thematic areas and allowed them to address corrective actions that will improve their overall predicted risk score over time.\n\nOverall, more than 92 of our EcoVadis-scored suppliers made improvements and increased their scores across all four themes. With a possible score of 100 in each theme, our suppliers increased their average scores in these areas:\n\n- Environment: +5.8 points\n- Labor and human rights: +3.6 points\n- Ethics: +3.1 points\n- Sustainable procurement: +4.0 points\n\nThese initiatives lay a foundation for continued maturity of our Responsible Procurement program and contribute to ServiceNow\u2019s attractiveness as a supplier to our customers.\nWaste\n\nMinimizing waste requires an ongoing focus on reusing, reselling, e-cycling, and donating. Four years ago, we started measuring e-waste by analyzing assets reused, resold, recycled, and donated. This data allows us to identify opportunities to maximize our asset utilization, which in turn minimizes the impact of our e-waste and drives sustainable financial performance.\n\nAs an example, we implement improvements that increase the productive life of our data center equipment and consistently look for opportunities to improve asset utilization and implement improvements that may extend the productive life of our assets in the future. In 2022, we extended the useful life of servers and networking equipment from three years to four years. This change allows us to reduce our overall near-term consumption and, consequently, reduces the volume of retired data center equipment over time. The sharpest decrease is reflected this year and will stabilize over time.\n\nBeyond our e-waste, we undertook a waste reduction pilot with one of our main materials suppliers for a data center fit-out project in Germany. We achieved a more than 80% reduction in cardboard packaging used for shipping the cabling and infrastructure materials to support the project. Following the pilot, we worked with this supplier to further improve the delivery process, and we have defined a solution where we expect to eliminate 100% of cardboard and plastic packaging used for this type of project. We plan to implement this packaging reduction process starting with new data center fit-outs in Amsterdam and Dublin in 2023.\n\nOur employees are also mobilizing for change. For instance, our Hyderabad Workplace Services team replaced waste bins at each of the 2,886 workstations with centralized bins that separate trash, recyclable waste, and compost, which will result in less trash going to landfills.\n\nE-waste reused, resold, or recycled\nRetired corporate IT equipment 100% reused/recycled\n\n2022\n\n|                | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| PDUs           | 272  | 335  | 604  | 627  |\n| Servers        | 2,389| 2,751| 4,217| 4,217|\n| Switches       | 396  | 411  | 680  | 158  |\n\n2019\u20132022\n\n|                | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| PDUs           | 2,833| 4,567| 5,018| 5,760|\n| Servers        | 16,749| 19,305| 27,893| 27,531|\n| Switches       | 1,188| 396  | 411  | 680  |\n\nWe extended the useful life of servers and networking equipment from three years to four years.\nWater\n\nIt\u2019s critical we understand our water vulnerability in a rapidly changing climate. Regardless of current trends, we need to know what impact water risk could have on our operations. That means understanding if we\u2019re already being impacted, if we have any mitigation actions in place, and how quickly we can adapt.\n\nIn 2022, we completed a water risk assessment for all 72 offices and 37 data center locations. The assessment analyzed our water stress (water demand in relation to water supply) within 10 kilometers of our sites. It looked at four scenarios of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) RCP4.5 (2.4\u00b0C) and RCP8.5 (4\u00b0C) for 2030 and 2040. Our site assessment also included current climate context, country-specific water stress maps, and alternative sources of water stress projections.\n\nUsing results from the assessment, we prioritized 16 high-risk locations (three offices and 13 data centers) to look deeper into overall water vulnerability and exposure. We then worked with our Workplace Service and Data Center teams to understand each location\u2019s sensitivity to water stress and our ability to adapt. Results of this deeper dive will be reviewed in 2023.\n\nWater risk assessment\n\n**ALL LOCATIONS**\n\n**Water risk exposure assessment**\n\nConducted a water risk exposure assessment for 72 office and 37 data center locations\n\nDetermined water risk exposure level under four scenarios: IPCC RCP4.5 (low carbon) and RCP8.5 (high carbon) scenarios at 2030\u20132040 horizon\n\nIdentified priority locations based on risk level and size of office\n\n**PRIORITY LOCATIONS**\n\n**Water risk vulnerability assessment**\n\nDevelop deep dive questionnaire\n\nEngage with 16 priority locations to conduct water risk vulnerability questionnaire\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAnalyze responses from water risk vulnerability questionnaire\n\nDiscuss deep dive assessment of priority locations, water risk exposure and vulnerability ratings, and exposure maps\n\nDetermine next steps\n\n---\n\n**2022**\n\n**Water risk exposure** is water stress related to climate projections\n\n**Water risk vulnerability** is sensitivity and adaptability (sensitivity is current and potential future vulnerability of our operations to water stress and adaptability is our ability to mitigate impact from the stress)\n\n---\n\n**2023\u20132024**\n\n---\n\n1 RCP is Representative Concentration Pathway.\nCreating equitable opportunity\n\nMaking work more equitable, accessible, and rewarding for all people\nAdvancing the lives of our employees and our communities\n\n\"We\u2019re taking a relationship-driven approach to talent acquisition, ensuring empathy, flexibility, and trust throughout the process with a priority on diversity.\"\n\nSarah Tilley\nSVP, Global Talent Acquisition, ServiceNow\n\nOur people are essential to who we are, what we do, and how we\u2019ll innovate and thrive. When we listen and work together to create access to opportunities for learning and growth, we open more doors for our people, our company, our customers, and our communities to thrive. That\u2019s why we champion equitable opportunity for all and provide programs to help new and existing employees grow both personally and in their careers. It\u2019s why we encourage and enable philanthropic engagement and service. It\u2019s also why we continue to engage with and invest in our communities, choosing partners that share our values and advance our commitments and priorities.\n\nThis section provides updates on our social pillar, creating equitable opportunity, and includes progress on our people; diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); workplace health and safety, and community engagement.\nInvesting in the power of our people\n\nThe more we care for our employees and allow them to flourish, the more we succeed together. In January 2022, we launched our People Pact, which codifies our commitment to help employees live their best life, do their best work, and fulfill our purpose together. It\u2019s how we continue to make ServiceNow a place we\u2019re all proud to build our careers.\n\nThe People Pact guides all we do for our employees, with each pillar building on the others. We\u2019ve embedded it into our talent system, which is anchored by DEI, and informed by data and insights. This comprehensive system aims to recruit, retain, and develop the best talent.\n\nWe start by recruiting and hiring a diverse talent base that can bring unique experiences and points of view to the workplace. Then we provide leadership training and career growth for our employees\u2014starting when they first join ServiceNow\u2014and promote employee well-being throughout their careers with us.\n\nTo ensure transparency and action, we use the ServiceNow Platform/CHRO dashboard to provide people insights to all executives and supporting HR business partners.\n\nOur Talent System at Scale\n\n- **Diversity, equity, and inclusion**\n- **Find and hire**\n  - Workforce planning\n- **Grow and develop**\n  - From EIC up, development opportunities and career paths\n- **Perform**\n  - Performance development based on critical capabilities and desired outcomes\n- **Plan and move**\n  - Succession planning\n- **System, data, and insights**\nLive your best life: Attracting and retaining talent\n\nTo attract and retain fulfilled and healthy employees, we focus on flexibility, belonging, trust, and well-being. In 2022, we further evolved our Future of Work policy to reflect and normalize our new way of working with a growing, global, and distributed workforce. This included clearer work-from-home policies and our 30-day, work-from-anywhere benefit.\n\nFostering workplace health and safety\n\nThe health, safety, and well-being of our employees continued to be a top priority in 2022. We introduced six companywide days off per year to rest and recharge. The response from employees was overwhelmingly positive. We also launched new benefits, including a new well-being platform, Virgin Pulse, to help our employees lead healthier, happier lives, and we added new family support benefits, including Grayce, Cleo, and FertilityIQ. These help our families with everything from planning a family to raising healthy children to caring for aging or ill loved ones.\n\nA sense of belonging is critical to well-being, so we continued to amplify our DEI efforts, and to support and encourage our employee belonging groups. You can learn more about our DEI work here.\n\nOccupational health and safety\n\nOur internal Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) policy outlines our commitment to ensure the occupational health and safety of our employees, provide a safe environment for contractors and visitors to our sites, and comply with environmental, health, and safety legislation as a minimum standard. We review this policy at least once every two years, with assigned resources and responsibilities for EHS management, performance reviews, and continual improvement.\n\nWe also have an internal Injury and Illness Prevention Program policy and an Ergonomics policy. These policies detail the process for workplace security and safety, help us manage the investigation and evaluation of reported hazards, and provide methods for correcting unsafe or unhealthy conditions and work practices. In 2022, we continued the process of developing and implementing an occupational health and safety management system to cover all workers along with an alignment with ISO 45001 and ISO 45003 standards. This work will continue through 2023.\n\nNew in 2022\n\n- Six companywide well-being days off\n- Employee well-being platform (Virgin Pulse)\n- Family support benefits (e.g., Grayce, Cleo, and FertilityIQ)\n\nTo ensure occupational health and safety, we:\n\n- Track regulatory, customer, and other EHS requirements, prioritizing compliance\n- Implement programs and training to prevent injuries and illnesses arising at our workplaces and from employees\u2019 work-related activities\n- Investigate illnesses, injuries, and other EHS incidents\n- Design our workplaces to provide a safe and healthy environment\n- Recognize ergonomic risks and provide support to prevent and mitigate ergonomic injuries\n- Require contractors to follow documented EHS requirements\n- Provide employees with information, training, and, where needed, equipment to foster a culture of health and safety, and to support safe work practices\n- Implement programs to ensure effective preparedness and response to emergency situations\n- Seek feedback from employees and protect the confidentiality of personal health-related information and participation in occupational health and safety services\nDo your best work: Learning and growing at ServiceNow\n\nInspiring our people to do their best work means investing in opportunities for all employees to grow themselves, reach their goals, and make an impact on their teams and beyond.\n\nOur strategy to grow leadership through innovation is designed to develop leaders at every level, equipping them with the capabilities needed to flourish in the new world of work. In addition to programs designed to hone technical skills, we continue to implement development programs for our early-in-career colleagues and a manager-readiness program that invests in building a deeper, diverse pipeline. Our goal is to have 50% of all participants come from underrepresented groups. In 2022, nearly 50% of participants were women.\n\nTo further support our employees, in 2022 we launched a suite of tools on our ServiceNow Platform designed to offer guidance, education, and enablement to our managers and employees on their career development and role success. This includes tools that can help employees receive timely feedback to help accelerate their development and celebrate wins and successes, help managers host impactful performance and career conversations, and help employees set and achieve goals.\nWe also launched frED, our enterprise-wide learning experience platform, in October 2022. Named after our founder, Fred Luddy, it harnesses the power of the ServiceNow Platform to provide a universal learning ecosystem with content from across the organization that\u2019s available anytime, anywhere, and from any device. The platform is predictive and personalized to help employees learn and grow in ways that are tailored to their own personal and professional aspirations, while providing data on team and individual progress. Within the first four weeks of launch, frED reached more than 65% of all learners.\n\nCreating future-ready leaders\nTo further support employee growth, in 2022 we launched our enterprise-wide Leadership through Innovation program, which forms the foundation of our strategy to develop leaders. Aligned with mindsets and capabilities that are true to our values, the strategy sets up our people and our company for success\u2014and will help us become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century (DESCO21C). To date, 335 people have participated in the Leadership Mindsets and Capabilities program, including 118 people from underrepresented groups (URGs), with a 93% satisfaction rate.\n\nAdditional leadership training programs launched in 2022:\n- **People Leader Essentials (PLE):** This is a manager training program built around our leadership mindsets and capabilities, the lifecycle of work, and wellness. We brought it in-house and relaunched it, training 650 managers in 2022.\n- **PLE Connect:** This is a mentorship program designed to help managers learn from their peers.\n- **Accelerating Hybrid Teamwork:** This is a leadership program designed for our Unified Technology Group on the challenges around team dynamics and growth in a hybrid environment.\n\nLeadership Through Innovation\nDeveloping future-ready leaders for the DESCO21C\n- Accelerated Individual Contributors (ICs)\n- Executive Business Schools (EBS) for High Potential (HiPo) Directors and Sr. Directors\n- Fortune Connect (Directors)\n- Accelerate Directors\n- Accelerate Sr. Directors\n- Accelerate VPs\n\n---\n\n4 Underrepresented group (URG) includes American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Two or more races.\nFulfill our purpose together: Building an outstanding team\n\nWe pledged to create technology in service of people, and we made a commitment to each other, to our global communities, and to our customers. Fulfilling this pledge requires recruiting and developing an outstanding and diverse team of people who have a wide range of experiences and perspectives that help us focus on product development that best serves our customers.\n\nTo achieve this, we hire with intent\u2014looking at a full spectrum of talent. This includes early-in-career talent, those representing racial and gender diversity, underrepresented groups, and people from diverse areas of study. We also strive for internal mobility, promoting from within to retain and grow our top talent. Using these guideposts, we achieved strong and diverse talent acquisition numbers in 2022. Our expansion into new markets, including Poland, Malaysia, and Costa Rica, contributed to the growth.\n\nIn 2022, we hired 5,885 new employees, excluding interns. This hiring growth can also be attributed to the continued improvement and effectiveness of our work to create a more objective, consistent, inclusive approach. This includes consistent interview guides for filling specific roles.\n\nOur early-in-career hiring and internal mobility also improved. With junior talent, we draw from underrepresented groups and nontraditional study areas, when possible, to increase industry exposure and open career opportunities for growth. In 2022, we saw significant gains with these talent groups, hiring 1,425 full-time, early-in-career employees and 585 interns. Of the interns, 89% have accepted a return offer as either a full-time employee or as an extension of their internship.\n\nIn terms of mobility for our current employees, we had 2,847 promotions and 1,559 internal hires (filling an open requisition) in 2022.\n\nYou can read about the progress we\u2019ve made on DEI hires in 2022, including women in leadership roles and URGs, in our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report 2023.\nListening to our employees\nDelivering on our pledge requires listening to our employees to better understand their evolving needs and priorities. Twice a year, our employees participate in an anonymous Employee Voice Survey (EVS) to give feedback about what\u2019s working well and where we need to improve. These surveys give us a chance to show our people that we hear them and are committed to making progress. Aggregated responses are also shared with managers, who work with their teams to discuss and improve on the findings that are specific and important to the team.\n\nOverall employee engagement dropped from 82% in 2021 to 78% in 2022. We attributed this 4% point decline to external market stressors such as inflation and geopolitical issues. Yet when we looked deeper internally, the EVS revealed two pain points common for rapidly growing organizations: learning and development, and enablement. As a result, we\u2019re now focused on driving enterprise improvements across both. The areas we scored particularly high in were flexibility, manager effectiveness, and DEI.\nRiseUp with ServiceNow\n\nIn October 2022, we launched RiseUp with ServiceNow, a global program designed to skill 1 million people on the ServiceNow Platform by the end of 2024. The program will create simpler, faster, more equitable paths for diverse groups of underserved and nontraditional talent to the high-growth ServiceNow ecosystem. This affordable and flexible learning model will be built with three foundational focuses:\n\n- Lower barriers to learning\n- Expand opportunities for developing high-demand technical skills\n- Place newly skilled talent in jobs with our customers and partners\n\nThe ServiceNow Talent Acquisition team is working closely with the RiseUp with ServiceNow team to ensure that this community is part of our pipeline for diverse hiring. To expand the program\u2019s capabilities and connections further, our signature digital literacy program, NextGen, is now part of the RiseUp program. You can read about NextGen here.\n\n\u201cRiseUp opens new pathways for both technical and business talent to advance into higher-paying roles across our ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTony Colon\nSVP, Customer Success, ServiceNow\n\nDigital transformation requires talent transformation\n\n2023: Scale ServiceNow Partner Placement Program to 25 partners\n2024: Skill 1 million people on the ServiceNow Platform\n\nSystem administrator\nYou\u2019re highly organized and thrive when working with others.

To build on the progress we\u2019ve made over the past several years, in 2022 we strengthened our DEI framework to focus on three objectives:\n\n- **Enable and empower our people:** Drive a relentless commitment to employee belonging and success by enhancing equitable processes, policies, and practices across moments that matter for our employees.\n\n- **Hire with intent:** Recruit high-performing and diverse talent across all levels by designing a unique and exemplary hiring process that is global and collaborative.\n\n- **Amplify DEI impact:** Build on the global ESG/DEI movement with human ingenuity and technology by advancing DEI with like-minded customers, suppliers, and community partners.\n\nUsing these guideposts, we directly engaged and empowered each of our businesses by enhancing equitable processes, policies, and practices across the employee lifecycle and our overall talent system. We also continued our focus on DEI through our investments, sponsorships, and partnerships.\n\nAt ServiceNow, we\u2019re building a culture of trust with intent and action. Our transformation is accelerating into 2023 through our commitment to transparency, equity and accountability. Leading a continuous movement of inclusive change, we are building not just a growth company but a growth mindset.\n\nKaren Pavlin\nChief Equity and Inclusion Officer, ServiceNow\nSustained progress\n\nSince 2019, we\u2019ve achieved gains in diverse hiring across all five of our DEI representative metrics. These include women, women in leadership, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, and underrepresented groups (URGs). We\u2019re seeing progress from our integration of DEI across our talent system and have increased our 2025 URG in the U.S.\n\nGlobal gender\n\nRace and ethnicity in the U.S.\n\n2022 diversity, equity, and inclusion highlights\n\n- **3.9%** Black or African American representation (+.4% point YoY)\n- **7.2%** Hispanic or Latinx representation (+.4% point YoY)\n- **14.7%** URG representation (+.9% point YoY)\n- **32.5%** women representation globally (+1.9% points YoY)\n- **32.3%** women in leadership representation globally (+2.2% points YoY)\n\nDEI goals by 2025:\n\n- **34%** women representation globally\n- **16%** URG representation in the U.S.\nMore work to do, more goals to get us there\n\nBased on our EVS, 89% of our employees believe in our commitment to DEI. While we're proud of our progress, we still have work to do. That's why we set new public goals for 2025 and created new strategic programs to help us achieve them. These include an increased focus on building a diverse talent pipeline, retaining our diverse talent, and increasing URG representation and women in leadership in EMEA and APJ.\n\nIn 2022, we also engaged a third party to conduct an equity assessment of our talent management processes\u2014such as talent acquisition, performance, progression, and attrition\u2014allowing us to review and analyze anonymized, aggregated data to identify opportunities in attracting and developing diverse talent at ServiceNow. Looking ahead, we will work across the Global People Team Centers of Excellence like talent acquisition (TA) and talent development (TD) to ensure that we not only address recommendations from the equity assessment but also grow and develop our programs.\n\nOne of the primary measures of equity in the workplace is pay parity. We are proud that we continue to maintain systematic gender pay equity, companywide and across the globe, as well as across race and ethnicity in the U.S. We track and manage pay equity using a third party that analyzes base salary, bonuses, and commissions. ServiceNow uses that information and adjusts compensation packages when necessary. In 2022, we intensified these efforts through a third-party assessment of our end-to-end ESG metric governance processes to ensure adherence to best practices, which resulted in several suggested changes to reinforce our commitment to pay equity. For 2022, our full-year global pay adjustments affected less than 1% of our employee population and accounted for less than 0.05% of our global payroll costs.\n\nDiversity Advisory Council (DAC)\n\nTo advance DEI metrics and initiatives for each of our business functions, we tapped select senior vice presidents and vice presidents in each business function to be DAC co-leads. They, along with select senior managers and directors who are DEI ambassadors, are working with our DEI and HR teams to develop and implement customized DEI strategies for their business units, making decisions informed by DEI data and metrics. We will track results through 2023 and beyond.\n\nSupporting digital skills: Building and closing the digital divide\n\nWe continued our efforts to bring technology to all people, especially with new opportunities for youth and students in our community. For example, our partnership with the Boys and Girls Club in Morgan Hill, California, creates a safe place for children to be after school with free access to technology. Ninety-eight percent of youths served at the club come from lower-income families, making this an incredibly important investment to support them on their learning journeys.\n\nOur $100,000 grant to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) will help us discover and empower the next generation of leaders from historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and predominantly Black institutions (PBIs). We also opened the ServiceNow Tech Center at Benedict College in November 2022 as part of a $1 million multiyear strategic partnership announced in 2021 to equip underrepresented students with digital skills. This includes launching a new scholarship program and integrating our HBCU Bootcamp Program. We'll report impact numbers in our DEI report next year.\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\nTo positively impact the community, talent acquisition, employee engagement, diverse representation, and DEI corporate brand awareness, we increased our strategic partnership landscape to engage diverse communities and nonprofits. We also enhanced our customer and key business partner relationships.\n\nStrategic partnerships\n\nThe Association of Latino Professionals for America (ALPFA)\nBlack Sisters in STEM\nBlavity/AfroTech\nColorintech\nExecutive Leadership Council (ELC)\nFairyGodBoss\nGirls Who Code\nHispanic/Latino Professional Association (HLPA)\nHispanic IT Executive Council (HITEC)\nINROADS\nOut in Tech\nPowertoFly\nEmployee Belonging Groups\n\nOur employee belonging groups (EBGs) continue to grow, fostering an inclusive and welcoming culture. In 2022, membership in our nine EBGs grew an average of 42%. More than 60 events were held companywide across our nine belonging groups:\n\n- Asian and Pacific Islanders at ServiceNow\n- Black at ServiceNow\n- Families at ServiceNow\n- Interfaith at ServiceNow\n- Pride at ServiceNow\n- TruAbility at ServiceNow\n- Unidos at ServiceNow\n- Veterans at ServiceNow\n- Women at ServiceNow\n\nTruAbility was rebranded from People with Disabilities to be a more inclusive community and provide a stronger focus on neurodiversity. Our newest employee belonging group, Families at ServiceNow, elected leaders this past year and will help parents and caregivers feel more supported by collaborating with peers and sharing resources.\nSupplier diversity\n\nWe continue to foster diversity in our supplier base, which helps us shape a more diverse and inclusive world. We\u2019re pleased to report that our diverse supplier spend increased from 16% in 2021 to 19% in 2022\u2014significantly higher than the industry average of 3% to 5%.  \n\nOur goal is to make supplier diversity top of mind with our sourcing group and stakeholders who are engaged in purchasing goods and services. Through increased education, 100% of our sourcing team has now been trained. We\u2019re also creating more awareness of our Global Procurement Policy, which includes supplier diversity, and focusing on highly rated suppliers, as determined by sustainability ratings partners.\n\nWe keep ourselves accountable through our spend management tool, which gives us more visibility and a more holistic picture. We also make our quarterly Tier II spend available to any customers who request it. Furthermore, by adding more visibility around diversity in our RFPs, we can verify ahead of time that we\u2019ve included at least one diverse supplier in that process. However, it\u2019s not enough to just include diverse suppliers in our RFPs; we must also track when they are included in our sourcing activities or rewarded with the business. That\u2019s why we plan to develop an RFP tool to track this information in 2023.\n\n2022 milestones on our diverse supplier journey\n\nWe became members of the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NSMDC) and Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), which together provide access to almost 20,000 diverse suppliers.\n\nWe updated our supplier diversity statement on our outward-facing website to better define it and encourage diverse suppliers to share their information with our sourcing team through our new supplier diversity mailbox. Multiple diverse suppliers have since reached out to us to be included in our vendor base.\n\nWe added language to our global procurement policy expressing our intention to actively seek out, develop, and build meaningful procurement relationships with minority-owned, women-owned, disabled individual-owned, and small businesses to create equitable opportunities when procuring goods and services.\n\n* Karina Swette and Timi Boyo, \u201cTracking the Supplier Diversity Dollar,\u201d Oliver Wyman.\nCreating impact through community engagement\n\nOur commitment to make the world work better extends to our local and global communities, which we support through strategic investments and partnerships, as well as continuously engaging our employees through leadership opportunities and a range of volunteering.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to build on the four focus areas where we know we can have the greatest impact: decarbonization, racial and gender equity (we expanded this category from racial equity), digital readiness, and disaster response. We also completed our first assessment to measure and understand our total social impact. Understanding the impact we\u2019re having led us to set a companywide goal to reach 20 million people by 2030 across our four focus areas. We will start reporting on our progress in 2024.\n\nServiceNow\u2019s commitment to funding GivePower\u2019s Solar Water Farm Max in Mshomoroni, Kenya, will provide 20 years of access to clean water for over 168,000 people in need.\n\nMichele Magee\nPresident, GivePower Foundation\nTotal Social Investment\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our overall calculation methodology to include a more holistic look at our investment based on CECP\u2019s Total Social Investment calculation. Our Total Social Investment is a measure of Community Investment plus Total Social Value. In addition, we calculated the Total Social Impact of our nonprofit partnerships.\n\nTo gain a holistic understanding of our Total Social Investment and learn the true impact we\u2019re having through our work, 2022 marked the first year of our five-year journey to measure our Total Social Investment across the \u201cS\u201d in ESG by 2026.\n\n**Total Social Investment** is a monetary input metric. The metric sums up all the company\u2019s resources used for \u201cS\u201d in ESG efforts that affect social capital and respond to social issues from the year.\n\n**Community Investment** is made up of our corporate matching gifts and rewards, employee-inspired volunteering, corporate cash grants, and donor-advised fund (DAF) cash grants.\n\n**Total Social Value** includes broader partnerships (community investment partnerships with nonprofit organizations that go beyond cash grants to a holistic view of what a company can offer to a nonprofit organization) and shared strategies (business strategies that materially and significantly incorporate social outcomes).\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to share that we delivered $20.3 million in Total Social Investment which includes $11.7 million in Community Investment and $8.6 million in Total Social Value.\nAmplifying our in-kind donation program\n\nIn 2022, we formally launched an in-kind donation program. This includes the donation of our products and services to nonprofits to enable greater efficiencies and help them better serve their communities. We also collaborate with our partners to deliver on some of our in-kind donations. In 2022, ServiceNow provided six in-kind donations to nonprofits with a value of over $1.7 million.\n\nA matchmaking app that saves lives\n\nSince the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, millions of Ukrainians have been displaced. The U.S. government wanted to bring 100,000 Ukrainians into the country as soon as possible, yet to be a sponsor, American families needed a connection to Ukrainian family members or friends. And that created a huge hurdle.\n\nTo address this, an innovative new app from ServiceNow is serving as a needed digital matchmaker. Designed for the nonprofit Welcome U.S., the app lets Americans sponsor refugees and Ukrainians drive their own sponsorship experience.\n\nThe app was conceived, developed, and launched in just 2.5 weeks by an all-volunteer team of ServiceNow employees who collaborated with Goldman Sachs and Infosys.\n\nWithin the first few hours of going live, hundreds of refugees had securely signed up. In addition to changing the lives of refugees and sponsors, creating the app was an incredibly fulfilling experience for the ServiceNow volunteers.\n\n\u201c\nIt\u2019s not every day that you get to work on a project that\u2019s actually saving lives.\n\nSara L.\nDirector, Top Accounts, ServiceNow\nSignature programs serving our community\n\nWe continued to broaden the impact of our two signature community engagement programs: NextGen and Incubators and Accelerators.\n\nNextGen\nSince inception, over 10,000 NextGen beneficiaries have been trained on the ServiceNow Platform, including more than 4,700 NextGen beneficiaries in 2022. In the same year, we brought the NextGen program in-house and tapped our own training expertise in order to achieve a tenfold increase in the number of participants per cohort\u2014growing from approximately 20 per cohort to 200 in the fall of 2022. The impact of this growth is threefold:\n\nMore people going through the program.\nWe launched our first 200-person cohort in the fall, using an innovative training model in which large classes were broken into smaller groups of 10 to 20 people and assigned a teaching assistant (TA). The TAs met with the smaller groups daily, answered questions, supported learners with resources, and cheered on individuals when the material was challenging.\n\nMentorship program to provide more support for our beneficiaries.\nAs employment is our most important metric of success, we are restructuring our mentorship program to provide focus and feedback on the job search process. In 2023, mentees and mentors will meet in small groups to systematically build the skills participants will need to obtain employment in the ServiceNow ecosystem.\n\nFocus on diverse and often underrepresented groups.\nWe partnered with our ESG team to identify nonprofits that can reach Black Americans, refugees, indigenous populations, women returning to work, and those living below the poverty line. We provided cash grants to these organizations so they can provide stipends and wraparound services to support those most in need.\n\nRead more about NextGen and those we\u2019ve helped here, along with some of our partnerships, such as Code Differently, NSW TAFE in Australia, and Northeastern University in the UK.\n\nBecause of the synergy between our two digital workforce initiatives, our NextGen digital literacy program is now part of RiseUp with ServiceNow.\n\n74%\nNextGen beneficiary growth in 2022\n\nLessons learned\n\nDespite NextGen\u2019s growth in India, we didn\u2019t anticipate that businesses would be hesitant to hire alternative talent, which resulted in lower-than-expected employment rates in 2022.\n\nTo remedy this, we are working with an underserved university in poor and rural areas of the country, including Andhra Pradesh, to increase opportunities. Here, 30 students were trained and employed.\n\nAnother important step was redirecting some of our staff to focus purely on employability. We conducted job fairs and employer engagement to assist with employment and career education for NextGen participants, allowing them to take ownership of their job search.\n\nThe ServiceNow SkillBridge program aligns perfectly with the attitude and vision of my new team in Customer Outcomes, and it allowed me to seamlessly move into the ecosystem. The knowledge I gained gave me a foundation to build on, while the exposure to various personas\u2014trainers, curriculum developers, partners\u2014helped me understand the overall ServiceNow culture and climate.\n\nNolan T.\nPilot Program Graduate and ServiceNow Employee\nIncubators and Accelerators\n\nOur investment supports nonprofits and businesses that are focused on creating a better world through technology. In 2022, we continued to evolve our program and added two new strategic partners: Fast Forward and Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE).\n\nFast Forward supports startups that combine the best technology with sustainable nonprofit business models. As one of its premiere partners, we sponsored its core program with a cohort of nine tech nonprofits, participated in demo days, and did micro-mentoring with the cohort leaders. More than 30 ServiceNow employees helped them fine-tune their pitches at a pitch camp event.\n\nNetwork for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) is a global educational nonprofit that brings the power of entrepreneurship to youth in low-income communities. We partnered with them to create the \u201cCarbon Killer Challenge,\u201d which addresses United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (affordable and sustainable clean energy). We invited youth from around the world to think of ideas for how communities can reduce carbon emissions. Our CEO, Bill McDermott, kicked off the partnership on Innovation Day, and 15 ServiceNow employees helped the students come up with potential solutions.\nEncouraging employee engagement\n\nWe\u2019re proud of our employees\u2019 commitment to helping their communities and causes they care about. In 2022, our employees showed up in very big ways to support their communities and exemplified what it means when we say we are stronger together.\n\nRise Against Hunger:\nEmployees packed over 1 million meals for Rise Against Hunger during departmental-wide events and our Month of Service.\n\nOne Tree Planted:\nFor Earth Day and April Sustainability Month, we partnered with One Tree Planted, where ServiceNow employees participated in 12 tree-planting and tree-restoration projects around the globe. In all, more than 1,900 trees were planted. We also planted a tree for every new hire in 2022 and provided a grant that allowed the nonprofit to plant another 340,000 trees. Read the story here.\n\nTo encourage even more participation and to weave in our People Pact, we localized our engagement efforts; leaned into what our employees want, such as skills-based volunteering opportunities; and continued giving them 20 hours paid time off to volunteer. We saw an increase in employee community engagement in 2022, driven in large part by an increase in volunteer hours, plus the fact we now include rewards redemption in our metrics. This includes Dollars for Doers, which rewards employees with $10 in their Giving at Now account for every volunteer hour logged (up to 20 hours), along with new-hire rewards and rewards from their teams. All of this helps our employees continue to give during tough economic times.\n\nWith an increased focus on skilled volunteering opportunities in 2022, employees used their skill sets to lean into the art of the possible with the ServiceNow Platform.\n\nThis year, we launched a new program where employees used their skill sets to create an app prototype with nonprofits to help track donations. Our end goal is to create a catalog of solutions specifically designed to support nonprofits in their daily operations.\n\nAn app built by the people for the people\n\nIn 2022, Nishant A., a principal technical consultant for Creator Workflows at ServiceNow, was trying to donate a couch when he realized how a lack of technology can severely limit the daily operations of nonprofits. Recognizing how ServiceNow technology could help, he worked with a group of employees to spearhead the design, development, and piloting of a resource management app that helps nonprofits manage and track their in-kind donations. The project was 100% volunteer- and employee-led. Read the story.\n\n\u201cKeeping customers happy is one thing. Building something for society is another.\u201d\n\nNishant A.\nPrincipal Technical Consultant, ServiceNow\nActing with Integrity\n\nBuilding trust through ethical, transparent, and secure business practices\nAddressing complexity with strong governance\n\n\"As the world becomes more complex, ESG-related reporting and regulatory requirements are increasing, fueling the demand for clear oversight and stronger governance.\"\n\nRussell Elmer\nGeneral Counsel, ServiceNow\n\nAt ServiceNow, governance underpins the effectiveness of our ESG strategy and how we engage with all of our stakeholders. We continue to build trust and integrity with our stakeholders by enhancing our disclosures related to corporate governance and business ethics, security and data privacy, and business continuity.\n\nOver the past year, we took several steps to strengthen our corporate governance over ESG. We conducted an internal audit of selected ESG metrics and worked with a Big Four consulting firm to conduct an ESG metric governance maturity assessment. We also adopted a new policy on corporate political contributions and industry associations. And, as part of our business ethics program, we rolled out a new human rights training for our employees\u2014further embedding our commitment to respect human rights into our operations and culture.\n\nIn addition, we advanced our security and data privacy practices by hiring more security professionals as well as expanding our data privacy efforts in the EU. And we\u2019re evolving our business continuity programs to mitigate the highest-risk events that could affect us and our customers.\n\nThis next section provides updates on our governance pillar, acting with integrity, and includes progress on corporate governance and business ethics, emerging technology and ethics, security and data privacy, and business continuity.\nCorporate governance and business ethics\n\nESG governance: Clear oversight and regulatory preparedness\n\nOur governance framework keeps us aligned with, accountable to, and transparent for our stakeholders. Clear oversight and strong governance are foundational to the effectiveness of our environmental and social impact and ensure the rigor and auditability of the data we publicly disclose.\n\nWe're strengthening the foundation we've built over the last three years by enhancing oversight, programs, and procedures of our ESG disclosures so that we're prepared to meet market and regulatory expectations. This ensures we focus on the integrity and quality of our data\u2014with evidence to back it up\u2014and affirms that our ESG metrics tell an accurate story of our progress.\n\nWe're also working to ensure the accuracy and auditability of our ESG data in preparation for emerging regulations. We began the year by conducting an internal audit of our key ESG metrics, which was reviewed by the Audit Committee.\n\nIn May 2022, we began work with a third-party consulting firm and stakeholders across the business to conduct an in-depth assessment of our ESG metric governance maturity. We mapped metric process flows and systems; identified potential risks, gaps, and controls; and developed roadmaps to mature our metric governance.\n\nHelping to ensure the integrity of published ESG data has become a priority for Internal Audit and the Audit Committee.\n\nBrian Foster\nVP Audit Risk and Control Assurance, ServiceNow\n\nNominating and governance committee of the board of directors\nCharter includes overseeing and periodically reviewing environmental, social, and governance activities, programs, and public disclosures\n\nAudit committee of the board of directors\nCharter includes reviewing company\u2019s processes, procedures, and validation surrounding the company\u2019s ESG governance disclosures\n\nExecutive management team\nGina Mastantuono, CFO (ESG executive sponsor)\nEmbed ESG into our vision to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century\n\nESG steering committee\nCorporate strategy, customer & partner, finance, global cloud services, global sourcing & sustainability, legal, marketing, people, product, risk & control assurance, sales, IT/security\nGuide ServiceNow\u2019s global impact (ESG) strategy, goals, and progress\n\nESG initiative business owners\nOversee ServiceNow\u2019s top global impact initiatives across strategy pillars\nIn addition, from 2022 through early 2023, we reached out to approximately 60% of our shareholder base and spoke with approximately 54% of them to gather feedback on our ESG strategy. We will incorporate this input, as well as feedback from ESG ratings and customer and partner engagements, as we continue to increase the transparency of our disclosures while creating an accessible, readable Global Impact Report 2023. In 2022, our commitment to enhance transparency resulted in increasing or maintaining our ESG ratings:\n\n- CDP Climate Change Questionnaire: B (+two levels YoY)\n- EcoVadis: 60/Silver (+6 points/+one level YoY)\n- MSCI: AA (no change YoY)\n- S&P Global CSA: 52 (+9 points YoY)\n\nOnce again, we were named as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America and JUST Capital\u2019s JUST 100.\n\nWe use our own solutions in areas of governance, risk, and compliance to help develop better solutions for our customers\u2014from complying with new laws and regulations to facing the challenges that come with the ethical use of data, privacy issues, and security.\n\n**Political advocacy**\n\nOngoing litigation around the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program means the future is uncertain for many members of our community. That\u2019s why we took action to seek justice and opportunities for Dreamers. To support our employees and their communities, we signed a letter from the Coalition for the American Dream calling on Congress to pass a permanent, bipartisan legislative solution that would enable Dreamers who are living, working, and contributing in the U.S. to continue doing so.\n\nIn 2022, we also developed our new policy on corporate political contributions and industry associations, which received board approval in January 2023. This policy provides enhanced guidance for our employees, oversight by our board, and annual voluntary disclosure on our website and in this Global Impact Report 2023.\n\n**Now on Now: Policy Compliance and Management**\n\nDuring 2022, we evolved our Policy Management framework by streamlining workflows and centralizing policy management through our Policy Compliance and Management (PCM) solution. This was done to improve transparency and efficiency, and to allow stakeholders to easily manage their documents. Additionally, we enhanced customer access to crucial documentation through CORE (Compliance Operations Readiness Evidence), while ensuring that consistent NDAs were implemented. PCM helps us optimize the e-signature process to meet complex regulatory requirements and reduce friction for employees while bolstering the strength and auditability of our documentation. These efforts align with our goal of driving visibility across the company.\nBusiness ethics\n\nWe infuse integrity, teamwork, and trust into everything we do. These qualities are core to our Code of Ethics, and\u2014along with our values and purpose\u2014they\u2019re how we make sure we do the right thing for our company and our stakeholders.\n\nThrough our Speak Up program, we provide employees with an easy and confidential way to raise concerns without fear of retaliation. This helps ensure we have the appropriate initiatives in place to maintain a safe, inclusive, and honest work environment.\n\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to make our programs accessible and inclusive by localizing our training and Code of Ethics, and in 2022, we saw the results of these efforts. More people in regions outside of the United States participated in the Speak Up program than in years past.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to upholding human rights laws and regulations, standing strongly against discrimination of any kind, and building inclusive skills and mindsets. As part of our continued commitment to respecting human rights, at the end of 2022, we rolled out new-employee training on this important topic. Available through our frED learning platform, this training complements our Human Rights Statement and provides more awareness around business and human rights.\n\nTogether, these efforts can help us achieve tangible results for individuals in the communities we serve, thereby contributing to a sustainable and thriving society.\n\nEmerging Tech and Ethics\n\nWe recognize our duty to use AI responsibly, and in 2022, we developed the Responsible AI Working Group, made up of stakeholders across our Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning teams. This working group meets under the umbrella of the Data Ethics Council, which includes cross-functional key leaders who work together to consider the key aspects and challenges around how we use data\u2014including any ethical crossroads\u2014to provide guidance based on our values and purpose.\n\nOne of the goals of the Responsible AI Working Group is to develop principles to ensure that ServiceNow teams responsibly develop new ServiceNow products and services that use AI. The first meeting was held in early 2023. We expect the AI/ML development principles to be approved in 2023 while the group continues to address responsible AI/ML use and other emerging technology.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to engage with industry peers through our membership in trade associations. These groups include the Business Software Alliance and the Information Technology Industry Council. Through these engagements, we\u2019re able to discuss and stay aware of the latest developments in AI/ML and technology-related legislation.\nSecurity and data privacy\n\nWe take a comprehensive approach to security and data privacy governance. We\u2019re vigilant in securing the data customers entrust to us. We use our ServiceNow Platform and solutions\u2014along with guidance from a cross-functional digital technology team and business stakeholders\u2014to ensure the way we collect, process, and retain customer data aligns with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nOur board of directors also reviews material security risks and control gaps on a regular basis to ensure we\u2019re continuously improving. To this end, in 2022, the board sponsored an independent cyber audit from a Big Four firm to assess our controls against the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework. The audit found that ServiceNow significantly exceeds the benchmark of our peers. In addition, every employee at ServiceNow is expected to contribute to our data security efforts. We require employees to complete privacy and security training each year. Learn more at our Trust and Compliance Center.\n\nWe continue to make strategic investments focused on maturing our data security and privacy practices to forge trusted relationships with our customers. In 2022, we hired more than 90 additional security professionals, expanding the team to more than 300 worldwide\u2014all focused on effectively managing and mitigating cybersecurity-related risks. In addition, we launched a Customer Data Processing Agreement and Data Security Agreement to further clarify ServiceNow\u2019s privacy commitment to customers and their data.\n\nUsing the ServiceNow Platform, we continue to make our security operations, vendor risk management, and vulnerability management programs more efficient.\n\nCollaborating to advance SaaS security\n\nCritical infrastructure operators rely on software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers to deliver services essential for core operations. In early 2022, ServiceNow led the formation of the Critical Software-as-a-Service Special Interest Group (CSaaS-SIG) under the framework of the IT Information Sharing and Analysis Center. We continue to act as chair for the group. Its purpose is to collaborate on a collective defense strategy to improve the security and operational resiliency of its services, accelerate the sharing of cyber threat information, and advance data protection and privacy initiatives among cloud service providers. Together with other industry leaders, ServiceNow is coordinating the development of enhanced defense tools and mechanisms to offer stronger security across the SaaS cloud industry. To learn more, watch this video on IT-ISAC advancements.\nDoubling down on data privacy\n\nServiceNow constantly monitors and responds to changes in the data security and privacy regulatory landscape, both in the U.S. and abroad. In 2022, to help our customers navigate changing privacy regulations in the EU, we launched the ServiceNow Protected Platform for the European Union (SPP EU), which minimizes data transfers out of the EU when customers use ServiceNow products.\n\nIn 2022, we also earned the EU Cloud Code of Conduct Certification\u2014one of the first industry certifications specific to cloud service providers and approved by European data protection authorities. This recognition demonstrates how ServiceNow remains compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nOur newest certifications\n\nWe added or expanded five global cloud certifications, authorizations, and attestations in 2022. See the full list in the Annex.\n\n1. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP)\n2. DoD Impact Level 5 Authorization (for U.S. DoD/IC entities)\n3. EU Cloud Code of Conduct\n4. ISMAP Cloud Service\n5. SSAE 18/ISAE 3402 SOC 1 for Hybrid Singapore Cloud\n\nOur state of security\n\n- Follow BSIMM application security standard\n- Align with common controls risk frameworks (NIST, ISO, FAIR, etc.), which cover cross-industry standards\nBusiness continuity\n\nOver the years, our business resiliency has been tested in a wide range of circumstances, including the COVID-19 pandemic and other global business continuity events. We\u2019re particularly challenged with planning for natural disasters that are becoming more intense and frequent, such as hurricanes, typhoons, wildfires, storms, and flooding. However, through our business continuity policies and procedures, we\u2019re now better positioned to mitigate high-risk disruptions using a people-first approach.\n\nFor example, when Hurricane Ian hit Florida, we activated the Incident Management response framework, including welfare checks and emergency responses for our impacted employees. For those who were safe, we verified their work availability. If employees were unable to work, their duties were transferred to teams on the West Coast who had the capacity to accommodate. Our incident management team also activated a community response in collaboration with our community engagement team.\n\nSeasonal tabletop exercises are continuously conducted, including hurricane and wildfire scenarios, to ensure our business continuity processes are updated and teams are prepared for adequate response.\n\n\u201cBusinesses don\u2019t plan to fail. They fail to plan.\u201d\n\nValerie Spillman\nSenior Director, Internal Audit and Enterprise Risk, ServiceNow\n\nState of Florida\n\nIn 36 hours, the state of Florida stood up an app using the ServiceNow Platform that helped identify and track missing family members during Hurricane Ian. Within the first day, more than 500 people reported missing family members.\nIncorporating privacy into Business Continuity Management (BCM)\n\nIn 2022, the BCM policy was updated to include integration with our Privacy team. Each time the business continuity process is invoked and it\u2019s determined that it impacts the Privacy team, it\u2019s now informed. The policy outlines how the Privacy team would support a privacy event, including roles and responsibilities\u2014for example, a hurricane disrupting a data center, resulting in a data breach.\n\nEnhancing our BCM program\n\nAt the end of 2022, we migrated to the latest version of our commercial BCM application on our ServiceNow Platform, using the power of our latest product offerings to enhance our own BCM program procedures. This application will manage our planning documentation, conduct business impact analysis, and document the business continuity exercises performed with different business functions and teams. Since documentation is managed in one place, we can use the power of our platform to ensure a single source of truth.\n\nAdapting to the world of work\n\nThe way enterprises work is constantly changing. Hence, our BCM processes are updated to accommodate employees who work from the office and/or remotely. For example, we consider employees\u2019 preferred work location before performing a welfare check to ensure their safety and work continuity.\n\nHow we build resiliency\n\n- 99.993% average uptime (99.8% SLA)\n- 30+ data centers with top-tier providers\n- Real-time availability dashboard\n- Multi-instance architecture\n- Automated transfer and failover\n- Fully redundant cloud infrastructure with 24/7 site reliability\n- Tier 1 ISPs in all geographies\nOur work is never done\n\nTackling global challenges and leading a thriving company go hand in hand. At ServiceNow, we enable our customers to do both\u2014even when it seems like only one choice is possible. It\u2019s how we put YES to work. By finding opportunity in uncertainty, we can accomplish more than we ever thought possible\u2014empowering people to live their best lives, lead ethical businesses, and heal and protect the world we all share.\n\nOur plans for 2023 include:\n\n**Our technology**\n- Focus on expanding the ESG-related capability of key products and their connectivity to the ESG Management solution\n- Build the foundation for future products around Green IT, responsible procurement, and employee engagement\n- Enable nonprofits to create greater efficiencies utilizing the ServiceNow Platform with ServiceNow.org\n\n**Environmental**\n- Conduct a qualitative climate risk scenario analysis\n- Continue to apply digital transformation to improve the operationalizing of our new data center monitoring platform to measure, understand, and modify environmental indicators such as temperature, cooling, and power usage\n- Assess the vulnerability of our high-water-stress sites and implement recommendations to address any issues we find\n\n**Social**\n- Accelerate efforts to expand our women in leadership\n- Increase awareness of ServiceNow as an employer in underutilized markets\n- Evolve our community engagement program to reach 20 million people by 2030\n- Help nonprofits with their technology needs through ServiceNow.org\n- Launch SkillBridge/ServiceNow Apprenticeship Program pilot and NextGen Guided On-Demand Program\n- Expand academic partnerships through RiseUp with ServiceNow\n\n**Governance**\n- Maintain or improve our ESG ratings and rankings\n- Expand localization efforts for our ethics and compliance training to more regions\n- Continue to review data privacy and security programs to support our commitment to protecting security and data privacy for our ecosystem\n- Evolve our BCM policies to include consistent testing for high-risk weather events that can disrupt our customers\n- Broaden the scope of our business impact analysis\nESG materiality\n\nWe engage in a wide variety of activities to support our ESG strategies. While we disclose what we believe to be the material items in this report, certain information may not be disclosed within our Annex if it is not considered material, privileged, or confidential; could cause a competitive disadvantage to our business if publicly disseminated; or is not currently collected in a manner wholly correlated with the related ESG metric.\n\nIn 2022 we partnered with BSR, a third party, nonprofit sustainability consultancy, to conduct the new best practice of double materiality, assessing impact on enterprise value, society at large, and the environment for our ESG material issues. In this assessment, we identified and defined our list of ESG material issues. BSR interviewed internal senior ServiceNow staff, representing multiple business functions, as well as external partner, customer, supplier, investor, and industry thought leader stakeholders. Additionally, we benchmarked tech industry peers and assessed ESG trends and issues. Lastly, we synthesized and scored the issues, then prioritized the results based on impact.\n\nOur ESG material issues remained the same year over year, with some adjustments to tiering as we adapted to the new double impact methodology. Responsible procurement moved from Tier 3 to Tier 2. Given 77% of our carbon footprint came from our suppliers in 2022, engaging suppliers will be critical to achieving our climate targets. Emerging technology and ethics moved from Tier 1 to Tier 2. ServiceNow\u2019s usage of AI for general business processes does not pose a significant impact on the environment, society, or business. Workplace health and safety moved from a Tier 2 to Tier 3. In 2022, our adoption of a largely hybrid / remote workforce, combined with the rollout of vaccines, has resulted in this issue falling in prioritization. Our material issues are noted below as Tier 1, 2, or 3 and guide the content of this report. Tier 1 are the topics that have the greatest opportunity for impact.\n\nStandards and regulations in this area are evolving, and we will continue to develop and adapt our reporting accordingly.\n\n| Tier 1 issues | Business continuity | Climate and energy | Corporate governance and business ethics | Diversity, equity, and inclusion | Our people | Security and data privacy |\n|---------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|\n| High impact on business, society, and environment | | | | | | |\n\n| Tier 2 issues | Community engagement | Emerging technology and ethics | Responsible procurement | Technology solutions for people and our planet |\n|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Medium impact on business, society, and environment | | | | |\n\n| Tier 3 issues | Waste | Water | Workplace health and safety |\n|---------------|-------|-------|-----------------------------|\n| Low impact on business, society, and environment | | | |\n## Stakeholders\n\nWe engage a broad set of stakeholders across our value chain as part of delivering on our ESG strategy and fulfilling our purpose.

Included in carbon-neutral boundary for 2022: Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (market-based) data center-related emissions (Category 1: purchased goods and services, Category 2: capital goods, Category 3: fuel and energy-related activities, Category 6: business travel, and Category 7: employee commuting).\n2. Business travel includes all flights, accommodations, ground transportation, and all travel-related business.\n3. All Scope 3 emissions are Market-based.\n4. South Korea renewable energy certificates (RECs) were sourced from the nearest available geography (China) and Singapore renewable energy certificates (RECs) were sourced from the nearest available geography (Thailand) for 2022. While these RECs contribute to ServiceNow\u2019s 100% renewable electricity coverage, according to the GHG protocol, they cannot be used to reduce the Scope 2 (Market-based) emissions as the RECs purchased are not in the market of use. This is reflected in Scope 2 (Market-based) emissions above.\n5. Other fuels refers to natural gas from offices and jet fuel for private executive flights.\n6.

It receives briefings, at least twice a year, from ServiceNow\u2019s ESG Steering Committee, which is chaired by the CFO.  \n\u2022 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the Company\u2019s risk management and control processes, including those for assessing and managing environmental-, social-, and governance (ESG)-related risks, which are addressed at least twice a year. Should a specific climate-related risk require more immediate attention, the Chief Audit Executive will raise it with the Committee during their regular quarterly meetings.  \n\u2022 The process for communicating critical concerns to the Board of Directors leverages input from the Risk and Compliance Steering Committee, executive management, and the annual risk assessment results. These are collated and distributed to the Board of Directors on an annual basis or ad-hoc, pending criticality. | NGC Charter  \nAudit Committee Charter  \nCDP Report (C1.1a, C1.1b)  \nClimate Risk and Opportunity Management Standard Operating Procedure (internal) |\n| b. Management\u2019s role | Disclose details of the process by which management is informed of and manages climate-related risks and opportunities. | \u2022 The ESG Steering Committee, which is chaired by the CFO, is responsible for overseeing the management of climate-related risks and opportunities. The ESG Steering Committee, which meets quarterly, and reviews risk and opportunity owners, sponsors strategies for addressing the risks and opportunities, and measurement and reporting of performance.  \n\u2022 The Risk and Compliance Steering Committee receives concerns and escalations identified by the Climate Risk and Opportunity Working Group which meet at least once a year.  \n\u2022 The climate-related risk and opportunity assessment process adopts standard Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) methods and criteria used at ServiceNow to identify climate-related risks and opportunities, assess significance, assign risk and opportunity owners, and track the effectiveness of control measures.  \n\u2022 The effectiveness of the assessment and controls process will be addressed at least once a year by the ERM team (including Business Continuity Management) and reported to the ESG Steering Committee.  \n\u2022 The Director of Environmental Sustainability reports to the SVP of Global Sourcing and Workplace Services, who sits on the ESG Steering Committee, and is responsible for monitoring and reporting on climate-related issues, including progress towards overall climate-related goals. | CDP Report (C1.2)  \nClimate Risk and Opportunity Management Standard Operating Procedure (internal) |\n| **Strategy**         |                  |            |           |\n| a.

These include the short- and mid-term impact of increasing frequency/severity of climate-driven weather events, and longer-term changes in mean temperatures, weather patterns, and sea levels. Short- and mid-term transitional risks including increased energy and carbon costs, emerging regulatory requirements, and investor-led reporting requirements were also identified.  \n\u2022 Potential opportunity drivers were also identified, including enhanced business continuity and resilience planning, value-chain decarbonization, industry climate leadership, impact investing, and customer demand for sustainable products and solutions. | CDP Report (C2.1, C2.3, C2.4) |\n### Topic and focus area\n\n| Disclosure focus | Disclosure | Reference |\n|------------------|------------|-----------|\n| **b.

Process for managing risk** | Describe organization's process for managing climate-related risks. | CDP Report C2.1, C2.2 |\n\n- The process and methodology for identifying climate-related risks and opportunities includes regular assessment, review, and research of climate-related customer, employee, and investor concerns, peer group priorities and strategies, and regulatory developments. Risk owners assess the business impact of research findings and work with subject matter experts to develop the appropriate response.\n- The research and analysis findings are assessed by risk and opportunity owners and subject matter experts in facilitated workshops for the annual climate-related risk and opportunity assessment. The workshops rank the risk and opportunities in relation to their impact on ServiceNow's strategic objectives and performance, and the effectiveness of strategies and control measures is also discussed.\n- As a platform as a service business, and after taking into consideration the cost of energy and carbon, and business resiliency and continuity planning processes currently in place for critical infrastructure and operations, ServiceNow's residual physical and transitional climate-related risks are assessed to be low. Should the residual risk increase in the future, more detailed scenario analysis may be performed.\n- In 2022, we conducted a water risk assessment for all 72 office locations and 37 data center locations (planned and existing) based on four scenarios (2.4\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C temperature increases and 2030 and 2040 time horizons). For any high risk locations identified, we plan to conduct a deeper assessment in 2023.\n- In 2022, we partnered with a third-party climate consultancy to conduct a climate health assessment for our climate-related risks and opportunities screening to determine a baseline gap with the TCFD guidance and to prepare for conducting qualitative and quantitative climate scenario analyses in subsequent years. We plan to conduct the qualitative climate scenario analysis in 2023 followed by a quantitative climate scenario analysis in 2024.\n- Opportunities for industry leadership, through our Net-Zero commitment, and the opportunity to accelerate customer climate strategies with our ServiceNow Platform and workflow solutions are assessed to be higher and detailed in our Global Impact Report.\n- Climate-related risks are assessed and managed within the umbrella of ServiceNow's ERM framework and methodology in our Global Impact Report. Risk drivers are assessed for potential regulatory, operational, reputational, employee and marketplace impacts using scales for impact severity and likelihood (i.e., probability of occurrence within a given timeframe) to establish an inherent risk rating. Control strategies are documented, and their effectiveness assessed to determine residual risk ratings and any gaps and improvement opportunities.\n- Climate-related risks and opportunities identified are assigned \u201cowners\u201d. Risk and opportunity owners are typically leaders and managers of key business functions across the organization. They are responsible for developing strategies and mitigation plans and incorporating them into their functional strategic and financial planning in line with the company\u2019s priorities or strategic objectives. On an annual basis, risk and opportunity owners formally brief functional management and the Climate Risk and Opportunity working group.\n- Semi-annually, the Climate Risk and Opportunity working group meets to identify and review persistent, strategic, and new climate-related risks and opportunities. The working group\u2019s responsibilities include:\n  - Review climate risk and opportunity register annually, ensure climate risks and opportunities are captured and ranked, and climate action plans are documented.\n  - Review alignment of ServiceNow\u2019s response to climate risks and opportunities with strategic and operational objectives.\n  - Monitor climate risk and opportunity identification and assessment exercises conducted for new/emerging and changing climate risks and opportunities impacting business strategy and objectives as needed.\n  - Review responses and resource allocations to optimize efforts and performance.\n- In 2022, a majority of data center operations staff earned independent certification in Certified Data Center Sustainability Professional (CDCSP\u00ae) training to better identify and manage climate-related risks within data center operations.\n| Topic and focus area | Disclosure focus | Disclosure | Reference |\n|----------------------|------------------|------------|-----------|\n| Risk management      |                  |            |           |\n| c. Integration into overall risk management | Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization's overall risk management. | - Climate-related physical and transitional risks are listed in an enterprise climate-related risk and opportunity register under four categories: business growth, business operations, financial performance and economic conditions. On an annual basis, they are assessed and managed within the umbrella of ServiceNow's ERM framework and assessment methodology. Risk drivers are assessed for potential regulatory, operational, reputational, employee and marketplace impacts using scales for impact severity and likelihood (i.e. probability of occurrence within a given timeframe) to establish an inherent risk rating. Control strategies are documented, and their effectiveness assessed to determine residual risk ratings and any gaps and improvement opportunities.  \n- Individual climate-related risk drivers identified during the annual climate-related risk and opportunity assessment are also mapped to other strategic, operational, financial, regulatory, reputational, and information technology and security risks and are therefore also subject to the oversight and controls provided to them.  \n- For example, the impact of more extreme weather events maps to and is included in the assessment of business continuity management. Policies and procedures are maintained to assess and manage business continuity risks and their effectiveness is also subject to Board oversight and reporting.  \n- Climate and energy is identified as a potential strategic enterprise risk by ServiceNow and is tracked as part of its ERM approach. | CDP Report C2.1, C2.2  \nBusiness continuity  \nClimate Risk and Opportunity Management Standard  \nOperating Procedure (internal) |\n| Metrics and targets |                  |            |           |\n| a.
