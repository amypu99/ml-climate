This aspiration drives us to go further, do more and innovate new solutions that ensure everyone has a seat at Sysco\u2019s table.\n\nGrounded in our purpose is our Recipe for Growth strategy, which fosters responsible and purposeful growth across five pillars: digital, product solutions, supply chain, customer teams and future horizons. Together, these pillars are fueling our business transformation to enable 1.5X industry growth by FY2024.\n\nOur Future Horizons pillar, specifically, reflects our commitment to grow responsibly. It drives us to cultivate new channels, segments and capabilities while acting as good stewards of our business and the planet. In addition, we\u2019re moving toward \u201ccost leadership\u201d to fund our Recipe for Growth.\n\nOur Sustainability Strategy\n\nWe focus our efforts on issues where we believe we can have the most positive impact. As we navigate challenges such as climate change and an evolving global economy, our sustainability strategy guides our actions and decisions across three key areas:\n\n- People\n- Products\n- Planet\n\nOur strategy is global, with Sysco businesses across the world operating robust sustainability programs. We also work across geographic, regulatory and local markets to develop country- and/or company-specific goals.\n\nOur sustainability strategy and goals are informed by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). While we have not developed a separate SDG framework, this report highlights how our work contributes to the success of several key SDGs:\n\n- SDG 2: Addressing hunger relief\n- SDG 5: Diversity, equity and inclusion\n- SDG 7: Clean energy\n- SDGs 14 and 15: Responsible sourcing\n\nWe know that investors and other stakeholders are interested in seeing evidence of our SDG alignment. We plan to evolve our approach in the coming years.\nAdvancing Our Sustainability Goals\n\nIn FY2022, we continued to drive progress across these areas by working toward our 2025 sustainability goals.\n\n**PEOPLE**\n\n| Global Sustainability Focus Areas | Philanthropy & Community Giving | Diversity, Equity & Inclusion | Health & Wellness |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|\n| **Sysco 2025 Goals1 and Progress** | **Goal:** Generate $500 million worth of good in our global communities. **Progress:** Generated $231 million2 | **Goal:** Increase total gender and ethnic diversity of U.S.-based associates to 62%. **Progress:** Achieved | **Goal:** Double associate participation rates in health and well-being programs. **Progress:** Increased participation by 18% in CY2021 |\n| **Goal:** Increase spend with certified diverse suppliers by 25%. **Progress:** Increased spend with certified diverse suppliers by 7.8% vs. last year | **Goal:** Increase spend with certified diverse suppliers by 25%. **Progress:** Increased spend with certified diverse suppliers by 7.8% vs. last year | **Goal:** Expand products in our portfolio with health and wellness benefits. **Progress:** Expanded \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d options in our Cutting Edge Solutions platform |\n\n**PRODUCTS**\n\n| Global Sustainability Focus Areas | Responsible Sourcing | Human Rights | Animal Welfare |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Sysco 2025 Goals1 and Progress** | **Goal:** Establish responsible sourcing guidelines for five key commodities. **Progress:** Established commitments for beef, paper, soy and coffee | **Goal:** Ensure that all first-tier, high-risk suppliers agree to the Supplier Code of Conduct principles. **Progress:** Completed 175 Sysco Brand facility audits | **Goal:** Ensure that all Sysco Brand protein suppliers adhere to requirements laid out in our Animal Welfare Policy for Suppliers. **Progress:** Returned to pre-Covid audit practices in FY2022 to continue engaging suppliers |\n\n**PLANET**\n\n| Global Sustainability Focus Areas | Sustainable Agriculture | Energy & Carbon | Waste Reduction |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **Sysco 2025 Goals1 and Progress** | **Goal:** Expand our Sustainable Agriculture program to include five fresh crops. **Progress:** Achieved and doubled to include 10 fresh crops | **Goal:** Reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 27.5% by 2030 from a CY2019 base year. **Progress:** Committed to purchasing up to 800 electric trucks and piloted an electric refrigeration trailer.

For FY2021 and beyond, we will only include certified diverse suppliers in our reporting. In alignment with our expanded definition of diverse suppliers, we will also include businesses owned by veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals and those who are disabled, in addition to businesses owned by minorities and/or women.\n4 Focusing on purchased goods and services and upstream transportation suppliers.\n5 Because of shifts in our operations that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sysco experienced a steep reduction in emissions from 2019 to 2020. As regular operations return, we expect to see a rise in our emissions, which will again drop as we achieve progress toward our 2030 goals.\n6 Sysco Global businesses are actively contributing to achieving this goal.\n7 Sysco Canada is actively contributing to achieving this goal.\n8 Sysco European businesses are actively contributing to achieving this goal.\nOur Purpose in Action\n\nEach day, we work hard with our colleagues and stakeholders to put our purpose into action. Here are some of the ways we connected the world to share food and care for one another in FY2022.\n\nPeople\nOur associates are passionate about bringing Sysco\u2019s purpose to life. We supported them by providing resources to connect with their colleagues and communities and to develop in their careers. We also began socializing Sysco\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) strategy across our organization\u2014establishing the structures, resources and behaviors to ensure that everyone has a seat at our table.\n\n- Launched a new Sysco Gives Back Volunteer Recognition Program, and associates volunteered 10,500 hours\n- Gave $46M1 of good in our local communities, including 16M meals2\n- Achieved 62% gender and ethnic diversity for U.S.-based associates\n- Hosted Sysco\u2019s first Supplier Diversity Summit\n- Launched three new Leadership Development Programs to increase performance and leader retention\n\nProducts\nWe continued our focus on efficient, ethical and responsible sourcing\u2014delivering the highest quality of products. Through partnerships with global suppliers and nonprofits, we drove improvements in responsible sourcing and sustainable seafood. We also worked to combat deforestation while upholding human rights. As we fuel Sysco\u2019s growth, we leveraged our Cutting Edge Solutions (CES) platform to deliver innovative new products to give our customers an edge in embracing emerging industry trends.\n\n- Awarded ranchers with $2.5M in grants through the Southern Plains Grassland Program\n- Joined the World Wildlife Foundation to launch the Peru Mahi Alliance\n- Launched 14 new product concepts through our CES platform\n- Conducted 175 social responsibility audits in 17 countries, with 13 facilities receiving a perfect score\n\n1 Includes pledged monetary donations.\n2 This refers to the number of meals donated in U.S. dollars to food banks, schools or other nonprofit organizations in FY2022. Our calculation of the number of meals donated is derived from the cost of product donated; one meal is defined by Feeding America (a U.S.-based nonprofit organization) as $2.15.\nPlanet\n\nIn line with our Recipe for Growth strategy, we continued to practice good environmental stewardship. From the U.S. to the U.K. to Sweden and beyond, we invested deeply in renewable energy and reduced-carbon solutions. We are proud to have been the first company in our industry to commit to a science-based target to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We announced our commitment to purchase up to 800 electric trucks and piloted an electric refrigerated trailer, which we believe will ultimately result in our ability to make deliveries to our customers in fully electric and very quiet vehicles. This supports our goal to electrify 35% of our U.S. tractor fleet by 2030.\n\n- Expanded our Sustainable Agriculture Program to include 10 fresh crops\n- Expanded our indoor agriculture partnerships\n- Committed to purchasing up to 800 electric trucks and piloted an electric refrigeration trailer\n- Installed a new solar panel array system in Britain and announced new solar farm projects at Sysco Edmonton and a new Calgary facility in Canada\n\nGovernance\n\nAs we grew our business to help connect and feed more people around the world, Sysco remained rooted in strong corporate governance. Our leaders continued to drive transformative change by engaging with stakeholders to understand their evolving priorities and needs. In FY2022, our Board of Directors elected three new independent directors. They also continued to focus on diverse Board recruitment so that Sysco can benefit from a range of leadership perspectives.\n\n- Added three new independent directors to our Board\n- Added environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics to executive compensation\nLeadership Perspectives\n\nA message from Kevin Hourican, President and CEO, and Neil Russell, SVP Corporate Affairs and Chief Communications Officer\n\nSysco has been undergoing a business transformation, fueled by our Recipe for Growth strategy to solidify our position as the global leader in foodservice distribution. Our sustainability approach helps to ensure that we are growing responsibly and purposefully while leading our industry toward a more sustainable future.\n\nWe are proud of the measurable actions we are taking to make a positive impact in the areas of People, Products and Planet. To share a few highlights, in fiscal year 2022, we:\n\n- Announced our science-based climate goal to reduce our operational emissions by 27.5% by 2030;\n- Committed to purchase up to 800 electric tractors to support our goal of electrifying 35% of our U.S. fleet by 2030;\n- Donated 16 million meals globally to fight hunger in our communities and pledged $1 million to Feeding America through our signature Nourishing Neighbors program;\n- Expanded our Sustainable Agriculture Program and doubled the number of fresh crops included; and\n- Awarded ranchers $2.5 million in grants through the Southern Plains Grassland Program to invest in sustainable grazing practices and wildlife habitats.\n\nIn addition, we launched a Global Volunteer Recognition Program to celebrate and recognize our associates for giving back to their communities. We are proud of our associates who reported 10,500 volunteer hours last year. These contributions are an important part of helping us reach our Global Good goal of donating $500 million worth of \u2018good\u2019 into our communities by 2025.\n\nWe are doubling down on our commitment to sustainability by tying our executive compensation to ESG initiatives involving gender representation, diverse recruiting and carbon reduction.\n\nAs you read through this report, we hope you feel just as proud of the progress we are making and excited about what\u2019s on the horizon for Sysco. We have set a clear roadmap to reach our sustainability goals and gained considerable momentum this past year, but of course there is still more to do.\n\nWe know we cannot get there alone. We are thankful for the support of our stakeholders who work with us and challenge us to go further. Everyone has a seat at Sysco\u2019s table as we pave the way to a sustainable future for our industry.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to share our progress with you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKevin Hourican\nPresident and CEO\n\nNeil Russell\nSenior Vice President, Corporate Affairs and Chief Communications Officer\nPeople\n\nEvery associate plays an important role in enhancing our company\u2019s success and bringing Sysco\u2019s purpose to life. We support them by providing resources to collaborate, give back and grow. By creating a culture of belonging and empowerment, we help our people thrive.\n\nFor us, living our purpose begins within Sysco\u2019s own walls where we work to ensure that everyone has a seat at the table. In FY2022, we focused on socializing our DEI strategy enterprisewide while deepening our outreach efforts to connect with future talent and diverse suppliers. Internally, we engaged our associates by listening to their feedback and ideas and by celebrating their achievements and passion for giving back. We also delivered new learning and development resources to help associates grow throughout their careers. Our goal is to cultivate a diverse team of leaders capable of delivering transformative results.\n\nIn this section:\n- Community Giving and Global Good\n- Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n- Supplier Diversity\n- Associate Engagement\n- Learning and Development\n- Health and Wellness\nCommunity Giving and Global Good\n\nWe aspire to lead the foodservice distribution industry by giving back, doing good and changing lives.\n\nAs a global leader in foodservice distribution, we are committed to making a positive impact in the communities where we live and work. Our purpose\u2014connecting the world to share food and care for one another\u2014motivates us to do good by sharing our resources, skills and time. Our philanthropic and community giving priorities include:\n\n- **Feed:** We work to reduce hunger in our communities by providing healthy and nutritious meals to families that are food insecure. We do so by working with local community partners and donating food, which also helps us reduce waste.\n- **Serve:** Our associates give their time and talent to serve our communities and customers. They give back to many causes that inspire them, including those focused on expanding food access for vulnerable groups such as seniors and kids.\n- **Give:** We support many global, national and local organizations\u2014both by donating funds and by sharing their knowledge as Board members.\n\nTo celebrate associate volunteers who help bring our purpose to life, in FY2022 we launched a new Sysco Gives Back volunteer recognition program. Associates log their hours using our Volunteer Hour Tracker to earn recognitions that include:\n\n- **Quarterly Volunteer Spotlight:** A random drawing, whereby five volunteers receive $100 each for a charity of their choice.\n- **Volunteer of the Year:** Recognizes the associate with the highest number of volunteer hours logged with $1,000 to donate to a charity of their choice. Two runners-up also receive $500 each to a charity of their choice.\n- **Sysco Company of the Year:** Recognizes one site globally that best represents our company\u2019s purpose. The site winner receives $10,000 to donate to a hunger-focused charity in their community.\n\n**GOAL**\n\nBy 2025, generate $500 million worth of good in our global communities, including 200 million meals\n\n**PROGRESS:** Generated $231 million\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Includes pledged monetary donations.\nIn addition to volunteer efforts, throughout FY2022, Sysco invested heavily in community food donations and funding. Amid a year of record wildfires and flooding, we supported communities from British Columbia to the American Southwest, and donated $50,000 to the American Red Cross to support relief efforts following Hurricane Ida. We also donated funds to food banks and food pantries\u2014such as Hearts for the Homeless in Buffalo, New York\u2014with our British business donating millions of community meals and announcing a \u00a3500,000, five-year commitment to help fight holiday hunger. Across the U.S. and Canada, our signature Nourishing Neighbors program continued to help us give back, contributing over $13 million to charitable organizations since its inception in 2018.\n\nComing Together to Support the People of Ukraine\n\nFollowing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Sysco\u2019s leaders began to closely monitor the developing humanitarian crisis unfolding in Eastern Europe. Utilizing our resources and global partnerships, we delivered and funded millions of meals (see Global Good at Sysco) to help feed the country\u2019s citizens and refugees. As we did so, many of our associates reached out to ask how they could help. That led us to match associates\u2019 donations of up to $25,000 to support UNICEF, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nWe were especially inspired by the efforts of our Director of Business Development for Guest Worldwide and her young daughter Bella. Their pop-up Bella and Co. \u201clemon-aid\u201d stand raised donations for humanitarian aid, one cup of Bella\u2019s lemonade at a time. Bella even brought the stand to our Global Support Center, where she received donations from many Sysco associates. In total, she raised $3,800 in funds to further support this important cause.\nGlobal Good at Sysco: FY2022 Highlights\n\nThousands of associates shared their valuable time through community volunteerism in FY2022. Sysco\u2019s President and CEO served as a great example, spending many Saturdays volunteering alongside his family at Kids\u2019 Meals Inc. The Houston-based organization is on a mission to end local childhood hunger by delivering free, healthy meals to the doorsteps of preschool-aged children year-round. We were also inspired by Shane Bourque, a Transportation Clerk from Sysco Acadiana, who was named Volunteer of the Year. Working with his local fire department throughout FY2022, he logged 332 volunteer hours. Finally, during a Nourishing Neighbors event held in our Capital region, we were proud to see 160 associates from our Baltimore and Virginia sites volunteer their time to pack 50,000 meals that supported five area food banks.\n\nThrough our fundraising efforts, we continued to support local food banks and other charitable organizations. For example, Sysco Canada hosted a Great Give fundraiser in which it matched associates\u2019 donations up to CA$25,000, raising more than CA$50,000 to support local food banks with 100,668 meals. Later, Sysco Canada hosted a Double The Heart campaign that doubled contributions to local charities through its Nourishing Neighbours program. The campaign raised enough funds to provide 180,000 meals to help feed those in need.\n\nWe continued to leverage our expertise in foodservice distribution to deliver millions of meals to communities in need around the world. One of our focus areas was supporting the people of Ukraine\u2014many of whom have faced heightened food insecurity or been forced to flee their country due to the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian War. In response, Sysco worked with a European partner to provide $100,000 worth of food products to Ukrainian refugees who crossed the border into Poland. We also donated $100,000 to fund food parcels for those remaining in Ukraine via the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\n1 This number refers to monetary donations (including pledged monetary donations) to food banks, schools or other nonprofit organizations in FY2022 in U.S. dollars.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nWe aspire to create a global culture that is decidedly diverse, equitable and inclusive\u2014one where we foster belonging as we care for one another and connect the world through food and trusted partnerships.\n\nOur DEI initiatives are critical to fulfilling our purpose and enabling long-term success. Sysco\u2019s Vice President and Chief Diversity & Culture Officer (CDCO), Adrienne Trimble, leads these efforts with the support of Sysco\u2019s DEI team and the company\u2019s Global DEI Advisory Council. In 2021, this group developed a DEI Strategic Framework that guides our actions across three areas:\n\n- **Our workforce**: We work to attract and retain diverse workforce talent while ensuring that people can move equitably through Sysco\u2019s systems.\n- **Our workplace**: We focus on creating an environment that makes people want to come to Sysco and stay.\n- **Our marketplace**: By focusing on DEI within our workforce and workplace, we can better meet our stakeholders\u2019 needs.\n\nIn FY2022, we began enacting the framework\u2019s year-one initiatives, such as socializing our DEI strategic priorities and applying a DEI lens to prioritized Talent Acquisition activities. Throughout the year, we engaged hundreds of DEI Ambassadors, who helped us execute critical initiatives such as our first Supplier Diversity Summit and our college intern recruiting efforts. We also expanded the Chief Diversity Officer role to include responsibility for the Culture & Engagement and Associate Relations teams. These teams and the DEI team now function as a singular Center of Excellence, focused on creating a best-in-class associate experience. As we welcomed new associates, we were proud to achieve our goal of 62% gender and ethnic diversity in our U.S. workforce ahead of our 2025 target. In the future, we will continue developing new workforce representation goals designed to address specific areas of opportunity.\n\n**GOAL**\n\nIncrease total gender and ethnic diversity of U.S.-based associates to 62%\n\n**PROGRESS:** Achieved\n\nSysco is proud to be named a Top Diversity Employer for 2021 in the Food & Beverage category by DiversityJobs.com for the second consecutive year.\nOur Workforce At-A-Glance\n\nU.S. Race & Ethnicity FY2021\n- White: 53%\n- Hispanic/Latino: 22%\n- Black or African American: 17%\n- Asian: 4%\n- Two or More Races: 2%\n- Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: 1%\n- American Indian or Alaskan Native: 1%\n- Not Available: 1%\n\nU.S. Race & Ethnicity FY2022\n- White: 48%\n- Hispanic/Latino: 23%\n- Black or African American: 20%\n- Asian: 4%\n- Two or More Races: 2%\n- Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: 1%\n- American Indian or Alaskan Native: 1%\n- Not Available: 0%\n\nGlobal Gender Representation FY2022\n- Male: 78%\n- Female: 22%\n\nLearn more about Sysco\u2019s workforce demographics in our FY2022 DEI Report.\n\nCreating a Culture of Belonging with Associate Resource Groups (ARGs)\n\nOur ARGs create a strong sense of belonging and connection for associates around the globe. Together, they help Sysco recognize culturally significant occasions, while creating a safe space and sense of community for associates from often underrepresented backgrounds. Our growing list of ARGs includes:\n\n- **APEX**: Elevating the growth of Pan-Asian associates\n- **BRIDGE**: Bridging gaps between associates, concentrating on differences in age, career stage, department, country, seniority, in-office/remote status and more\n- **Catalyst**: Cultivating and supporting Black associates\n- **Circle**: Creating community for Indigenous associates\n- **Emerging Leaders**: Empowering leaders to achieve their maximum potential through career development\n- **Food for Thought**: Raising awareness of mental wellness in the workplace\n- **HART**: Providing advocacy and resources for Hispanic associates\n- **IMPACT**: Empowering and supporting female associates\n- **MINDS**: Raising awareness of and providing resources regarding neurodiversity\n- **Spectrum**: Bringing together LGBTQ+ associates and allies\n- **Veterans Outreach**: Connecting and celebrating U.S. military veterans\n\nSome totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding.\nYear-over-year data is currently unavailable; however we plan to include it in future reporting.\nCelebrating Key Milestones and Events\n\nBlack History Month\nIn honor of Black History Month, Sysco\u2019s Catalyst ARG held a global town hall for all associates, featuring Dr. Jessica B. Harris, the culinary historian and author behind the Netflix series *High on the Hog*.\n\nSysco Canada welcomed Canadian rapper, record producer, actor and author Maestro Fresh Wes for a keynote speaker session on sticking to your vision.\n\nGender Equity Momentum (GEM) Awards\nSysco recognized 36 associates at our annual GEM awards, which recognize those making strides to remove gender barriers, champion gender equality and cultivate an inclusive workplace culture.\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day\nWe collaborated with our IMPACT ARG to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day with several Break the Bias-themed events and a Let\u2019s Talk Change virtual summit organized by Let\u2019s Talk Womxn.\n\nJob Shadow Day\nWe were proud to partner with the Cope Foundation\u2019s Ability at Work program, which is focused on providing job opportunities to young adults with intellectual disabilities. Sysco Ireland\u2019s Cork facility invited two Cope Foundation candidates to spend a day shadowing the Transport and Warehouse teams and hired both of the participants following the event.\n\nIndigenous History Month\nSysco Canada\u2014which has committed to the Progressive Aboriginal Relations program\u2014commemorated National Indigenous History Month by encouraging all associates to take time to recognize the rich history, heritage, resilience and diversity of First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples across the country.\n\nCircle ARG held an event to celebrate Indigenous History Month. We welcomed Elder Ed Sackaney and had a Spirit Animal Workshop with Cree artist Kamamak.\n\nMilitary Makeover: Operation Career\nSysco\u2019s Veterans Outreach ARG announced the company\u2019s participation in a Lifetime Television show called Military Makeover: Operation Career. The show, which profiles companies offering outstanding opportunities for veterans in the workforce, featured three of Sysco\u2019s veteran associates.\n\nPride Month\nSysco celebrated Pride Month globally, including by providing training around LGBTQ+ inclusiveness and raising Pride flags at all U.S. and Canada sites.\n\nLearn more about Sysco\u2019s DEI initiatives in our FY2022 DEI Report.\nSupplier Diversity\n\nWe are committed to building relationships with diverse supply partners who reflect and meet the needs of the customers and communities we serve.\n\nAt Sysco, supplier diversity is woven into our strategic approach. Rather than treating it as a standalone program, it is an ongoing activity fully embedded in the way we do business. Accordingly, in FY2022, we announced our membership with the five leading diversity councils, which will enhance our ability to develop relationships with qualified diverse suppliers. Through the new memberships, we expanded Sysco\u2019s scope and definition of supplier diversity and created an auditable process that helped us identify nearly $937.5 million in diverse supplier spend. We also formalized our new Supplier Diversity Mentorship Program, which we piloted in FY2021, and in May, we hosted our first Supplier Diversity Summit with participation from nearly 500 suppliers.\n\nOur expanded definition of diverse suppliers includes certified businesses that are 51% owned and operated by women, ethnic minorities, veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals and those who are disabled.\n\nLearn more about Sysco\u2019s supplier diversity initiatives in our FY2022 DEI Report.\nGOAL\nIncrease spend by 25% by 2025 with certified diverse suppliers\n\nPROGRESS: We increased our spend with certified diverse suppliers by 7.8% vs. last year.\n\nLaunching New Diversity Council Partnerships\n\nAs we work to expand our diverse supplier network, we have formed partnerships with five leading diversity councils. The partnerships create an opportunity for suppliers to grow their businesses at Sysco while positioning us to meet customers\u2019 evolving needs. They include:\n\n- Disability: IN\n- National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)\n- National Veteran-Owned Business Association (NaVOBA)\n- National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC)\n- Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC)\n\n1 Going forward, Sysco will only count certified-spend toward our goal.\n2 We will pursue opportunities in FY2023 to transition self-selected diverse suppliers to certification.\nAssociate Engagement\n\nWe help associates thrive by recognizing their achievements and ideas while embedding Sysco\u2019s values and purpose in their work.\n\nDuring FY2022, our associates remained highly engaged and committed to bringing Sysco\u2019s purpose to life. Through interactive sessions on Sysco\u2019s purpose, values and inclusion, we created a strong alignment between our associates and their work. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many associates continued working in a remote or hybrid environment. We supported them by providing newly designed tools, resources and practices that helped them communicate with their teams and remain connected. Through our feedback tools\u2014such as pulse surveys and our annual Sysco Speaks survey\u2014we saw engagement across all workplace modalities. We also found that associates had a strong connection to our company\u2019s purpose and took pride in the products they delivered to Sysco customers.\n\nSysco Speaks\nOur annual Sysco Speaks survey captures the collective voice of our associates around the globe, providing feedback that our leaders use to drive increased engagement and business success. As challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic continued, our FY2022 engagement score saw a 3-point year-over-year drop; however, our score remained favorable at 77%. Our participation score of 84% continues to outpace other organizations; and, thanks in part to our studio sessions, associates\u2019 understanding of their personal contributions to Sysco\u2019s purpose exceeded the industry benchmark by 10 points. Our focus areas for continued improvement include:\n\n- Communicating transparently and proactively to build leadership trust.\n- Ensuring that our associates feel heard, acknowledged and valued for sharing their ideas and suggestions.\n- Improving work-life balance and enhancing safety by prioritizing associates\u2019 well-being.\n\nHighlights from our Sysco Speaks Survey\n\n- 90% of associates understand how their roles relate to the business goals of the company\n- 85% of associates are proud of the products we sell to customers\n- 83% of associates understand Sysco\u2019s Purpose statement\n- 82% of associates\u2019 immediate supervisors ensure they understand the goals and objectives of their teams\n- 81% of associates have a clear understanding of our external customers\u2019 needs\n- 80% of associates are proud to work at Sysco\n- 74% of associates say their site operates in an environmentally responsible way\n- 70% have seen their site support the local community\nLearning and Development\n\nWe invest in opportunities that bring people together and help them grow throughout their careers.\n\nFrom internship programs to executive development, we provide people with the tools they need to continually build new knowledge and skills. These tools include training, mentorship and networking opportunities that emphasize a culture of belonging and enterprise-wide success. In FY2022, we launched our new Thrive learning platform\u2014a common hub of technology-based learning resources for all associates worldwide. Thrive is mobile-enabled with a user-friendly interface, making it easier than ever for associates to grow throughout their careers. We also expanded our pipeline-building internship programs and our Operations Academy programs for new delivery partners and warehouse selectors, in addition to launching three new development programs for Sysco leaders.\n\nExpanded Internship Programs\n\nIn FY2022, we welcomed 67 college interns throughout the U.S. who gained real-world experience while exploring future Sysco careers. Interns had opportunities to connect across cohorts while hearing from senior leaders, including Sysco\u2019s CEO. Sysco Bahamas partnered with the local government and the Ministry of Education to welcome nine interns into their operations. In the U.S., we expanded our recently launched Supply Chain Internship Program to reach across multiple Sysco sites and include students from the University of Tennessee and Penn State University. We also brought back our Sales Internship Program, welcoming a diverse and talented cohort with the aim of fueling future workforce growth.\n\nInvesting in Student Success\n\nSysco is a proud supporter of higher education, and we invest in scholarships aimed at furthering students\u2019 success. In 1996, we established the John F. and Eula Mae Baugh Sysco Scholarship Program in honor of our founder and first CEO and his wife. The scholarship recognizes the determination, integrity and perseverance of Sysco associates\u2019 children pursuing undergraduate education at accredited four-year colleges and universities. To date, Sysco has awarded over $5 million in scholarships to help over 1,000 students.\nEarning Recognition for Our Focus on Learning and Development\n\nSysco\u2019s Learning & Development team achieved LearningElite status from Chief Learning Officer magazine for the fifth year in a row, in recognition of our continued focus on learning and development. The award acknowledges our efforts to continue educating Sysco field associates with regularly scheduled learning programs throughout the pandemic to help them navigate a rapidly evolving business landscape.\n\nLaunching New Operations Academy Programs\n\nWe continued to expand our Operation Academy programs for our delivery partners and warehouse selectors. In Denver and Central Florida, we have graduated nearly 140 new delivery partners through our Delivery Partner Basic Training program, a five-day course that provides standardized onboarding and training for new Sysco drivers who already have a commercial driver\u2019s licence (CDL). We also graduated four delivery partners through our Denver-based CDL Basic Training program, which we plan to expand to Central Florida soon. In Charlotte, North Carolina, we\u2019re piloting a new Selector Basic Training program that is yielding promising results, such as faster onboarding times and increased productivity and retention rates for graduates. To enable the program\u2019s rapid rollout, we are currently conducting Train the Trainer classes across the U.S.\n\nLaunching New Leadership Development Programs\n\nIn FY2022, Sysco launched three new leadership development programs to support leaders across business units and at various phases in their careers. The programs, which are now underway, include:\n\nExecutive Leadership Development Program (XLD)\nThis cutting-edge program helps senior leaders from across the organization learn to navigate complexity, drive change and deliver transformational business results. Over the course of a year, participants connect during three in-person summits and a series of virtual workshops and roundtables. They also engage in self-assessment and peer coaching to enhance accountability and self-awareness. XLD culminates in \u201cHeat Experiences\u201d in which leaders work to achieve a specific year-end goal.\n\nHigh Potential Leadership Development Program (HLD)\nThis program is geared toward senior and executive functional leaders and helps accelerate their readiness to take on broader, more complex future roles. With an 11-month commitment, the program journey focuses on three key areas: Leading Self, Leading Others and Leading Enterprise. Participants apply their skills through individual experimentation and activities with their respective teams. They also apply their skills and learnings on Heat Experiences: projects and initiatives that each leader is accountable for delivering, the results of which have a positive impact on the business.\n\nFrontline Leadership Development Program (FLD)\nThis program is designed for field-based leaders who supervise hourly Operations associates. It began in the U.S. and is now being expanded globally to help participants master leadership fundamentals. Supervisors engage in instructor-led, virtual courses over three nonconsecutive days. They also complete eight self-guided courses that introduce and reinforce the leadership lessons they learn.\nHealth and Wellness\n\nWe aspire to empower our people, communities and future generations to make healthy choices about lifestyles and diet.\n\nOur total well-being strategy is aligned with four pillars: Health, Mind, Security and Community. Across each of them, we offer programs to support associates and their communities by ensuring they have the resources needed to stay healthy and thrive. In FY2022, we enhanced those resources by moving to an integrated health platform with Aetna. The new platform makes it easier for associates to access and navigate various healthcare programs by consolidating them into one place. One of our focus areas is providing support that extends to associates\u2019 entire families. For example, in FY2022, we delivered several resources for parents of neurodivergent children. Within the Aetna lineup, we added new autism services such as applied behavioral analysis and various treatments. We also continued to provide Rethink, a resource that assists parents of children with autism, ADHD and other conditions with live help sessions, training videos and group support.\n\nLooking forward, we are focused on implementing paid-leave enhancements, including additional paid vacation time and paid parental leave. In FY2023, we will realign our health and wellness goals to ensure they are fit for purpose and remain focused on meeting our associates\u2019 needs and the evolving operating context. We will continue to lean into our four pillars of Health, Mind, Security and Community and provide an update in the next sustainability report.\n\nGOAL\nDouble associate participation rates in health and well-being programs\nPROGRESS: Increased participation by 18% in CY 2021\n\nGOAL\nExpand products in our portfolio with health and wellness benefits\nPROGRESS: Expanded \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d options in our Cutting Edge Solutions platform\nCreating a Culture of Total Well-Being\n\n#Walk2Wellbeing\n\nIn FY2022, we continued our quarterly Walk2Wellbeing global challenge to encourage teams to enjoy some exercise, friendly competition and fresh air. Teams of up to 10 associates registered in three different categories based on the number of steps they hoped to average. We provided prizes to teams and individuals who ranked the highest in each category and offered a step conversion matrix to support those with mobility challenges. Based on the challenge\u2019s weekly leaderboard, associates logged over 233 million steps.\n\n**FY2022 Walk2WellBeing Challenge**\n\n| Total teams: | Countries represented: | Total Steppers: |\n|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| 239         | 9                      | 1,625           |\n\n- **Busy Steppers** average up to 8K steps a day\n- **Big Steppers** averaged 8K-18K steps a day\n- **Heavy Steppers** averaged 18K+ steps a day\n\nWorld Mental Health Day\n\nEach October, Sysco celebrates World Mental Health Day to raise awareness, share mental health strategies and resources and build community support. Associates participated by wearing green on October 9, and our HR leaders held Toolbox Talks discussing the importance of self care. In the U.K., we continued to offer a Mental Health First Aid training course designed to teach people how to recognize crucial warning signs and symptoms and provide appropriate first aid and support. As of FY2022, Sysco sites in the U.K. have trained 136 associates as Mental Health First Aiders.\n\nSysco Canada: Live and Let Live Campaign\n\nIn September 2021, Sysco Canada held their sixth annual campaign, which coincided with kids going back to school. The campaign encouraged field associates to raise awareness of the dangers of distracted driving, including the common behaviors that contribute to it, the impact it has on Canadians and how it can be avoided. Vivid posters, daily safety messages, a social media campaign and an associate pledge urged associates to drive safely and speak up when they see other distracted drivers.\n\nPrioritizing Safety and Sysco\n\nWorld Day for Safety and Health at Work\n\nEach year on April 28, the International Labour Organization (ILO) marks its World Day for Safety and Health at Work. ILO uses the occasion to raise awareness of safety and health best practices that can reduce work-related illnesses and deaths. Sysco participated in the event for the fourth year in FY2022 with events in the U.S., Canada, Bahamas, Costa Rica, Mexico and Panama. These events included daily safety messages, posters and crosswords with clues from the daily safety messages. The campaign reported a significant increase in participation from the previous year.\n\nIncentivizing COVID-19 Vaccination\n\nThe health of our associates, customers and communities is a priority for our company, and in FY2022 we continued our Vaccine Incentive Program to encourage associates around the world to receive their vaccines. The program offered associates $100 for an initial COVID-19 vaccination or $200 for a completed vaccination series. Increasing vaccination rates is vital to keep people safe and to help ensure Sysco\u2019s operations continue to run smoothly.\nAs the leading global foodservice distributor, Sysco is leading the way in efficient, ethical and responsible sourcing. The result: Products that make our associates proud and meet our customers\u2019 evolving needs.\n\nAround the world, our associates work hard to ensure that every customer receives quality products. For us, that means products responsibly sourced from global supply partners that treat people, the planet and animals with respect. In FY2022, we continued to lead progress in responsible sourcing best practices\u2014driving improvements in Sysco\u2019s value chain and industrywide. With our partners in the Southern Great Plains Program, we awarded the first round of grants to support rancher-led improvements in sustainable cattle grazing, and we celebrated the launch of the Peru Mahi Alliance alongside the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).\n\nWe also continued to focus on sustainable sourcing of key commodities in alignment with our commitment to combat deforestation around the world. At the same time, our Cutting Edge Solutions team grew our portfolio with an emphasis on innovative, sustainable and \u201cgood-for-you\u201d products.\nAnimal Welfare\n\nWe aspire to improve animal welfare practices throughout the foodservice industry.\n\nSysco is a major provider of animal protein products for customers around the world. Leveraging our size and scale, we are dedicated to driving improved animal welfare practices while upholding stringent standards for all Sysco Brand animal products. We work closely with all Sysco Brand veal, beef, lamb, pork, poultry, dairy, shell egg and processed egg suppliers to ensure they are meeting all regulatory requirements and employing industry best practices for animal care. In FY2022, we continued to socialize our Animal Welfare Policy for Suppliers while implementing it across our supply chain within the U.S. We also updated our plan to ensure compliance with the policy\u2014taking a tiered approach to our ongoing supplier engagement.\n\nSysco\u2019s Animal Welfare Guiding Principles\n\n1. We are committed to ensuring that high standards and practices for animal welfare are consistent throughout our supply chain.\n2. We believe that the humane treatment of animals within our supply chain is the right thing to do. It builds customer confidence and supports further growth and development of the foodservice industry.\n3. We serve a wide variety of customers with different needs. We are committed to providing animal protein products that meet these needs while maintaining our standards for animal care.\n4. We support species-specific, science-based animal welfare standards and encourage ongoing continual improvements with our suppliers of animal proteins.\n5. We work with suppliers who demonstrate a commitment to aligning with our requirements and do not tolerate violations due to supplier negligence.\n6. We consider food safety, environmental, societal and economic impacts\u2014as well as internal and external stakeholder input\u2014as we implement our animal welfare policy.\n\nGOAL\n\nBy 2025, ensure that all Sysco Brand protein suppliers adhere to requirements laid out in our Animal Welfare Policy for Suppliers\n\nPROGRESS: Returned to pre-Covid audit practices in FY2022 to continue engaging suppliers\nEnsuring Best Practices Through Sysco\u2019s Auditing Program\n\nOne tool for compliance is our auditing program, carried out by Sysco\u2019s Quality Assurance Program Quality Managers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, their ability to conduct in-person animal welfare assessments was limited by travel bans and safety concerns. However, they have continued to engage with suppliers to ensure best practices and began to return to in-person assessments in FY2022.\n\nIn addition, Sysco continued to roll out program requirements for our Sysco Brand suppliers who do not harvest animals but purchase from supply sources that are engaged in direct animal handling. Through the program, we receive attestation from suppliers that they are purchasing raw materials from supply sources harvesting animals that meet the requirements of Sysco\u2019s Animal Welfare Policy.\n\nWorking Toward Our Goal of Cage-Free Eggs\n\nDependent upon supply availability, affordability and customer demand, our goal is to source only cage-free eggs by 2026. Affordability for this high protein source remains a marketplace challenge, so significant collaboration among industry participants\u2014including our suppliers and customers\u2014will be required to continue making progress toward this goal. In FY2022, cage-free eggs represented approximately 28% of all shell and processed/liquid egg orders fulfilled in the U.S. (a year-over-year increase of 8%) and 8% of all egg orders fulfilled in Canada.\u00b9\n\nSince 2004, all Sysco Brand raw shell egg suppliers have been certified by the United Egg Producers Animal Husbandry Guidelines and have undergone annual animal welfare audits. We also offer our customers a full portfolio of cage-free egg options in both the shell and processed egg categories.\n\n\u00b9 Due to an error in our calculation, our FY2021 reporting for the percentage of cage-free shell and processed/liquid egg sales in Canada was incorrect. The correct number was 7%, meaning that, from FY2021 to FY2022, Sysco achieved a year-over-year increase in Canadian cage-free egg sales of 1%.\n\nWhile all supplier-owned farms in the U.S. have adopted group-housing systems, we continue to work with our pork suppliers to ensure compliance with all state- and federally-mandated animal welfare regulations.\nOur vision is to continuously improve our responsible sourcing practices for key commodities. By prioritizing responsible sourcing, we minimize our environmental impact while upholding the highest social and ethical standards.\n\nThe world\u2019s forests produce many key commodities that help us meet our customers\u2019 needs. They are also home to rich environmental ecosystems that play a critical role in protecting people, animals, plants and the planet. One of the biggest threats to these ecosystems is deforestation, which we are working to address in our agricultural supply chain. In addition to our historical commodities commitments for seafood and palm oil, we have established new commitments for beef, paper, soy and coffee. In FY2021, we released our first Forests Report, which outlines these commitments and our approach to tackling deforestation and other forest-related risks. In FY2022, we continued to make progress toward these commitments while analyzing options for a fifth commodity, which we plan to name in FY2023. We also plan to submit our second Forests Report\u2014which will be our first done through CDP\u2014and we are committed to making continuous improvements based on the results.\n\nGOAL\nBy 2025, establish responsible sourcing guidelines for five key commodities\n\nPROGRESS: Established commitments for beef, paper, soy and coffee\nOur New Key Commodity Commitments\n\nKey Commodity: BEEF\nCommitment\n\u2022 As a member of the U.S. and Canadian Roundtables for Sustainable Beef (USRSB and CRSB), we actively participate in the development of principles and approaches for defining and measuring a sustainable beef supply chain and pilot a minimum of two projects by 2022 to positively impact the beef supply chain.\n\nProgress\n\u2022 In FY2022, we remained active in our role as a member of the CRSB and USRSB, with one Sysco member serving on USRSB\u2019s board of directors. We also awarded the first round of grants through one of our pilot projects, the Southern Plains Grassland Program, which we launched with Cargill and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) in FY2021.\n\nKey Commodity: PAPER\nCommitment\n\u2022 Source all Sysco Brand paper towels, paper napkins, bath and facial tissues from sources certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) or other equivalent standards by 2025.\n\nProgress\n\u2022 More than 99% of the U.S. broadline Sysco Brand paper towel, paper napkin, bath and facial tissue case volume sold in FY2022 was certified by ECOLOGO, FSC and SFI.\n\nKey Commodity: COFFEE\nCommitment\n\u2022 Source 75% of Sysco Brand Coffee from certified sources or verified sustainable sourcing programs by 2025.\n\nProgress\n\u2022 In FY2021, we completed a full audit of our Sysco Brand coffee sold and developed a roadmap against our 2025 commitment. During FY2022, over 2% of the U.S. broadline Sysco Brand Coffee pounds that we sold were certified fair trade and organic. We have partnered with our coffee supplier to identify new sourcing options and are launching a Rainforest Alliance certification program for our Citavo Imperial coffee. We expect to make meaningful progress toward this goal in FY2023.\n\nKey Commodity: SOY\nCommitment\n\u2022 Partner with our Sysco Brand suppliers and soybean industry stakeholders to identify opportunities to address the environmental impacts of soybean production in the U.S. and Canada, starting with farmers enrolled in the USDA Farm program or equivalent.\n\u2022 Incorporate sustainability criteria in our Sysco Brand soybean oil sourcing decisions.\n\nProgress\n\u2022 Our top four soy suppliers\u2014comprising 90% of the soy we procure\u2014source the commodity from within the U.S., and three of them have published deforestation-related commitments (covering ~50% of our soy-related spend). Moving forward, we plan to obtain assurance of this data and how these commitments apply to the soy we procure.\n\nHistorical Commodity Commitments\n\nIn addition to our new key commodity commitments, Sysco has long-established commodity commitments for sustainable seafood and palm. For example, we previously committed to sourcing 100% Roundabout on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)-certified palm oil in Sysco Brands. While our original target for this commitment was 2020, our supply partners faced challenges in collecting the necessary data due to COVID-19. However, we remain focused on achieving progress and, in FY2022, we continued working toward RSPO certification.\n\nLearn more in our Palm Oil Report and by reading about our sustainable seafood commitments on page 31.\n\n1 Broadline sites: Broadline operating sites distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served.\n2 Sysco Brand: Products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for Sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team. In addition, our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged, enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements.\nSupporting Sustainable Grazing Practices Across the Southern Great Plains\n\nWhat do the Monarch butterfly, the swift fox and many beef cattle have in common? They all coexist in a vast grassland ecosystem called the Southern Great Plains. Stretching across Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, the area is responsible for approximately 30% of beef produced in the U.S.\n\nIn 2021, we teamed up with our longtime supplier, Cargill\u2014providing $5 million total to fund a five-year project with the NFWF. The project supports the implementation of sustainable grazing practices across 1 million acres in the Southern Great Plains. In 2022, we awarded the first round of grants through our Southern Plains Grassland Program, providing $2.5 million to support 10 rancher-led sustainable grazing projects in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas and Colorado. In the first year of the program, the grants also leveraged $3.3 million in matching contributions, generating a total conservation impact of $5.8 million.\n\nVisit the NFWF\u2019s website to learn more about the Southern Plains Grasslands Program\u2019s 2022 grant-funded projects.\nPromoting Sustainable Seafood\n\nFor more than a decade, we have proudly partnered with WWF to lead the industry in sustainable seafood best practices and make progress toward our 2025 sustainable seafood commitments. Through our responsible seafood sourcing program, we help to improve protections for species and habitats worldwide while securing the livelihoods of more than 100,000 people. In FY2021, we expanded the program to include Sysco U.S. and our Canada Broadline and U.S. Specialty businesses. We also announced a new set of commitments for 2025 which we focused on advancing in FY2022 to guide the next phase of our work.\n\nIn CY2021, Sysco sourced approximately 94% of our volume for the U.S. and Canada top-15 wild-caught Portico Brand seafood species from fisheries that are Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)-certified, in MSC assessment or in a comprehensive fishery improvement project (FIP)\u2014with 80% of this volume coming from MSC-certified fisheries. Additionally, all of Sysco\u2019s Portico Brand wild-caught cod, clams, pollock, haddock, salmon, whiting and flounder were sourced from MSC-certified fisheries. In CY2021, 98% of our volume for U.S. and Canada top-five farmed Portico Brand species met our overall seafood commitment, with 20% of this volume coming from Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)-certified farms.\n\nIn partnership with WWF, we conducted a baseline assessment of our U.S. Specialty seafood sourcing for two priority species groups: 89% of farmed salmon and 100% of wild-caught scallops volume met Sysco\u2019s overall commitments.\n\n2025 Sustainable Seafood Commitments\n\nFocus Area: ADVANCING TRACEABILITY\n\nCommitments\n- Engage with suppliers of Sysco Portico Brand farmed shrimp products to ensure supply chains are traceable to the farm\u2019s geographic location.\n- Address issues of deforestation or conversion of natural ecosystems (e.g., mangrove ecosystems and other natural wetlands).\n- Work with WWF to adopt key traceability principles and build on the work of the Global Dialogue on Seafood Traceability.\n\nFocus Area: IMPROVING SUSTAINABLE SOURCING\n\nCommitments\n- Source 100% of our top 15 (by volume) wild-caught Sysco Portico Brand seafood species groups from fisheries that are certified by the MSC, in MSC full assessment or in a comprehensive FIP and sourcing at least 85% of this top-15 volume from fisheries that are MSC certified.\n- Source 100% of Sysco Portico Brand canned or pouched tuna products from fisheries that are MSC certified, in MSC full assessment, in a comprehensive FIP or from companies that are members of the International Seafood Sustainability Association (ISSA) and source at least 25% of this volume from fisheries that are MSC certified.\n- Source 100% of Sysco Portico Brand canned or pouched tuna products from fisheries that are MSC certified, in MSC full assessment, in a comprehensive FIP or from companies that are members of the International Seafood Sustainability Association (ISSA) and source at least 25% of this volume from fisheries that are MSC certified.\n- Source 100% of our top five (by volume) aquaculture Sysco Portico Brand seafood species groups from farms that are certified (ASC, Global Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) or Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) 3-Star minimum) or in a comprehensive AIP.\n\nFocus Area: PROTECTING ENDANGERED SPECIES\n\nCommitments\n- Prohibit the sale of endangered seafood species globally.\n\nFocus Area: SYSCO FRANCE SEAFOOD\n\nCommitments\n- Source 100% of top 15 (by volume) wild-caught seafood species groups from fisheries that are certified (MSC, \u201csustainable fishing\u201d or Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative certified), in good stock condition (scientifically assessed) or in a comprehensive FIP.\n- Source 100% of top five (by volume) aquaculture seafood species groups from farms that are certified (ASC, Global Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) or Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) 3-Star minimum) or in a comprehensive AIP.\nDuring the year, our Portico Pride oyster supplier, Prestige Oyster, became the first private oyster fishery in the Americas to achieve MSC certification for their sustainable fishing practices. To do so, Prestige Oysters went through a rigorous assessment to demonstrate that the fishery is well managed, has minimal environmental impacts and is sustaining resources and livelihoods for future generations. Their sustainable fishing practices are vital to protecting both the ocean habitat where oysters are produced and the livelihoods of the families that rely on that work.\n\nWe are also proud to report that, continuing from FY2021, all of Sysco\u2019s canned tuna suppliers are ISSA-participating companies. Their participation demonstrates a commitment to following best practices for tuna conservation and management. Additionally, in March 2022, Sysco attended Seafood Expo North America where we celebrated the launch of the Peru Mahi Alliance (PMA). The launch represents an important next step in our ongoing work with the WWF to help fisheries and farms take on forward-looking projects aimed at long-term environmental protection and market success.\n\nDuring FY2021, we also took important steps to begin implementing our commitment to advance the traceability and responsible production of Sysco Portico Brand farmed shrimp products and to ensure the protection of vulnerable marine species and habitats around the world. In close partnership with WWF, we began mapping our global farmed shrimp supply chains to the source-farms\u2019 geographic locations while working to address any impacts of deforestation or habitat conversion. This is part of Sysco\u2019s broader commitment to continue improving the sustainability of our products through responsible food production that balances the needs of both people and our planet.\n\nCelebrating the Launch of the Peru Mahi Alliance\n\nIn March 2022, more than 70 people gathered at Seafood Expo North America to celebrate the launch of the PMA. The alliance brings together 15 Peruvian processing companies working to drive progress on the Peru mahi mahi FIP. Peru is the world\u2019s leading producer of mahi mahi (Coryphaena hippurus), sending over 70% of its exports to the U.S. The fishery supports the livelihood of more than 4,200 fishers by generating between $90 million and $100 million in income. Mahi mahi is also a key link in the marine-based food chain, providing sustenance for ocean predators such as dolphins and sharks.\n\nThe FIP aims to improve the fishery\u2019s performance so that it can meet the MSC standard, helping the fishery continue to thrive and support future generations. Sysco has been working to support the FIP since its beginning in 2013. Together with the WWF and other U.S. and local buyers, we encourage the advancement of several of the FIP\u2019s key goals. These include:\n\n- Working with the government to ensure fishing permits are issued to qualified mahi mahi fishers.\n- Improving traceability and transparency.\n- Reducing the bycatch of sea turtles.\n- Collaborating with the governments of Ecuador and Peru to develop a binational management plan for mahi mahi.\n\nThrough the FIP, over 1,500 fishers have been pilot testing a new mobile electronic catch documentation system to improve the collection and transparency of catch data. Additionally, 151 fishers across 64 fishing vessels have received training and toolkits to reduce sea turtle bycatch. Moving forward, Sysco will continue to work with other stakeholders to build on these efforts and address other important FIP goals, such as developing scientific stock assessments and vessel best practices and driving further adoption of traceability and transparency tools across the fishing industry. The launch of PMA was an important next step in this process that will spur future progress through industry collaboration.\n\nLearn more about PMA in this WWF Seafood Sustainability video.\nOur Partnership with WWF\n\n| Year | Event |\n|------|-------|\n| 2009 | Launched partnership with WWF to develop a sustainable seafood sourcing strategy. |\n| 2011 | Established commitment to source top 10 wild-caught Portico Brand species from fisheries that are MSC certified, in MSC assessment or in comprehensive FIPs. |\n| 2016 | Expanded commitment to include top 15 wild-caught species and shelf-stable tuna, and top five farmed species from farms that are ASC certified, in ASC assessment, in an AIP or at a minimum BAP 2-Star certified\u2014effectively doubling the volume of seafood under commitment. |\n| 2019 | Achieved sourcing of approximately 99% of our top 15 wild-caught Sysco Portico Brand seafood products from fisheries that are either MSC certified, in MSC full assessment or engaged in a comprehensive FIP. |\n| 2021 | Recommitted to sourcing top 15 wild-caught and top five farmed species from fisheries that are MSC certified, in MSC full assessment or in a comprehensive FIP, and sourcing at least 85% of this top-15 volume from fisheries that are MSC certified. |\n| 2022 | Launched the PMA, bringing together 13 Peruvian processing companies working to drive progress on the Peru mahi mahi FIP. |\n\nEnsuring Safe Products\n\nAt Sysco, we are dedicated to ensuring that we provide safe, consistent and high-quality products to our customers around the world. Our Food Safety and Quality Assurance (FSQA) team designs, develops, implements and measures compliance with our food safety and quality management system based on Sysco\u2019s values. Our FSQA programs cover our own Sysco Brands, as well as the products we manufacture in our owned facilities and our distribution activities for all food products we handle. We conduct risk assessments for our products, our sites and our suppliers to identify known food safety hazards in our supply chain. Based on those assessments, we develop preventive control programs and auditing processes, which we apply at our distribution centers, our specialty company manufacturing facilities and with our suppliers.\n\nUpholding Compliance Standards\n\nTo receive consideration to produce Sysco Brand products, a location must first pass the FSQA supplier approval process. This comprehensive process uses documentation reviews and physical audits to verify that a supplier\u2019s facility and products related to our FSQA programs meet Sysco\u2019s standards. Following approval, we establish ongoing monitoring and verification procedures in partnership with the supplier. These procedures are designed to ensure that Sysco Brand products are manufactured and packed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications in a food-safe environment.\n\nAll Sysco-owned distribution centers and branded suppliers are required to undergo an annual, independent food safety certification audit. These food safety certification programs\u2014which have been benchmarked by the Global Food Safety Initiative\u2014verify that industry-recognized best practices for food safety are being applied at these sites. Sysco also uses a robust internal audit process for its branded suppliers and owned companies, with more frequent audits for higher-risk suppliers. We routinely update our audit standards to ensure that proper risk management and quality requirements are met. Additionally, commodities such as raw ground beef, ready-to-eat seafood, ready-to-eat produce and ready-to-eat deli meats and poultry must adhere to even more rigorous Sysco FSQA requirements designed to mitigate pathogen risks.\n\nIn FY2022, the Sysco GAP program monitored 478 suppliers and conducted 179,000 GAP audits and 32,000 GMP audits in produce linked to our suppliers.\nHuman Rights\n\nGuided by our values and purpose\u2014connecting the world to share food and care for one another\u2014our vision is to ensure that respect for human rights is embedded in our own operations and global supply chain.\n\nAll people deserve to work in a safe environment with fair treatment and equal opportunities to succeed. At Sysco, we work diligently to uphold human rights in our own supply chain while continually seeking ways to improve them industrywide. We expect our suppliers to uphold the rights of every individual they work with, as outlined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and Sysco\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier COC), which describes the legal, moral and ethical standards we expect from all suppliers throughout our international supply chain. We also follow the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Any act of human trafficking, slavery, forced labor or child labor within Sysco\u2019s supply chain is unacceptable and, if identified, will be addressed in a manner to ensure compliance with Sysco\u2019s established policies and procedures. In FY2022, we continued to work on updating our Supplier COC to ensure it reflects the global nature of our supply chain.\n\nConducting Social Responsibility Audits\n\nAll Sysco Brand-approved suppliers in high-risk Latin American and Asian countries must undergo third-party audits to identify potential risks relating to wages, working hours, discrimination, worker safety, living conditions and child and forced labor. In FY2022, travel restrictions continued to prevent some on-site audits, in which cases we used a virtual audit approach. In total, we conducted 175 audits in 17 countries, including 43 initial audits of new and approved supplier facilities. Among suppliers that have participated in the program for multiple years, 37% demonstrated improvement when compared to their previous audit. Additionally, 13 facilities achieved a perfect score in FY2022, while 36% received a lower rating than the previous year. Through our audits, three locations were suspended from working with Sysco based on their audit results, with one reinstated after implementing corrective action plans and undergoing a second audit to confirm the effectiveness of their efforts.\n\nThrough annual audits and corrective actions, we have minimized human rights risks while improving working conditions in the facilities where our audits took place. Based on audit findings, we work closely with Sysco Brand suppliers and processors to develop and implement improvement plans as part of our program\u2019s focus on continuous improvement.\n\nGOAL\n\nBy 2025, ensure that all first-tier, high-risk suppliers agree to the Supplier Code of Conduct principles\n\nPROGRESS: Completed 175 Sysco Brand facility audits\n\nFY2022 Audit Results\n\n175 audits completed for approved supplier facilities and facilities considered for approval\n37% improved their score at 64 locations\n7% achieved a perfect audit score at 13 locations\nIn the high-paced foodservice industry, operators are challenged to stay ahead of the competition. Sysco\u2019s Cutting Edge Solutions (CES) platform delivers the innovative products and solutions our customers need to operate their businesses with confidence.\n\nEach year, Sysco\u2019s culinary experts and customers evaluate hundreds of new product concepts to find the very best solutions for our CES platform. CES features better-for-you items and on-trend flavors that help our customers spice up their kitchen creations. In the past year, we launched 14 new product concepts nationwide, which showcase our increasing emphasis on nutrition and sustainability\u2014including a 100% recycled fiber cup and two flavorful Sysco Simply Plant Based products.\n\nSysco continually works to improve and diversify the CES platform, in terms of both products and suppliers. Within our most recent application period, 18 suppliers noted they were minority- or women-owned, and 25% of the suppliers represented a plant-based focus. Moving forward, we will continue our engagement with diverse suppliers to increase their participation, while working to identify a core assortment and strategy for plant-based CES items.\n\nCES features better-for-you items and on-trend flavors that help our customers spice up their kitchen creations.\nCES FY2022 Product Solutions and Trends\n\nDelivering Better-for-You Ingredients\nOne of the five pillars of the CES platform focuses on the \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d trends, featuring wholesome, unmanipulated ingredients and plant-based products. In FY2022, we continued the trend with better-for-you options such as sweet potato coconut soup with Thai curry, which performed well in concept testing and is planned for launch in the fall of FY2023, as well as cauliflower tortillas and sprouted grain hamburger buns. The cauliflower tortillas and sprouted grain buns provide a healthier vegan, kosher and plant-based alternative to traditional options. The sweet potato coconut soup is a delicious vegan option offering functional and immune-boosting ingredients, such as sweet potatoes, turmeric, coconut and ginger. We also recently launched two plant-based items that utilize our oat-based protein to create a chili and Bolognese that are lower in fat and cholesterol than similar beef-based options.\n\nEmphasizing Sustainable Solutions\nSustainability plays an increasingly important role in the CES platform, enabling us to launch new plant-based, farm-raised, pesticide- and synthetic fertilizer-free and non-GMO products. During evaluations for our September 2022 launch, the top-performing item was a Norwegian Farm-Raised Cod Loin produced by the world\u2019s first successful commercial supplier of natural and sustainably farm-raised premium Atlantic cod. The Norwegian Farm-raised cod is Global GAP certified and ASC certified.\n\nGoing Global\nSysco Classic Fry Oil Filter Pods are the first-ever product to launch through the Global Innovation process, which introduces Sysco-exclusive items throughout Latin America, Europe and beyond. The pods are produced by FreshFry\u2014a startup co-founded by CEO Jeremiah Chapman\u2014based on an idea he began developing as a student at the University of Louisville. The all-natural pods are sustainable and plant-based and are used to remove impurities from oil that cause it to darken and taste bitter. They extend the usability of frying oil and result in lighter, crispier fried foods\u2014a key advantage given oil scarcity, price volatility and labor shortages in current markets.\n\nFreshFry x Sysco\nFY2022 Highlights\n\n16,000+\ntotal cases sold\n400+\ncases sold per week\n4,400+\ncustomers and counting!\n\nFreshFry successfully redeployed 10 million pounds of waste by the end of 2021.\nTo fulfill Sysco\u2019s purpose and ensure long-term business success, we must protect the planet. Our Recipe for Growth strategy guides our efforts to practice good environmental stewardship as we grow our global operations.\n\nThe U.N. projects that the world\u2019s population will reach 9.8 billion by 2050, with approximately 83 million people added to the population each year.\u00b9 To support that growth, Sysco seeks out novel solutions that can provide nutrition in a more sustainable way. We develop these solutions by working with growers and suppliers, and by engaging in innovative, cross-industry partnerships. Together, we continue to find ways to operate more efficiently\u2014reducing operational waste and supply-chain emissions. In FY2022, we forged ahead on trailblazing new projects, such as electrifying our transportation fleets and shifting to indoor farming. We also invested in renewable energy sources, such as solar, and enhanced our efforts to minimize waste and recycle. These initiatives advance our 2030 emissions reduction goals while raising the bar for our partners and industry peers.\n\n\u00b9\u201cWorld population projected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in 2100.\u201d United Nations, https://www.un.org/en/desa/world-population-projected-reach-98-billion-in-2050-and-112-billion-in-2100#:~:text=COVID%2D19-,World%20population%20projected%20to%20reach%209.8%20billion%20in%202050%2C%20and%2011.2%20billion%20in%202100%20today.\nEnergy and Climate\n\nWe aspire to reduce the carbon footprint of our fleet and operations.\n\nAt Sysco, we believe in responsible growth that enhances our ability to connect and feed the world while minimizing our impact on the planet. We know that the climate crisis is both complex and pressing, demanding quick and decisive foodservice industry action. Our strategy is to lead the industry by example, finding new ways to reduce GHG emissions and bring those solutions to scale. We are guided by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approved climate goals, which we aim to achieve by 2030.\n\nTo lay the foundation for this work, in FY2021, we completed a carbon footprint analysis across 17 business units and eight countries. Among other insights, Sysco\u2019s GHG emissions data tells a complex story about the way the pandemic continues to impact our business. From FY2019 to FY2020, pandemic-related disruptions caused a steep drop in our GHG emissions. In FY2021, our emissions increased, as we began to return to normal business activity. Following this rise, we anticipate that our GHG emissions will decrease yet again, as we yield the carbon-reduction benefits of several new initiatives. For example, in FY2022, we advanced our roadmap for progress and announced breakthrough projects focused on electrifying our outbound fleets. Implementing these projects will accelerate progress toward our Scope 1 and 2 emissions-reduction targets while creating a new model for industry-specific solutions.\n\nMost of our Scope 3 emissions come from food production and transportation between our growers, suppliers and customers. This is a challenging area to tackle, yet it represents our greatest opportunity for supply-chain reductions. With that in mind, we continued to focus on engaging our suppliers. By helping them solidify their own emissions-reduction targets, we can amplify our impact around the world.\n\nGOAL\nBy 2030, reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 27.5% from a CY2019 base year\n\nPROGRESS: Committed to purchasing up to 800 electric trucks and piloted an electric refrigeration trailer. Installed solar panel array system to meet over 15% of energy needs in Britain.\n\nGOAL\nWork with suppliers representing 67% of our Scope 3 emissions1 to set science-based targets by 2026\n\nPROGRESS: Sysco suppliers representing 27% of our CY2019 Scope 3 emissions have committed to or set their own reduction goals\n\n---\n\n1 Focusing on purchased goods and services and upstream transportation suppliers.\nMeasuring Our Carbon Footprint\n\nOur Scope 3 emissions, generated by our supply chain activities, make up nearly 98% of Sysco\u2019s carbon footprint. Within that category, 85% come from purchased goods and services\u2014such as ingredients and raw materials, packaging and food production\u2014in line with emissions generated throughout the food sector. Electricity use and fleet transportation account for most of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which make up about 2% of our carbon footprint. During our base year of CY2019, Sysco emitted 76 million metric tons (mt) of GHG emissions. We chose to measure our emissions reductions against CY2019 because it was the most recent year of routine business without pandemic-related disruptions. In FY2022, we adjusted our Scope 3 emissions baseline following the SBTi validation process.\n\nReducing Scope 1 and 2 Emissions\n\nWe are best positioned to drive reductions in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which are generated by areas under Sysco\u2019s direct control. As we work to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 27.5% by 2030, we are focused on increasing our use of renewable energy, electrifying our tractor fleets and continually implementing new operational efficiencies.\n\nPowering Our Global Operations with 100% Renewable Electricity by 2030\n\nOur Energy Management Program develops energy efficiency measures\u2014and helps to implement them at our facilities\u2014to reduce our energy-based emissions. Additionally, in FY2022, we launched new long-term projects that will further our progress toward Sysco\u2019s renewable energy goal.\n\nSysco has disclosed CDP Climate Change and Water Security responses since 2016. In our Climate Change 2021 response, Sysco achieved a B, which suggests a transition to managing environmental impact.\n\nAt our British business we installed a new solar panel array system that will meet over 15% of the site\u2019s energy needs, saving the equivalent of over 200 tonnes of CO\u2082 each year. This represents the first phase of a long-term renewable energy project in which Sysco will implement wind and solar energy across its U.K. sites. Meanwhile, Sysco Canada announced new solar farm projects at its Edmonton and Calgary sites. The Edmonton solar farm will be fully installed and functional in 2023 and is set to produce enough electricity to accommodate 75% of the site\u2019s annual use. The Calgary facility is set to be operational in 2024 and will boast state-of-the-art features including LED lighting, dedicated space for composting, stormwater reclamation for watering greenspace and high-efficiency refrigeration and HVAC with a heat capture system to reduce heat and energy use.\n\nSysco\u2019s CY2019 Baseline GHG Footprint\n\n| TOTAL | 76 million metric tons CO\u2082e |\n|-------|-----------------------------|\n| SCOPE 1 DIRECT EMISSIONS | 1.7% \u2014 1,300K mt CO\u2082e |\n| Mobile sources: 87% | Refrigerants: 10% | Stationary fuel: 3% |\n| SCOPE 2 PURCHASED ELECTRICITY | 0.4% \u2014 320K mt CO\u2082e |\n| Purchase of electricity, steam, heat or cooling: 100% |\n| SCOPE 3 INDIRECT VALUE CHAIN ACTIVITIES | 97.9% \u2014 75,000K mt CO\u2082e |\n| Purchased goods & services: 85% | Upstream transportation & distribution: 8% | Fuel- & energy-related activities: 3% | Processing of sold products: 3% | All other categories: 1% |\nElectrifying 35% of Our U.S. Tractor Fleet by 2030\n\nSysco\u2019s U.S. tractor fleet is our largest contributor of direct GHG emissions. In FY2022, we committed to purchasing up to 800 battery electric Class 8 tractors by 2026, including Daimler (aka Freightliner) eCascadia vehicles. The first delivery is expected to arrive at Sysco\u2019s Riverside location in FY2023. We are now looking to deploy those vehicles over the next several fiscal years. In the U.S., we are also in the early stages of partnering with companies to develop some of the first battery-powered and refrigerated class 6 vehicles.\n\nAs we roll out this pilot project within the U.S., we will also begin piloting electric vehicles (EVs)\u2014such as a Class 6 EV\u2014abroad. In Europe, the Class 6 EV vehicle already has battery-powered units with refrigerated bodies which we are actively testing with several manufacturers. Adopting these vehicles could have a major impact. We are excited to be delivering to customers in zero-emission, multitemperature vehicles, which can save around 69 tonnes of carbon per HGV each year.\n\nContinually Implementing Efficiencies in Our Routing, Refrigerant and Building Activities\n\nIn our transportation fleets, temperature control is crucial to keep our products fresh and safe. However, we must reduce transportation- and refrigeration-based GHGs to achieve our 2030 Scope 1 and 2 goal. In FY2022, we made progress by announcing an innovative new partnership to supply Sysco with a fleet of reduced-emission commercial trailers equipped with electric trailer refrigeration units. For a portion of each route, the trailers use generated and regenerative energy from wheel-hub electric motors to provide electricity for refrigeration. We began piloting the system at our operating site in Riverside, which is at the forefront of our electrification efforts.\n\nEnsuring Efficient Shipping and Delivery\n\nOur customers rely on Sysco to quickly deliver the products they need. As we do so, we focus on operational efficiencies to make every minute, mile and shipment count. In FY2022, we continued to experience disruptions to the global supply chain; however, we implemented reduced-emissions shipping solutions whenever we could. When lead times allowed, we used intermodal and rail shipping to transport our products, which provide significant environmental and cost advantages for Sysco. As in FY2021, we worked hard to navigate extreme sales variability, using transportation modes that enabled us to maintain our service levels and meet customers\u2019 needs.\n\nLoad-Fill Optimization\n\nLoad-fill optimization helps to reduce Sysco\u2019s carbon footprint by reducing the number of trucks we use to stock our sites. In FY2021, we partnered with our inventory optimization software provider to develop load-fill optimization capability, which builds on work conducted at the regional distribution centers (RDCs) over the last three years. In FY2022, we deployed the technology to many RDC lanes, and while supply-chain challenges have slowed our progress, we continue working to roll out the technology across all sites.\n\nISO STANDARDS ACROSS SYSCO SITES IN THE U.K.\n\n- ISO14001 Environment management\n- ISO50001 Energy management\nInvesting in Inventory Management\nRarely has strong supply-chain management been more crucial than during FY2022. Guided by our customers\u2019 experience, we are investing in streamlined solutions to assortment, stocking, supplier, transportation and customer management. In FY2022, we continued to build our omnichannel inventory management capabilities, which cut across operating disciplines and allow our customers and sales consultants to access and purchase Sysco\u2019s broad assortment of products through a common ordering platform.\n\nReducing Scope 3 Emissions\nMost of our GHG emissions come from our supply chain activities, so our greatest opportunity to make a positive impact is by helping suppliers establish their own climate strategies. Our supplier base is large and varied, so we have segmented our suppliers to identify those making the largest emissions contributions. Along the way, we are conducting interviews and surveys to further inform our engagement strategy and accelerate progress.\n\nAs of FY2022, Sysco suppliers representing 27% of our CY2019 Scope 3 emissions have committed to or set targets aligned with SBTi criteria.\n\nInvesting in Carbon Offsets with Menigo\nOur Swedish company, Menigo, is a trailblazer in implementing climate-smart technologies and best practices. They power their facilities with 100% renewable energy and use approximately 80% renewable fuel in total transport, including third parties. In FY2022, they formed an agreement with their three largest logistical partners to exclusively transport Menigo products using hydrotreated vegetable oil-based renewable diesel fuel. They also launched plans to build a modern and sustainable warehouse outside of Gothenburg that will reduce energy usage and internal transports when it is completed in FY2024.\n\nOne of Menigo\u2019s boldest projects is to offset their emissions. They do so based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2014a first for the foodservice distribution industry in Sweden. In FY2022, they offset 5,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. They plan to double the amount to 10,000 tonnes of carbon emissions in FY2023 to further support projects that store carbon dioxide, contribute to forest conservation and improve the health and living conditions of the local population. Local nonprofits run the projects, which are small-scale and Plan Vivo or fair-trade certified. Examples include protecting mangrove forests in Kenya and increasing access to efficient stoves for households in Raichur, India.\n\nFY2022 Shipping and Delivery Highlights\n\n- Experienced ~18% year-over-year increase on rail boxcars\n- In the U.S., moved 1,580 rail boxcars and shipped approximately 10,426 intermodal loads to avoid using 3.5 million gallons of fuel and 78 million pounds of CO\u2082\n- In Canada, shipped ~1,631 intermodal loads to avoid the use of nearly half a million gallons of fuel and 6 million pounds of CO\u2082\nOur vision is to leverage Sysco\u2019s size, scale and knowledge to further integrate environmental sustainability within Sysco\u2019s global agricultural supply chain.\n\nSysco remains the only foodservice distribution company with a program dedicated to sustainable agriculture. That means we are leaders in developing industry standards and best practices that encourage growers to operate in a more environmentally responsible way. A cornerstone of this work is our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, which we launched in 2004. The program encourages the responsible use of pesticide and nutrient inputs, as well as waste reduction and conservation of energy and water. During the 2021 growing season, growers who applied IPM principles reportedly avoided using almost 10 million pounds of pesticides. By the end of FY2022, the program included 21,195 growers across 130 processing locations. During the year, we also expanded our Sustainability Standard, which promotes industry best practices for fresh crops.\n\nEngaging Growers in Sysco\u2019s Sustainability Standard\n\nIn FY2022, Sysco launched our Sustainability Standard, which we piloted in FY2021. Modeled after IPM, the standard recognizes farming and processing operations based on their sustainable performance and encourages continuous improvement. We are using the standard to expand our Sustainable Agriculture program beyond canned and frozen foods to include more fresh crops. By the end of the year, we surpassed our 2025 goal to include five fresh crops in the program\u2014achieving 10 crops in categories such as tomatoes, mushrooms and leafy greens.\n\nMoving forward, we will continue to engage growers through audits and education\u2014including a grower summit in August\u2014to accelerate the adoption rate. Not only does this enhance growers\u2019 ability to grow their business with Sysco, but as other industry leaders adopt the standards, its impact is becoming increasingly widespread.\n\nGOAL\n\nBy 2025, expand Sysco\u2019s Sustainable Agriculture program to include five fresh crops\n\nPROGRESS: Achieved and doubled to include 10 fresh crops\n\n2021 Growing Season Highlights\n\n- 450M+ gallons of water conserved\n- 9.9M+ pounds of pesticides avoided\n- 2.9B+ pounds of vegetative waste reused\n- 1M+ field acres covered by IPM\n- 10 fresh crops covered by our Sustainability Standard\n- 200M+ pounds of local produce distributed by FreshPoint from 500+ local farmers\nLeading the Way on Indoor Agriculture\n\nOne promising solution to support our growing population is the adoption of indoor agriculture, which, according to the USDA, reduces distribution-based emissions and drastically reduces water consumption and runoff.1 Understanding the benefits of indoor agriculture, Sysco spent the past two years vetting more than 30 indoor farms. Through that process, we identified a key indoor growing partner to supply an increasing number of Sysco sites.\n\nWe began our partnership in the fall of 2021 through a pilot program with FreshPoint Nashville. Since launching the pilot, our partner now supplies almost 100% of the site\u2019s stocked 4/3-pound mesclun mix. The mix uses over 95% less water and 90% less space than field-grown leafy greens. By sourcing it closer to our warehouse, we also improve the product\u2019s freshness and shelf life\u2014which minimizes food waste for our customers\u2014and reduce Sysco\u2019s freight-based emissions. In FY2022, we continued to expand our crop commitments with the grower, including by building a new farm site in South Florida. The site will drive further reductions in our freight costs and help reduce our carbon footprint. Beyond the South Florida site, we are considering additional indoor farming opportunities on the East Coast, as well as with Sysco Bahamas Foodservice and Sysco U.K.\n\nReducing Water in Our Value Chain\n\nMost of our operational water consumption is used for product refrigeration, washing vehicles and landscaping our sites. In these areas, we continue to identify and implement water-saving opportunities, such as using cooling processes to recycle the water we use for condensers at five U.S. locations. Because significant water consumption isn\u2019t part of our direct operations, we focus on reducing the water used by our suppliers.\n\nIndoor Farming Benefits\n\n- **Predictable Growing Conditions**: Climate-controlled for optimal conditions year-round\n- **Predictable Harvest**: Meets product specs based on local demand, not weather conditions\n- **Smaller Physical Footprint**: 90%+ reductions in land use vs. traditional farming\n- **Improved Water Conservation**: 95%+ less water-intensive vs. traditional farming\n- **Reduced Waste**: 63% reduction in food waste vs. traditional farming\n\n1 \u201cVertical Farming for the Future\u201d USDA, Oct. 2021, [https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2018/08/14/vertical-farming-future](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2018/08/14/vertical-farming-future)\nWaste Reduction\n\nOur vision is to minimize waste in Sysco\u2019s direct operations.\n\nFrom our products to packaging, we are invested in sustainable solutions to reduce Sysco\u2019s operational waste. One of the best ways to reduce waste is through recycling, and in recent years, we have expanded our recycling capabilities to include food and organic waste. In FY2022, we selected Northstar Recycling Company as our new recycling partner and onboarded them across approximately 180 sites. Partnering with Northstar enabled us to streamline our recycling and waste management practices and will result in reduced disposal volumes and costs. Additionally, it enabled us to enhance our data tracking practices and update our waste-diversion rate.\n\nAlso in FY2022, we deepened our focus on both food waste and organics. Across our operations, we are emphasizing solutions such as diverting waste to produce animal feed, composting and leveraging meal donations to serve those in need. These efforts helped us make progress toward our goal to divert 90% of operations and food waste from landfills by 2025. They also support our goal to deliver $500 million of global good by 2025, including through the value of donated meals.\n\nCelebrating Stop Food Waste Day\n\nLaunched in 2017 by our customer Compass Group, Stop Food Waste Day is an international day of action to educate and ignite change in the fight against food waste. In April 2022, Sysco marked the occasion by joining Compass Group for their Stop Food Waste Day Webinar, during which chefs from Sysco and other organizations shared insights on repurposing and upcycling commonly wasted foods at home. Sysco\u2019s leadership also discussed efforts to reduce food waste in our own operations, which support our overarching goal of reducing GHG emissions.\n\nIn 2022, Sysco joined the USDA and Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s list of U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions. The list identifies organizations that have made a public commitment to reduce food loss and waste by 50% in their U.S. operations by 2030.\n\nGOAL\nBy 2025, divert 90% of waste, including food, from landfills\n\nPROGRESS: Diverted 67% of waste\nMinimizing Packaging Waste with M&J Seafood\u2019s Sustainable Solution\n\nOur U.K. brand, M&J Seafood, is committed to innovating sustainable packaging solutions that maximize shelf life, maintain quality and reduce waste from food and packaging materials. Recently, the company recognized that the typical fishmonger wax box and ice storage system led to excess waste and downstream disposal problems. Their proposed solution won the 2022 Footprint Innovations in Packaging Award.\n\nThe project began with market research, through which M&J Seafood identified two potential solutions: a Promens tray that could be implemented for most products right away and thermoformed packaging that could provide further benefits during the next step of the project\u2019s evolution. The tray reduces the wax box\u2019s packaging materials to two forms of easily recyclable plastic, and the thermoformed packaging improves on those benefits by using up to 40% less plastic and is designed to enable portion controlling and a longer shelf life. The solutions would allow Sysco to take expertly filleted fish from their fishmongers and place them in sustainable packaging.\nSysco\u2019s leaders are highly experienced at driving transformative change and delivering results. They are guided by our mission, purpose and values, which they embed in the business units they serve. Our strong corporate governance provides a framework for our leaders to engage Sysco\u2019s stakeholders and fuel our company\u2019s success. It is based on a simple set of principles: Act ethically. Act responsibly. Do the right thing.\n\nAs our business grows, we are dedicated to maintaining quality relationships that are rooted in mutual trust. That requires transparent communication with our shareholders, suppliers and customers, as well as the communities where we live and work. We earn that trust by ensuring strong compliance with both the letter and spirit of the law. We deepen it by going above and beyond what is required of us to lead the foodservice distribution industry in making a positive impact around the globe.\nOur Board of Directors oversees Sysco\u2019s business and risk management strategy and strives to ensure we are integrating sustainability issues into our approach.\n\nOur director tenure policy, established July 2016, provides that no individual who, as of the date of the election to which any nomination relates will have served as a nonemployee director for 15 years, will be eligible to be nominated for election or re-election to the Board. Additionally, in FY2021, we transitioned to an independent, nonexecutive Chair structure. Our Board Committees include an Audit Committee, a Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (the Governance Committee), a Sustainability Committee (formerly the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee), a Technology Committee and an Executive Committee.\n\nEvery year, the Board conducts a self-evaluation to determine whether the Board and its committees are functioning effectively. The Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Governance Committee led a discussion of the Board\u2019s performance in executive session.\n\nIn addition, each Board committee conducts a self-evaluation of its performance, focused on the committee\u2019s key responsibilities. As part of the evaluation process, each director completes a committee self-evaluation questionnaire developed by the Governance Committee. The committees all reviewed feedback from their self-evaluations, as did the full Board. Key learnings from the Board and committee self-evaluations play an important role in informing the Board\u2019s approach to refreshment and succession planning.\n\n360-Degree Performance Reviews\nFor the past five years, the Board\u2019s self-evaluation process has been enhanced to include periodic \u201c360 degree\u201d individual director performance reviews, which involve a confidential evaluation of the performance of directors selected by the Governance Committee by each of the other directors, key members of senior management and representatives of certain independent, third-party firms that routinely interact with the directors assessed. An independent, third-party corporate governance firm compiles and communicates the feedback from these reviews to the directors assessed.\n\nDiverse Board Recruitment\nAs a matter of practice, our Board looks for diversity in nominees, including reviewing enhanced perspective and experience through diversity in race, gender, ethnicity, cultural background, age, geographic origin, education and professional and life experiences. Three of our Board nominees are women\u2014one of whom is African American\u2014while one of our Board nominees is from outside the U.S.\n\nSustainability Committee\nSysco\u2019s Board-level Sustainability Committee meets three times a year, with each meeting focused on one of the company\u2019s three pillars: People, Products and Planet. The Sustainability Committee reviews and acts in an advisory capacity to the Board and management with respect to policies and strategies that affect Sysco\u2019s role as a socially responsible organization. They review, evaluate and provide input on the development and implementation of Sysco\u2019s sustainability strategy and on the implementation of and progress toward Sysco\u2019s 2025 sustainability goals. The Sustainability Committee also reviews areas such as philanthropic giving, agricultural programs and warehouse and transportation initiatives, which are designed to reduce the company\u2019s environmental impact while addressing the challenges posed by climate change.\n\nLearn more about our Board and its practices in our FY2022 Proxy Statement.\nWe take a proactive approach toward managing Sysco\u2019s risk and minimizing our risk exposure.\n\nSysco\u2019s Executive Leadership Team (ELT) is responsible for identifying, managing and mitigating enterprise risks. Our ELT regularly reports to Sysco\u2019s Board and Audit Committee with respect to enterprise risk management (ERM). The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing Sysco\u2019s ERM process, which we have enhanced in recent years. The process begins with frequent discussion of risk issues by the ELT, followed by a deep-dive risk assessment approach. Based on those discussions, an ERM plan is created to lower Sysco\u2019s exposure to risk. The plan includes monitoring its implementation by Sysco managers and tracking all risk-related information. These efforts take place within a governance and reporting cadence, and the Board\u2019s committees help oversee the ERM process within the respective areas of the committees\u2019 delegated oversight authority.\n\nGlobal Code of Conduct\n\nAt Sysco, we believe in delivering exceptional service with integrity. Our Global Code of Conduct (the Code) outlines our standards and expectations, in line with our company\u2019s Purpose and values. We require all directors, officers and associates\u2014including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller\u2014to understand and abide by this Code.\n\nPriority topics addressed by the Code include:\n\n- Food safety\n- Fraud\n- Anti-corruption and anti-bribery\n- Export and import laws and trade sanctions\n- Human rights\n- Diversity and inclusion\n- Workplace safety\n- Antitrust\n- Competition and fair dealing\n- Confidential information\n- Professional conduct\u2014including customer relationships, equal opportunity, payment of gratuities and receipt of payments or gifts\n- Political contributions\n- Conflicts of interest\n- Insider trading\n- Financial disclosure\n- Intellectual property\n\nThe Governance Committee periodically reviews the Code and requires every Sysco associate to strictly adhere to all laws and regulations applicable to our business. We also require associates to report any violations or suspected violations of the Code. Learn more in our FY2022 Proxy Statement.\n\nOur Values\n\nRooted In Integrity\nDrive Together\nCommitted To Inclusion\nDefine Excellence\nGrow Responsibly\n\nAnnual Code of Business Conduct (COBC) Training\n\nWe administer COBC training to educate associates on important COBC topics and behaviors. The training is an enterprise-wide requirement, and our goal is to ensure that the content is relevant and engaging for a broad range of learning styles. By ensuring that all associates are aware of our COBC expectations, we minimize our company\u2019s financial and reputational risks. Topics covered in the training include:\n\n- Preventing harassment\n- Anti-bribery\n- Accounting and financial integrity\n- Antitrust\n- Avoiding conflicts of interest\n- Reporting misconduct\nAs a global foodservice distribution leader, we rely on technology in nearly everything we do. We focus on ensuring a technology environment that is responsible, compliant and secure.\n\nTechnology plays a substantial role in all aspects of Sysco\u2019s operations. In line with our strategic objectives, we continue to implement leading-edge business technology initiatives. We know that our customers trust us to be good stewards of their data. We take that responsibility seriously, and our commitment to cybersecurity is unwavering. Sysco\u2019s digital team guides our approach to data privacy and cybersecurity management and risk mitigation. Our chief information and digital officer and chief information security officer oversee this approach, with ultimate oversight from our Board. Two of our Board directors are highly experienced in cybersecurity matters with experience in information technology systems and related opportunities and risks. We leverage their expertise to protect our enterprise and embrace the technologies needed to facilitate responsible growth.\nGovernment Relations\n\nOur mission to deliver success for our customers relies on sound public policy. We envision a collaborative and inclusive approach to policy-related decision making.\n\nWe work alongside our industry, supplier and customer stakeholders to advocate for our priorities. We do so at the local, state, federal and international levels. This engagement is critical to ensure that\u2014at all levels of government\u2014the interests of our customers, associates and shareholders are properly represented. Sysco\u2019s public policy priorities and activities are reviewed regularly with senior management and with the Board of Directors.\n\nLobbying Activities\nSysco promotes and protects our company\u2019s interests by directly lobbying government officials on a wide array of issues. Common issues include agriculture, animal welfare, energy and the environment, food safety, healthcare, immigration, nutrition, labor, occupational safety and licensing, product labeling, taxes, trade, transportation and workers\u2019 compensation.\n\nSysco complies with all U.S. federal and state lobbying laws, which require reporting on lobbying activity. For FY2022, Sysco reported U.S. federal lobbying expenditures of $200,000 in reports filed with the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Secretary of the U.S. Senate. In jurisdictions outside of the U.S., Sysco complies with all applicable lobbying legislation.\n\nTrade Association Engagement\nSysco works with a diverse array of industries and organizations that have similar business objectives and goals. To help achieve legislative and regulatory priorities on issues important to our overall business strategies, we maintain memberships in various industry trade associations. We don\u2019t necessarily agree with every position these organizations take; however, we have found that providing our input is a constructive way to influence policy outcomes. That\u2019s true whether we are for or against a particular position. A list of our memberships and dues is available here.\n\nPolitical Contributions\nWe engage in the political process by providing financial support for select candidates and issue advocacy campaigns that support Sysco\u2019s business objectives. The Sysco Corporation Public Policy Committee determines the level of our contributions and involvement. The committee is a multifunctional group consisting of members from Sysco\u2019s executive leadership, Government Relations, Legal, Investor Relations, Communications and other relevant functional leaders.\n\nThe Sysco Corporation Good Government Committee, Inc. (Sysco PAC) was established to allow eligible associates to become engaged in the political process. Sysco PAC is governed by a separate board of directors comprised of PAC members from across our company. These members include representatives from executive and functional leadership, including support center and field leadership. Sysco PAC makes contributions to U.S. federal, state and local candidates in accordance with election laws and regulations. Membership in Sysco PAC is strictly voluntary and can be discontinued at any time.\n\nSysco PAC is regulated by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and files reports, as required, with the FEC and relevant state election commissions. Reports filed with the FEC are publicly available on the FEC website.\n\nVisit our website for more information on Sysco\u2019s government relations and public policy engagement.\nAppendix\n\nIn this section:\n- Additional Sustainability Resources\n- Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement\n- Assurance Statements\nAdditional Sustainability Resources\n\nPlease see below for helpful links to additional information about our sustainability efforts and related topics, including how we govern, and disclosures such as our CDP reports.\n\nAbout Sysco and Our Board\n- Business Overview\u2014page 3, 2022 Annual Report\n- Reporting Segments\u2014page 3, 2022 Annual Report\n- Customers and Products\u2014page 4, 2022 Annual Report\n- Human Capital Resources\u2014page 5, 2022 Annual Report\n- Board Composition and Accountability\u2014page 13, 2022 Proxy\n- Board Committees\u2014page 15, 2022 Proxy\n- Risk Oversight\u2014page 19, 2022 Proxy\n- Code of Conduct\u2014page 37, 2022 Proxy\n- Reporting a Concern or Violation\u2014page 37, 2022 Proxy\n- Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u2014page 44, 2022 Proxy\n\nOther Resources\n- Associate Code of Conduct\n- Supplier Code of Conduct\n- Board-Level CSR Committee\n- CDP Climate Change CY2021\n- CDP Water CY2021\n- Palm Oil ACOP CY2021\n- Forests Report May 2021\n- Sysco Seafood Sustainability Report\nSysco\u2019s sustainability strategy is based on our 2018 materiality assessment, which identified the ESG topics that our stakeholders deemed to be most important and/or influential on their decisions. The company completed a materiality refresh in FY2022 to help ensure the matrix was fit for purpose and to better reflect the global enterprise.\n\nOur Primary Stakeholders\n\nAssociates\nOur 71,000 global associates bring Sysco\u2019s strategic priorities to life and enable our company\u2019s growth. We know that our associates and future talent care deeply about how we engage with communities, and our sustainability strategy has become a valuable tool in our recruiting and retention efforts. We engage with associates via Sysco Speaks (our companywide engagement survey), \u201cThe Dish\u201d (our intranet site), Thrive (our new online learning platform), Sysco To-Go (internal app of news and resources for Sysco associates), social media and other channels. In FY2022, we continued to expand our engagement, communication and development efforts to support all our global associates.\n\nCustomers\nAt Sysco, we put customers first. Their needs and expectations are foundational components of our sustainability priorities. We engage with customers through several channels\u2014including sales consultant interactions, customer service surveys, online communications and strategic reviews\u2014while maintaining an ongoing dialogue and partnership to help customers deliver quality and safe food options to their patrons.\n\nInvestors\nEarning the confidence and support of Sysco shareholders is essential to our continued success. We know that a growing segment of our investor base is interested in how we address social and environmental issues. We engage them in various ways, including through financial reports, annual shareholder meetings, investor conference presentations, CDP and other ratings disclosures and meetings with interested investors.\n\nRegulators\nComplying with regulatory requirements and interacting with appropriate regulatory authorities are essential activities for our business. We regularly engage with entities such as the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as corresponding agencies in other jurisdictions where we operate.\n\nNongovernmental Organizations (NGOs)\nWe respect the role that NGOs play in moving the needle on change, and we partner with many, including the World Wildlife Fund, the Global Food Safety Initiative and the Center for Food Integrity. These partnerships help us better understand various environmental and social challenges, as well as the ways Sysco can contribute to solutions.\n\nSuppliers\nTo deliver for our customers and advance our sustainability agency, it is critical that we collaborate closely with Sysco suppliers. We engage with suppliers through surveys and regular business reviews, as well as in a Joint Business Planning process with several strategic suppliers. We also partner with suppliers to advance our sustainability priorities, including through the IPM program, in which Sysco works with participating growers to implement sustainable agriculture practices.\n\nPeers\nEngaging with industry participants helps us advance best practices and influence regulatory and legislative improvements. For instance, an important driver in our work is Sysco\u2019s Animal Welfare Council, which brings together academic and industry professionals skilled in animal welfare to provide Sysco\u2019s leaders with guidance on the design, development and implementation of animal welfare programs. Council members also offer perspectives on emerging issues and best practices, and the Council meets annually with the Sysco Quality Assurance and Sustainability teams to discuss animal welfare issues, including supplier performance. Another example is our work with the British Frozen Food Federation (BFFF). Through BFFF, our U.K. team and European peers are working with WRAP (Waste & Resources Action Programme) to reduce waste, develop sustainable products and use resources in an efficient way.\n\n1 ESG materiality, as used in this report, and our ESG materiality assessment process, is different than when used in the context of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure obligations. Issues deemed material for purposes of this report and for purposes of determining our ESG strategy may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes, nor does inclusion of information in this report indicate that the topic or information is material to Sysco\u2019s business or operating results.\nBeing transparent about our sustainability performance is a critical component in taking accountability and achieving our goals. Therefore, this year we expanded our third-party assurance beyond environmental verification. We will continue to pursue additional assessment/verification of key data points going forward.\n\n**LRQA Assurance Statement**\n\nWe engaged LRQA to provide a limited level of assurance for the following data pertaining to the calendar year 2021:\n\n- Direct (Scope 1) and Energy Indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions\n- Scope 3 GHG emissions (verified by LRQA only include business travel\u2014hotel stays, car rentals and air travel)\n- Water withdrawn, discharged and consumed\n\nLRQA\u2019s Independent Assurance Statement is available [here](#).\n\n**EY Assurance Statement**\n\nWe engaged EY to perform limited assurance over various FY2022 ESG metrics, including:\n\n- Charitable giving\u2014Meal donations\n- Charitable giving\u2014Monetary donations\n- Sustainable/Responsible Sourcing\u2014Percentage of coffee pounds sold\n- Sustainable/Responsible Sourcing\u2014Percentage of paper towel, paper napkin, bath and facial tissue case volume sold\n\nMore information is available [here](#).\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-04-27", "created": "2025-04-27", "metadata": {"Source-File": "climate_reports/tp_reports/sysco_2022.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.1.59", "pdf-total-pages": 55, "total-input-tokens": 110298, "total-output-tokens": 26512, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1098, 2], [1098, 1965, 3], [1965, 3013, 4], [3013, 3677, 5], [3677, 5743, 6], [5743, 10731, 7], [10731, 12925, 8], [12925, 14600, 9], [14600, 17178, 10], [17178, 18265, 11], [18265, 20339, 12], [20339, 22155, 13], [22155, 24328, 14], [24328, 26512, 15], [26512, 28560, 16], [28560, 30834, 17], [30834, 32042, 18], [32042, 32928, 19], [32928, 35407, 20], [35407, 37597, 21], [37597, 40836, 22], [40836, 42687, 23], [42687, 45909, 24], [45909, 47040, 25], [47040, 49139, 26], [49139, 51393, 27], [51393, 52741, 28], [52741, 56601, 29], [56601, 57742, 30], [57742, 61691, 31], [61691, 65606, 32], [65606, 69262, 33], [69262, 72325, 34], [72325, 73634, 35], [73634, 76040, 36], [76040, 77485, 37], [77485, 79992, 38], [79992, 83223, 39], [83223, 86433, 40], [86433, 89316, 41], [89316, 91719, 42], [91719, 94181, 43], [94181, 96335, 44], [96335, 97478, 45], [97478, 98401, 46], [98401, 101994, 47], [101994, 104905, 48], [104905, 105972, 49], [105972, 109397, 50], [109397, 109526, 51], [109526, 110491, 52], [110491, 115140, 53], [115140, 116307, 54], [116307, 116307, 55]]}}
